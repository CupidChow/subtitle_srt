1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,840
   

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,320
   

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,620
   

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,030
   

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,220
   

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:32,680


7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,050
   

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,330
   

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,970
 Would you save me? 

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,070
 Ju Eun Ho, do you know that you're dirty? 
   

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,880
 Would you save me? 

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,360
How many days did you leave these dishes piled?

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,740
Answer me! If I were drowning, would you save me?

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,100
Find your own way out.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,930
Dude.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,100
Are you crazy?

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,670
- Does it hurt? 
 - Did you just bite me?

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,820
- You're really insane. 
 - I bit you!

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,330
I bit you like you were a chicken leg! 
    

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,800
I'll get you once I'm done with the dishes.

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,360
 With extreme heat, this will be the hottest day of the year... 
   

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,500
 - Hyun Oh. 
 - What? 

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,930
 With the heat wave warnings around the country, as of 10 a.m. this morning— 

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,250
 Is it I or the nine o'clock news? 

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,410
 You seem crazy. 

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,420
 Me or the nine o'clock news? Answer me. 

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,810
 Excuse me. 

28
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,110
 Hurry up and answer me! 

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,860
 Listen. I won't tell you twice! 

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,120
 The nine o'clock news for sure. 

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,260
 Recorded 150 mm (6 inches) of rain in Jeju... 

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,870
 Oh, hey! 

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,360
 You seem like a crazy person. 

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,180
 Me or the nine o'clock news? 

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,210
 Please! Seriously! 
   

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,940
   

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,200
- Hyun Oh. 
 - What?

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,820
Me or the vacuum cleaner?

39
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,050
Ask a real question.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,410
It was a question with a question mark at the end.

41
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,640
Answer me. Is it I or the vacuum?

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,850
What is wrong with you?

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,550
Me or the vacuum?

44
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,550
- Answer me now! 
 - You really kicked me!

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,900
 Answer me! Is it I or the vacuum? 
   

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,410
 The issue of granting privileges in the legal field has resurfaced. 
   

47
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,400
 Recently, major law firms have been 
   

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,700
- Hyun Oh. 
  - actively recruiting former judges and prosecutors. 

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
What?

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,840
- Is it I or the nine o'clock news? 
  - Concerns about their influence and access to information 

51
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,300
- You, of course. 
  - used in the judicial system have been raised. 

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,640
 - The former position holder can  
 - I like you better than the vacuum

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,100
- and the news. 
  - use his influence to gain 

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,630
- Are you satisfied? 
  - information advantageous to his case. 

55
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,520
No.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,890
I want more.

57
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,720
Well, what else?

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,900
I like you better than doing the dishes.

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,170
I like you better than the current issues, and I like you better than a news scoop.

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,790
Then...

61
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,030
can you sit right there?

62
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,470
Why are you so nice suddenly?

63
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,420
Because...

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,190
I love you.

65
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,520
Me, too.

66
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,610
   

67
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,630
 I love you and support you. 

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,540
   

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
No.

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,880
Why not?

71
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,810
Seriously, why not?

72
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,320
Team Leader, I do the early morning radio.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,900
I get to work at 5 a.m. and work like a dog until 2 p.m.

74
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,600
How can I do the 4 p.m. live on top of that?

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,520
Make someone on the afternoon team do it.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,350
Exactly.

77
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,650
You can leave the morning team and join the afternoon team.

78
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,250
Then I would have to quit my radio program, and I don't want to.

79
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,840
Darn it. Why not?

80
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,130
Team Leader, my program is number one in the ratings.

81
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,740
Not second, but first.

82
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,020
That didn't happen overnight.

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,380
I worked hard for three years to get to number one.

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,470
Who would easily give up what they have worked so hard for?

85
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,800
"A radio show is a long-term commitment."

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,130
It should continue for 10-20 years.

87
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,170
"Loyalty with your listeners is built over time."

88
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,720
Did I first say that? Did he say it?

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,870
Did he say it?

90
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,380
No, you said it, Team Leader.

91
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,500
How about you change your mind?

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,190
Why do I need to take on the 4 p.m. live?

93
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,220
Several announcers are right here.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,100
We need a woman to announce,

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,270
a woman.

96
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,790
Eun Ho, the host is Sunbae Han Seok Jin.

97
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,040
Think about it.

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,980
Should a woman or a man stand beside him?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,230
A man.

100
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,190
- What? 
 - Why can't a man do it?

101
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,620
We have so many men here.

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,670
Team Leader, "Boy Love" is all the rage these days.

103
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,740
- What love? 
 - Team Leader, if two men stand next to each other,

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,190
you'll defy outdated gender roles and become a global pioneer.

105
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,610
- You must be crazy. 
 - Team Leader, don't do this to me.

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,200
Just pick one of them. Keep pace with trends.

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,220
You told me that I'm awful,

108
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,190
that even after 14 years, I'm not a national announcer whom people recognize,

109
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,160
and if I'm not even a deputy general manager at the company, I'm doomed, totally doomed.

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,270
And even if I freelanced, I wouldn't earn a won.

111
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,830
Did I say that?

112
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,290
Did he say that? Did he?

113
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,400
Team Leader, you said that!

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,300
So don't do this to me—

115
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,640
I'll do it, Team Leader.

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,080
What?

117
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,280
The 4 p.m. live "Issue-In." I'll do it, Team Leader.

118
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,830
Instead of that.

119
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,700
What? "That"?

120
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,820
Hey. What did you just call me? "That"?

121
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,520
No, no.

122
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,660
No, Hyun Oh.

123
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,070
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,070
You know the 4 p.m. live.

125
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,910
It might get ratings, but the announcer has to be off-site.

126
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,000
It's nice to be off-site and deliver information dynamically.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,540
You get recognition and become friendly with the viewers. It's good.

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,440
You can catch all kinds of fish: shark minnow, mandarin fish and mackerels.

129
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,350
It's good. Good!

130
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,120
But you're going to anchor the news

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,850
so you can't go there.

132
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,510
Not in ten years, not in five, but very soon.

133
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,840
As soon as possible, you'll be doing the news. So no.

134
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,700
What are you saying?

135
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,470
So I'm supposed to do all the fishing and make him look good?

136
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,900
Isn't this gender discrimination?

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,740
No. This isn't gender discrimination.

138
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,120
This is human discrimination!

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,270
More specifically, I'm discriminating between you and him.

140
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,360
Hyun Oh, you can't go there. Got it?

141
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,960
You just can't convince...

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,630
that.

143
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,080
"That" again...

144
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,840
Hey!

145
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,230
Still no, Hyun Oh.

146
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll handle her.

147
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,220
Don't worry about that.

148
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,840
You can't worry about that right now.

149
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
Got it, Hyun Oh?

150
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,070
No, Team Leader.

151
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll do the 4 p.m. live.

152
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,790
- Well then. 
 - No.

153
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,660
No, Hyun Oh. Hyun Oh?

154
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,550
Jung Hyun Oh! Hyun Oh?

155
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,960
Hey, you!

156
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,820
What are you going to do?

157
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,240
Sunbae, he must be out of his mind.

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,530
- He called me "that." 
 - Hey!

159
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,420
You must take care of this.

160
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,690
He can't do this! You know that!

161
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,750
He absolutely cannot!

162
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,730
You take responsibility and talk him out of it.

163
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,530
If you can't, you'll surely be on the 4 p.m. live. Got it?

164
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,870
- Sunbae, he said he'd do it. Just let him— 
 - Hey!

165
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,430
I wouldn't say this in front of those guys, but do you know how hard this was for me to get?

166
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,340
Those producers don't even know you!

167
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,410
They wanted Jung Hyun Oh!

168
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,030
Exactly. The producers want him, and he wants to do it.

169
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,880
I pushed and pushed to recommend you!

170
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,100
I pushed and pushed like plugging you into an outlet!

171
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,670
Why? So you could do something real for once!

172
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,810
You should be thanking me and accepting it!

173
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,370
But what?

174
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,910
"Boy Love"?

175
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,890
Got it, Team Leader.

176
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,270
What's up?

177
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,770
What?

178
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,580
You know, I thought you despised me.

179
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,480
You're not completely wrong.

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,610
But even those feelings stem from affection.

181
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,650
I was wrong.

182
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,390
Now that I think about it,

183
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,180
you still love me.

184
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,460
What are you talking about?

185
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,970
Were you daytime drinking?

186
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,480
The 4 p.m. live show,

187
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,370
you volunteered in my place so I wouldn't have to do it.

188
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,250
You were so stubborn, making everybody uncomfortable.

189
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,110
Has it occurred to you I sacrificed for the team?

190
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,840
Not at all. I think you did it for me and only me.

191
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,860
Don't be delusional.

192
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,410
Excuse me. I wish I were being delusional, too.

193
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,620
But how could it be?

194
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Aloof people could separate work from personal life,

195
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,800
but I'm a hot-blooded 37-year-old spinster.

196
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,720
If you take a hit for the team to prevent others from hating me,

197
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,200
since I'm a pain in the neck,

198
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,700
there are only limited reasons I can imagine.

199
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,350
"Omo, maybe he loves me."

200
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,800
"Oh my, maybe he's still not over me."

201
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,870
Of course, I already have my reply.

202
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,150
No, thanks. Bye. You keep your love and regrets to yourself.

203
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,400
I would rather bear everyone's hate, you know.

204
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,250
Are you done?

205
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,130
No. You know, don't you?

206
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,380
That affection you speak of? It's all fluff. It's actually crap.

207
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,660
So you can keep the crap.

208
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,900
I'll talk to Team Leader and have someone else—

209
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm curious about something.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,070
I'd rather you didn't ask, but go ahead.

211
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,870
Do you really like the morning team that much?

212
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,940
Yes, I do. I told you.

213
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,620
I need to stay on the morning team if I want to keep my beloved radio program.

214
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,950
How about this? I'll move the 4 p.m. live to a morning slot.

215
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,710
- What? 
 - The morning works. Right?

216
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,770
Then you can stay on the morning team.

217
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,530
What?

218
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,490
Moving programs isn't like moving a vase between tables.

219
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, no matter how beloved you are in this industry,

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,970
even if you're the next nine o'clock news anchor, you can't do that.

221
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,760
Do you think you're some all-powerful video game cheat character?

222
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,200
I've always thought this, but you're so full of yourself. Are you aware?

223
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,280
No, I think I'm actually all-powerful.

224
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,170
I think I can get it done.

225
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,800
The heck you can.

226
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,350
Hey, do you own our company? Do you?

227
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,130
Not even the CEO of PPS can—

228
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,440
Hello.

229
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,650
Starting today, "Issue-In" will be brought to you a little earlier.

230
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm Announcer Jung Hyun Oh, one of the new hosts.

231
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,840
We will cover the issues on your morning commute.

232
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,170
 I'm Announcer Ju Eun Ho. 

233
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,380
My goodness.

234
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,660
Sunbae.

235
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,070
Wh-Wh-What?

236
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,850
I experienced something so mysterious.

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,490
Jung Hyun Oh said, "If you really want to stay on the morning team,"

238
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,270
"I'll move the program to the morning."

239
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,110
I told him, "Not even the CEO of PPS can do that."

240
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,910
But the next thing I know, I'm hosting "Issue-In" at 9:05 a.m., Sunbae.

241
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,910
 My goodness. 

242
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,190
 A program can easily move to the morning 

243
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,000
 with just one word from Jung Hyun Oh. 

244
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,100
But you know what's even more fascinating, Sunbae?

245
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,830
I heard that Sunbae Han Seok Jin would be my co-host.

246
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,480
But when I came to my senses, it was Jung Hyun Oh next to me instead. Why?

247
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,900
Oh, as for that...

248
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,490
Sunbae Han Seok Jin had a scheduling conflict in the morning.

249
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,290
Then Hyun Oh said he would take responsibility so...

250
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,390
Then that jerk can do it alone. Why include me?

251
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,760
Eun Ho, I'll say this again.

252
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,650
A woman needs to stand next to a man.

253
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,850
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,130
I haven't escaped from my old-fashioned ideas yet.

255
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,600
I see.

256
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,520
But Sunbae, do you know?

257
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,190
I used to date Jung Hyun Oh.

258
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,540
Of course. You dated him for eight years.

259
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,170
So what is this?

260
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,160
Why are ex-lovers made to be co-emcees?

261
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,320
Hey. This is sincere advice.

262
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
You should be thankful you were assigned a program.

263
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,830
It's next to Jung Hyun Oh. Jung Hyun Oh.

264
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,490
Why would I be thankful?

265
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,020
Why not? That Hyung is great.

266
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,860
You should absorb some of his energy.

267
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,370
Hey, Ji On.

268
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,830
Jung Hyun Oh and I are the same age.

269
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,650
Why is he your "hyung" while I'm just "you"?

270
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,460
Address me like you do for Jung Hyun Oh:

271
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,880
"Noona. Sunbae."

272
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,120
Or be like him and say, "Hey, you. Over here."

273
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,750
As I consider you a woman, I won't call you "Noona."

274
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,680
Oh, really?

275
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,080
You're nice to everybody. What's with the mutiny?

276
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,640
Ju Eun Ho, Hyung is nice to everybody, too.

277
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,030
But he dated you.

278
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,860
Then why can't you date me? I'm nice to everybody, too.

279
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes, I dislike that the most.

280
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,500
Then why did you date him?

281
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,650
Do you think I knew before dating him? I didn't.

282
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,680
I like someone who's rude to everyone except me.

283
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,910
Then I'll do my best, Ju Eun Ho.

284
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,650
No need. And I...

285
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
will get my revenge.

286
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,200
What revenge?

287
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,290
You know, some people were saying this on the Internet.

288
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,340
Saying what?

289
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,370
"The best revenge at your ex-boyfriend is to become hot,"

290
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,150
"so tremendously hot that he can't even approach you."

291
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,720
 Excuse me, Writer. I'm so curious. 

292
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,700
 What's going on with Ju Eun Ho's hair and makeup? 

293
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Is there a war? Where?

294
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,540
What is wrong with her outfit? Is she Francesca (former first lady)?

295
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,690
I don't know. Will it change the trends, Producer?

296
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,360
 No. It won't affect the trends. 

297
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,530
Next news.

298
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,790
While we transition from winter to spring, the wide daily temperature range might make you catch a cold.

299
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,080
Right. That's why immunity is so important to prevent colds.

300
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,520
-  At "Issue-In" today, we seek foods to help immunity.  
 - Oh, what is that?

301
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,120
 We visited the vendors ourselves. 

302
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,590
VCR start.

303
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,900
What do we do in the closing two-shot (of both people)?

304
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,090
Can we do a chest-up on Deputy Jung to finish?

305
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,170
 Sunbae, we will do a chest-up shot on you to finish. Close it out, please. 

306
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,820
 Three, two, one, cue. 

307
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,040
That's it for today's news.

308
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,550
- The wind is still— 
 - Chilly and cold.

309
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,090
Please watch out for your health, everyone.

310
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,780
- Have a— 
 - Have a good day.

311
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,090
Good, good. Display energy, Sunbae.

312
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,010
 Director, keep Camera 2 chest-up. 

313
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,450
 We're not doing a two-shot. We will close here. 

314
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,710
We're going to cut it here. Start the title sequence.

315
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm sorry, Hyun Oh.

316
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Are you not feeling well?

317
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,350
Excuse me, Jung Hyun Oh. Are you not feeling well?

318
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,100
- I'm okay. 
 - I don't think so.

319
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,780
You don't look fine. You look really sick.

320
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,050
Get off me.

321
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Oh, no, this was still here.

322
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,650
What did you just say, Jung Hyun Oh?

323
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,630
Get off? Get off me? No?

324
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,160
Get out of here right now?

325
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,910
Just go now.

326
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,500
Excuse me, Jung Hyun Oh.

327
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,410
If you're in pain, don't hold back. Get angry.

328
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,150
You want to curse me out, don't you?

329
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,760
Then just—

330
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,880
- Go. 
 - So why did you steal my line?

331
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,390
Did you want those few lines so badly that you stole them?

332
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,890
Hey.

333
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,990
Why? What's up?

334
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,700
You must not have a grasp on reality.

335
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,240
Hey. Few people have a tighter grasp on reality than I do.

336
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,060
You've done this for 14 years.

337
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,500
Where's your professionalism?

338
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,410
Your actions could ruin the broadcast. Do you ever consider that?

339
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,300
So why did you steal my line?

340
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,440
Hey. Stealing my line would ruin the broadcast, not my stepping on your foot.

341
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,610
I'm not so sure.

342
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,730
Accidents never happen the way you expect.

343
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,820
Excuse me. Are you trying to give me advice now?

344
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,750
No.

345
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,450
A warning.

346
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,760
That's just...

347
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,390
Are you okay? Put this around your waist.

348
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,320
Why, Chan Woo?

349
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,550
Your skirt ripped.

350
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,820
What? Where?

351
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,560
Oh, no, how did this happen?

352
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,550
If Deputy Jung hadn't stolen your line, it would be a serious accident.

353
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,110
Don't ruin your career just to get revenge on Hyun Oh.

354
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,440
What?

355
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,050
You just said the same thing as Jung Hyun Oh.

356
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,810
He said that, too?

357
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,190
Yes. He asked me where my professionalism went.

358
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,550
Honestly, I felt super guilty.

359
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,590
Then I thought,

360
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,340
"Oh. I've lived a pathetic life because I am this pathetic."

361
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,940
"That's why Jung Hyun Oh treated me like I was so pathetic."

362
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,810
- Ju Eun Ho. 
 - Ji On.

363
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,970
It's "Noona" or "Sunbae."

364
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,620
Can you try not to hate Jung Hyun Oh?

365
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,580
What do you mean?

366
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,220
You hate him so much that it seems you like him.

367
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,770
What are you saying?

368
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,970
Then don't hate him.

369
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,940
It bothers me.

370
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,660
- Moon Ji On. 
 - What?

371
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,780
Want to go on a date with me?

372
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,070
What?

373
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,980
Would you go on a date with me?

374
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,110
I mean...

375
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,740
I have time only this week.

376
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,470
I have filming on the weekends starting next week.

377
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,980
Then we can go out this weekend.

378
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,700
No canceling.

379
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,860
Fine, no canceling.

380
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,950
Hey! What do you want to do? What do you want to eat?

381
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,440
Is there a gift you want? Tell me everything.

382
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,010
One date and you're asking what gift I want?

383
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,270
In that case, I want pork belly.

384
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,890
I can't have pork belly alone.

385
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,250
Hey, let's go get pork belly.

386
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,690
Not that! Something more date-like!

387
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,850
Fine dining, sushi, or what else?

388
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,750
Oh, teppanyaki (fry on iron slab).

389
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,010
Sushi, gross. Fine dining, gross.

390
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,960
- What else did you say? 
 - Hey.

391
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,430
If you keep this up, I'll take you on vacation.

392
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,010
Pork belly on vacation? Let's go.

393
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,410
Seriously.

394
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,890
Not pork belly. How about beef?

395
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,710
 But I like pork belly. 

396
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,950
Okay. Beef is fine.

397
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,980
Okay, beef, okay!

398
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,430
Hey. Why are you so pretty today?

399
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,320
 Right? So pretty, right? 

400
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,740
 But everyone else seemed frightened. 

401
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,120
 Really? Why would they be like that? I don't understand. 

402
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,870
 Right? Say I'm pretty a few more times. 

403
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,790
 I can feel my confidence growing. 

404
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,590
What's on the filming agenda this weekend?

405
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,400
W-W-Wait one second. Let me check.

406
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,790
Reporting on the ocean waste in Yangwan.

407
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,490
It's two days on the weekend. Why?

408
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,970
Send Ju Eun Ho.

409
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,330
What? That business trip pays dirt-poor.

410
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,370
We can barely get people to do it even if it's a special.

411
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,460
Ju Eun Ho likes that kind of thing.

412
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,840
Send Ju Eun Ho.

413
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
Stop talking nonsense!

414
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,880
Sunbae, no one's into that kind of thing. Do you get that?

415
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,540
Sure, I'm into it.

416
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,210
Wh-What?

417
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,420
The ocean waste filming, I'll go.

418
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,240
What's the schedule like?

419
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,710
Oh, well...

420
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,900
it's this weekend.

421
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,230
Oh, the weekend.

422
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,470
Right? You can't, right?

423
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,030
It's the weekend, overnight and everything.

424
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,110
How many minutes on the VCR?

425
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,590
Oh, that's...

426
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,960
Thirteen, oh, fourteen minutes.

427
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,560
Fourteen minutes.

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,650
Yes. I know, it's not great.

429
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,140
Fourteen minutes for an overnight schedule, not great.

430
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,720
I just figured I would ask.

431
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,440
I'll do it.

432
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:12,250
You'd be leaving at 5 a.m. on Saturday.

433
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,280
Sounds good, I'm a morning person.

434
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,530
Oh, you're a morning person.

435
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll see you on the day then.

436
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,040
Thank you!

437
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,860
- What? 
 - Our date.

438
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,980
Can we go out next weekend?

439
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,760
Next weekend, this noona will—

440
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,210
I told you I can't. I'll be filming.

441
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,960
Right. You did.

442
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,620
Then why don't we... hop on the phone like it's a date?

443
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,960
A quick call?

444
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,560
Or let's imagine that we're on a date right now and go down to the cafeteria to eat, and—

445
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,500
You got something scheduled, didn't you?

446
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,990
How did you know?

447
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,340
You're trying to dominate the VCR.

448
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,920
Were you there just now?

449
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,430
Did you hear everything?

450
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,780
You're choosing screen time over me.

451
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,490
I mean...

452
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,050
"Issue-In" is going off-site to film on the weekend.

453
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,420
But do you know how long the segment is?

454
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,050
Fourteen whole minutes, fourteen minutes!

455
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,620
In my fourteen long years of being an announcer,

456
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,750
I have never once been on TV alone for fourteen minutes!

457
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,430
And they're giving it to me.

458
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,040
I need to take it. Don't you think?

459
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,400
Fine. I'll accept it.

460
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,950
What?

461
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,660
Is your heart like Lake Titicaca?

462
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,570
A lake 4,000 meters above sea level, serving vast highlands?

463
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,980
Is it open, wide and very vast?

464
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,230
No. I'm coming with you.

465
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,960
What do you mean? It's an overnight shoot.

466
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,630
Even better.

467
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,190
I'll ask to share a room with you.

468
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,680
Okay! See you on Saturday, Ju Eun Ho.

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,400
What did you say, Ji On?

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,180
Moon Ji On?

471
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,900
Moon Ji—

472
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,580
   

473
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,920
- Hello? 
 -  Sunbae! 

474
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,190
 I'm at the shoot. Guess who Ju Eun Ho brought. 

475
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,120
 She brought Moon Ji On. Moon Ji On! 

476
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,470
 She brought a guy to an overnight shoot. 

477
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,420
Are they dating or something?

478
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,800
 How can she do that on an overnight shoot? 

479
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,280
Mi Yeon.

480
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,090
Let me ask you a favor.

481
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,660
 What? What favor? 

482
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,150
Can you wrap up the shoot within the day?

483
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,600
 Why? 

484
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,120
It'll be tricky here due to the high tides and stuff.

485
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,530
Still. You can squeeze it all in.

486
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,310
 If it were that easy, I would have scheduled it that way. 

487
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,700
 I can try, but it won't be easy. 

488
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,700
 But why? Why do I need to do that? 

489
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,700
This is a beach in Yangwan.

490
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,210
Do you see the garbage here?

491
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,440
Where did this garbage come from?

492
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,530
Butane gas, tin foil...

493
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,910
It appears that someone grilled meat out here.

494
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,960
But humans are not the ones who clean up this kind of trash.

495
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,460
It's the animals that live here.

496
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,480
The trash is not just limited to the beach.

497
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,240
Here—

498
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,920
Cut! Eun Ho, what's wrong? Do you not want to go in the water?

499
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,710
Then you don't have to.

500
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,780
No, I can go in.

501
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,920
Oh, then just dip your foot. Let's go again.

502
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,720
 Hi. Cue! 

503
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,940
You can also easily see garbage in the ocean water.

504
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,410
Ji On.

505
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,190
I-It's a seaweed!

506
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,680
I'm sorry I misunderstood you two.

507
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:11,390
As you can see, the issue of ocean waste is quite serious.

508
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,650
Oppa, I think you should stop laughing.

509
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,110
Right, Unnie?

510
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,290
Oppa, do you know that word has spread?

511
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,670
- What word? 
 - They say you hate her so much

512
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,310
that you came all the way here to watch her struggle.

513
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,320
Unnie, I can't find spare clothes anywhere.

514
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320
Everything you brought is wet from the rain.

515
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,230
What if you catch a cold?

516
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,660
I'm okay, Yu Yeon.

517
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,550
I'll be loading our stuff.

518
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,010
See you two later.

519
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,090
Take some. 
    

520
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,310
Come on.

521
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,200
You were laughing at me.

522
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,540
Now this?

523
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,010
Of course.

524
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,820
If I came all the way here and obviously showed I like you,

525
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,140
it'd hurt your career that's already not going well.

526
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,450
Take them before you really catch a cold.

527
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,250
You'll return in my car, won't you?

528
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,350
I don't know.

529
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,790
What do you mean, you don't know?

530
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,030
 - Nice work. 
 - Yes, great work. 

531
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,580
 Travel safely! 

532
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,330
Okay, Yu Yeon! See you at work! 
    

533
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,980
Okay!

534
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,780
Here. Put this on.

535
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,620
This?

536
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,840
Yes. It's too cold.

537
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,340
Get changed. I'll go get some stuff.

538
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,690
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

539
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,100
 After the beep, a fee will be charged. 

540
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,290
What?

541
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,690
Do I look more attractive to you now that you think of it?

542
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,900
No.

543
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,400
On second thought,

544
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,130
I think you're a really serious person,

545
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,970
yet people treat you like you're not.

546
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,030
You know that I'm a serious person.

547
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,370
That's why I like you.

548
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,790
Thanks for the ride.

549
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,330
I'll wash your sweater and return it.

550
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,020
Aren't you tired? I told you to sleep as I drove.

551
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,810
I can sleep at home.

552
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,920
Bye.

553
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,650
But…

554
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,020
why did you want to see me?

555
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,050
You didn't want to be with me anyway.

556
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,490
There must have been a different reason.

557
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,460
You said you wanted to say something.

558
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,680
What is it?

559
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,530
Later.

560
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,120
Can I tell you later?

561
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,660
Do you want to go on another date?

562
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,320
Ji On, I…

563
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,100
hate…

564
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,120
Hyun Oh.

565
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,060
Still?

566
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,590
Yes.

567
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,120
Why do you hate him?

568
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,560
 Marriage? No way, Eun Ho. 

569
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,750
 I won't do that. 

570
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,820
 I don't do such a thing, Eun Ho. 

571
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,300
 Because he's not mine. 

572
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,110
No matter how much I want it,

573
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,260
no matter how hard or desperately I try,

574
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,380
he will never be mine.

575
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,010
To give up what you want so badly,

576
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,510
do you know how much you must…

577
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,350
hate it?

578
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,360
Is that why you…

579
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
Yes, I hate him.

580
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,730
I hate him to pieces.

581
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,060
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,920
No.

583
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,360
There is no need to be sorry.

584
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,310
What?

585
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,540
You just have to choose.

586
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,140
- What? 
 - I'll be with you, no matter what.

587
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,610
Ji On. Moon Ji On, I—

588
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,060
If you say no, I'll never make a move on you again.

589
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,290
But if you stay where you are without saying anything,

590
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,590
I'll try harder to make you stop hating Hyun Oh.

591
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,230
What do you think?

592
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,800
Have you decided?

593
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,440
No, I… I…

594
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,540
I have.

595
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,980
I really don't know.

596
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,640
What do you like about me?

597
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,820
I'm 37 years old.

598
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,500
Why do you always mention your age? I don't care at all.

599
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,490
 - Here you go. Bye now. 
 - Thank you. 

600
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,880
 Ju Hye Ri, what's happening? 

601
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,780
 Were you dreaming again? 

602
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,100
 What was your dream? 

603
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,080
 I was an announcer. 

604
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,310
 That's the dream I had. 

605
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,860
 Could you be more specific? 

606
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,370
An announcer who looks just like me.

607
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,860
In my dream, she was running around the broadcast station.

608
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,360
In this one, she was at the beach for a shoot.

609
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,240
After there,

610
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,680
she even kissed a much younger guy.

611
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,080
 Doctor, why are my dreams so vivid and realistic? 

612
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,010
 Is it because I sleep 16 hours a day? 

613
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,080
Instead, does something make you feel exhausted?

614
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,230
"Exhausted"? Doctor…

615
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,550
I'm bored to death daily.

616
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,210
Is this because I've lost most of my memories?

617
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,270
When you lose your memories, instead of feeling bored,

618
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,040
you're more likely to feel uneasy and anxious.

619
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,290
When your days feel tedious, you could try to make exciting things happen.

620
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,870
"Exciting things"? By chance…

621
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,490
like falling in love?

622
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,400
That could be one.

623
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,710
Why? Are you in love?

624
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,390
I have someone I like.

625
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,760
Excuse me, is this a parking spot?

626
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,130
No, it's under construction.

627
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,590
Go away.

628
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,510
I don't think so. There's a spot right here.

629
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,140
Darn.

630
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,550
   

631
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,260
 Who is the person? 

632
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,780
Hello, everyone.

633
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,570
It's Monday, March 18. This is Media N Seoul's 8 p.m. news.

634
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:14,510
After the salmonella-contaminated onion scandal, we are now under a food safety alert.

635
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,340
 After salmonella was found in some onions grown and distributed by Daeju, 

636
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,590
 the Ministry of Health is holding an investigation. 

637
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,140
   

638
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,860
   

639
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,790
 A good person. 

640
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,470
 And… 

641
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,860
 a good-looking person. 

642
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,900
Is that why you like him?

643
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,900
 No. Because he is rude. 

644
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,590
 You said he was a good person. 

645
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,590
He is good…

646
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,530
but also rude.

647
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,150
What?

648
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,260
W-W-Wait!

649
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,830
 Why would you be drawn to that? 

650
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,740
 I read in a web novel once 

651
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,760
 that a guy like that is totally devoted to his girlfriend. 

652
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,140
 Have you ever actually seen that? 

653
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,540
Yes.

654
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,590
Hey, if you do this, you'll be late. Just go.

655
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,260
I won't be.

656
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,250
Do they all need pushing?

657
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,420
 Doesn't that mean he likes men? 

658
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,850
No. He's just nice to those close to him.

659
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:10,400
 Still, I don't know if you'll be that one special girl. 

660
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,740
Min Yeong, I lost most of my memories, didn't I?

661
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,600
That means I don't have much data on failure.

662
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,960
So all I have is overflowing confidence.

663
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,390
 Is that right? 

664
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,450
 Ju Hye Ri. 

665
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,910
 Yes? 

666
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,300
 I see Kang Ju Yeon. 

667
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,950
 Just joking! 

668
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,020
I have a question.

669
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,570
What is it?

670
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:58,960
What does a guy like that think of when he's alone?

671
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,510
 Se Yeon. 

672
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:28,400
 I'm so happy Se Yeon became an announcer. 

673
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,470
 My son is so handsome. 

674
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,560
   

675
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,260
 I wish Ju Yeon was as handsome as you and became an announcer, too, 

676
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,350
 but he wanted to be a soldier like his dad, right? 

677
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:50,270
 Se Yeon, I saw your dad in my dreams last night. 

678
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:53,000
 In my dream, your dad… 

679
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,440
 Se Yeon. 

680
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,320
Mom.

681
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,020
It's Ju Yeon.

682
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,100
Sunbae!

683
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,210
Sunbae, are you going to work now?

684
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,770
Yes, Hye Yeon.

685
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,700
Sunbae, do you have time this evening?

686
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,210
No, Hye Yeon.

687
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,190
There's a new udon food truck in the area.

688
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,130
Do you know what they call udon?

689
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,990
"Tight Tight, Chewy Chewy."

690
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,950
How good are noodles named "Tight Tight, Chewy Chewy"?

691
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,390
It makes no sense. Is that right, Sunbae?

692
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,360
It does make sense, Hye Yeon.

693
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,790
-  See?  
 - Excuse me.

694
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,060
 Kang Ju Yeon and Baek Hye Yeon are dating. 

695
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,760
 Wait a minute. 

696
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
No.

697
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,540
 She's the only girl Kang Ju Yeon has to deal with. 

698
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,400
 That's right. 

699
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,110
 Then what else would they be? 

700
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,320
   

701
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,200
   

702
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:59,060
Sunbae, where are you going? Home? Are you going home now?

703
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,350
Yes, Hye Yeon.

704
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,440
Sunbae, I actually have a wish.

705
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,820
Can you make my wish come true?

706
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,510
No. I can't.

707
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,880
It's a challenging task to fulfill a wish, Hye Yeon.

708
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,370
No. Fulfilling a wish is really easy.

709
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:21,190
You can just have dinner with me.

710
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,590
All right. What's your wish?

711
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,180
If I fulfill it, will you make mine come true?

712
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,740
What is your wish?

713
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,690
My wish is for the world to end.

714
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,860
- What did you say? 
 - That all trees outside my house get pulled out.

715
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,280
Or all the paper cups at work hang from the ceiling.

716
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,860
Or my news desk flies into a sudden gust of wind.

717
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,300
- Bye. 
  - It's one-sided. 

718
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,700
Why does he have such a wish?

719
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,730
 Now I have to be brave. 

720
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,670
You? You live with a curtain over your face in case Kang Ju Yeon sees you.

721
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:07,000
You claim self-confidence, yet still live with a face curtain.

722
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,700
Now you say you want to be brave?

723
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,240
- Min Yeong. 
 - What?

724
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:19,150
That's because if he sees me, he will fall in love with me.

725
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,740
 I'm too pretty. 

726
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,890
 Hey. 

727
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,650
 Has anyone in your life ever told you that's not true? 

728
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,950
No. Even if they did, I don't recall.

729
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,830
I've lost all my memories.

730
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,700
Wow. Your life is so easy.

731
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,390
I'd love to lose my memories like you.

732
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,060
Until now, the time just wasn't right.

733
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,210
Because even in unrequited love, I loved myself.

734
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,400
Daebak.

735
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,490
So?

736
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,920
What will you do?

737
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,780
Prepare my heart.

738
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,310
Prepare to meet the version of myself in requited love.

739
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,570
I am preparing my heart.

740
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,560
Make sure you go to the hospital.

741
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,530
I already take time off and go every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m.

742
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,540
You know that.

743
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,370
That's true.

744
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,890
That's why I work more.

745
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,440
I feel very bad about that.

746
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,200
 I just want to pay for this. 

747
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,060
Oh, sure.

748
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,450
Let me total your bill.

749
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,240
You're all set.

750
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,460
I thought you were ready.

751
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,240
So why did you hide?

752
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,280
I meant I would do it from now on.

753
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,510
From now on.

754
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,420
That's right, from now on.

755
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,060
   

756
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,870
   

757
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,730
Kang Ju Yeon, step down! You misreported the onion scandal!

758
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,990
 Step down! Step down! 

759
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,320
We demand a true report! 
     

760
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,360
 We demand! We demand! 
   

761
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,760
Get Kang Ju Yeon out here! 
    

762
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,500
Please leave.

763
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,940
   

764
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,600
- Step down! 
 - I need to see Kang Ju Yeon before I go!

765
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,230
What are you talking about?

766
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,310
You can't stay here.

767
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,020
Let go!

768
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,840
Stop it!

769
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,500
Stop It!

770
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,380
Kang Ju Yeon!

771
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,660
   

772
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,360
This is done.

773
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,830
But this is not the last one.

774
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,810
We're all going to work late for it.

775
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,520
I hear the basement printer is ready. Go check it out.

776
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,110
Okay.

777
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,740
 Let go! 
   

778
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,550
 Hey! You… you! 

779
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:29,170
Die! Die! I said die!

780
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:35,880
Do you know what you've done?

781
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,000
No…

782
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,520
You've killed all of us!

783
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,210
Kang Ju Yeon! Stop right there!

784
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,180
Kang Ju Yeon!

785
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,690
Excuse me.

786
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,450
Kang Ju Yeon!

787
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,980
Get out here! Where are you hiding?

788
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,950
Kang Ju Yeon!

789
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:47,140
I'm going to kill you!

790
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,250
 Calm down! Put that down. 

791
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,690
 Let's go. 

792
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,850
 How did you find me here? 

793
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,130
Well…

794
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,950
That's…

795
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,560
They are…

796
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,190
all gone.

797
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,370
So…

798
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:42,060
she just showed up in front of the elevator.

799
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,440
She threatened me with the pickax so I tried to stop her...

800
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,570
because I thought I could.

801
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,850
Didn't you think you might get hurt running at her like that?

802
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,510
Oh…

803
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,470
Are you hurt anywhere?

804
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,620
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

805
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,300
 Have you met someone from your dream… 

806
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,060
 in real life? 

807
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,830
Yes, Doctor.

808
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,540
   

809
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,460
I met this person.

810
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,640
This person appeared before me in real life.

811
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,770
   

812
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,800
How is that possible?

813
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,010
How could someone in a dream exist for real?

814
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,620
Do you know what he called me?

815
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,940
The name of the woman in my dream.

816
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,600
How is that possible, Doctor?

817
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:35,690
What is the name of the woman in your dream, Eun Ho?

818
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,560
The woman in my dream…

819
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,470
What did you say, Doctor?

820
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:48,000
What is the name of the woman in your dream?

821
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,210
No, after that.

822
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,950
Eun Ho.

823
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,260
Doctor, am I…

824
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,880
Eun Ho?

825
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,750
Yes, Eun Ho.

826
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:21,530
You've been seeing me for the past two months, Eun Ho. 
    

827
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,540
 Why, Eun Ho? 

828
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:28,620
 Doctor, I'm Hye Ri. 

829
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,640
No.

830
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,500
Eun Ho, you're not Hye Ri.

831
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,870
You are Eun Ho.

832
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,350
I-I...

833
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,830
I am…

834
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,460
the same person…

835
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,410
   

836
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,790
as her?

837
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:50,900


838
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:56,690
   

839
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,670
What are you doing over there?

840
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,050
Why are you walking like that?

841
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,350
Are you trying to make me laugh?

842
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,480
How is this possible?

843
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,950
How can someone from my dream…

844
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,470
How can this be real?

845
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:17,170
What are you saying, Ju Eun Ho?

846
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,840
What is this? Did he just call me "Ju Eun Ho"?

847
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,680
Wow!

848
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,030
Wow!

849
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:30,670
Is this your new method of ignoring me?

850
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,100
I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho…

851
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,900
Oh, really?

852
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,090
Then who are you?
