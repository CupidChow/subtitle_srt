1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,750
   

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,310
   

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,650
   

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,960
   

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,350
   

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:30,020


7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,980
   

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,130
   

9
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,050
   
   

10
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,540
Mom! Mom!

11
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,550
Mom!

12
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,330
Mom!

13
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,720
- Aigoo! 
 - How did this...

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,280
What do we do?

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Aigoo! We need to get her to the hospital!

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,110
How did you get hurt?

17
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,050
It's okay.

18
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,000
It's okay, it's okay!

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,310
Honey!

20
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,350
 Hye Ri... 

21
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,900
 Hye Ri... 

22
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,280
 Hye Ri... 

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,690
 Girls, let's take a photo. 

24
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,330
 Hye Ri, let's take a photo! 

25
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,510
 All right, get closer. 

26
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,770
Come forward a little.

27
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,160
 That's right. Here I go. 

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,100
 One, two... 

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,200
   

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,980
   

31
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,320
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

32
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
What are you doing over there?

33
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,670
Wh-Why are you walking like that?

34
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,510
Are you trying to make me laugh?

35
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,140
How is this possible?

36
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,400
How can someone from my dream...

37
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,300
How can this be real?

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,720
What are you saying, Ju Eun Ho?

39
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,410
What is this? Did he just call me "Ju Eun Ho"?

40
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,250
Wow!

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,920
So wow!

42
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,740
Is this your new method of ignoring me?

43
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,670
I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho…

44
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh, really?

45
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,740
Then who are you?

46
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,050
Before that, you should identify yourself first.

47
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,840
Oh, yes. I'm Jung Hyun Oh.

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,350
Happy now?

49
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,070
Impossible.

50
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,450
I heard you took Moon Ji On along on your overnight trip to film.

51
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,110
Even if the PD (Program Director) allowed you to, that's not right.

52
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,530
They had a big crew there.

53
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,650
What would they think of you?

54
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,200
If you mix your personal and professional affairs–

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,750
No way.

56
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,630
That was what happened in my dream.

57
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,370
What are you saying, Ju Eun Ho? Stop it!

58
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm not...

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm not Ju Eun Ho!

60
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,430
 I-I... 

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,970
 I am… 

62
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,370
 the same person... 

63
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,200
as her?

64
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,120
This might be very confusing for you,

65
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,130
but Eun Ho and Hye Ri are the same person.

66
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,530
But that's impossible.

67
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,800
Because... because...

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,930
I have a scar right here.

69
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,210
Only Hye Ri has this scar–

70
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,380
Do you see a scar there?

71
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes, clearly.

72
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,180
Wait, I don't see it.

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,640
Wait. Let me wipe the grime off my eyes.

74
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,250
It's called Dissociative Identity Disorder.

75
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,350
What?

76
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,730
In psychiatry, what you're experiencing is called Dissociative Identity Disorder.

77
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,160
It's commonly known as multiple personality disorder.

78
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,690
All symptoms you're experiencing right now fall under the criteria.

79
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,600
   

80
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,880
   

81
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,070
But I don't know Ju Eun Ho.

82
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,050
I only know myself.

83
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,800
I simply lost my memories.

84
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,490
Yes,

85
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,850
what if the doctor confused memory loss for Dissociative Identity Disorder?

86
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,030
Since the doctor can't know everything, either.

87
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,940
Yes.

88
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,980
Maybe...

89
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,800
 Various switches can trigger a personality change. 

90
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,200
 Drinking alcohol, experiencing extreme stress, or... 

91
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,050
 it could change after waking from sleep. 

92
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,340
   

93
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,890
   

94
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:18,480
 However, where exactly did the personality who causes Hye Ri and Eun Ho 

95
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,810
 to co-exist come from? 

96
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,730
 What is the relationship between these two women? 

97
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,560
 That's what we must find out. 

98
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,970
 Verification unsuccessful. 

99
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,420
 Verification unsuccessful. 

100
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,720
You can get a replacement from the info desk.

101
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,190
What's going on?

102
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,230
Let me go in with you.

103
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,850
Hello, I'm Jung Hyun Oh.

104
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,800
This is my fellow announcer, Ju Eun Ho.

105
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,220
All right.

106
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,000
Please go ahead.

107
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,090
That event must be over now.

108
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,380
What event?

109
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,480
"I'm not Ju Eun Ho." That event.

110
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,100
You startled me for the first time in a while.

111
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you saying? If I'm not Ju Eun Ho, then who is?

112
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,280
Don't you remember?

113
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,670
What are you talking about? Say it clearly.

114
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,540
I met you in front of your house.

115
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,360
Why would you come to my house? That's unpleasant.

116
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,300
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

117
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,090
What?

118
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,870
 I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho… 

119
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,830
You really...

120
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,880
What?

121
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,260
Never mind. Get going.

122
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,640
I was going to.

123
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,070
Hey, Moon Ji On.

124
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,970
Will you give me the silent treatment today too?

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,830
Ji On?

126
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,730
Hey, Seung Hwa. Can you check my chair?

127
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,150
- I think it's too low. 
 - Sure.

128
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,440
By the way, Sunbaenim.

129
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,530
Could you stand up a bit?

130
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,600
Oh, sure.

131
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,510
Seung Hwa, did you eat yet?

132
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,170
Yes, I did.

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,190
Moon Ji On, you'll really not talk to me?

134
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,440
Did you have something good?

135
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,530
Yes, it was good.

136
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,970
Crap, Moon Ji On! Will you really not talk to me?

137
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,170
 What are you doing? 

138
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,120
 Oh, I... 

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
 That was close. 

140
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,710
 - What? 
 - Gosh. 

141
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,870
 Hey, Moon Ji On. You... 

142
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,910
 I almost fell for you. 

143
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,450
 But? 

144
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,100
 I can't do this. 

145
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 - The reason being– 
 - Jung Hyun Oh? 

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,930
 I'm really sick of it. 

147
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,090
 Fine. 

148
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,480
 I'm sorry for pursuing you in this situation, Ju Eun Ho. 

149
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,750
Hello, Viewers.

150
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,120
This is PPS Thursday News at noon.

151
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,880
Hey, Moon Ji On. I'm getting off work.

152
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,690
   

153
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,320
   

154
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,650
 What? 

155
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,470
 You kissed him? 

156
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,840
 Yes. 

157
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,400
 Isn't that a bit too fast? 

158
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,390
 I once read a web novel. 

159
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,350
 There's a point where physical affection becomes emotional affection. 

160
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,900
 So what about it? 

161
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,010
 That's what I was going for. 

162
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,130
 Geez. 

163
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,180
 But, Ju Hye Ri. 

164
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,740
 Yes? What? 

165
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,410
 I'm getting so distracted. 

166
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,250
 Can you stop moving like that? 

167
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,900
 But I want to move a bit more. 

168
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,420
 All right. 

169
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
 Whoa, why is he so early today? 

170
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,450
 What are you– 

171
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,830
Excuse me.

172
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,000
 Yes? 

173
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,390
The woman who works here...

174
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,420
Yes, go on.

175
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,250
No, not you.

176
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,800
Well...

177
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,700
She isn't here yet.

178
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,080
 What time does she come in? 

179
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,120
Oh, you see...

180
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,010
At 8:00 p.m.?

181
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 All right, thank you. 

182
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,330
Sure.

183
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,380
Hey, I honestly don't understand.

184
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,650
Why are you hiding?

185
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,670
If you kissed him, doesn't that mean your relationship has progressed?

186
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,700
You see, for experts, once they obtain physical affection, their next step...

187
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,570
is avoidance.

188
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,000
   

189
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,600
   

190
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,060
   

191
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,420
 Is she here yet? 

192
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,890
 Oh, well, she did come to work, 

193
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,320
 but she went to get something. 

194
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,780
Would you like me to deliver a message to her?

195
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,040
 No. 

196
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Hey.

197
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,500
I want to ask you something.

198
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,910
Why did you kiss me?

199
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,130
Well...

200
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,840
can we talk about this somewhere else?

201
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,290
I just want to know why you kissed me.

202
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,990
- You see– 
 - I was on the elevator at the time,

203
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,600
then that woman showed up and threatened me with a pickax.

204
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,270
Then you appeared.

205
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm very grateful you saved me from that situation.

206
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,770
Then we ran.

207
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,110
I understand up to that point, but afterward...

208
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,610
I just don't understand why you kissed me.

209
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,120
I understand why you don't understand that.

210
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,140
But instead of standing here–

211
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,500
You just need to tell me why you kissed me.

212
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,070
Was it just spontaneous?

213
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,210
Are you a loose person...

214
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,490
or did I look easy to you?

215
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,360
I just can't wrap my head around it.

216
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,420
I hope you can explain it to me.

217
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,170
Why did you kiss me?

218
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,450
S-So...

219
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,840
the reason why I did something like that–

220
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,680
Hey, Kang Ju Yeon!

221
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,120
What's going on?

222
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,760
Nothing. I'll see you later.

223
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,220
Sure, see you later.

224
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,810
All right.

225
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,330
I...

226
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,020
I...

227
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,530
Are you crying right now?

228
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,140
I don't...

229
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,840
I don't know why I'm...

230
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,350
I-I don't why I'm like this right now.

231
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,740
B-But...

232
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,480
B-But... b-but...

233
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,560
B-But...

234
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,380
No.

235
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,150
Forget it.

236
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,050
But...

237
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,260
But...

238
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,400
But...

239
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,470
But...

240
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,610
Hey! Kang Ju Yeon came by.

241
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,070
Hey, you...

242
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,260
 So... 

243
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,870
 I don't know why I did that. 

244
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,200
 But he was really upset. 

245
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,580
 Min Yeong... 

246
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,910
 I thought... 

247
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,810
 he would be nice to me, 

248
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,530
 but he was so scary and cold. 

249
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,480
 Min Yeong... what should I do? 

250
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,470
 I think I made a serious mistake. 

251
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,300
 What should I do? What should I do, Min Yeong? 

252
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,670
 What should I do? 

253
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,740
I made a serious mistake.

254
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,970
I was... too rude.

255
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,990
That's why...

256
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
   

257
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,730
That's why he...

258
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,200
he was cold to me.

259
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,840
So cold.

260
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,140
   

261
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,130
   

262
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,770
   

263
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,530
 What the heck? Why are my eyes so swollen? 

264
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,870
   

265
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,760
   

266
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,420
   

267
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,680
 Kang Ju Yeon's here. 

268
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,160
Sunbae!

269
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,410
Hey, Hye Yeon.

270
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,370
Someone left that with your name on it at the info desk so I brought it up.

271
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,090
I did well, right? Go on and open it.

272
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,820
I said to open it.

273
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,330
Oh my! They're paper stars!

274
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,250
There must be a thousand.

275
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,290
I'm so jealous of you, Sunbae. I always wanted to receive something like this.

276
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,630
You can make a wish with this.

277
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,130
You also had a wish. What was it again?

278
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,640
It was for an apocalypse.

279
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,890
Sunbae, that's a bit too much.

280
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,090
Wish for something a bit more constructive.

281
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,810
You received a heartfelt gift so wish for something constructive and–

282
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,830
You can have it then.

283
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,700
Sunbae?

284
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,670
Sunbae, Sunbae!

285
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,760
What!

286
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,030
Good job, Sunbae.

287
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
What?

288
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,380
You wished for an apocalypse, right?

289
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,130
Or what was it again?

290
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,530
"Paper cups hanging from the ceiling"?

291
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,040
But those events don't happen by just sitting around.

292
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,300
You must get angry at me, or something, to form a crack in your daily life.

293
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,900
So you did a great job, Sunbae.

294
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,150
 You see... 

295
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,810
 I wish you wouldn't just sit around waiting for something to happen. 

296
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,540
   

297
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,660
That's it for today's news.

298
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,780
Thank you for watching.

299
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,160
Good work.

300
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,030
Great work.

301
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,280
 I wish you would open the door yourself... 

302
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,280
 and create another world. 

303
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,900
   

304
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:17,680
 Also, Sunbae, you can't carelessly give someone else a gift you were given. 

305
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,150
   

306
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,910
   

307
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,050
 I hope all is well with your household. 

308
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,750
 I really... 

309
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,600
 I really liked you. 

310
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,610
 Thank you. 

311
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,630
 Thank you! 

312
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,700
 I'm paying for this, please. 

313
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,350
 Sure. 

314
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,900
 Let me ring the amount. 

315
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,230
 - Here you go. 
 - Thanks. 

316
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,180
   

317
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,080
Oh, Shi...

318
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,950
   

319
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,750
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

320
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,310
Oh, if... you're going to make a payment–

321
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,010
I didn't mean to make you cry either.

322
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,200
I was just really curious...

323
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,810
why you kissed me in that situation.

324
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,620
Oh, I-I wrote the reason in the letter.

325
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,190
I used to like you.

326
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,940
I realized it was unrequited,

327
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,060
but when I came to my senses, you were right in front of me.

328
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,200
- That's why you kissed– 
 - Yes, that's why I kissed...

329
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,400
That doesn't make sense.

330
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,070
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say, even if you sue me.

331
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,630
I don't intend to sue you.

332
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,310
Oh, that's a relief.

333
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,470
I'm also sorry.

334
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,370
That rainy day,

335
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,670
I realized I might have been too...

336
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,200
belligerent toward you.

337
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,330
Oh, that's fully understandable–

338
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,640
But I couldn't figure out the reason

339
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,990
why I was so upset.

340
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,820
Could it be because I was too disrespectful to you?

341
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,270
No. To be exact, right after the kiss,

342
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,100
I felt really weird.

343
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,660
And I became upset when you started crying.

344
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,230
Then what about now?

345
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,410
Has your anger subsided?

346
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,790
Yes, it has.

347
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,400
Why is that?

348
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,130
I'm not sure.

349
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Because now I know why you kissed me?

350
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,980
Then let me tell you one more time.

351
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,850
I really liked you, Kang Ju Yeon.

352
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,690
I was very happy when I had feelings for you.

353
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,300
Okay then.

354
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,440
Excuse me!

355
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,140
- That's right. Playing hard-to-get is quite difficult. 
 - Sorry?

356
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,800
There was someone who completely overpowered the Master of the Earth.

357
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,140
He was the lowest of the lowest.

358
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,270
By "lowest," do you mean–

359
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,010
Was that your first kiss by chance?

360
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Yes, it was.

361
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,260
Mine, too.

362
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,590
- It didn't seem like it. 
 - I like you, Kang Ju Yeon.

363
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,330
Which is why I wanted to get to know you better.

364
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,440
Actually, I really want to get to know you more,

365
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,000
even more so after kissing you.

366
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,060
I'm also curious about you.

367
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,060
Then shall we go somewhere and talk?

368
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,700
Where?

369
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,510
Not sure. Why don't you consider that?

370
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,780
 I didn't think you'd bring me to your house. 

371
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,300
 Nothing is open at this time. 

372
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,820
I see you live on the third floor. I also live on the third floor:

373
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,170
Samgok Villa, Sejeongdong, Apartment 301.

374
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,550
Your house is very clean.

375
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,270
Is it?

376
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,980
   

377
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,040
   

378
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,410
Who is this?

379
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,800
My hyung.

380
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,060
He's handsome.

381
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,290
He's dead,

382
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,010
five years after taking that photo.

383
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,750
   

384
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,050
But he's beautiful.

385
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,550
That's why my mom is often agonized

386
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,720
since my brother died.

387
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,610
Because he is gone.

388
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,170
But I'm still alive.

389
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,510
But being alive is a good thing.

390
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,120
Didn't you say you were curious about me?

391
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,630
What are you curious about?

392
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,570
First of all, I'm Ju Hye Ri.

393
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,120
I'm 28 years old.

394
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,260
What? Do I look younger?

395
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,000
No, I thought you'd be around the same age as me, if not older.

396
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
How old are you?

397
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,610
I'm 35.

398
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,630
That's impolite.

399
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,570
Do you live with your family?

400
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,500
No, I live alone.

401
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,210
I think my parents passed away, and I have no siblings.

402
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,540
I guess you can say I'm an only child.

403
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,240
But now...

404
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,840
I have you.

405
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,540
Is that so?

406
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,560
I never pictured you smiling like that.

407
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,030
That was so alluring.

408
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,220
Was it?

409
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,820
Yes.

410
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,490
Being alive is good like that.

411
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,410
Your mom is foolish.

412
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,540
I'll speak to her one day.

413
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,460
"Mother, being alive is a good thing."

414
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,100
"So please be grateful Kang Ju Yeon is alive."

415
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,320
Hye Ri...

416
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,860
Yes, Ju Yeon.

417
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,160
Can you stay with me a bit longer tonight?

418
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,410
Yes, without a doubt.

419
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,880
What?

420
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,440
What's that?

421
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,950
It's just...

422
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,170
You just leave it on all day?

423
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,550
Yes.

424
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,240
What's the reason?

425
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,570
   

426
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,700
   

427
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,280
   

428
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
   

429
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,530
   

430
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,220
   

431
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,560
Hey, did you guys watch today's soccer game?

432
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,270
Hey, Kim Taek Min.

433
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,200
What?

434
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,400
- Did you watch the game, too? 
 - I didn't.

435
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,120
Hey, what's with your outfit?

436
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,750
No need to judge things like that–

437
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,990
A 37-year-old woman dressed to look younger and went to the club

438
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,370
and had a one-night stand with a 20-year-old man–

439
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,000
- No, that wasn't me. 
 - I'm not saying it was you. I read it in the article–

440
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,200
I said it wasn't me!

441
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,830
Why are you yelling? Are you sick?

442
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,620
I am. I think I'm sick right now.

443
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,540
You have a lot of colleagues at Media N Seoul, right?

444
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,230
Yes, why?

445
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,140
- Do you want me to introduce you to someone? 
 - No, forget about that.

446
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,710
Look into someone for me.

447
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,730
 Well, this level of response isn't too bad. 

448
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,630
 No, you have to cover the fish topic, Sunbae. 

449
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,490
No, give it to Ju Eun Ho.

450
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,000
What are you talking about?

451
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,970
The fish topic is a social exposé.

452
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,150
Social exposés are your area of expertise.

453
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,080
You cover it so people can treat the topic seriously and take an interest.

454
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,700
There's no impact if Ju Eun Ho covers it.

455
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,670
Not happening.

456
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,840
Mi Yeon, I host "Current News at Ten" before coming here.

457
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,410
But if I cover that,

458
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,630
viewers will be confused if this is "Current News at Ten" or "Issue-In."

459
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,970
So I should cover light topics.

460
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,550
What does that matter as long as we get good ratings?

461
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,790
If people get confused about whether it's

462
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,800
serious "Current News at Ten" in the morning or "Issue-In,"

463
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,570
my goal is to make our serious topic go viral!

464
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,930
I don't get what you're saying.

465
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:23,340
I'm sorry, but can't you just cover it, Deputy Jung?

466
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,530
No, I can't.

467
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,660
Give this topic to Ju Eun Ho. Period.

468
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,590
You must be crazy! What's wrong with you?

469
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,640
Excuse me, why are you doing this to me?

470
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,700
Don't you care about my performance, Sunbae?

471
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,360
This will be on our program.

472
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,170
How will your performance be affected if I cover it or not?

473
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,070
Fine, do what you want to do!

474
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,990
Unnie, do I give this to Oppa?

475
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,730
"Oppa"?

476
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,650
Sorry?

477
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,470
Are you discussing me?

478
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,440
Who's your Oppa?

479
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,600
Dear Ms. Subwriter, who recently joined us.

480
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,100
You'll get in big trouble if you call him "Oppa."

481
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,770
When we used to attend university together, he would find all the girls

482
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,260
who called him "Oppa" and gave them a serious talk.

483
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,190
Didn't you hear me call him "Sunbae" every single time?

484
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,940
So, Sunbaenim, this fish topic should be–

485
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,700
Give it to Ju Eun Ho. I'm off.

486
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,070
What the... Does he still love Ju Eun Ho?

487
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,860
Oppa.

488
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,440
Yes?

489
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,950
Do you still love her?

490
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,050
What are you saying?

491
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,850
Then why do you keep giving her topics?

492
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,160
You gave her the ocean garbage topic last time.

493
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,010
Now you're giving her the fish topic.

494
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,670
Su Jeong, you said they're stored in refrigerated trucks.

495
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,210
Refrigerated trucks are too cold. I hate being cold!

496
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,530
Yes, right. You love the cold, Oppa.

497
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,650
What you really hate is being hot.

498
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,290
Preferences change as you get older.

499
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,250
- Oppa! 
 - Yes, what is it?

500
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,300
Ju Eun Ho is off-limits.

501
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,360
Yes, I know.

502
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,950
She will run away faster than anyone.

503
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,750
I know that as well.

504
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,550
And you'll still hand over every topic to her?

505
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:12,330
Su Jeong, this topic really is too heavy for me to cover–

506
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,610
Darn it! I really hate her.

507
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,520
   

508
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,080
Deputy Jung insists he won't cover this topic.

509
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,680
Crap, he drives me crazy.

510
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,900
How can he tell us to hand over a hot topic to a weirdo like her? 
    

511
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,420
I don't know. Let's just go ask her for now.

512
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,820
She might decline.

513
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,160
Hey, Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

514
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,230
What? What is it?

515
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,870
Well, it's nothing really. There's a shoot this weekend.

516
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,330
"Weekend"?

517
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,390
I don't know. I'm quite tired on weekends now.

518
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:26,300
I have too much on my mind, and I have a headache.

519
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,060
Right? A shoot every weekend is too much for you, right?

520
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,770
Sure! And the business trip pay is always so measly!

521
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,940
Well, I don't really obsess over money.

522
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,910
- How long is the screen time? 
 - Oh, it's only 10 minutes.

523
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,490
So I'll convince Hyun Oh–

524
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,700
I'll give it a shot.

525
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,690
I mean, do you even know what it's about?

526
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,350
I can cover a 10-minute VCR without knowing what it is.

527
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,640
Please just tell me what to do, Your Majesty.

528
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,130
What do I need to do in the refrigerated truck?

529
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:07,530
Just film them transferring mackerels to domestic boxes and discarding them.

530
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,290
What about the key?

531
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,600
I messaged you the license plate number.

532
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,860
Just confirm and open it with this.

533
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,880
But do I film this instead of the VJ (video jockey)?

534
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,440
Then my face won't show.

535
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,530
I agreed to this, thinking my face would show for 10 minutes.

536
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,930
Your sense of presence is enough with your voice alone.

537
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:36,690
Then my face and name will display throughout the entire 10 minutes, right?

538
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,380
Oh, yes. Of course. We can do that.

539
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,360
What about a script?

540
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,000
We messaged it to you.

541
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,710
You could memorize it as it's brief.

542
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,600
Goodness. I can memorize it even if it's long.

543
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,720
The staff and I will wait here at the food stall. Call us if anything goes wrong.

544
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,370
What could possibly go wrong?

545
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:23,170
 Geez, where exactly did you leave it? 

546
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,730
 I don't know. 

547
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,370
Oh, just go through everything?

548
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,020
Hey...

549
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,860
But why is the door open?

550
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,450
 Who was responsible for locking up? 

551
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,950
 Hey! Do your job right! 

552
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,380
 Will you wake up after something goes wrong big time? 

553
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,470
 Do you want to die? 

554
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,190
Pick up. Pick up!

555
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,270
Hurry and pick up.

556
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,980
Pick up!

557
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,060
Why aren't you picking up?

558
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,550
At this rate...

559
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,290
   

560
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,170
Is everything going smoothly?

561
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,190
My fish.

562
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,940
My precious fish.

563
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:34,360
We're out here filming at the crack of dawn.

564
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,750
But what if this doesn't go viral?

565
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,340
I'll just...

566
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,520
I'll just kill Jung Hyun Oh.

567
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,990
 Mi Yeon, you're not picking up. 

568
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,440
 I'm trapped inside the refrigerated truck, unfortunately. 

569
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,800
 Someone should come and open the doors for me. 

570
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,200
 But before that, Mi Yeon... 

571
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,970
 If you're asking what this is, yes, it's a dead person. 

572
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,110
 I still checked just in case he was still alive, but he's already dead. 

573
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,220
 I want to call the police. 

574
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,690
 But before that, I'm stuck in a refrigerated truck. 
    

575
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,940
 So, Mi Yeon, can you get me out of here? 
   

576
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,800
 It's getting colder and colder in here. 

577
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,890
Trying to get 10 minutes of screen time with just a tiny photo of myself at that.

578
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,000
Can't believe I'm trapped inside a refrigerated truck.

579
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,560
And if I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have agreed to this.

580
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,470
Why? Because I had so much to think about.

581
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,580
I should report this, right?

582
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,210
 By the way, I'm sure you know this. 

583
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:46,330
 If this gets exposed to outsiders, it's the end for us. 

584
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,050
Why?

585
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,030
Why is it the end?

586
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,760
Why can't this be exposed to outsiders? What's going on?

587
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,490
My life is about to end.

588
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,250
I'm about to die here.

589
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,750
But why? Why in the world?

590
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,940
Why isn't this woman answering me?

591
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,500
What is she doing right now?

592
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,920
She's not helpful at all, my gosh!

593
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,570
I don't know the other staff members' numbers.

594
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:18,580
Wow. Wow...

595
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,110
Wow, what do I do?

596
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,550
It all will go swiftly if I call the police.

597
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,550
I can get out of here.

598
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,810
That person can get out of here, and our program will crash–

599
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,770
Crap!

600
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,300
 Would you save me? 

601
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,140
 Would you save me? 

602
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,450
 Ju Eun Ho, you know... 

603
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,810
 Know what? 

604
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,860
 You learned how to swim. 

605
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,130
 Are you crazy? 

606
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,930
 I believe you even learned the butterfly stroke. 

607
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,230
 That's good enough to survive on your own. 

608
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,340
 Hey! Can't you just indulge me? 

609
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,580
 Humor me and say you'll save me? 

610
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,750
 Foster some independence, Eun Ho. 

611
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,050
 Why expect help when you've fallen into the water? 

612
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,910
 Please! Find your own way out, okay? 

613
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,350
 Hey! Don't you love me? 

614
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,420
 Geez, you're heavy! Get off of me. 

615
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,610
 No! I won't let go. 

616
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,620
 Answer me. Would you save me? 

617
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,650
 Seriously! 

618
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:44,960
   

619
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,530
   

620
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:09,110
   

621
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,450
I'll wait exactly 10 minutes.

622
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,020
Then I'll call the police. Why?

623
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,550
Because I'll get out of here alive, no matter what it takes.

624
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,570
I'm not...

625
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,960
going to die.

626
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,370
I won't die.

627
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,700
 It's this truck! The number matches! 
   

628
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,200
Oh, it's you, Chan Woo!

629
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,260
Did Mi Yeon contact you?

630
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,900
Yes, PD Kim told me to come.

631
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,050
As expected, Mi Yeon didn't abandon me.

632
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,750
Gosh, I was so scared in here.

633
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,660
Are you okay? It wasn't too cold?

634
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,460
Yes, I'm all right. I have a lot of fat in my body.

635
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,920
I was a bit cold, but something was scarier.

636
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,140
You heard, right?

637
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,320
Th-There's...

638
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,600
 Hey, you should consider it a real honor. 

639
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,520
 Because I would save you. 

640
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,490
 You're still going on about that? 

641
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,810
 You told me to crawl out by myself while I'm drowning. 

642
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,690
 But if you were drowning, 

643
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:33,030
 I would save you even if I didn't know how to swim! 

644
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,620
 Why would you save me? 

645
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,090
 Find a way for you to survive. 

646
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,870
 Because I love you. 

647
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,340
 - What? 
 - Because... 

648
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,330
 I love you. 

649
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,250

650

01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:06,530
♫  Please don't think of me at all  ♫

667
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,980
♫  Please hate me  ♫

668
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,780
♫  Don't be in too much pain  ♫

669
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:20,500
♫  Erase me little by little  ♫

670
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,910
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

671
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,560
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

672
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,650
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

673
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,820
♫  Always  ♫

674
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:48,390
   

675
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,060


676
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:09,610
I can't hold back if I'm curious about something.

677
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:12,500
So let me ask you one thing.

678
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,010
Go ahead.

679
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:18,120
I contacted Kim Mi Yeon.

680
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,580
I know.

681
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,900
But how did you come?

682
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,580
Why did you come?
