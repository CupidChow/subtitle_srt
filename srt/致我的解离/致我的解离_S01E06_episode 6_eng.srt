1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,850
   

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,400
   

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,710
   

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,000
   

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,370
   

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:29,970


7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,030
   

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,030
   

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,700
This is the first time I'm bringing a guy home.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,130
Yes, I thought so.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,220
No! I was popular! I wasn't that bad!

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,210
I bet you weren't popular. I bet you were quite bad.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,120
And you? Were you popular? Were you super lucky?

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,620
Of course. It would be strange not to be popular with this face.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,870
So what? So have you dated many girls then?

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,080
A lot of them?

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,700
Not that many.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,440
I've dated many guys.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,900
Of course, you're the first one I've dated for over three months.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,220
Should I be thankful?

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,030
Of course, you should be!

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,850
I told myself if I met a guy who could handle me for more than three months, I would marry him.

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,560
Because that kind of guy isn't common.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,890
Anyway, I would marry a guy like that and have one child.

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,280
Maybe two is better? A boy and a girl? That sounds good.

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,500
Honestly, I think it would be better if the girl looked like me.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,110
Because your face, honestly, would look better on a boy than a girl. Right?

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,820
I'm not getting married, Ju Eun Ho.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,500
Oh, right. You said that.

30
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,320
Aren't you coming? Hurry.

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,780
I'm coming.

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,370
   

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,540
   

34
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,690
I'm leaving.

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,620
 Hyun Oh, Mommy will be back soon. 

36
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,130
 Hyun Oh, you're so brave. 

37
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,160
 You're the class president. 

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,700
 You can take care of yourself, right? 

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,500
Mommy, are you going somewhere far?

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,960
If you miss Mommy,

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,460
look at this while waiting for me.

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,220
But then...

43
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,960
you won't have this.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,620
What will you look at when you miss me?

45
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,090
Will you become someone I can see from anywhere?

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,150
Someone everyone knows?

47
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,770
Could you do that, Hyun Oh?

48
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,820
Fine! I'll give it to you!

49
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,400
Just 100,000 won?

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,210
I'll bring it over right now!

51
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,830
Yes! Including Mr. Moon's from next door!

52
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,260
Hey, come over here.

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Go with Il Soo's wife to drop it off.

54
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,410
Okay, Father.

55
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,260
Get Mr. Moon's from next door, too. Got it?

56
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,700
Yes, Father.

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,190
Hyung!

58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,010
Dad told us to go with you.

59
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,440
He gave us money, too!

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,310
Really? Then let's go together.

61
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,840
Oppa, my mommy isn't coming home.

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,650
Hey, don't tell him.

63
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,070
- Why not? 
 - I don't know.

64
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,330
She said she was going to Grandma's, but she won't return.

65
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,230
She will be back.

66
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,620
But your mommy's not coming back, either.

67
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,660
Hey, don't say that.

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,100
Ji On, Su Jeong.

69
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,300
Want to have dinner at my place tonight?

70
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,600
Yay, I'm excited! I want sausages!

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,550
Okay. Let's go.

72
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,320
Okay. The sausages are yummy.

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,010
They are.

74
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,410
But Ji On,

75
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,200
we're missing  ₩10,000 ($7.40).

76
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Oppa, Dad took it to buy soju.

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,650
He said he will repay it tomorrow.

78
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,690
I'm sorry, Hyung.

79
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,150
   

80
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,280
You lost the money? Stop lying.

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,010
Children, you bought food on the way with that money, didn't you?

82
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,240
No, we brought it as is.

83
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,050
But I made a mistake, and we lost it on the way.

84
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,480
I apologize.

85
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,170
Hey, Little One, let me ask you.

86
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,090
You shoved food in your mouth on the way, didn't you?

87
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,900
No, I didn't shove any food in my mouth.

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you laughing?

89
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,100
Hey.

90
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,050
This ahjumma isn't trying to cheat you guys.

91
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,000
Your dads borrowed the money.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,630
If they die, you'll need to repay it.

93
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,080
Are you already trying to get out of it?

94
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,240
You hopeless little brats.

95
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,910
Do you want to start working to pay it back?

96
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,410
How dare you try to rip me off?

97
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,000
No. We really weren't trying to rip you off–

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,600
I own two buildings in this area, including this one.

99
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,460
There's a gambling den in each one.

100
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,080
There are dozens of rascals who owe me money!

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,750
But they all pay me back on time, without exception.

102
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
- Right. 
 - But...

103
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,510
you're the only ones who are always late. Only you guys.

104
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,910
But aside from being late,

105
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,090
now you're trying to rip me off?

106
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Go find the money.

107
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,270
Right now!

108
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,440
But Ahjumma.

109
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,580
What?

110
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,530
I've let you hit me so isn't that enough?

111
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,700
That's right! There we go!

112
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,260
Geez. It's over. It's over.

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,310
That round was a tie.

114
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,610
Wait. Stop.

115
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,580
 Where are you going? 

116
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,840
Yes.

117
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,860
I'll pay. I'll pay in full next month!

118
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,890
So annoying.

119
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,280
- All right. 
 - What now?

120
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,060
- Go! 
 - What?

121
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,510
Hey, Mr. Jung.

122
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,690
Even in this slime-hole, your son is studying.

123
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,950
He's going to take care of you later.

124
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,340
Stop saying nonsense. Get rid of that.

125
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,360
Here we go. You lose; it's 20,000 won.

126
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,080
Where should I put the drinks?

127
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,530
- Here. 
 - Okay.

128
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,010
Yes.

129
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,030
Here are your orders. Salad?

130
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,830
Welcome. Would you like to order...

131
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,220
I'm ordering my  ₩100,000 ($74).

132
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,290
The 100,000 won I didn't get this month.

133
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,990
Aigoo, aigoo!

134
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,560
I thought you were inside!

135
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,130
Where's my father?

136
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,900
Where's my father? He isn't in there, right?

137
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,360
No, no, Hyun Oh. The smoke...

138
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
- Wait. 
 - Hyun Oh...

139
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,490
Father!

140
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,240
- No. 
 - Wait.

141
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,760
 This is the orphanage you'll stay in until you're eighteen. 

142
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,100
Hyun Oh.

143
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,020
Are you okay?

144
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,150
No.

145
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm so sorry I couldn't be of any help.

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,770
And this place is a little far.

147
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,790
I think you'll need to switch schools.

148
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,700
Do you have everything?

149
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,240
Yes.

150
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,310
Where do you think you're going after stealing my money?

151
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,100
So everything's burnt down to the ground.

152
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,880
Yes.

153
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,120
I don't have a won.

154
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,130
Also, as far as I know,

155
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,510
if the debtor passes and I relinquish my inheritance,

156
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,530
my responsibility to pay the debt goes away.

157
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,610
Correct. That's the law.

158
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,180
Then...

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,700
- you don't need to see me anymore. 
 - Correct.

160
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,930
But we don't live by the law.

161
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,830
Your dad owes me  ₩100 million ($74, 200).

162
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,630
With that money, I could buy an apartment on the city's outskirts.

163
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,260
How can we give that up?

164
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,370
I'll get it back eventually, no matter what.

165
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,080
There's not much I can do right now.

166
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,100
I'll have to turn eighteen before I can earn real money.

167
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,500
My part-time job only pays for my allowance.

168
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,740
I heard you're going to an orphanage.

169
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,010
Don't you get kicked out when you're eighteen?

170
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,280
Even if I'll get kicked out,

171
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,330
they can be my guardian right now.

172
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,500
Your dad said your dream

173
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,800
was to become someone who shows up on TV.

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes, that's correct.

175
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,300
Then you'll need to go to college.

176
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,600
Like Seoul National University?

177
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,170
I can't go to Seoul National University,

178
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,700
but I'm trying my best.

179
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,900
When I become an adult and find a job,

180
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,030
I'll repay it all little by little.

181
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,800
I will...

182
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,410
cancel your debt.

183
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,000
Instead, I have a condition.

184
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,570
What is it?

185
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,310
Come live in my house.

186
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,790
Pardon?

187
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,850
It'll be much nicer than the orphanage.

188
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,340
If you come and live with me,

189
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,900
I'll pay your college tuition

190
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,560
and pay for academies if you'd like.

191
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,880
I'll provide everything other parents do.

192
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,430
Why?

193
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,060
Nothing is free.

194
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,900
That's right. Nothing is free.

195
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,470
If I raise you like that,

196
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,350
there is something you must do later.

197
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,970
What is that?

198
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,900
Five women, including myself, will raise you.

199
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,540
Just give back as much as you receive later.

200
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,100
"Give back"?

201
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Yes. Repay the kindness.

202
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,900
You know the magpie that brought calabash gourd seeds (Korean folktale), right?

203
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:34,850
Like that magpie, when we are old and frail, you can repay our kindness.

204
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,980
   

205
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,560
This is three.

206
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,600
Yes! I won!

207
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,310
What?

208
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,770
Is he the hostage who'll care for you ladies in your golden years?

209
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,670
Oh my, you're so adorable.

210
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,800
So naughty.

211
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,470
Don't call a boy adorable.

212
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,740
You could say "pretty boy" or "nice-looking." That would be better.

213
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,950
Why is that child so skinny?

214
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,640
He looks like he's going to faint.

215
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,810
That's not good.

216
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,400
I need to make good use of him.

217
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,750
Hey, Shin Yeong, where's the alcohol?

218
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,440
Give me more alcohol.

219
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,470
Hi!

220
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,390
Have you eaten?

221
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,800
Aigoo, you're so skinny.

222
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,550
Oh, what's your name?

223
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm Jung Hyun Oh.

224
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,840
We set up a room for you.

225
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,630
Do you want to see it?

226
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,180
- I'll take him. 
 - Okay.

227
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,930
Follow me.

228
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,790
Go.

229
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,500
Is this where I'll stay?

230
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,660
Why? We're letting you sleep and eat for free.

231
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,790
Were you expecting a palace?

232
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,390
No.

233
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Thank you.

234
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,430
By the way...

235
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,700
the Moon family isn't dead yet, right?

236
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,080
Those rats...

237
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,800
 Will they be able to repay me? 

238
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,080
Su Jeong.

239
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,020
Oppa!

240
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,240
Where's Ji On?

241
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,530
He went to look for our dad.

242
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,780
Dad hasn't been home.

243
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,930
How about you? Have you eaten?

244
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,790
No, I'm hungry.

245
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,050
Let's go inside.

246
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll make you something.

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,680
Oppa, we don't have any food in the house.

248
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,390
We skipped meals yesterday too.

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,100
Mr. Moon hasn't been home.

250
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,510
Is that so?

251
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,750
I can't get in touch with that scoundrel.

252
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,000
I was wondering if I should go take his children.

253
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,270
But they came on their own.

254
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,670
How much does Mr. Moon's family owe?

255
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,050
They've repaid almost all of it,

256
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,410
unlike you.

257
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,700
Ji On and Su Jeong are still too young.

258
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,350
At least until they can get part-time jobs...

259
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,870
What?

260
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,360
Do you want me to raise them, too? No way!

261
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,030
One is enough for us.

262
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,790
No.

263
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,500
Please just feed them three meals a day.

264
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,400
Ji On and I will make sure to pay everything back later.

265
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,140
- I promise. 
 - Do you think

266
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,110
we are running a charity here?

267
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,700
I mean...

268
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,600
taking me was a charitable act.

269
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,520
But we will repay you.

270
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,330
So it's closer to a loan arrangement.

271
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,350
It shouldn't be too difficult.

272
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,520
You're just doing what you normally do.

273
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,900
On top of that, you have hostages who will reimburse the money Mr. Moon didn't pay.

274
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,040
Doesn't it make the deal sweeter?

275
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,760
Aigoo...

276
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,520
We're off to school.

277
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,690
Grandma.

278
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,910
That's dirty.

279
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

280
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,040
Grandma.

281
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,720
Who's that noona?

282
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,160
Me?

283
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,750
I'm...

284
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,800
the noona who sells alcohol.

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,410
Get out! 
    

286
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,900
- I'm sorry. 
 - What are you doing?

287
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,980
I'm sorry. We will send in some free drinks.

288
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,230
What's wrong with you?

289
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,330
Can you stop working in the rooms? It's driving me crazy!

290
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,310
Honey, this is all just work. You need to deal with it.

291
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,400
Work or not, just hand over the drinks then leave.

292
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,460
I'll tell the guests to touch my butt instead.

293
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,300
What are you talking about?

294
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
What? What?

295
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,490
Is there a rat or something?

296
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,590
Hey, don't go in there.

297
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,220
- Honey! 
 - Stay there.

298
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,400
Shin Yeong! Call an ambulance!

299
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
Shin Yeong!

300
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,600
Hurry up! Ambulance...

301
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,360
What are you doing?

302
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,270
Run.

303
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,090
- Why would I run? 
 - If they die, you might be framed as the murderer.

304
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,430
No one knows what happened in there.

305
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,030
Hey, you know it wasn't me!

306
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,900
Who's going to prove that?

307
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,120
Do you think the police will believe you? Hey, Lee Do Hyeong!

308
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,700
You have four convictions.

309
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,740
No matter what you say, no one will believe you in this situation.

310
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,700
- Hey. 
 - Hurry.

311
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,870
Hurry and leave!

312
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,720
And don't call me again, got it?

313
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,450
Hey, Shin Yeong, this is–

314
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,140
Darn it.

315
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Hey, come eat.

316
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,700
   

317
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,060
Jung Hyun Oh, get up. Come eat.

318
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,140
Get up before I shower you with phlegm. You need to eat.

319
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,850
That's gross!

320
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,280
   

321
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,200
 Hyun Oh! 

322
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Jung Hyun Oh.

323
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,450
Hey! Announcer!

324
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,770
Will you only get up if I call you Announcer now?

325
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,030
What time is it?

326
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,660
Time to eat.

327
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,040
You reek of alcohol.

328
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,610
Have you been drinking?

329
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,160
No, I didn't drink.

330
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,400
No, Oppa. She did a lot.

331
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,680
No!

332
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,010
- No way. Hyung, she had two bottles of soju this morning– 
 - I did not.

333
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,430
- I saw you, Grandma! 
 - Out, out!

334
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,430
Aigoo.

335
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,500
 Hyun Oh! Come eat! 

336
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,360
Hey, how's the toast?

337
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,280
I went all the way to the 4-way intersection store just for you.

338
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,800
It's good.

339
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,100
Hey, if an old woman says she bought toast from far away,

340
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,610
you should get up, bow, and say, "It's delicious."

341
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,120
That's how you should act!

342
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,130
Grandma, did you go to the hospital? The doctor should have told you not to drink.

343
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,700
Is buying toast such a big deal? It's just food.

344
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,860
Hyun Oh, pick up cigarettes on your way home tonight.

345
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,470
You were going to smoke a pack a week. It hasn't been a week.

346
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,520
You annoying punk.

347
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,220
I'll just pick it up.

348
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,920
But...

349
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,550
where is Hye Ja?

350
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,130
Unnie!

351
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,360
I'm hungry.

352
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,730
What?

353
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,540
Hey.

354
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,490
Who are you?

355
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,280
Who are you?

356
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,000
Unnie, who is that?

357
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,660
Don't cry.

358
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,790
- Grandma... 
 - It's okay. 
    

359
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,360
What do we do with her room?

360
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,210
I don't know.

361
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,920
Aigoo, aigoo...

362
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,910
Let's go home.

363
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,640
What's wrong?

364
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,780
Are you worried?

365
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,150
Yes,

366
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,720
a little.

367
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:08,240
If you're that worried, get married before they all pass away.

368
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,030
That's their wish.

369
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,700
How about you, Noona? What will you do?

370
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,740
I don't know.

371
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,500
I have nothing to do.

372
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,050
Maybe I'll just be a leech.

373
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,240
What if that hyung comes back?

374
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,930
Then I'll leave.

375
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,300
I've done my work so I'll leave.

376
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,450
And the remaining responsibilities are yours.

377
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,170
Unnie, where should I put this?

378
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,320
Over there.

379
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,050
So start your own family soon.

380
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,350
That's what those grandmas wish for.

381
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,080
But Noona...

382
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,820
Yes?

383
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,980
What kind of woman would marry me?

384
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,400
 Taking care of grandmothers should be my job. 

385
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,650
It's bearable for me here, but it's torture to others.

386
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,450
I can't drag someone else in here.

387
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,020
Do you...

388
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,830
even want to get married?

389
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,480
We have a guest.

390
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,890
Okay, I'll be right there.

391
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,140
You do want it, don't you?

392
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,150
But that woman...

393
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,540
isn't someone who would fit in here?

394
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,610
 Morning, noon, seven o'clock, and the nine o'clock news. 

395
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,050
 My goal is to slay each of them, one by one. 

396
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,430
Amazing.

397
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,610
Make sure you do that, Ju Eun Ho.

398
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,050
It's cool, right?

399
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,680
Yes, very cool.

400
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,030
Also, Jung Hyun Oh,

401
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,000
look at this.

402
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,130
- This is...
 - It's the same as the one you lost, right?

403
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,950
Yes.

404
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,850
It's identical.

405
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,020
Nice, right?

406
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,120
I found it in Japan. Your mom got it in Japan, right?

407
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,040
No way. She likely got it in Namdaemun Market.

408
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,840
Look at this.

409
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,280
Look.

410
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,600
It's completely identical.

411
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
Yes!

412
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Hey. You'll never find another girlfriend like me,

413
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,240
a girlfriend who actually buys the exact thing you lost just because you said so.

414
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,120
There's no girlfriend like that in the world.

415
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,190
You're thankful, right? Super thankful, right?

416
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,950
Yes. Thank you so much.

417
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,430
Then, Jung Hyun Oh, get me something like that next time. You will, right?

418
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,040
No. Gold is so expensive.

419
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,350
What?

420
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,030
Do you think I bought it because it was cheap? Did I buy it cheap?

421
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,870
Darn you.

422
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,840
Don't laugh.

423
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,360
So are you going to wear it around your neck?

424
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,710
- No. 
 - Then where will you keep it?

425
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,410
- I don't know. 
 - What?

426
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,360
I'm going to hang it here.

427
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,940
Hey! Why would you hang that there?

428
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,430
It'll get in the way when I'm driving. Take it off.

429
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,760
No. It was so hard to get. I want to see it every day.

430
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,810
- Take it off. 
 - Darn it!

431
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,710
Hey. Don't you love me?

432
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,020
You're asking me that again.

433
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,800
Put it up. Look at it every day!

434
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,440
Give it to me! Put it up over here!

435
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,300
Please.

436
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,280
Eun Ho!

437
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,970
Ju Eun Ho!

438
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,520
Eun Ho.

439
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,980
Get sick.

440
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,300
Just like this...

441
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,590
Get sick sometimes, Eun Ho.

442
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,070
No.

443
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,290
   

444
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,230
   

445
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,410
Oppa!

446
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,430
Why did you call him up? He's busy.

447
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,900
Who called him?

448
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,060
I did! I thought you were going to die!

449
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,810
She didn't die, Su Jeong.

450
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,870
You fell down the stairs! You rolled!

451
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,550
Seriously... Do you know how scared I was?

452
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,520
I didn't die. I'm alive. Isn't that good?

453
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,140
Then don't fall down the stairs!

454
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,190
Aigoo, this girl.

455
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,800
Stop fussing. You're not even the one who got hurt.

456
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,340
Hyung, you made it.

457
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
Hey. Get lost.

458
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,900
Oh my, look at how she talks to her older brother.

459
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,130
I know. Noona, it makes me so sad.

460
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,170
Su Jeong was so cute when she was little.

461
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,740
When did she start hating my guts? Why?

462
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,700
Because you're ugly.

463
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,790
No. I'm quite good-looking, no?

464
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,690
Ji On is good-looking.

465
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,840
Grandma. What if you die?

466
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,010
What if you can't walk anymore?

467
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,560
She's basically cursing you.

468
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,100
Bones heal on their own with time.

469
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,340
Grandma, I've cracked bones a few times while working out.

470
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,700
It takes two months to heal.

471
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,100
But Grandma, maybe three months since you're a granny.

472
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,860
I told you to get lost!

473
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,600
Your legs must hurt. Sit here.

474
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,550
Have a seat.

475
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,400
   

476
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
   

477
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,070
Here you are, Team Leader Kim.

478
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,990
What is this, Press Director?

479
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,600
What? What do you mean?

480
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,310
The anchor for the 9 o'clock news.

481
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,230
- That's─ 
 - Well, as for that...

482
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,600
 The new face taking over the 9 o'clock news starting next week... 

483
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,380
   

484
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,390
 is Jeon Jae Yong. 

485
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,900
   

486
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,280
 Those scoundrels at the newsroom... I knew it. 

487
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,470
I know. They're taking care of their own.

488
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,390
 They wouldn't take someone from the Announcer Department for the 9 o'clock news. 

489
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,880
 It's appointed by the Press Director. 

490
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,740
 Why give it to an announcer? People are lined up for the job. 

491
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,530
 Hyun Oh just looks like a fool. 

492
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,800
 But Jeon Jae Yong is really not it. 

493
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,480
 Right, not at all. But what can you do? 

494
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,910
 It's already been decided, gosh. 

495
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm begging you, Press Director.

496
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,600
 I'd be so grateful if you'd reconsider, Press Director. 

497
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,020
 Same here, Team Leader Kim. 

498
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,820
I would like to, Team Leader Kim, but...

499
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,660
Hyun Oh doesn't want it.

500
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,180
Pardon?

501
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,020
Jung Hyun Oh didn't want it.

502
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,300
He said he really doesn't want to do the news.

503
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,100
That's not possible, Press Director.

504
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,920
It is possible.

505
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,840
Really.

506
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,700
You know what, Team Leader Kim?

507
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,300
Jung Hyun Oh asked me to keep Ju Eun Ho on the 12 o'clock news.

508
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,980
He came to see me privately to ask that.

509
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,200
 What? 

510
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,200
 Please leave Ju Eun Ho alone, Press Director. 

511
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,480
 I must have been praising you too much. 

512
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,500
 You're really crossing the line here. 

513
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,480
 What use is putting Shim Jin Hwa, whom you adore, on that small 12 o'clock news? 

514
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,630
 The 9 o'clock news would be better. 

515
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,840
 Right. There's the 9 o'clock news. 

516
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,000
 Yes, Press Director. 

517
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,510
 Put Shim Jin Hwa on the 9 o'clock news. 

518
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,860
 I'll make it work. 

519
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,520
 Not possible. 

520
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,580
 Think about it. I'm the Press Director. 

521
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,610
 Reporters are lining up for the 9 o'clock news. 

522
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,700
 I can't fill both the male and female slots with announcers. 

523
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,530
 Not possible. What about my people? 

524
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,720
 What? 

525
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,620
 Do you want to drop out? 

526
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,810
 If you give up the 9 o'clock news, I'll secure Ju Eun Ho's spot. 

527
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,920
 But you're not going to do that, right? 

528
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,000
 So... Just fire Ju Eun Ho from the 12 o'clock─ 

529
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 I'll drop out. 

530
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,460
 What? 

531
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,430
 I'll drop out. 

532
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,390
 So please let Eun Ho 

533
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,390
 continue on the 12 o'clock news, Press Director. 

534
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,070
Darn it!

535
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,800
Excuse me, Sunbae.

536
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,400
Did something happen that I don't know about?

537
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,920
You know Hyun Oh didn't get the 9 o'clock news, right?

538
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,320
Right, I know.

539
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,880
It's not that he didn't get it.

540
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,640
He gave up the 9 o'clock news for you!

541
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,470
W-Wh...

542
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,700
- Wh-What did you say? 
 - That punk met the Press Director privately

543
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,560
and traded your 12 o'clock spot for his 9 o'clock!

544
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,980
Gosh, darn it!

545
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,740
That imbecile!

546
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,890
How can he give up the 9 o'clock news?

547
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,920
Where did you go?

548
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,300
- Kim Mi Yeon, knock before you— 
 - I heard you gave up the 9 o'clock news.

549
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,570
Oh. I didn't give it up, I just didn't make it.

550
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,050
Not true, I heard you gave it up so I could keep the 12 o'clock news.

551
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,770
Do you maybe owe me something?

552
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,290
No. It's not that—

553
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,730
Did you take out a loan in my name? Do I need to repay it?

554
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,730
Is it because you feel guilty about it?

555
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,370
- It's not like that. 
 - How much is it?

556
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,710
I'll pay it.

557
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,010
So stop this crap and take the 9 o'clock news, please.

558
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,830
I told you. It's not like that.

559
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,970
Then what?

560
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,270
Do you still pity me?

561
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,220
Am I still that pitiable to you?

562
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,960
Am I so pitiable that you gave it up to say "Take this, you pitiful little thing"?

563
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,500
Trading the 9 o'clock news for the 12 o'clock news?

564
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,240
Hey.

565
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,810
How generous of you! (sarcasm)

566
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,980
No matter how bad you feel for your ex-girlfriend,

567
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,200
how can you give up what you've wanted all your life so easily?

568
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,830
Jung Hyun Oh, you don't need to do that for me.

569
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,670
Just live the life you want.

570
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,800
- Eun Ho. 
 - I...

571
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,500
know that I embarrassed you as a girlfriend.

572
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,570
But there's one thing I worked hard at while I was with you.

573
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,270
It wasn't anything special.

574
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:49,440
I couldn't be of any help for your bright future,

575
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,580
but I tried not to be an obstacle.

576
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,180
- Listen to me. 
 - Just that one thing.

577
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,580
I worked so hard at that one thing, but it was so difficult.

578
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,190
As you know, I'm way below average, no matter how hard I work.

579
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,290
I was always an obstacle to you, but I worked really hard not to.

580
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,590
So you...

581
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,000
You can't do this to me.

582
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,950
So don't be generous to me. Take what's yours. Got it?

583
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,870
- Ju Eun Ho. 
 - You shouldn't be generous to your ex.

584
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,100
Be vengeful,

585
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,520
the revenge of having a better life.

586
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,790
 Tell me, Jung Hyun Oh. 

587
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,410
 Why are you with me? 

588
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,480
 That question again. 

589
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,090
 Hey, I'm not curious, but people keep asking me. 

590
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,450
 "Hey. Why is Jung Hyun Oh with you?" 

591
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,340
 "Why does Jung Hyun Oh have to date you? A dummy like you?" 

592
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,100
 Gosh... "Why"? "Have to"? 

593
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,630
 "A dummy"? Really? 

594
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,180
 Want me to get you a cab? 

595
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,260
 But they keep asking. 

596
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,000
 So I became curious. 

597
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,150
 I mean, why is he actually  with me? 

598
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,400
 A dummy like me? 

599
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,710
 You should go. 

600
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,610
 Answer me, Jung Hyun Oh. 

601
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,530
 - Why are you dating me? Answer me. Hey! 
 - Taxi! 

602
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,910
 Answer me! 

603
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,150
 - Driver. 
 - Answer me. 

604
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,630
 - Sejongdong, please. 
 - Answer me! 

605
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,330
 Watch your head! 

606
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,010
 Hey! 

607
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,410
 - Hey! 
 - Bye. 

608
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,390
 - Why are you dating me? 
 - Go. 

609
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,040
 Jung Hyun Oh! 

610
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,960
 Bye! 

611
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,960
   

612
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,990
   

613
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,140
 Because I love you. 

614
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,680
   

615
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,840
 Because I do love you. 

616
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,110
Yes, Reporter. Of course.

617
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,570
But we don't know, either.

618
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,260
Ju Yeon, Hye Yeon, no one is at work yet.

619
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,840
Yes.

620
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,060
I know. You don't come to work to date.

621
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,050
I don't police that kind of thing one by one.

622
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,690
Of course, yes, yes.

623
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:21,910
Got it. I'll ask myself when they're in. Bye.

624
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,520
Hey, Baek Hye Yeon.

625
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,400
Yes, Department Head?

626
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,020
Did something happen?

627
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,370
   

628
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,660
Did you just see this?

629
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,020
Department Head, do they still print this stuff?

630
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,030
They do, Hye Yeon. But that's not the issue here.

631
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,830
Department Head, shouldn't we report them for invasion of privacy?

632
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,340
Report what?

633
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,440
Tell me now. Are you dating Kang Ju Yeon or not?

634
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,280
Of course not.

635
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,470
Then what is this? Why were you and Kang Ju Yeon

636
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,590
photographed going into a hotel suite together?

637
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,900
I got a room on my own that night.

638
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,230
Why?

639
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,130
Is that the issue here?

640
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:10,550
First of all, Sunbae and I had a drink only.

641
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,380
Actually, I was with Choi Soo Hyeon.

642
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,200
Why wasn't he photographed?

643
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,500
What? Hye Yeon!

644
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,990
Choi Soo H-Hyeon?

645
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,730
Okay, fine.

646
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,750
Fine, Hye Yeon.

647
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,470
Let's first release an apology. Now public opinion isn't great...

648
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,360
Department Head, what's wrong with me having a drink with Sunbae?

649
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,220
Why would I apologize? Why isn't the public opinion great?

650
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,240
Oh my, I actually don't understand.

651
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,300
Hye Yeon, you were photographed in front of a hotel room.

652
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,700
Hye Yeon, has Night 7 contacted you?

653
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,900
The Director of the Announcer Department hasn't said anything?

654
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,800
No, no one's called me.

655
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,090
What does this have to do with the news-

656
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,460
What?

657
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,980
   

658
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,680
What do I do?

659
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,630
We've discussed this with the newsroom.

660
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,000
Resign from the news immediately and write an apology.

661
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,700
Director.

662
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,540
I was just having a drink, a drink.

663
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,860
Is it illegal to have a drink after work?

664
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,840
Do you understand how promiscuous you look right now?

665
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,040
- "Promiscuous"? 
 - Hey.

666
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,490
Everyone is in an uproar. Don't you go online?

667
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,900
Hey, Ju Yeon.

668
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,450
Did you see?

669
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:50,590
The internet is crazy right now! The office is, too!

670
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,450
Yes, I saw.

671
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,070
So? What happened?

672
00:51:55,070 --> 00:52:00,630
I went to Hye Yeon's room to have a drink and someone took a photo.

673
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,990
Right?

674
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,630
So did you tell the reporters that?

675
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,560
Yes. I did, but no one is writing a followup.

676
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,360
- Really? 
 - Of course not.

677
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,140
That's not what excites them.

678
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,440
My phone is blowing up.

679
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,270
My phone is blowing up even after I got to work.

680
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,170
All the ringing... I think I'll start hearing voices.

681
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,140
   

682
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,150
   

683
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,980
   

684
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,990
   
   

685
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,730
   
   

686
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,450
   

687
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,310
Hye Yeon.

688
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,130
I'm sorry, Hye Yeon.

689
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,000
I should have been more careful.

690
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,220
No, Sunbae.

691
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,800
- What? 
 - Handkerchief.

692
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,500
I knew you'd carry this kind of thing around.

693
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,880
Kleenex messes up my makeup.

694
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,000
I'll get you a new one.

695
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,380
Sunbae, you know...

696
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,580
You know what really angers me?

697
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,680
This.

698
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,400
   

699
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,270
Look at my face here.

700
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,140
It's such a bad photo, right?

701
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,180
Is that... why you're crying?

702
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,100
I mean, it's an awful photo of me!

703
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,070
Sunbae, what do I do?

704
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,080
Are you okay not working on the news?

705
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,710
Of course, I'm not okay.

706
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,690
But what can I do? They told me to drop out.

707
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,600
But Sunbae.

708
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,360
The thing I don't understand,

709
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,230
why does everyone want me to apologize?

710
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,900
Whom do I owe an apology to for walking down a hotel hallway with a guy?

711
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:07,900
Shouldn't the reporter, who took a private photo of me as a paparazzi, apologize to me?

712
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,720
When did the public have the right to know my private life?

713
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,300
Fine. Let's say they do.

714
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,100
But what did I do wrong here?

715
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,060
   

716
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,650
   

717
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,080
   

718
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,920
   

719
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,390
 [I wanted a bigger room so I paid for my own,  not sponsored! 

720
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,420
   

721
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,270
 Unlike my clean, demure, innocent, and wholesome image, 

722
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:50,870
 I disappointed you by meeting with a man in a hotel room. 

723
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,890
 I am so sorry. 

724
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:59,330
 I will never go to a hotel where a reporter is spying in the hallway 

725
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:03,630
   

726
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,720
   

727
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,900
Aigoo, Hye Yeon...

728
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:36,320
What happened? Did you get fired?

729
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,490
Oh, yes. I did.

730
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,770
You should have controlled yourself.

731
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:48,320
Is it so bad that I walked down a hotel hallway with a male sunbae because I wanted a drink?

732
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,470
You're right. It's not bad.

733
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,420
But by the way,

734
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,610
you didn't say that you booked a suite because I kicked you out.

735
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,720
- You could have. 
 - Why would I?

736
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,210
Your image would be even worse than it is now.

737
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,560
I really dislike you, Baek Hye Yeon.

738
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:30,240
No need to tell me. You were very clear during the last special.

739
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,790
Still, I feel bad for you...

740
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,050
that you might end up like me.

741
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,450
Are you saying that I'll get cut from Night 7 someday?

742
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:48,270
Are you cursing me that I'll get old and be pushed out by younger people?

743
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,740
I already got fired from Night 7.

744
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,770
It's not a curse.

745
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,710
It's just something that happens often.

746
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,610
But...

747
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,270
I'm sorry.

748
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,500
I was very rude.

749
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,700
I have such a short temper.

750
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:33,260
No, thanks. I already put it behind me.

751
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,760
Sure.

752
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,480
- So we're cool. 
 - No, we're not.

753
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,170
I'll bring it up every time I see you.

754
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,820
Also, Sunbae...

755
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:52,520
I'm so fed up here because I had to write a crappy apology.

756
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,200
When I was on the 9 o'clock news,

757
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,850
I once posted my child's favorite song on social media during election season and had to apologize.

758
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:11,810
What did a song about children's hopes and dreams do?

759
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:16,510
One of the parties had used it as a campaign song.

760
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:26,000
People who do the news must maintain political neutrality.

761
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,050
But a hotel?

762
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,780
In the middle of the night? With a man?

763
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,570
Hey.

764
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,050
How will people focus on the news if they're bothered by your private life?

765
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,080
Right.

766
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,470
Your apology...

767
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,610
is meant for people who watch Night 7.

768
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,950
You sounded like a legendary crazy witch in your apology.

769
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,600
Rewrite it.

770
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,640
What was that?

771
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,400
Was it that bad?

772
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,280
Hye Ri.

773
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,100
You still haven't seen her?

774
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,800
She didn't come in today, either.

775
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,690
I see.

776
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,150
Got it.

777
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,540
Hye Ri.

778
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,160
Hello.

779
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,400
Kang Ju Yeon.

780
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:39,580


781
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:45,510
   

782
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,240
 Hello. 

783
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,860
 I'm Announcer Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul. 

784
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,680
 I didn't get to say hello earlier. 

785
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,900
 Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho from PPS. 

786
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,200
 Yes. Nice to meet you. 

787
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,560
Nice to meet you.

788
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,900
 E-Exc... 

789
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,350
 E-Excuse me.
