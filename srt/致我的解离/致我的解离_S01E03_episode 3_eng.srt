1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,770
   

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,300
   

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,610
   

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,930
   

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,270
   

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:29,930


7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,980
   

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,090
   

9
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,290
Hyun Oh, why aren't you coming out?

10
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,680
I'll go a little later.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
No. We need to take out the dishes for the ancestral ritual.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,390
You're the only one who can carry them. Come on out.

13
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,140
What's Cho Rong doing?

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,070
That little one can't carry that. You need to.

15
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,210
By the way, did you take Grandma Yeong Ja to the hospital?

16
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,880
I did. Why?

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,670
How about Grandma Shin Ja's medicine?

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,770
I gave her the medicine.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,820
Did you schedule Grandma Choon Ja's lung CT scan?

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,220
 I'll do it! Stop nagging me! 

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,760
 Find the dishes. 

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,470
Place the fish to the east and meat to the west.

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,790
Hey. The alcohol is for the ritual. You can't drink all of it.

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,020
Gosh, this woman.

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,590
So good.

26
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm over 70 years old and still sitting here flipping pancakes. How does that make sense?

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,480
Where's Cho Rong?

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,730
What about Su Jeong and Ji On?

29
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,480
They're all busy working.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,700
It's only right that we do it since we don't work.

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,860
Let's all be quiet and get ready.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,270
Hyun Oh is tired.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,380
Grandma, can I put them here?

34
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes. There.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,710
Hyun Oh, can you get the folding screen too?

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,980
- Okay. 
 - Still...

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,750
thanks to Unnie Hye Ja, it feels like a party. It's nice, isn't it?

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,830
"Nice"?

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,020
So Cho Rong really can't come?

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,500
She's running late.

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,490
Are Moon Ji On and Moon Su Jeong pulling all-nighters, too?

42
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,050
Ji On has a broadcast. Su Jeong is filming.

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,260
Aigoo. What's the point of feeding them?

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,300
I do all the work by myself.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,840
   

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,430
Gross.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,010
Unnie, we could make porridge out of your phlegm.

48
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,890
All right, try it then.

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,810
No, thanks.

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,150
   

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,310
Hey, the ancestral ritual is over. Go home. Even if you come—

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,520
 Oppa, I'm doing backup for Kim Mi Yeon and Ju Eun Ho right now. 

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,700
But there's a problem.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,050
Then call Kim Mi Yeon, who is in charge.

55
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,380
Ju Eun Ho is locked inside the freezer truck.

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,170
 I saw Ju Eun Ho's texts to Kim Mi Yeon. 

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,560
 I think Ju Eun Ho is stuck inside the freezer truck, and a dead body is inside, 

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,320
 but... Kim Mi Yeon is drunk and passed out. 

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,400
What are you doing?

60
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,150
Aren't you cold?

61
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,920
I can't hold back if I'm curious about something.

62
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,730
So let me ask you one thing.

63
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,350
Go ahead.

64
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,380
I contacted Kim Mi Yeon.

65
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,930
I know.

66
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,190
But how did you come?

67
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,100
Mi Yeon is passed out drunk. I barely managed to contact Chan Woo.

68
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,210
Then you could have sent Chan Woo alone.

69
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,910
Why did you come?

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,540
I couldn't send Chan Woo alone when there's a dead body.

71
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,800
But listen, Jung Hyun Oh.

72
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,180
What?

73
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
Next time, don't come.

74
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,760
No matter what happens to me,

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,750
even if I'm about to die,

76
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,700
don't come.

77
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,050
Got it? I'm leaving.

78
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,570
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

79
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,510
You know...

80
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,810
I'm ashamed of you.

81
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,400
What?

82
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,920
   

83
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,820
   

84
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,870
 That's love. 

85
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,420
This is?

86
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,700
Yes. If you think about it,

87
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,130
this man... volunteered to be "Daddy Long Legs" (benefactor) to his ex-girlfriend.

88
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,570
What is that, if not love?

89
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,000
No! I think that's just obsession.

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,870
The woman didn't want it. That's obsession.

91
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,160
Sunbae, what do you think? Do you think this is love?

92
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,460
We need to decide before airing this. It could be controversial.

93
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,850
- I think... 
 - It's love, of course.

94
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,590
- What? 
 - You're also like him, Deputy Jung.

95
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,840
"Daddy Long Legs" (2005 movie).

96
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,000
- Me? 
 - You know. You tidy your ex-girlfriend's mess.

97
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,490
You take care of her.

98
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,630
I see. Do I?

99
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,510
I mean, since your heart is as generous and wide as the ocean.

100
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,380
Ocean or whatever, this is an obsession! Sunbae, what do we do?

101
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,380
What should we do?

102
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,150
Hey.

103
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,710
It's fine outside of work, but can you talk back to me less at work?

104
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,700
I mean, I wasn't entirely wrong.

105
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,100
How were you right?

106
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,700
You're Ju Eun Ho's "Daddy Long Legs." It's true.

107
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,020
We broke up four years ago. That's just facts.

108
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,130
But you still go around looking after her. Am I wrong?

109
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,670
You called me urgently so I went. How is that looking after her?

110
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,210
That's because Kim Mi Yeon—

111
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,300
The producer shouldn't have been drinking.

112
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,280
She got an earful from the higher-ups.

113
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,800
Whatever.

114
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,480
Oppa, I think... you still love that woman.

115
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,420
No.

116
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,480
Su Jeong, you're still a baby. You don't know love.

117
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,990
You've never been in a relationship. How would you know?

118
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,350
I've read books! Books!

119
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,680
What you do for Ju Eun Ho is love.

120
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,240
You broke up, but you can't stop thinking about her.

121
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,820
I'm telling you. She's going to run away.

122
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,990
You know one of the grandmas hurt her knee, right?

123
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,190
"Hurt"? Who?

124
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,610
Grandma Choon Ja. I'm right, aren't I?

125
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,320
So annoying! Why are you there?

126
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,240
Don't talk to your oppa like that.

127
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,790
How hurt is she?

128
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,130
She was fine yesterday. When did it happen?

129
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,240
I don't know.

130
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,310
I ran into her at the hospital...

131
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,620
Oppa, wait! No.

132
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,440
She begged me not to tell you. Please?

133
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,840
If you call her right now, it'll be so obvious she tattled. Don't do it.

134
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,690
You keep walking. Why isn't she answering?

135
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,790
- Oppa, please! 
 - Call me "Oppa." I'm your actual older brother!

136
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,160
You just get lost!

137
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,230
Sure, sure. I'll just get lost.

138
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,860
Why isn't she picking up the phone?

139
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,660
Oppa, just don't tell her you heard from me.

140
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,580
Why were you at the hospital anyway?

141
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,790
Because of my wrist.

142
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,740
Typing hurts my wrists sometimes.

143
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,890
Are you listening to me? Don't tell Grandma—

144
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,550
It's fine.

145
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,910
Is it carpal tunnel syndrome?

146
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,900
Twist it this way, a little more.

147
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,370
That's right.

148
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,120
Bye now.

149
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,890
What?

150
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,890
Hello? Grandma! It's me.

151
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,050
Why weren't you picking up your phone?

152
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,690
   

153
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,140
Hello.

154
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,640
Hello.

155
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,700
Stay seated. It's okay.

156
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm back, everyone!

157
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,170
Hyungnim.

158
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,020
I'm back!

159
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,670
Jeon Jae Yong is back!

160
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,570
 What? 

161
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,710
Do I need medicine?

162
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,230
I'm hallucinating.

163
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,390
Hyungnim!

164
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,350
Open the door! The press director assigned me to work under you.

165
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm hearing voices too.

166
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,820
 Hyungnim! Open the door! 

167
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,700
 I have so much to tell you! Hyungnim! 

168
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,970
 Let's have some soju! Hyungnim! 

169
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,610
Hyungnim, I can see everything!

170
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,250
 Let's grab soju. I have too much to say. Hyungnim! 

171
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,340
- Sunbae. 
 - Yes, Hye Yeon.

172
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,110
You know your co-host for the weekend 8 o'clock news?

173
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,370
Yes. Reporter Yoon Ji Yoon.

174
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,150
What do you think of her?

175
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,290
Is she pretty? Is she? Pretty?

176
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,380
I don't know. Is she?

177
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,790
I don't know about that.

178
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,630
How about me? What do you think?

179
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,090
Am I pretty? Am I? Pretty?

180
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,800
Yes. You are pretty.

181
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,120
- What did you say, Hye Yeon? 
 - Department Head!

182
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,220
I think Kang Ju Yeon is seeing someone.

183
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,920
What about it? What's wrong with that?

184
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,800
What do you mean, Department Head?

185
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,110
What do you mean by "What's wrong with that"?

186
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,160
It's not me. That's why it's wrong.

187
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
By chance, does anyone come to your mind?

188
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,290
I'm digging but haven't found anything. How about you?

189
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,230
- No. No one. 
 - Then who is it?

190
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,160
She can't be prettier than me.

191
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,770
Is it Yoon Ji Yoon?

192
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,110
Reporter Yoon Ji Yoon has been married for quite a while.

193
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,010
Really?

194
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,900
But Hye Yeon, why do you think that?

195
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,680
- Kang Ju Yeon told me... 
 - Yes?

196
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,090
- told me... 
 - Yes?

197
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,290
I was pretty.

198
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,640
That's a compliment.

199
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,130
That's why it's a problem, Department Head.

200
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,320
Kang Ju Yeon doesn't get angry but also doesn't give compliments. Why?

201
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,110
He's not interested in other people.

202
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,270
I mean, he did get angry at me recently.

203
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,560
It was nice. But now he gives me a compliment?

204
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Then it's not nice anymore.

205
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,920
Because it's too strange.

206
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,410
There's no doubt.

207
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,920
Really, there's no doubt.

208
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,560
About what?

209
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,470
Oppa, Kang Ju Yeon is seeing someone.

210
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,180
What? Him?

211
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,860
He... he is?

212
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,740
We need to stop it before it goes further.

213
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,870
But how can I make sure?

214
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,900
Want me to ask?

215
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,400
- Can you ask him, Oppa? 
 - Sure.

216
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,770
Like a snake crawling over a wall: natural and subtle.

217
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,800
Okay. Like a snake crawling over a wall: natural and subtle.

218
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Like a snake crawling over a wall. Natural...

219
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,030
It's already unnatural.

220
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,000
Hey, Kang Ju Yeon!

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,920
Do you have a girlfriend or something?

222
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,670
What?

223
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,620
Someone was curious... No, no, stop.

224
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,140
Anyway, do you have a girlfriend?

225
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,460
A girlfriend? Girlfriend?

226
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,340
Sunbaenim, have you been drinking?

227
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,310
Oppa,

228
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,040
is that a new shirt?

229
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,500
No, I've always had this. Why?

230
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,000
What happened to the one your girlfriend gave you?

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,120
Oh, that...

232
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
I wore it yesterday.

233
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
(Excuse me, ask him. Now.)

234
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,210
Ju Yeon, that's a new shirt, right?

235
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,370
Oh, yes. How did you know?

236
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,340
What?

237
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,150
Is that actually a new shirt?

238
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,400
Really?

239
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
Then wh-what did you do with the one your girlfriend got you?

240
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,820
What?

241
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,250
What did my girlfriend get me?

242
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
Your girlfriend... What did she get?

243
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Hey, Sunbaenim.

244
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,150
You can't drink at work.

245
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,100
I should get going.

246
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,860
Sunbae, bye.

247
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,700
Oppa! Seriously!

248
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,060
 Korean-Chinese A is still missing after he went missing on a fishing boat 

249
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,740
 alongside the Incheon West Sea shoreline. 

250
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,050
Let me ring your total.

251
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,020
Here you go.

252
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,150
Good night.

253
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,630
 Can I drink this water? 

254
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,990
 It smells so good. 

255
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,640
 Is that so? 

256
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,670
 This room too. 

257
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,840
 I see. 

258
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,660
 What kind of fabric softener do you use? 

259
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,590
 - "Fabric softener"? 
 - Where did you buy the blanket from? 

260
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,920
 - The blanket— 
 - I have a lot of questions. 

261
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,640
 Can I keep asking them? 

262
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,220
 What do you want to know? 

263
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,530
 Your eyes... 

264
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,930
 How were your eyes made? 

265
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,180
 I had an older brother. 

266
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,090
 All right, you two. Look this way. 

267
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,130
 We have ten seconds! 

268
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,960
 Ten seconds, ten seconds. 

269
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,440
 My brother... 

270
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,100
 was like the father I never had. 
   

271
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,680
 He was like a daughter to my mother. 

272
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,000
 I should get going. 

273
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,460
 - Se Yeon, watch out for traffic. 
 - Yes, Sir! 

274
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,930
 I'm off. Take care of Mom. 

275
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,660
 I'll call you. 

276
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,640
 That was the last time I saw him. 

277
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,070
 He went out of the way to come to my ceremony 

278
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,040
 and got into an accident on his way back. 

279
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,120
 This is because of you. 

280
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,250
 If Se Yeon... hadn't come to see you, 

281
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,870
 this wouldn't have happened to him. 

282
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,910
 If you... 

283
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,200
 hadn't told him to come to your ceremony... 

284
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,340
 Se Yeon... 

285
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,290
 Se Yeon... 

286
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,070
 Se Yeon... Se Yeon... 

287
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,060
 Se Yeon... 

288
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,740
 He fell into a vegetative state. 

289
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,380
   

290
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,210
 You see that kind of thing in movies. 

291
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,210
 When the older brother dies, 

292
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,600
 the younger brother makes his dreams come true. 

293
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,970
 Yes. 

294
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,930
 Watching those, I thought... 

295
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,210
 Thought what? 

296
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,910
 What's the point of making 

297
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,640
 a dead person's dreams come true? 

298
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,870
   

299
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,870
 So pretty. 

300
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,850
 So pretty... 

301
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,670
 But... 

302
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,510
 after he died, that was what I thought. 
   

303
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,110
   

304
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,310
 Let's become an announcer. 

305
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,530
 Salute! 

306
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,210
 Salute. 

307
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,030
 This is my discharge application. 

308
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,910
 What did you just say? 

309
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,790
   

310
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,470
 "Discharge"? 

311
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,060
 Hyung would like it. 

312
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,210
 At the appeals trial of Assemblyman Jo Han Jong, who was indicted for receiving millions in donations, 

313
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,590
 the court sentenced him to seven years, higher than the original verdict. 

314
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,590
 Hyung would be happy. 

315
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,560
 So... 

316
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,010
 did your hyung become happy? 

317
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,760
 As for that... 

318
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,720
 I don't know. 

319
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,200
 Your hyung... 

320
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,140
 Are you sleepy? 

321
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,990
 Yes. 

322
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,370
 Your hyung... 

323
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,130
 became happy. 

324
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,710
 But... 

325
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,960
 are you happy? 

326
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,370
 Are you... 

327
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,380
 happy... 

328
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,150
 living like this? 

329
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,430
Hello, Ju Yeon.

330
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,900
You know, the night you slept over at my place...

331
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,100
Yes, Ju Yeon.

332
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,770
You were gone in the morning.

333
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,520
I don't remember that.

334
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,760
What?

335
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,480
When I woke up, I was home.

336
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,020
Do you know how to teleport yourself?

337
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,940
Is that a joke?

338
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,500
Next time, I'd like to wake up together.

339
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,200
Omo. It's kind of romantic.

340
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,640
Do you have a phone?

341
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,110
Unfortunately, I get no joy out of the selfishness of civilization.

342
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,500
But, Ju Yeon,

343
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,940
how did you know I work here?

344
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,430
You wrote in your letter.

345
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,720
No, you came to see me before that.

346
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,310
Well...

347
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,580
I knew your face.

348
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,430
Oh. Since when?

349
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,070
Since I first saw you at the parking lot office.

350
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,920
I knew it. I'm way too pretty.

351
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,210
No.

352
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,190
You were working with your bangs covering your face.

353
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,210
It was unique.

354
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,650
And...

355
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,890
when I stopped by, you would hide.

356
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,110
That was also unique.

357
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,240
Did you know I was hiding?

358
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,370
Yes.

359
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,960
I saw you hide. How could I not know?

360
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,000
Then did you know I saved a spot for you in the parking lot?

361
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,030
I knew about that too.

362
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,910
You're so cruel.

363
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,720
I thought you were cute.

364
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,320
Is that why you have a crush on me?

365
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,130
It's not so much a crush.

366
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,600
It's more like the things I did with you were all new to me.

367
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,210
I think that's why I keep thinking of you.

368
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,830
Isn't that the same thing as a crush?

369
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,400
No.

370
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,500
I keep thinking of you since it's all new to me.

371
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,180
Why do you keep referring to me as "you"?

372
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,600
I keep thinking of Ju Hye Ri.

373
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,440
I get hurt when someone calls me by my full name.

374
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,860
You, Hye Ri.

375
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,460
It's almost time for my broadcast.

376
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,840
Okay.

377
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,500
Oh, yes...

378
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,810
I'll come pick you up after work.

379
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,230
Wait for me.

380
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,780
Okay. Bye.

381
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,060
Bye.

382
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,470
What? Isn't that Ju Eun Ho?

383
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,520
J-Ju Eun Ho?

384
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,990
Is it not?

385
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,250
 What? 
   

386
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,470
 He smiled? 

387
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,230
 Yes. He smiled. 

388
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,950
- At who? 
 - It was at the restaurant.

389
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,260
At some girl.

390
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,040
It was strange. Ju Yeon doesn't smile much, you know?

391
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,310
So who was the girl?

392
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,540
Well, I don't really know her.

393
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,430
Is it someone you don't know?

394
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,490
No, I've seen her before, but...

395
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,750
I feel I've definitely seen her before. It's driving me crazy.

396
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,220
You're saying you don't know her, but you've seen her before, right?

397
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,970
I've seen her somewhere before,

398
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,220
but it's not someone I don't know, you know?

399
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,910
 You make it sound so complex. Are you really an announcer? 

400
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,130
What?

401
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,580
It's her.

402
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:23,120
Yes, it was that woman! Kang Ju Yeon smiled at her!

403
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,710
I see! She works there!

404
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,730
That's why I've seen her, even though I don't know her.

405
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,050
 Wow, I'm getting goosebumps all over. 

406
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,300
How did Kang Ju Yeon get to know her?

407
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,390
 I never imagined she would work there. 

408
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,620
 Look, look! He's smiling! Right? 

409
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,820
 I'm totally right. Do you see? 

410
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,850
 He is really smiling. 

411
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,180
This is so strange.

412
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,910
"Through official statements, the Jano Party—"

413
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,620
"Through official statements, the Jano Party announced"

414
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,550
"that the events related to the French diplomat's state dinner invitation"

415
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,410
"were a diplomatic discourtesy."

416
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,670
"Diplomatic discourtesy."

417
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,910
"Discourtesy."

418
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,600
- That word was difficult for me, too. 
 - Oh, my gosh.

419
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,610
Are you serious? This whole time—

420
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,230
Sunbaenim, please get lost.

421
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,480
We are preparing to broadcast here.

422
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,520
No, I have a question for Ju Eun Ho.

423
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,820
Hey, Ju Eun Ho, listen—

424
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,560
Everyone's getting prepared so early.

425
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,300
Press Director, it's good to see you here.

426
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,570
Yes.

427
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,860
Everything is fine, isn't it?

428
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,650
I just stopped by to cheer on my hoobaes.

429
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,200
Fighting!

430
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,830
I'll get lost now.

431
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,970
 Diplomatic dis-curtsy, discourtesy! 

432
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,240
No, no, no.

433
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
There's no need to get up.

434
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,310
I just stopped by. I got tired of sitting in the back room like an old man.

435
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,060
But…

436
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,020
don't you two do something together on the weekends?

437
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,800
"Cine Talk Talk" on the weekends.

438
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,650
That's right, "Cine Talk Talk."

439
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,130
It's good! I try to catch it.

440
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,960
Thank you.

441
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,570
Υou…

442
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,700
I'm Ju Eun Ho.

443
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,720
- Which year group? 
 - Group 28.

444
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,980
The group who selected only one woman.

445
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,090
Yes, Director.

446
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,640
If you are a member of that group…

447
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,960
you should be a deputy by now. So you're quite old.

448
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,200
- Pardon? 
 - What?

449
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,960
She must be over 40 years old. Right?

450
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,570
 You know Shim Jin Hwa from Group 35, don't you? 

451
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,950
Yes. I do.

452
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,400
Press Director Soh must be into her these days.

453
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,450
They are very close. He takes her with him to introduce her to people.

454
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,740
He keeps talking about the noon news.

455
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,470
He wants to replace Eun Ho with Shim Jin Hwa.

456
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,980
Shim Jin Hwa. On weekends, this girl shares a program with Ji On.

457
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,580
He says they look great together, and they're pleasant to look at.

458
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,670
He wants to replace them.

459
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,350
I said, "Is that really necessary?"

460
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,550
He says if I don't do it, he will replace her with his own reporter.

461
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,500
For me, it doesn't matter if it's Jin Hwa or Eun Ho,

462
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,180
as long as it's one of my youngsters.

463
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,190
I just feel bad for Eun Ho.

464
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,160
The newsroom…

465
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,670
is probably waiting for something to take her down.

466
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,900
Gosh… I'm leaving.

467
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,060
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh. Are you still dating Ju Eun Ho?

468
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,820
I have a question about her.

469
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,800
We broke up four years ago.

470
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,210
Could you please leave?

471
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,810
 - Through official statements…  
 - Okay.

472
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,700
Hyungnim! You thought I didn't see you, right?

473
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,500
 That the events related to the French diplomat's state dinner invitation were a diplomatic discourtesy, 

474
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,070
 and criticized it as a display of extreme incompetence. 

475
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,010
 Jano Party spokesperson said our administration's stance… 

476
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,210
You said "curtsy"!

477
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,820
- Pardon? 
 - You said that on the news.

478
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,740
Diplomatic "dis-curtsy."

479
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,730
You said "dis-curtsy," not "discourtesy."

480
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,130
No, Press Director. I never did that.

481
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,000
Are you saying I'm wrong?

482
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,100
No. I really did not do that, Press Director.

483
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,450
Didn't you read the viewer message boards?

484
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,410
People are going crazy!

485
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,290
Yes, I heard you said that. Thus, I checked the message boards.

486
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,180
- I couldn't find anything— 
 - There was something.

487
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,370
There was one.

488
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,330
Did you not see it?

489
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,810
Well, I…

490
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,730
If you were the only girl in a group,

491
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,190
you should be young, pretty, or exceptional.

492
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,890
You have no foundation or talent.

493
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,970
Excuse me, Press Director, what you just said…

494
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,380
What? Get out.

495
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,920
You're annoying me!

496
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,970
Come in.

497
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,350
What are you doing? Get out.

498
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,840
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh.

499
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,500
Come in, come in.

500
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,080
Have a seat over here.

501
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,790
You don't have anything going on today. Do you?

502
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,980
 No. 

503
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,800
 Look at you, Handsome. 

504
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,320
 What would happen to our broadcast without you? 

505
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,600
 It's all thanks to you, Press Director. 

506
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,500
 No, no, not at all. We got two more ads for "Current News at Ten." 

507
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,250
Hyungnim! Wait for me.

508
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,970
Wait for me.

509
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,640
Are you going to eat?

510
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,710
Go to your newsroom.

511
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,280
Why do I feel you've been in the announcer's department all day?

512
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,500
Hyungnim, I have a question,

513
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,430
but it's so absurd I don't know if I'm right or wrong.

514
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,200
I'm a little confused.

515
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,250
So Hyungnim, you know Ju Eun Ho well, don't you?

516
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,150
You went to the same college.

517
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,700
What about Ju Eun Ho? What, what?

518
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,740
Hyungnim, I park my car at the Media N Seoul parking lot,

519
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,940
and I saw a woman who looked just like Ju Eun Ho.

520
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,840
Is Jun Eun Ho a twin?

521
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,750
She's not a twin.

522
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,730
Sisters look alike, you know.

523
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,170
That's right!

524
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,040
Hyungnim, so I was wondering… can you buy me a drink?

525
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,320
It's my homecoming.

526
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,490
Your homecoming? You were demoted and barely made it back to Seoul.

527
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,700
Forget that.

528
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,540
Jae Yong…

529
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,080
Hyungnim.

530
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,660
Did you just say my name?

531
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,590
Oh, my gosh.

532
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,560
That's a first.

533
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,370
Our company's parking lot is huge.

534
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:48,050
Why do you park your car over at Media N Seoul?

535
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,960
Well…

536
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,780
the land over there is remarkably flat.

537
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,410
Is it because your car is too nice for our parking lot?

538
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,290
Okay, no, thanks for the drinks or the parking. End of story.

539
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,440
Hyungnim, speaking of…

540
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,150
Hyungnim! Hyungnim, speaking of…

541
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,880
I-I heard another thing.

542
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,460
Is the next 9 o'clock news anchor already chosen?

543
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,260
Is it Jung Hyun Oh from Group 28?

544
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,510
I don't know.

545
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,650
Why? I heard if Department Head Oh retires,

546
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,660
Jung Hyun Oh will get it right away. It's all been decided.

547
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,700
I knew it. That Jung Hyun Oh is so full of himself.

548
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,170
Hey, I said I don't know anything.

549
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,100
I said to go back to your newsroom!

550
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,120
Hyungnim, I added so much newsroom info to the announcer department so long.

551
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,170
You can't be so cold to me.

552
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,380
Yes, you did.

553
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,800
Just as much as the info you passed from us to the newsroom.

554
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,170
That's just give and take!

555
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,130
Speaking of, Hyungnim…

556
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,520
Wait, wait, wait.

557
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,900
Do announcers still do this?

558
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,700
You know, if someone makes a mistake, people scold them.

559
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,870
Do you mean the Joint Meeting?

560
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,460
Announcer, Ju Eun Ho.

561
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,940
Why don't you answer, Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

562
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,170
At the last Joint Meeting, we all agreed

563
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,180
that announcers will avoid entering the field.

564
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,000
However, you've gone twice.

565
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,020
As if you wanted us to know, you went off-site.

566
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,140
Why do you Group 28 members like going off-site so much?

567
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,100
Sunbae, who says we like going off-site?

568
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,760
It just looks like that. She wanted to do this one.

569
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,240
Is that right, Ju Eun Ho?

570
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Still, I hear only her voice made the cut.

571
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,500
I know. Our Eun Ho got less screen time than a Styrofoam box.

572
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,100
Still, the beach scene was hilarious.

573
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,810
You were quite remarkable, Ju Eun Ho.

574
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,860
By the way, was that seaweed or hijiki (brown seaweed) on your head?

575
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,470
It was algae.

576
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,180
Are you happy?

577
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,860
Was there any pressure from the production crew?

578
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,170
No.

579
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,580
Not at all.

580
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,900
Eun Ho, if there was no pressure from them, why did you do it?

581
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,680
If you do that, what happens to our agreement to act sensibly?

582
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,100
- Sunbae, I— 
 - Please apologize, Sunbaenim.

583
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,290
- "Apologize"? 
 - Yes.

584
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,800
Apologize for the negative impact you had on all of us.

585
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,880
Did I…

586
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,570
do something to negatively impact

587
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
- everyone? 
 - Yes. Of course.

588
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,040
You had a massive negative impact on us.

589
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,730
Do you really not know that?

590
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,000
- What kind of negative impact? 
 - Sunbaenim.

591
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,200
I dreamed of becoming an announcer since I was 11 years old.

592
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,610
 The first snowstorm in 10 years has continued since yesterday. 

593
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:37,330
 This morning, a 55-vehicle pile-up occurred in the northbound lane of Honam Highway. 

594
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,990
 Twenty-seven people were killed or injured in the crash. 

595
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,240
 Eun Ho. 

596
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,290
 Reporter Lee Joon Cheol is present on the scene. 

597
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,530
 - Let's go. 
 - This is the northbound lane of Honam Highway… 

598
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,280
 Eun Ho. 

599
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,580
 where a multiple car crash occurred this morning. 

600
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,650
 According to the authorities, seven people died on the scene 

601
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,470
 and 20 more have been hospitalized with injuries. 

602
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,090
 What is the possible reason for this car crash? 

603
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:11,000
   

604
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,850
   

605
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:27,140
 The first priority of the year is to create more jobs, 

606
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,700
 but neither the president nor the businessmen 

607
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,280
 nor college students seem to have a proposed solution. 

608
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,140
 Setting a clear goal is just the beginning. 

609
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,870
 It's time to put our national strengths into the fight. 

610
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,000
Number 6976771. 
    

611
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,020
   

612
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,980
 You have no idea how badly I wanted to be an announcer. 

613
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,700
I put in blood, sweat, and tears to succeed,

614
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,660
to earn the dignity reserved only for announcers.

615
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,780
But what is happening here?

616
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,040
Thanks to your careless actions, I lost that dignity overnight.

617
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,520
All the work I put in turned into a joke.

618
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,370
It's also not just me.

619
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,950
All the work everyone has done here…

620
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,640
You practically stepped all over it.

621
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,050
So please apologize

622
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,110
for trampling my dreams,

623
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,640
for trampling everyone else's dreams,

624
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,180
all of them.

625
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,240
I'm sorry.

626
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,250
With my careless actions,

627
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,240
I tarnished Shim Jin Hwa's dreams

628
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,240
and the honor you all deserve.

629
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,500
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,480
I wanted only to work hard.

631
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,090
No, honestly, I just wanted to be more successful than I am.

632
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:38,930
I wanted to take over VCR and gain more recognition.

633
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,050
That's why I entered the field.

634
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,580
If…

635
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,440
that ended up embarrassing someone else,

636
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,650
I am genuinely sorry.

637
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,320
Can I…

638
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,110
go home now?

639
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,130
 You know… 

640
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,220
 I'm ashamed of you. 

641
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,130
 What? 

642
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:34,790
 You know what I hear most often? 

643
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,460
 "Why did you date her?" 

644
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,210
 "Why were you together?" 

645
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,210
 "Why did you ever like her?" 

646
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,930
 But… 

647
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,880
 I really hate hearing that. 

648
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,870
 It's embarrassing. 

649
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,370
 What is 

650
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,200
 embarrassing? 

651
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,080
 Everything. 

652
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,300
 So I hoped you would get into a good program without me. 

653
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,300
 I hoped you would get a great news piece without me. 

654
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,840
 I hoped you would get out of a freezer truck without my help. 

655
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,800
 I hoped you would survive in this field without me. 

656
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,730
 - I hoped you were a decent person like that. 
 - I see… 

657
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,780
 - I really wished— 
 - I'm sorry! I'm not a decent person, Jung Hyun Oh. 

658
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,450
 I'm sorry, I'm so mediocre. But… 

659
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,070
 can I just be mediocre? 

660
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,900
 - What? 
 - You know. 

661
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,260
 I'm mediocre. I'm inadequate. 

662
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,650
 So what? 

663
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,500
 - It bothers me. 
 - Just don't be bothered. 

664
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,860
 Because you and I are broken up already. 

665
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,430
 And just think about it. 

666
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,820
 Was I any better when we were together? 

667
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,090
 I was totally mediocre then, too. 

668
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,450
 Actually, back then, 

669
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,030
 I felt bad about it. 

670
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,650
 I was so mediocre, and you were so excellent. 

671
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,570
 Now, I don't feel bad about it at all. 

672
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,360
 Because as I said, you and I are broken up. 

673
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,500
 Because you and I are nothing. 

674
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,400
 So what you're asking me now… 

675
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,320
 to save you from embarrassment… 

676
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,800
 I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it. 

677
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,930
 Because as you know, I'm really mediocre, 

678
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,500
 and it's not up to me. 

679
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,920
 Do you get it? 

680
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,860
 - Ju Eun Ho. 
 - Goodbye. 

681
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,130
 Don't call me again. 

682
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,210
   

683
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,100
- Ju Eun Ho. 
 - You scared me.

684
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,890
You scared me.

685
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,190
 Why are you… why… 

686
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:55,120
 Don't ask me why I'm still in the announcer department. I heard that all day. 

687
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,080
I want to ask why you're doing things that justify that question.

688
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,740
Don't call me a golden bat, either.

689
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,480
That's a trigger button for me.

690
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,330
You went back and forth between here and the newsroom to steal information.

691
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:10,360
 I think the nickname "Golden Bat" is well-earned. 

692
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,730
Enough.

693
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,480
Listen.

694
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,470
I saw a woman who looks exactly like you.

695
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,820
She is at the Media N Seoul parking lot.

696
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,990
I hear…

697
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,230
that woman is your sister.

698
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,940
- So? 
 - So?

699
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,190
What do you mean? Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

700
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,540
Your sister…

701
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,480
is dead.

702
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,200
If I remember correctly, you said so at a staff dinner once.

703
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,000
Not to me directly, but still.

704
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,800
- Hey, Jeon Jae Yong. 
 - What?

705
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,340
What? Why? I thought I saw a ghost.

706
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,580
It was so scary. I got goosebumps all over.

707
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,050
My sister is not dead.

708
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:09,270
No!

709
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,370
I heard you at the staff dinner.

710
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,200
Once again, you didn't say it to me directly—

711
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,940
Hey. Who are you to kill someone with your words?

712
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,840
Don't cross the line.

713
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,330
 Yes, hello? 

714
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,820
 Yes? 

715
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,370
 Yes. 

716
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,350
 I'm sorry. 

717
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,910
 Could you repeat that? 

718
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,080
 Ju Hye Ri is missing. 

719
00:54:54,050 --> 00:55:00,300
   

720
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,430
 "A", a college student who went on a graduation trip, was reported missing last night. 

721
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:33,060
 The last place "A" was seen last night at about 10:50 p.m. was here 

722
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,680
 at the start of the hiking trail. 

723
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:40,290
 "A" did not have a cell phone when she disappeared. There are few security cameras in the area. 

724
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,530
 The police are struggling with the investigation. 

725
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,590
   

726
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:39,410
   

727
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,610
 I found a 10-won coin on my way to school. 

728
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:45,320
 Good things are going to happen. I'm so happy! 

729
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,930
   

730
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,880
   

731
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,580
   

732
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,320
   

733
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,030
   

734
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,560
   

735
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,110
 Unnie bought me a gift. I love it. 

736
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:13,950
 How would I ever live without her? 

737
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,370
 My sister's dream is to be an announcer. That's cool. 

738
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:25,460
 It'll be fun to go to the broadcast station with her, right? 

739
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,720
   

740
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,060
 The parking lot is my dream. 

741
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,720
   

742
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:58,000
   

743
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,340
 Hello… 

744
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,730
 - Excuse me. 
 - Yes. 

745
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,680
 How can I help you? 

746
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,330
 Well… 

747
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,220
 Can I… 

748
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,220
 ask a strange favor? 

749
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,610
 Excuse me. 

750
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,750
 Excuse me… 

751
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,590
 What's your name? 

752
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,290
 I'm Ju Eun… 

753
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,020
 Ju Hye Ri. 

754
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,620
 Ju Hye Ri. Ju Hye Ri. 

755
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,930
 How about you? 

756
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,260
 I'm Kim Min Yeong. 

757
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,310
 How old are you? 

758
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,320
 I'm thir… 

759
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,340
 I'm 25. 

760
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,920
 What? 

761
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,130
 You're younger than I am? 

762
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,080
 Maybe? 

763
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,910
 Can I speak casually then? 

764
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,800
 Can I do that, too? 

765
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,420
 Yes! 

766
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,680
 By the way, what's going on with your bangs? 

767
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,860
 Is it a new trend or something? 

768
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,150
 This hurts my eyes. 

769
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,100
 Excuse me, 
   

770
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,680
 I'm here to get counseling. 

771
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,530
 Yes. Is this your first time? 

772
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,330
 Yes. 

773
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:19,820
 Have a seat over there and fill out this form, please. 

774
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,530
   

775
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,480
 What brings you here? 

776
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,930
 I… 

777
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,010
 I… 

778
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,500
 Recently I have been unable 

779
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,530
 to remember things. 

780
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,260
 What kind of things can't you remember? 

781
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:56,760
 When I wake up, I have cuts that I don't remember. 

782
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:00,760
 And I'm so tired… I'm so tired… 

783
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,480
   

784
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,270
   

785
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,130
 Do you know him? 

786
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,400
 I don't. 

787
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,460
 He became a famous announcer after his military academy. 

788
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,990
 Why? Are you interested in him? 

789
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,100
 Do you want me to set you up? 

790
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,730
   

791
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,000
   

792
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,150
   

793
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,190
 Hello, I… 

794
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,930
 I am looking for Announcer Kang Ju Yeon. 

795
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,770
 Do you have an appointment? 

796
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,340
 No. 

797
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,580
 Then can I see your ID? 

798
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,130
 Okay. 

799
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,700
Here.

800
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,300
Yes, I've got it.

801
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,900
You can fill this out.

802
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,230
Put "Announcer Kang Ju Yeon" here.

803
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,550
Who are you?

804
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,190
It's you, Hye Ri.

805
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,180
Hey, Ju Eun Ho!

806
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:49,050


807
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:01,230
   

808
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,010
 Why am I here? 

809
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,970
 Do you not know? 

810
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,590
 No. 

811
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:20,020
 I definitely went home last night. 

812
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,970
 And now I'm here. 

813
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,000
 You saw me earlier. 

814
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,400
 No way. I don't even remember coming to work. 

815
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,440
 Then you went to the restroom and broke a mirror. 

816
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,970
 Who did? I did? 

817
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,380
 Then you passed out. 

818
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,640
 Who did? I did? 

819
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,070
 But why?
