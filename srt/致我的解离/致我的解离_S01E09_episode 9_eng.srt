1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,880
   

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,370
   

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,720
   

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,970
   

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,320
   

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:30,680


7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,030
   

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,040
   

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,050
 Ju Hye Ri! 

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,100
How long will you be like this?

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,260
You need to be independent!

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,710
Work hard at something! Make connections!

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,130
You need to prepare to be part of society!

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,430
Stop complaining and go. Go make friends!

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,440
What? She showed up.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,370
Who?

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,370
Her. Ju Hye Ri.

18
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,500
She's never around.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,300
Oh, her.

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,520
Right.

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,450
I haven't talked to her at all in the past four years.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,310
But you know...

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,810
She's an orphan.

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,910
So? What's wrong with being an orphan?

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,280
No. It's just weird.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,740
She's an orphan.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,860
But...

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,360
   

29
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,120
   

30
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,260
Rock, paper, scissors! Two! Three! 
    

31
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, come on!

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,460
- Hurry and drink! 
 - Hurry!

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,290
Over-drinking game! Which game?

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,140
- Eleven! 
 - Twelve!

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,890
Eighteen! Oh no.

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,610
I said it to be funny!

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,720
- "Ani"! (Game word) 
 - Darn!

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,250
- Four! 
 - Five!

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,820
Come here.

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,200
- Your punishment! 
 - Fast, make an excuse!

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,660
   

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,000
   

43
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,260
My phone.

44
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,110
Is this not the way?

45
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,100
   

46
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,020
   

47
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,810
   

48
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,910
   

49
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,290
 It's really summer now. 

50
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,920
 During other seasons, we don't feel this summer air. 

51
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,860
 How much did you miss it during the winter? 

52
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,330
 Today, why don't you inhale the air that you missed so much? 

53
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,520
 It's a good day. 

54
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,070
 Hello. It's Monday, June 17. 

55
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,090
 This is "Every Morning" by PPS. I'm Choi Yeon Jeong. 

56
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,600
 I'm Announcer Choi Yeon Jeong. 

57
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,070
   

58
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,300
Hello, Viewers.

59
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,110
This is the Monday PPS 12 o'clock news.

60
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,460
We start with news on the National Assembly's vote on the constitutional amendment.

61
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,620
Thank you for watching.

62
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,110
Seung Hwa, can you remove my mic?

63
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,420
Yes, Sunbaenim. One moment.

64
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,550
- Hey, Oppa. 
 - Yes?

65
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,840
Press Director Soh wants to grab a meal together.

66
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,630
Eating with Press Director Soh is reserved just for you.

67
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,750
Thanks, Seung Hwa.

68
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,830
Oppa, how can you say that?

69
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,890
Do you know how much I praise you to Press Director Soh?

70
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,800
Thanks.

71
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,250
But can you stop calling me "Oppa"?

72
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,210
Why? You're an oppa.

73
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,830
You're older than me.

74
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,370
Yes, I know, but...

75
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,170
   

76
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,450
Hyung!

77
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,790
Yes?

78
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,440
Hyung, what do you say to people who call you "Oppa"?

79
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,370
"Don't call me that."

80
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,130
That's what I said, but she keeps doing it.

81
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,110
Then make a serious face.

82
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,710
Make a serious face? What a novel idea!

83
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,190
- Is that all? 
 - No.

84
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,650
Has Ju Eun Ho reached out?

85
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,100
No. She hasn't.

86
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,220
Oh, yes. I was about to tell him.

87
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,820
Yes, yes. Have a good day.

88
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,670
Hey. They say you're back on "Current News at Ten."

89
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,060
Is this a joke? I already quit that program.

90
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,410
Exactly. I also thought that so I asked several times.

91
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,710
"Really? Are you sure?"

92
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,500
"Are you sure you're talking about Announcer Jung Hyun Oh?"

93
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,800
"Not someone else with the same name?"

94
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,500
"But why are you asking for Jung Hyun Oh, who didn't make the 9 o'clock news?"

95
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,370
"You know? He lost his seat to Jeon Jae Yong"

96
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,930
"and has become an outcast with nowhere to go."

97
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,460
"Every other month, he waters the cactus on our office windowsill."

98
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,870
"His nickname these days is the spray bottle of the announcer world."

99
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,760
You know, spray bottles?

100
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,950
"Are you sure you want that Announcer Jung Hyun Oh back?"

101
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,160
And they said yes.

102
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,800
So just say, "Aigoo, thank you," and get back in there next month.

103
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,660
Don't you think it'll be kind of funny?

104
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,880
Funny how?

105
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,730
Do you want me to tell you again why none of this is funny?

106
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,390
Where should I start? Explaining why you've been an outcast?

107
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,560
Never mind. Got it.

108
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,600
Thank you, Team Leader.

109
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,230
I'll join back right away. Good?

110
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,050
Hey, Hyun Oh.

111
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,760
Well, you know... have you heard from Eun Ho?

112
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,880
No.

113
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,260
I mean... she took a leave of absence and ran off. Why would she call you?

114
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,150
And she ran off after she heard you're getting married. Right?

115
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,810
Hey. Team Leader.

116
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,390
Hey. I'm just talking about the timing.

117
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,450
- But are you seriously getting married— 
 - No, I'm not.

118
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,990
I'm not. Never.

119
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,950
Hey. Good call.

120
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,630
Wow. I wish Eun Ho would find out about this news.

121
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,390
But where is she? Doing what?

122
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,230
I heard she used all the vacation days that she piled up.

123
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,800
- She probably went on a trip. 
 - Exactly.

124
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,900
Where did she go that I haven't heard from her at all?

125
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,560
It's been a month.

126
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,300
When she was in the office, it was so noisy.

127
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,150
But...

128
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,100
now that she's not here...

129
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,270
it feels empty.

130
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,980
Hello, this is the Announcer Department.

131
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,660
Hello?

132
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,880
Solve for you to...

133
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,180
It's quite hard for...

134
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,490
Any quotation...

135
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,130
Yes, Kang Ju Yeon. Ju Hye Ri isn't here today, either.

136
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,870
It lines into the...

137
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,360
And then...

138
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,450
♫  When you're struggling, I won't let you be lonely  ♫

139
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:41,300
♫  Like the skies, I'll widely embrace you  ♫

140
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,030
♫  When you're tired, and you want my heart  ♫

141
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:55,040
♫  Like the bright sunshine, I'll warmly shine on you  ♫

142
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,840
♫  My heart changes according to your gaze  ♫

143
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,240
♫  If I could feel every moment  ♫

144
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
   

145
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,450
   
 ♫  That's enough  ♫ 

146
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,530
♫  I'll be with you, always there but barely noticeable  ♫

147
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,510
♫  I'll be in your background  ♫

148
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,780
    
 ♫  I'll protect you forever  ♫

149
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,560
♫  I'll be the affection for another side of you  ♫

150
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,760
♫  So you won't get hurt in this harsh world  ♫

151
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:46,200
♫  Always there but barely noticeable, I'll be in your background  ♫

152
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,200
♫  I'll protect you forever  ♫

153
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,090
♫  I will be for only you  ♫

154
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,580
♫  I'll be by your side  ♫

155
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,390
♫  We will be happy  ♫

156
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,160
   

157
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,500
   

158
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey, Eun Cho Rong!

159
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,850
Hey, Oppa.

160
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,090
You look like you're in a good mood.

161
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,470
I'm not really in a good mood.

162
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Why not?

163
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,840
Because Sunbae Hyun Oh says he will never marry.

164
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,690
Why are you pretending like you didn't know?

165
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,460
Well, Hyung doesn't talk to me about that stuff.

166
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,550
- Want coffee? 
 - No, thanks. I have some.

167
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,900
One iced Americano, please.

168
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,130
But you know... the grandmas are pulling for you.

169
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,810
Of course.

170
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,840
Who would be a better in-law than me?

171
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,270
But Noona Shin Yeong seems to be against it.

172
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,840
Right. She thinks marriage is for people who like each other.

173
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,630
I agree with that part.

174
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,420
Thank you.

175
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,520
But Oppa,

176
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,450
actually...

177
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,710
I like Sunbae Hyun Oh.

178
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,320
What?

179
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,620
I thought you didn't like him.

180
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,800
You said you like our family but have no interest in him.

181
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
Of course, I like your family.

182
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
But I also like Sunbae Hyun Oh.

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,370
If I said that, I thought he'd be even more against it.

184
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,730
Hey, if Hyung Hyun Oh knows that...

185
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,170
Wow.

186
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,850
Eun Cho Rong. Can you explain it slowly this time?

187
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,890
- Well... 
 - You don't like me,

188
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,930
but you like my family.

189
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,870
You said that's why you wanted to marry me.

190
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,500
I can't say I didn't consider it.

191
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,850
What? Really?

192
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,350
Don't get too excited.

193
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,200
Because now that I know you like me,

194
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,050
it feels more burdensome.

195
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,460
That makes sense.

196
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,620
Yes. As you know, I don't like you at all.

197
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,100
But Sunbae...

198
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,600
I do like you, but I won't insist that you like me back.

199
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,000
I just love your family so much.

200
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,940
Liking someone who doesn't like you might hurt you.

201
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,760
No. I'm strong about this kind of stuff.

202
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,000
Then let me be more straightforward.

203
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,670
I don't want to be the bad guy who hurts someone.

204
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,440
But Sunbae, I can't give up yet.

205
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,730
Eun Cho Rong, please respect someone else's feelings.

206
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,880
Until now, I considered it a bit,

207
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,870
but not anymore.

208
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,490
Eun Cho Rong, we will never get married.

209
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,620
So please don't bring up marriage again anywhere.

210
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,680
Okay, Sunbae.

211
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,820
I won't say it.

212
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,970
Then let's get back to work.

213
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,760
But Sunbae...

214
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,560
you're so gentle even after saying such cruel things.

215
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,370
I don't need to be cold to you.

216
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,870
Where are you headed? The office?

217
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,700
Yes. I'll go to the office.

218
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,210
By the way, Grandma Mi Ja wants us to gather later.

219
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,960
What do you think she wants to say?

220
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,290
Not sure. I don't know.

221
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,630
They say there's some improvement.

222
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,870
Unbelievable.

223
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,800
That's unbelievable. 
    

224
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,090
What is? My getting better?

225
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,230
You've been aggravating since last time.

226
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,290
Do you want me to die? Or—

227
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,860
Unnie! She's crying tears of joy.

228
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,070
Don't exaggerate.

229
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:04,380
Then I can relax now and have a smoke.

230
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,360
No smoking.

231
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,730
But she's allowed to drink! Why not me?

232
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,570
Grandma Yeong Ja has a clean liver.

233
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,240
But what did the doctor say to you?

234
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,180
That I should stop smoking.

235
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,740
Yes, that's right.

236
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:30,170
Aigoo, after you got cancer, Hyun Oh's nagging got worse.

237
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,510
Hyun Oh, don't worry.

238
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,950
I'm a lot better so—

239
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,270
How does cancer get better?

240
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,540
You need to keep getting treatment.

241
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,640
Hey. If I just keep—

242
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Unnie! Unnie!

243
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,900
Grandma!

244
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,050
What do we do?

245
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,970
What?

246
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,220
Noona...

247
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,290
Shin Yeong...

248
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,770
 Hurry. Hurry and leave! 

249
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,000
 And don't call me again, got it? 

250
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,170
 Hey, Shin Yeong, this is— 

251
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,490
 Darn it. 

252
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,040
Eat up.

253
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,670
Do Hyeong, where were you, and what have you been up to?

254
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,020
I've been everywhere.

255
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,240
Mountains, boats...

256
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,670
You two are so cringe. Stop holding hands.

257
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,640
No way. I haven't held this hand in forever.

258
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,170
Aigoo, so nice and warm.

259
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,190
She used to be cute. What happened to her?

260
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,580
Even I don't know.

261
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,930
I don't know at what point it happened, either. It's a real mystery.

262
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,580
- Honey, want more rice? 
 - Yes.

263
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,300
We should raise a glass on a day like this.

264
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,650
We have an expensive bottle that Hyun Oh brought back from a business trip!

265
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,510
- Grandma, no. 
 - Why not?

266
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,360
- My liver is healthy! 
 - No.

267
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,400
Why is he so strict now?

268
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,420
Do Hyeong, ever since Unnie Mi Ja got cancer,

269
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,050
he's lost his mind.

270
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,580
- Completely. 
 - No.

271
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,700
I think it happened after he didn't get the 9 o'clock anchor job.

272
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,470
No. I think it happened after Eun Ho disappeared.

273
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,150
Stop it.

274
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,290
Give it to me. Hyung, I'll do it.

275
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,110
You can't do that?

276
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,650
What are you doing?

277
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,330
Give it to me. I'll do it.

278
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,610
I heard some people can open a bottle with paper.

279
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,300
I think I can do that.

280
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,730
Sunbae, I think the bottle opener is the problem.

281
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,430
No, no. That's...

282
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,600
Is it that difficult?

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,150
Aigoo.

284
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,920
Come in.

285
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,800
Ju Yeon!

286
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,720
- Department Head. 
 - Yes.

287
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,530
I have a question.

288
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,780
Go ahead and ask!

289
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:42,220
What does it mean if an announcer is taken off all programs at once?

290
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,170
- That's... 
 - I know the answer.

291
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,780
That means she quit.

292
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,440
Aigoo, Hye Yeon.

293
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,700
What? It's true.

294
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,100
Am I wrong?

295
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,600
I think you're right, Hye Yeon.

296
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,690
Why do you ask, Ju Yeon?

297
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,000
But Department Head,

298
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,700
if they quit, their job wouldn't show up on their profile.

299
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,700
Is that so?

300
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,850
I know this one too. That means she's taking a sabbatical.

301
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,410
Hye Yeon, we don't have sabbaticals here.

302
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,050
No, but PPS does.

303
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,760
It's very appealing to me.

304
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,950
Sunbae, that means she's taking a leave,

305
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,510
a very long one.

306
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,090
But why? Do you need a break, too?

307
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,620
If so, can you let me know? I want a break, too.

308
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,730
No. I don't want a break.

309
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,090
- Thank you, Department Head. 
 - Sure.

310
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,200
What? Why are you thanking him?

311
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,250
I answered everything. You should thank me.

312
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,490
So in that spirit, let's...

313
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,670
- By the way, Department Head. 
 - Yes, what else?

314
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,680
Do you know Announcer Jung Hyun Oh from PPS?

315
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,880
"Jung Hyun Oh"?

316
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,710
   

317
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,780
   

318
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,590
   

319
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,150
Hello.

320
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,280
I heard you came to see me.

321
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,950
Hello. I'm Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

322
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm Jung Hyun Oh. I think we've met once before.

323
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,240
 Yes. 

324
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,560
 What brings you here? 

325
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,440
I'm here because I have some questions.

326
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,110
Sure, go ahead.

327
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,470
Announcer Ju Eun Ho...

328
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,590
where is she right now?

329
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,750
I'd like to know first

330
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,410
what your relationship is with Announcer Ju Eun Ho

331
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,950
that you're asking me such a question.

332
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,920
Then can I ask you, too?

333
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,400
Sunbaenim, what is your relationship to Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

334
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,890
We're colleagues.

335
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,390
Seriously...

336
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,520
Why are you saying, "Seriously"?

337
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,020
Because I've seen you and Announcer Ju Eun Ho

338
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,930
be affectionate with each other.

339
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,600
Who are you to ask me such questions?

340
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,740
As I've said before, I'm from Media N Seoul—

341
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,020
No.

342
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,630
I'm asking who you are to Ju Eun Ho.

343
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,940
Announcer Ju Eun Ho's other personality,

344
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,700
Ju Hye Ri, and I are in a relationship.

345
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,420
Her other personality? What are you talking about?

346
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,040
Ju Eun Ho said she has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

347
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,420
I found out only recently.

348
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,700
- Then how did you— 
 - Ju Eun Ho told me herself.

349
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,050
She told you directly?

350
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,110
Then you and Eun Ho...

351
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,950
What did you say? "A relationship"?

352
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm in a relationship with Ju Hye Ri, Announcer Ju Eun Ho's other personality.

353
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,590
So...

354
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,100
Eun Ho has multiple personalities, and her other personality is Ju Hye Ri.

355
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,800
But Ju Hye Ri...

356
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,980
- Isn't that her younger sister's name? 
 - Yes.

357
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,800
That's what Ju Eun Ho said, too,

358
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,590
that her other personality is her younger sister.

359
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,030
Oh, so...

360
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,530
You were dating Eun Ho's sister?

361
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,330
Yes. I'm dating her younger sister.

362
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,200
But you're saying that younger sister...

363
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,860
is Eun Ho.

364
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,410
Then you're saying you were dating Eun Ho. Am I wrong?

365
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,440
That's true, but...

366
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,560
the person I met was 28 years old

367
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,260
and worked in a parking lot.

368
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,400
Her name is Hye Ri.

369
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,160
Sunbaenim, did you not know about this at all?

370
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,430
 I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho... 

371
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,170
 What are you saying, Ju Eun Ho? Stop it! 

372
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,510
 I'm not Ju Eun Ho! 

373
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,440
 Hey, Ju Eun Ho! 

374
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,740
 We had feelings for each other. 

375
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,000
 Fine. 

376
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,760
Even if she has multiple personalities, it's still Eun Ho.

377
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,960
The fact that Eun Ho had feelings for someone else...

378
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,240
What's odd about that?

379
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,850
Because...

380
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,530
that...

381
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,630
- Because Eun Ho— 
 - She likes you, Sunbaenim?

382
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,760
I have feelings for her.

383
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,420
Do you mean...

384
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,580
you like Eun Ho or Ju Hye Ri?

385
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,880
To be precise,

386
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,930
I like Ju Hye Ri, who is inside Ju Eun Ho.

387
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,350
Ultimately, that's Eun Ho.

388
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,220
I wish that were the case, too, Sunbaenim.

389
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:55,220
I wish the person I had met was Eun Ho.

390
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,990
Because…

391
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,740
no matter how long I wait,

392
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,260
Hye Ri won't show up.

393
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,470
So I looked for Eun Ho, and she was gone.

394
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,310
That's why I came here.

395
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,020
I thought maybe you knew…

396
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,450
where Ju Eun Ho was.

397
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,780
Where she is and what she's doing.

398
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,940
Do you happen to know?

399
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,500
I want to see Ju Eun Ho.

400
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,500
I want her to be Hye Ri, but if not,

401
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,020
I'd like to at least see Eun Ho,

402
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,010
and I have so much to tell her.

403
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,300
Eun Ho took a leave of absence a month ago

404
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,480
and hasn't been back since.

405
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,470
I can't reach her, either.

406
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,540
I see.

407
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,330
Did Eun Ho…

408
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,720
say she likes you?

409
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,480
As I've said, Sunbaenim,

410
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,460
Eun Ho never told me that she likes me.

411
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,630
Hye Ri, who is inside Eun Ho, and I

412
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,450
shared feelings for each other.

413
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,060
So did you break up?

414
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,720
No.

415
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,660
Hye Ri just disappeared.

416
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,820
If she comes back,

417
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,310
will you date her again?

418
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,150
Yes.

419
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,870
Does that surprise you, Sunbaenim?

420
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,770
No.

421
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,580
I'm surprised by too many things.

422
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,950
I can't sort out just one.

423
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,520
But more than that…

424
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,920
the fact you and Eun Ho were together, I—

425
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,120
Dissociative Identity Disorder is a disorder by its name,

426
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,160
an illness.

427
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,170
That means…

428
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,620
Ju Eun Ho was very sick.

429
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,570
The fact that she disappeared so suddenly

430
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,480
means she was in a lot of pain.

431
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,930
Sunbaenim…

432
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,090
don't you care about that at all?

433
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,680
Don't you care Ju Eun Ho was in pain?

434
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,450
Do you care only that she dated me in her condition?

435
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm asking because I'm curious.

436
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,890
Sunbaenim,

437
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,930
what's important to you?

438
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,410
 Are you sick? 

439
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,220
 Yes. I'm sick. 

440
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,230
 Hyun Oh. 

441
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,690
 Yes? Tell me. 

442
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,900
 I already have a doctor whom I see. 

443
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,970
   

444
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,770
 Hello, Jung Hyun Oh? 

445
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,690
 Oh, yes. Hello. 

446
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,760
 Doctor, I'm Ju Eun Ho's colleague. 

447
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,910
 Yes. How can I help you? 

448
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,420
I mean, I actually…

449
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,160
used to be Eun Ho's boyfriend.

450
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,020
I heard that she has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

451
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,110
Did you come in to hear about Ju Eun Ho?

452
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,420
Eun Ho is alone. She has no guardian so I—

453
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,300
No, I'm sorry. We do not provide information about our patients.

454
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,580
I am obligated to keep patient discussions confidential.

455
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,280
- Eun Ho— 
 - Hyun Oh.

456
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,000
As I've said, I cannot help you with that.

457
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,250
But if you don't mind, how about we talk about you?

458
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,010
 I… 

459
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,190
 Yes, tell me. 

460
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,140
 I'm heartbroken. 

461
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,750
Do you mean your heart is in pain?

462
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,620
Yes. My heart.

463
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,250
Could you be more specific?

464
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,010
So…

465
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,180
I had a girlfriend I broke up with four years ago.

466
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,950
She…

467
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,430
She has Dissociative Identity Disorder,

468
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,480
but I heard about it

469
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,600
from the man she dated as her other personality.

470
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,710
I know,

471
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,630
I have no right.

472
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,740
But Doctor,

473
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,830
honestly, I didn't want to break up with her.

474
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,570
You mean, you didn't want to break up with your girlfriend?

475
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,100
Correct.

476
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,670
If I could, I would be with her forever,

477
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,010
but I had to break up with her.

478
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,950
I think then she developed Dissociative Identity Disorder.

479
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,590
She lived as a different person,

480
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,910
and I had no idea.

481
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:10,280
How did you feel when you found out about it, Hyun Oh?

482
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,470
I was shocked.

483
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,000
But what was equally shocking was the fact…

484
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,500
she was with another man as her other personality.

485
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,240
 I mean… 

486
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,770
 how can I think only of myself in this situation? 

487
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,880
 Do you think you're being selfish? 

488
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:42,070
 I want to know why she is sick. 

489
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,080
Is it because of me?

490
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,800
Is it my fault that she has this illness?

491
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,030
Because…

492
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,660
this feels as if I am to blame.

493
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,470
I see. It sounds as if this is a very difficult time for you.

494
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,080
Dissociative Identity Disorder

495
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,210
may be widely known to involve past trauma or stress,

496
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,580
but many other factors affect it.

497
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,680
So we can't determine it was your fault.

498
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,610
Did I cause her to struggle and suffer?

499
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,330
Is that why she's sick? Is this all due to me?

500
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,720
Hyun Oh.

501
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,700
I understand you want to help Eun Ho,

502
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,710
but what we discuss is related to Eun Ho.

503
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:41,110
I have to talk to Eun Ho first and get her approval,

504
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,850
that she wants your help before I can help you.

505
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,820
But… she didn't tell me any of this.

506
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,070
Hyun Oh, it seems you are worried

507
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,670
that breaking up with her might have really hurt Eun Ho.

508
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,780
Yes, I am.

509
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,180
I worry it hurt her intensely.

510
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,100
That she will never get better.

511
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,800
Doctor.

512
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,840
How do you treat Dissociative Identity Disorder?

513
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,930
Does she need hospitalization? Should she take medication?

514
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,830
If necessary,

515
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:40,050
but the important thing is to talk it out and let wounds heal.

516
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,200
If Eun Ho needs help during treatment,

517
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
just knowing someone is by her side

518
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,630
will be very assuring.

519
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,700
 Eun Ho. 

520
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,100
 Ju Eun Ho, are you inside? 

521
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,890
Ju Eun Ho!

522
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,570
Eun Ho!

523
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,890
   

524
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,080
   

525
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,610
♪ Me? Me? Me? I'm the best ♪

526
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:11,050
♪ I'm the best, best, best anchor. I am ♪

527
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,830
♪ Let's go, go, go ♪

528
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,470
Hyun Oh, I came to ask you a question.

529
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,710
Do you know where Ju Eun Ho went on vacation?

530
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,390
Is she living somewhere else for a month?

531
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,870
I want to try that kind of thing, too.

532
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,860
I don't know, either.

533
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,340
I see.

534
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,910
Did her sister go with her, too?

535
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,370
Her sister works at the parking lot I go to, but I haven't seen her in a while.

536
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,070
If they left together…

537
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,680
What?

538
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,710
What?

539
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,960
I park my car at the lot where Ju Eun Ho's sister works.

540
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,290
Hey! I park there since that lot is weirdly flat!

541
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,580
 The person I met was 28 years old 

542
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,630
 and worked in a parking lot. 

543
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,910
 Her name is Hye Ri. 

544
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,040
- What's the name of the lot? 
 - Why?

545
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,080
Do you want to check how flat it is?

546
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,870
You doubt so much.

547
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,500
Hurry up and tell me.

548
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,030
It's all the way over at Media N Seoul, outside the building.

549
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,250
It's very spacious.

550
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:22,320
But you know, Hyun Oh, I heard earlier that Ju Eun Ho's sister disappeared.

551
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,330
You left.

552
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,130
 Yes, Kang Ju Yeon. 

553
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,300
 Ju Hye Ri is absent again. 

554
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,390
 Are you checking out? 

555
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,630
 Can I see your ticket? 

556
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,400
Does Ju Hye Ri look like this?

557
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,890
 Yes. 

558
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,680
 Yes, she does, but… 

559
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,920
 her vibe is different. 

560
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,300
 But who are you? 

561
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,140
I'm looking for Ju Hye Ri.

562
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,500
When did she start working here?

563
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,280
 Are you a detective? Did something happen to Hye Ri? 

564
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,040
No. I'm Announcer Jung Hyun Oh from PPS.

565
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,750
If you search for my name online, my face will come up.

566
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,710
 Yes. 

567
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,760
 Why is a PPS Announcer looking for Hye Ri? 

568
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,940
I know Hye Ri personally.

569
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,430
I heard Hye Ri stopped coming here suddenly.

570
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,300
When did Hye Ri start working here?

571
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,080
 Maybe 3-4 years ago? 

572
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,260
 Don't you know what eight years mean? 

573
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,850
 It's the time it takes for a child to be born and go to elementary school. 

574
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,270
 We're breaking up like this after all that time? In one breath? 

575
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,390
 It's not like we were just messing around! 

576
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,650
 Whether we were together eight years or eight weeks, 

577
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,210
 breakups are the same. 

578
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,040
 Goodbye. So long. 

579
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,400
 That's the end of it, Eun Ho. 

580
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,810
 Wh-What? Did something happen to Hye Ri? 

581
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,060
No.

582
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,310
I'm sure nothing happened to her.

583
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,630
Did she seem happy?

584
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,100
What?

585
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,780
Did Ju Hye Ri seem happy?

586
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,460
 Eat up. 

587
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,230
 This is good. 

588
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,230
Hyun Oh, you are home! Come eat.

589
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,730
I already ate.

590
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:56,120
Look. These guys brought seaweed for my breast cancer—

591
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,160
Anchovies? Or peppers?

592
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,840
Anchovies too. Peppers are perfectly seasoned.

593
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,090
Eat.

594
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,270
It turned out good.

595
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,800
 Ju Eun Ho was very sick. 

596
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,700
 The fact that she disappeared so suddenly… 

597
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,600
 Hyun Oh, it seems you are worried 

598
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,200
 that breaking up with her might have really hurt Eun Ho. 

599
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:15,080
♫  Only after you were gone  ♫

600
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:23,470
♫  Only then I realized it was a goodbye  ♫

601
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:32,940
♫  Your empty space seemed endless  ♫

602
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,580
♫  That's why  ♫

603
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,830
♫  What if I had held onto you?  ♫

604
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,860
♫  If I had smiled more?  ♫

605
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,230
♫  Would it have been different for us?  ♫

606
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,160
♫  If I had hugged you then  ♫

607
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,550
♫  If I hadn't let go of your hand  ♫

608
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:05,740
♫  Could we go back to those happy times?  ♫

609
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:11,200
♫  No matter how much I hypothesize now  ♫

610
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:19,400
♫  I know nothing will change  ♫

611
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,250
♫  I just keep thinking of those days  ♫

612
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:32,200
♫  I'm regretting it again like this!  ♫

613
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,440
♫  If I had held onto you  ♫

614
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,800
♫  If I'd treated you better  ♫

615
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,260
♫  Would it have been different for us?  ♫

616
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,010
♫  If I could see you again  ♫

617
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,400
♫  If it's not too late  ♫

618
00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:05,400
♫  Could we go back to when we were in love?  ♫

619
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,410
 Great work. 

620
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,720
Oppa.

621
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,400
Oppa!

622
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,280
Oppa!

623
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,690
Oppa.

624
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,120
Hey, don't call me "Oppa."

625
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,770
That is right. I should keep a serious face.

626
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,460
Don't call me that. It's annoying.

627
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,500
No. What I can tell you won't annoy at all.

628
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,820
What is it?

629
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,260
I can't tell you for free.

630
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,520
Wow! Do you want a deal?

631
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,920
I don't make a deal without a hint.

632
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,800
Ju Eun Ho.

633
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,360
And?

634
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,750
No. First, listen to my deal's terms.

635
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,660
What are they? Make it quick.

636
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,680
As you know, there are too many rumors about the Press Director and me.

637
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,050
- And? 
 - So…

638
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,260
can you pretend to date me?

639
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,560
If you pretend to be my boyfriend, those rumors will naturally stop.

640
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,200
That just feels like a lousy favor to ask. I don't feel like it.

641
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,970
I see. Despite my info about Ju Eun Ho?

642
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,460
Her name alone won't convince me to do that favor for you.

643
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,520
You know, Oppa, I saw Ju Eun Ho.

644
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,950
Why? Are you more tempted now?

645
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,610
 When are we starting? 

646
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,520
 What? 

647
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,030
 Hey! 

648
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,820
 Hey, phone… 

649
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,340
 Does anyone have a phone? Call 911! 

650
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,430
 Excuse me. 

651
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:38,990
 Excuse me! 

652
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,940
 Can you hear me? 

653
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,890
 Can you move? 

654
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,460
 Are you okay? 

655
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
 Ju Eun… 

656
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,200
 W-Wait! You can't go! We called 911! 

657
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,230
 Wait! Wh-Where are you going? 

658
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,910
 Then gosh… 

659
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:35,290
- Are you sure? 
 - I can't be entirely sure, but…

660
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,850
Hey.

661
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,750
I mean, I think I'm quite certain.

662
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,730
Where did you see her?

663
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,750
I'll text it to you.

664
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,570
But—

665
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,850
It might not have been her.

666
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,230
Hey, Hyun Oh. Answer the phone, the phone!

667
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,980
The phone!

668
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,850
Never mind.

669
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,080
Where's Ji On?

670
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,720
Ji On left. Didn't you let him go early?

671
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,910
Oh, right. I did.

672
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,310
Hyun Oh, the phone—

673
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,160
Yes, this is Kim Shin Joong.

674
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,100
Aigoo, hello.

675
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,700
Hello, everyone! It's me! The hidden gem of PPS!

676
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:49,350
Jeon Jae Yong! Jeon Jae... Hyungnim! Where are you going?

677
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,400
 Hyungnim! Team Leader! Hyungnim! 

678
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,120
 Hyungnim! 

679
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,690
 Hyungnim! Open the door, Hyungnim! 

680
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,090
 Hyungnim! Open! Hyungnim! 

681
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,650
Hyun Oh, the reason I'm here

682
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:20,630
is because I want to comfort you.

683
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,700
Last time, I noticed you were in a very bad mood,

684
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,710
then I thought about it.

685
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,760
Is it because you didn't make the 9 o'clock news?

686
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,020
But you couldn't help not making the 9:00 p.m. news.

687
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,700
I'm more stressed as the anchor for 9 o'clock news.

688
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,720
Because…

689
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,180
the weight of the crown for the 9 o'clock news is heavy.

690
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,430
You know that, don't you?

691
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,800
No, I don't. I've never worn it.

692
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,250
No! Someday, you will. Do you know when?

693
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,980
When I retire and leave.

694
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:01,150
Then you'll do 9 o'clock news, and you'll find out

695
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,900
the weight of this crown.

696
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,730
Hyun Oh, you can do it, too! So don't be so depressed.

697
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,070
Sure, okay.

698
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,300
Hey, Hyun Oh. Eun Ho…

699
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,700
N-No, no. I didn't mean to talk about Eun Ho…

700
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,250
Wh-What was I going to talk about? W-Well…

701
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,960
Oh, right! I wanted to tell you that you can do it, too!

702
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,000
Because I'm the best news anchor on the planet, but I think you're second!

703
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,870
I mean it. You're handsome, though not as handsome as me.

704
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,790
Your diction is good, though not as good as…

705
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,610
I-It's okay. D-Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

706
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:05,110
So… Wow! I…

707
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,940
Th-The phone.

708
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,480
The phone…

709
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,040
Hello?

710
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,750
Yes, yes, hello! 
    

711
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,730
Can I speak to Ju Eun Ho? 
    

712
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,920
 Kang Ju Yeon, Hye Ri isn't here today— 

713
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,990
Excuse me, Kim Min Yeong.

714
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,950
I want to report her as missing.

715
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,650
How long do you think Hye Ri will be gone?

716
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,450
Will she ever come back?

717
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,900
When will that be?

718
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,320
   

719
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,270
   

720
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,390
   

721
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:51,250
   

722
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,970
   

723
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,180
   

724
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,670
   

725
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,060
Good evening.

726
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,450
Aigoo, what brings you here?

727
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,590
Ju Eun Ho…

728
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:09,420
Aigoo. You got here quickly.

729
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,630
She was living alone in a rundown mountain cabin.

730
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,200
I felt so bad for her.

731
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,290
Since there was no activity, you might have thought she was dead.

732
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:22,030
She was living in the middle of nowhere.

733
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:25,110
Of course, there wasn't any activity.

734
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,140
You can sign here and take her home.

735
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,400
   

736
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,820
You can sign here and take her home.

737
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,030
Who…

738
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,990
What do you mean?

739
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:55,250
Ju Hye Ri, who went missing ten years ago.

740
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:15,000


741
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:36,920
   

742
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,930
 I'm just curious. 

743
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:07,550
 What should I call you? 

744
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,460
 Anyway, you aren't Eun Ho, are you? 

745
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,290
 Should I call you Hye Ri?
