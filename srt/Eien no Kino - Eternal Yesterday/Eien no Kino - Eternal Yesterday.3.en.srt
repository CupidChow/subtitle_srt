♫ To the day that has passed ♫

[Episode 3]

10
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,840
Wow!

11
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:51,473
This is real summer heat! I love it!

12
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:53,450
It's perfect for barbecue, isn't it?

13
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,333
I brought a lot of meat.

14
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,078
Okay, let's walk to work up an appetite.

15
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,579
Is that okay, Micchan?

16
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:01,483
I guess.

17
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:03,140
All right!

18
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,356
Let's go to the beach first.

19
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,905
Last year's summer.

20
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:10,436
Koichi convinced me to come with him

21
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:13,171
to the camping grounds near the beach.

22
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:17,944
A short trip of two days and one night.

23
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:22,021
Honestly, I didn't want to go.

24
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,520
Micchan!

25
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:26,664
Hurry up!

26
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,622
Let's go to the beach!

27
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,291
Do you prefer the beach or the mountains?

28
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,268
- The mountains.
- The mountains?

29
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,356
So, do you like mountains?

30
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:39,883
I like the beach more.

31
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,361
I planned for us to go to both today,

32
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,272
so you'll see how great the beach is.

33
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:48,436
- Well, actually...
- Wow, the weather's great!

34
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,287
- I really wanted to come.
- We'll swim.

35
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:54,200
- And yet, I also didn't want to come.
- We'll fish too.

36
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,756
I like doing a barbecue with the fishes I catch.

37
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,581
Wow.

38
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:05,408
I always take the car when I come with family,

39
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,639
but walking is somewhat incredible.

40
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,941
The view feels totally different.

41
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,169
Here, Micchan.

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,860
You need fluids to avoid heatstroke.

43
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,190
Here.

44
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:51,329
I tried desperately to not feel elated.

45
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,115
I see.

46
00:02:55,116 --> 00:03:00,455
Geez, I feel like we should've seen the ocean by now.

47
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,161
Maybe we're lost.

48
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,977
I'm the one who's lost.

49
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,005
I'm...

50
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:14,628
Back then, I was already aware of my feelings toward Koichi.

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,979
Micchan, that looks good on you.

52
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,498
Ever since I was born, I was never interested in girls,

53
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:44,747
especially not in a romantic way.

54
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:48,835
I thought I was just not interested in other people,

55
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,623
but I was wrong.

56
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:54,401
Yeah, we're on the right road.

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,608
All right.

58
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:05,465
When we got to the beach, the sky was covered in clouds.

59
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:12,331
It was as if the weather was matching my ambiguous feelings.

60
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,100
Yeah!

61
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,890
The ocean!

62
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,900
Whoa!

63
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,758
This feels great!

64
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,295
Hey Micchan, the water's great!

65
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:54,706
Whoa, oops!

66
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,505
Oh, I see.

67
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,225
I'm a man who likes men.

68
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:23,811
And when I realized I see Koichi that way,

69
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,050
I felt depressed.

70
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,528
I felt guilty toward Koichi, who was so carefree.

71
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,014
I thought if he finds out how I feel,

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,281
he wouldn't reprimand me.

73
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,050
He'd understand the rights of minorities,

74
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,078
be open-minded,

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,245
and probably say...

76
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,409
Sorry, Micchan.

77
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:04,870
I'm sorry I can't be like that for you.

78
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:14,117
Hey, Micchan! Get over here!

79
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:18,654
I found a huge jellyfish over here!

80
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:22,034
Just imagining it made me feel despair.

81
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,329
I wouldn't just get rejected.

82
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,748
I'd also lose the first close friend I ever had.

83
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,074
All right, I'm putting it through.

84
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:41,248
It's that green thing over there.

85
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,997
- Pull that. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,168
All right. That looks great.

87
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,139
Oh, that went in smoothly.

88
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,661
- How does that look?
- I've been doing well.

89
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:57,176
- At school and at home.
- Okay, so if this is put in there... Do you see this?

90
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:01,631
-But here...
- There's this long silver thing.

91
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:04,241
- in this open, isolating space...
- It's this cylinder.

92
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:08,138
- I'm sleeping in a tent with Koichi.
- Put it through the hole.

93
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:10,490
I wasn't sure if I could keep it in.

94
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:13,833
Ready to pull it up on three?

95
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,600
All right, we have to do it together.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,000
Whoa! This is tough! You got this, Micchan?

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
It went in.

98
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,500
It did? That was fast.

99
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,592
All right, mine too.

100
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:29,279
Now the other side.

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,873
Can you insert it the same way you did with this side?

102
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:37,108
Yes, the fire's looking good.

103
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,309
I'm getting excited.

104
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,700
Hey Micchan, this barbecue is looking great.

105
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:47,900
All right. Look, I brought all kinds of great ingredients.

106
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,800
I got cabbage, corn, and green peppers, which I don't like that much.

107
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,489
And I have mushrooms and onions.

108
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,467
And special meat marinated for 24 hours.

109
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,800
There's garlic, onions, and what else?

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,973
Anyway, it's all marinated in the Yamada family's secret sauce.

111
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:10,200
This stuff tastes delicious.

112
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,900
And I also brought fireworks for later.

113
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,340
Ta-da!

114
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:21,132
This stuff is out of this world, too.

115
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's eat it later as a late-night snack.

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,500
All right.

117
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,749
How's everything going on your end?

118
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,232
- I'm almost done.
- The weather that day and myself

119
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,686
- Phew.
- were one and the same.

120
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,500
Come here when you're done.

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,600
It started raining.

122
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,400
The barbecue was canceled.

123
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,310
Sorry, Micchan.

124
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm really sorry.

125
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Why are you apologizing?

126
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm the one who invited you. Sorry.

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm sorry it started raining.

128
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,900
It's fine.

129
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,300
The rain isn't your fault.

130
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,100
- But...
- Stop apologizing. It's annoying.

131
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,100
Micchan...

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
Ugh, seriously.

133
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
I was at my limit.

134
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Koichi was right by my side.

135
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,000
His smell was so close to me.

136
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
You didn't want to come, right?

137
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,000
I never said that.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,300
I could tell from your attitude.

139
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm sorry for forcing you to come

140
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
and for having fun on my own.

141
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,365
- I never...
- I was getting all excited on my own

142
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:56,987
while you weren't into it at all.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
- That's not...
- It's just me!

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,134
It's always like that.

145
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,713
It's always just me.

146
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm always the one who wants to sing karaoke, shop, or play games.

147
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,200
You only just tag along without saying you don't want to.

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,100
-That's...
- It's just me. It's only me.

149
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,452
But say something at least.

150
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,530
Just say you don't want to go.

151
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,575
Stop acting so annoyed by it.

152
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:31,800
If you just said no, I would back off.

153
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,100
I wouldn't be so persistent.

154
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,700
You're not being fair.

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,500
What?

156
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,700
You don't need friends. You like being alone.

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,700
You act like you want no one near you, but you treat me differently.

158
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Like it's okay sometimes if it's me.

159
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Stop doing that already!

160
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,900
What the hell? It pisses me off!

161
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,206
It seriously pisses me off!

162
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:10,900
What the hell?

163
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,900
What do you take my feelings for?

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
Huh?

165
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,100
Micchan.

166
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,500
Um...

167
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,300
I...

168
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Well...

169
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Micchan... Micchan.

170
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Dammit.

171
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Micchan, I'm sorry.

172
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,400
See? There you go again.

173
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
You always apologize.

174
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,600
You give in, even when you did nothing wrong.

175
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,940
That's why I...

176
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,697
I'm really sorry, Micchan.

177
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:54,700
Go away!

178
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,839
You're just...

179
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,649
You know?

180
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,346
What?

181
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:16,466
Yeah, sorry.

182
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,371
Don't yell at me.

183
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,420
That freaked me out.

184
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,754
You were so intense.

185
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:33,307
Yeah, um...

186
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:34,885
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,239
I didn't mean to scare you.

188
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:49,037
Just so you know,

189
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:53,719
I did want to come camping.

190
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,040
I see.

191
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,217
Okay.

192
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,819
Going to karaoke and playing games...

193
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,970
I wanted to do those too.

194
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:17,060
I was afraid of hearing you say

195
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,159
you didn't want to hang out with me.

196
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,912
So...

197
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:34,978
Really?

198
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,267
I'm glad.

199
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,866
I see.

200
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,522
I'm glad.

201
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:57,809
I'm really glad.

202
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,269
Actually,

203
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,594
you're special to me.

204
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:33,612
You're special to me too.

205
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:40,370
In fact, you're my number one.

206
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:52,925
I like you more than anyone else.

207
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:10,083
That's why it crossed my mind.

208
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:18,319
I wanted to be your number one too.

209
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,621
Even though I know that's impossible.

210
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,603
I couldn't help it.

211
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,250
You are.

212
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:56,937
You're my number one, Koichi.

213
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:01,700
What?

214
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,540
You're kidding.

215
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,364
I'm not kidding.

216
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:22,397
Micchan, I'm your number one?

217
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,634
Yeah.

218
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,457
Then...

219
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:48,325
Does that mean...

220
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,135
we both like each other?

221
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,992
Does... it?

222
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,330
It does.

223
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,580
♫ Two shadows, overlapping and separating ♫

224
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,660
♫ Fooling around on the way home ♫

225
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,305
I was scared.

226
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,533
I was really scared of Koichi that day.

227
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,273
Not because I was yelled at.

228
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,768
Koichi was mad at me.

229
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:01,855
That was what scared me.

230
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,500
♫ We pretend to be fine ♫

231

♫ In order to burn with love ♫

♫ Blooming in summer and coloring the night sky ♫

[Preview]
Did you two do something special?

237
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:54,937
It's true that it was special.

238
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:59,934
Micchan, can I bite your ear?
