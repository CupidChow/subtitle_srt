1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,577
But Micchan, aren't I creepy?

2
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,434
As I said, you're not.

3
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:09,124
Koichi is a corpse.

4
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,756
If I were you, I would be really creeped out.

5
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,600
He's a living corpse.

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:17,100
So I would be creepy if I were a corpse?

7
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,182
No, of course not.

8
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:22,097
I wouldn't mind if you were,

9
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,053
because it's you.

10
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:28,261
But I'm the corpse here.

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,793
It's scary for me that I'm a corpse.

12
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,845
That's why...

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,205
Micchan.

14
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:44,710
That night we did something special.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,100
♫ I would like to send my unvoiced feelings ♫

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,060
♫ To the day that has passed ♫

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,240
♫ "I miss you" ♫

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,120
♫ A momentary illusion once again ♫

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,140
♫ I would like to keep seeing this squeaky day ♫

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,120
♫ True love is always there ♫

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,450
♫ The pouring rain and the light ♫

[Eternal Yesterday]

23
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,312
[Episode 4]

24
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:32,879
Koichi had been a corpse for 24 hours.

25
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,800
You were sleep-talking last night.

26
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:45,539
I couldn't hear you very well, but you were so cute.

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,590
You spoke this morning too.

28
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:50,928
You didn't sleep?

29
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,140
Nope.

30
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,934
I couldn't sleep at all.

31
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,576
I'm fine even without it.

32
00:01:56,576 --> 00:02:01,136
Last night, Koichi stayed at my house.

33
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:06,907
We were worried that Koichi's family would find out he's a corpse.

34
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,952
I checked Koichi's pulse first thing this morning,

35
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,578
and it was silent, as expected.

36
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:22,528
But his temperature was pretty much the same as a regular human's.

37
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:26,704
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

38
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,379
- Hey, are you still a corpse?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,942
Oh, but you don't look pale at all. Is it makeup?

40
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,889
I'd never use makeup.

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,842
Oh, seriously?

42
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,706
You don't look like a corpse at all.

43
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:43,093
Why're you at school so early?

44
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,967
Well, Sumi-chan is...

45
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,483
What about Kagamiya?

46
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,602
Oh, Ogawa Sensei!

47
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:55,430
Ogawa Sensei, good morning...

48
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,819
Sorry, what were we talking about?

49
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,850
Oh, about Kagamiya.

50
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,987
Right, you'll know in the classroom.

51
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,285
Oh, okay.

52
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,522
This girl is Kagamiya Sumiko.

53
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:49,756
Morning.

54
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:54,405
Her family runs a shrine, and they say she sees spirits.

55
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,887
Something felt off.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,506
What?

57
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:06,612
Huh?

58
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,178
Yeah, you're dead.

59
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:13,030
But you are in your body having a normal temperature.

60
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,490
Huh?

61
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:19,191
Oumi-kun, Yamada-kun is really dead.

62
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:26,655
Kagamiya, Koichi isn't dead.

63
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:29,037
He's a living corpse.

64
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:32,050
Indeed, that's the correct definition.

65
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,210
Anyway, this is amazing.

66
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,147
I've never seen an oni in the flesh before.

67
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,241
It's kind of exciting.

68
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,513
Micchan, help me.

69
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:46,850
Kagamiya.

70
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,565
What do you mean by "oni"?

71
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,468
It's basically a dead person.

72
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:57,977
You call them like that after they passed away.
(T/N: Kiseki = pass away)

73
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,163
Miracle?
(T/N: "Miracle" and "pass away" are pronounced the same way)

74
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,514
Koichi, you've got it wrong.

75
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:05,948
An oni is someone who has passed away.

76
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:16,785
But, Sumi-chan, Yamada doesn't look like an oni at all.

77
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,465
He has no horns

78
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,681
and looks like a normal high school student.

79
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,825
Yeah, but he's probably an oni.

80
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,940
What?

81
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,390
- Oh, Gods in the heavens.
- What is this?

82
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:44,184
Bring good fortune.

83
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,704
Wait, Kagami...

84
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,032
Huh?

85
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,665
Yeah, I knew that would work.

86
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,775
Hey, what did you do?

87
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,623
What? I sealed him away.

88
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,434
"Sealed him away"?

89
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:02,945
This only works on oni.

90
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,653
It doesn't work with the living.

91
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:08,257
- So Yamada-kun is definitely an oni...
- Kagamiya, stop it.

92
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,407
Bring him back now.

93
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:11,952
Oumi-kun.

94
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:15,598
Oni are usually meant to be sealed away.

95
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,894
Koichi didn't do anything.

96
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,870
He hasn't put us in any danger.

97
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,307
Is that true?

98
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:25,643
Well, if my sealing skills have defeated him, he must be really weak.

99
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:27,444
Then what's the problem?

100
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,690
Stop this already.

101
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,445
I guess that's fine. I don't think he'll eat us.

102
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:38,226
What? Oni eat people?

103
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:41,041
Yeah, oni live to eat humans.

104
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,272
No, I can't handle that.

105
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:44,749
Remove the talisman.

106
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,761
He'll start moving again.

107
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,299
I thought I was going to die.

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,827
That was mean, Kagamiya.

109
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,736
Yeah, sorry.

110
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,828
I'd never eat anyone.

111
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,295
That'd taste awful.

112
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,089
Well, there are many ways to eat one.

113
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,329
To maintain your body, you need someone's life force, vitality,

114
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,480
or something equal...

115
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:19,605
Hey, were you two together all day yesterday?

116
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,031
Yeah.

117
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:32,091
Did you two do something special?

118
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:36,596
S-Special? Special?

119
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:40,564
Of course, we wouldn't do something like that.

120
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:43,480
Right, Micchan?

121
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:46,967
We did.

122
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,752
You can tell from how flustered Koichi got.

123
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,615
It's true that we did something special.

124
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:06,007
Last night, Koichi slept over at my house for the first time.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,403
Aren't you hungry?

126
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,930
No, I'm fine.

127
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,078
But you didn't eat lunch.

128
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,096
Yeah, but I'm completely fine.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Your mom's good at cooking, huh?

130
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,100
It's more trendy than what we eat.

131
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,500
No, our maid made this.

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
My mom died long ago.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
What?

134
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,600
You think you overstepped, don't you?

135
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
Yeah.

136
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,400
Sorry, I didn't know.

137
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,674
Don't apologize.

138
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:51,900
I never told you. I didn't think it was necessary.

139
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,800
I mean, it was over a decade ago.

140
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,891
I see. Sorry.

141
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:08,300
Stop apologizing.

142
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Oh, sorry...

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,500
I messed up.

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,000
I was the one who overstepped.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,500
I didn't want Koichi to truly feel like he died.

146
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,800
I somehow thought that might make him disappear.

147
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,700
Go wash up.

148
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm fine.

149
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,800
Why?

150
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,278
I feel like if I take a bath, my body might rot.

151
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm sure it's fine. It was hot and humid all day.

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
What's wrong?

153
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Micchan.

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm dead, aren't I?

155
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,300
You're not dead.

156
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
You're just a corpse.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
That's the same.

158
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
It's weird.

159
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
It's not natural.

160
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm almost a zombie.

161
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,400
Zombies can't talk and lack self-awareness.

162
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,800
You don't hate me, Micchan?

163
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
Not at all.

164
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,800
What's the matter? Cheer up.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Don't ask so much of a corpse.

166
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,900
Corpse or not, you're still alive.

167
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,000
You know,

168
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,400
I can believe aliens and UFOs are real,

169
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
but not a living corpse.

170
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Who cares if you believe it or not?

171
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,100
You're here, and you exist.

172
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
Yeah, but...

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,800
And this kind of thing happens sometimes.

174
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,400
What?

175
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,512
I've seen a ghost before.

176
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:47,900
Seriously?

177
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah, only my mother's.

178
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
No way.

179
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,700
She had legs, and we even locked eyes.

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,400
This may be rude to your mother, but that's honestly scary.

181
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,500
I wouldn't call it "scary."

182
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,400
She was scarier alive.

183
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,500
Somehow, she was always watching me

184
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,100
and didn't go easy on me.

185
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Anyway, she'd be really strict.

186
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,600
I see.

187
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't have any memories of my mother patting my head or hugging me.

188
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm sure she did when I was a baby,

189
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
but I don't remember that.

190
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,500
Wow.

191
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,800
Whenever I visited her in the hospital,

192
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
I'd tense up.

193
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,600
"Are you being a good boy?"

194
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,500
"Are you studying?"

195
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,300
"Are you being picky?"

196
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,400
"Keep a straight posture."

197
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
That was it.

198
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,600
But my mother as a ghost

199
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
would smile kindly when our eyes met.

200
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,900
I never saw that face when she was alive.

201
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,700
I see.

202
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,333
Anyway, your heart stopped beating, but everything else is normal.

203
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:03,795
No, not normal, but special.

204
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:06,477
You don't feel pain from injuries.

205
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,431
You can live happily.

206
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,769
Aren't you invincible now?

207
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,244
You're like a superhero.

208
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,895
You could beat the world in martial arts.

209
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:19,610
But Micchan,

210
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,071
aren't I creepy?

211
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,166
As I said, you're not.

212
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:30,526
If I were you, I'd be really creeped out.

213
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,517
So I'd be creepy if I were a corpse?

214
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:36,628
No, of course not.

215
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,559
I wouldn't mind if you were,

216
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,502
because it's you.

217
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:45,637
But I'm the corpse here.

218
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,676
It's scary for me that I'm a corpse.

219
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,203
That's why...

220
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:57,316
Micchan...

221
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,649
Koichi's lips were incredibly cold.

222
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,958
I wanted to give him some of my warmth.

223
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:11,196
I wouldn't do this if I thought you were creepy.

224
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:14,384
Micchan.

225
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:16,925
Don't say anything, so...

226
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:18,703
Micchan.

227
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,689
Micchan, you never change.

228
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:34,986
Your thoughts alone are enough for me.

229
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,695
Whoa!

230
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:53,677
What is it?

231
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,228
Huh?

232
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:59,745
What is this?

233
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,918
I'm a corpse, right?

234
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,339
What's wrong?

235
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,755
I mean, um...

236
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:16,819
Whoa!

237
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:19,910
Right?

238
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,198
You're kidding.

239
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,032
Micchan.

240
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:37,775
I feel kind of hot.

241
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,110
It's true.

242
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,870
You're hot.

243
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,854
You're burning up.

244
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:55,595
Ugh, I'm at my limit.

245
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:58,115
Micchan.

246
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,549
I...

247
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,641
Ouch. That hurts.

248
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,993
Koichi?

249
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,927
Micchan, can I bite your earlobe?

250
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:24,176
What?

251
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,076
I'm biting it.

252
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,547
Okay.

253
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,878
Th-That's a lot.

254
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,790
That... feels kind of... weird.

255
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:58,161
I love your voice.

256
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,452
Idiot.

257
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,936
Micchan.

258
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,055
Let me touch it.

259
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,884
Can I?

260
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,221
Good night, Micchan.

261
00:20:57,344 --> 00:21:00,425
I slept in Koichi's arm.

262
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,227
It was warm.

263
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:08,200
It was an indescribable happiness. A special feeling.

264
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,770
Maybe this is what they call being at peace.

265
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,476
Oumi.

266
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:16,258
Earth to Oumi.

267
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,634
Sorry.

268
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:23,281
I can't think of anything special.

269
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:30,299
I see.

270
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,705
Wait, what is this?

271
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:37,723
Well, Yamada is able to move around,

272
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:41,198
so he needs some kind of energy.

273
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:45,613
I think it might be a different metabolism compared to organic bodies.

274
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:49,059
I see.

275
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:53,569
But isn't it too much to expect proper order in occultism?

276
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,025
You could say that.

277
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:59,402
If there's an order, then there'd be no mystery.

278
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,415
Wait, I'm not following.

279
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:02,488
Me neither.

280
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,622
Sorry, Iku-chan.

281
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:10,566
Well, I just think Yamada-kun is absorbing some kind of energy from somewhere

282
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,682
without realizing it.

283
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,834
I don't know the details either.

284
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,195
But...

285
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,457
But?

286
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,853
Um...

287
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:29,845
I think it's only a matter of time.

288
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:35,331
"A matter of time"?

289
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,834
What do you mean?

00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,237
