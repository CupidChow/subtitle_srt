1
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:09,011
Is it a cold?

2
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:10,816
Are you feeling chilly?

3
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:14,179
Don't exaggerate, it was just a sneeze.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,824
You are so overprotective.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,552
Sorry.

6
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:25,053
We walk to school toward the high school's side gate every morning.

7
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:28,786
Hey.

8
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,863
What is it, Micchan?

9
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,974
Why are you always on my left, Koichi?

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,344
The main gate doesn't open until 7:30 a.m.

11
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:42,665
Because of basketball practice,

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,681
Koichi had to go earlier than this.

13
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:47,980
So we used the side gate instead.

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,088
I'm not in any clubs nor do any sport, so I don't have any morning practice.

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,992
I tag along with him anyway,

16
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:06,966
but I shouldn't have come on this day.

17
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,108
The rain.

18
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,009
The rain was...

19
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,381
incredibly cold.

29
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,898
Oumi!

30
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,493
Hey, come on, Oumi!

31
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,911
Thank you!

32
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:46,235
That class just now was so confusing.

33
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,725
You're amazing. This is so easy to understand.

34
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:52,636
So much better than our Class President.

35
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:53,871
What?

36
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,856
If only you were sociable, you would be perfect.

37
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,502
Right, Sumi-chan?

38
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,368
Try laughing for us.

39
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,264
I can laugh if I want.

40
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,840
But is there actually anything funny in this world?

41
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,667
Wow, you're not cute at all.

42
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,079
No, Micchan is cute.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,350
What?

44
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:17,102
In gym class earlier, all we did was run,

45
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:20,391
but he almost tripped over his own feet.

46
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:21,830
It was so cute.

47
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:24,470
I was speechless.

48
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,343
I wish I had a video.

49
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,293
Sorry.

50
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:38,249
My name is Oumi Mitsuru.

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,599
The only one who calls me "Micchan" in this school is Koichi.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,920
Yamada Koichi is the only one.

53
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,367
We met two years ago, in Spring.

54
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:54,367
It rained that day as well.

55
00:03:56,206 --> 00:04:01,276
How many high schoolers were living

56
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:05,044
in Japan that year? I don't know.

57
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,181
I bet the number is pretty high.

58
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:15,482
This sucks.

59
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:22,230
Of all those people, Koichi enrolled in the same school as me,

60
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,341
was put in the same class,

61
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,289
and happened to make eye contact with me.

62
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,744
You could statistically call it a miracle.

63
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:34,355
Geez, but seriously, how'd his hair get so wet?

64
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,177
Oh, really? You noticed?

65
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,684
That's a lot.

66
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,201
Whoa, you're getting me wet.

67
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,531
Stop, you're making me wet.

68
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,747
- You're already wet.
- That's true.

69
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:46,928
Thank god practice was canceled. Today's practice looked tough.

70
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:24,311
But I can't consider it a miracle.

71
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:27,814
After all, "miracle" is a lazy word.

72
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:31,052
It's nice when you want to stop thinking,

73
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,402
but it can become a habit.

74
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:39,377
It wasn't a coincidence that we'd often meet each other's eyes.

75
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:41,741
It was because I was looking his way.

76
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:44,015
Wow.

77
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,564
That lunch is really typical for you, Sumi-chan.

78
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,629
I packed it with my wishes.

79
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,087
- What wishes?
- I can't tell yet.

80
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:57,657
Well, whatever. What did you bring, Yamada?

81
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,117
Well, I...

82
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,897
I was watching Koichi

83
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,198
because he was already popular.

84
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,001
Here we go!

85
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,945
What? Isn't that too much?

86
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,942
Isn't that the size of Kagami's face?

87
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:25,923
Well, my mom gets too excited every morning.

88
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,237
But still...

89
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,836
Can you eat all that?

90
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:32,191
I could finish that.

91
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,242
It's impossible, Sumi-chan.

92
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,900
I don't think anyone can.

93
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,245
I'll be right back.

94
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:06,010
Oumi, right?

95
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,725
Yeah, so what?

96
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,690
Can we talk?

97
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:26,418
Half a month after our eyes first met,

98
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,328
Koichi called me outside.

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
What?

You know, regarding sports and stuff.

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,900
Tennis. But I quit.

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,900
I play basketball... very actively.

Are we done here?

106
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
Can I leave?

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,900
Wait a second.

Can't we become friends?

What do you mean?

110
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,200
Well, you know, friends

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
that hang out with each other.

112
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't need anyone to hang out with.

113
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:14,218
Then we can chat.

114
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,366
I don't need that, either.

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,700
Then we can be silent together.

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,900
"Silent together"?

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,900
But eat lunch with me.

118
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,400
Of course, we can do that in silence.

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,900
Is there anything I would gain from this?

Sorry, maybe there isn't.

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There isn't, huh?

122
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
There's nothing really good about me.

123
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:06,400
I can play basketball, but that's irrelevant to you.

124
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,100
And I'm not smart like you.

125
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,700
You...

126
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:18,997
Your name is Yamada, right?

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Yeah, it's Yamada. Yamada Koichi.

128
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,600
My name is ordinary, too.

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Oumi is a nice name. Oumi Mitsuru.

130
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,100
It's a pretty name.

131
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,400
It reminds me of the sea.

132
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,800
My name uses the character for "sea." You would read it as "blue sea."

133
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
I see.

134
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I never said yes or no in the end.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,900
I just stayed silent.

136
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,800
Koichi took my silence as tacit agreement.

137
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,700
At first, we really just ate our lunches in silence.

138
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,900
Koichi's giant lunch box was always packed with side dishes.

139
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,700
He always had rolled omelets and sausages.

140
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Always in an octopus shape.

141
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,700
Maybe it's a rule in the Yamada family.

142
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,500
Crab sausage?

143
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
It's like my lunch was made for a kid, right?

144
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,000
I think it's fine.

145
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,800
I have two younger siblings. A brother and a sister.

146
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,000
My brother is in kindergarten, so my lunch is always...

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,900
Making octopuses is fine, but crabs seem tricky.

148
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,674
What?

149
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:19,500
I mean, how would you cut the sausage?

150
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,310
Oh, the shape? That stuff interests you?

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,695
Well, kind of.

152
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Look.

153
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:37,200
Oh, you cut it from both sides.

154
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,500
Yeah, it's pretty easy. I can make it too.

155
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,700
But the sausage has to be red, or it won't look like a crab.

156
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,400
Here.

157
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,005
What?

158
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,700
Eat it.

159
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,200
How was it?

160
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,300
Yeah, pretty normal.

161
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,400
Right?

162
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,800
From that day onward, we slowly started talking a bit more.

163
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:31,223
And we'd leave school together.

164
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:34,400
Have you ever gone camping before?

165
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,097
No.

166
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,700
Oh, really?

167
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,600
Our family goes camping every year.

168
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,300
It's really fun. You get to barbecue and go to the beach.

169
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,600
Man, I really want to chomp down on a huge chunk of barbecue.

170
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,015
But we're probably just having hot pot today.

171
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:59,996
Fried chicken would be nice once in a while.

172
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:02,694
And we'd walk together in the mornings too.

173
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm so tired.

174
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,000
Aren't you sleepy?

175
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:13,626
Morning practice is tough.

176
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:17,300
For some reason, Koichi always walks on my left.

177
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,300
It's okay, I'll sleep during class.

178
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
It's summer break.

179
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,494
He begged me to help with his summer homework.

180
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,400
Oumi!

181
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Sorry I made you wait.

182
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Let's go.

183
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,560
Oumi, about this...

184
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,323
Hey.

185
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,001
I'm at a loss with question 14 on page 22.

186
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:13,159
Could you teach me?

187
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:22,347
For this, you start by gathering these numbers together.

188
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,472
Then, 4x is...

189
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:29,253
Um... minus...

190
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:31,784
Are you listening?

191
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,161
Yeah.

192
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,697
Then it's 2x...

193
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:44,298
We agreed I wouldn't have to do this, and yet...

194
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,372
What a shrewd guy.

195
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,754
Thanks for having me.

196
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,758
Whoa, this is huge!

197
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,756
This is so big! Seriously?

198
00:16:56,757 --> 00:17:00,292
Sometimes, we did homework at my house too.

199
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:02,262
You have so much expensive stuff.

200
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,456
Stop looking so much.

201
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:08,136
Whoa, this TV is huge!

202
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,635
It'd be fun to play games on this.

203
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,384
Is this your mom, Oumi?

204
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,792
Yeah.

205
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:23,735
Wow. She surely looks like you.

206
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,334
- It becomes negative six.
- Yeah.

207
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:28,739
We went to Koichi's house too.

208
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,824
And when that happens...

209
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:34,122
3x is bigger than negative six.

210
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:35,825
Micchan! Micchan!

211
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,248
What is it, Minato?

212
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:39,499
Play with me.

213
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,789
Micchan, let's play!

214
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,110
Come on, this isn't the time to play.

215
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,101
- We're studying.
- We want to play superheroes.

216
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:47,783
We can't play superheroes.

217
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,132
We want to play!

218
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,912
We can't play with you.

219
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,132
Don't interrupt our studies, okay?

220
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,702
Well, in that case...

221
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:56,428
What're you... Come on.

222
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:59,983
Geez, seriously, you two.

223
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:03,127
Don't interrupt Micchan's studies.

224
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:05,334
Here's some fried chicken.

225
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,144
- Yes, fried chicken!
- Fried chicken!

226
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,855
Eat some too, Micchan.

227
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,933
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.

228
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,769
So good!

229
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,704
But we're always too busy dealing with his younger siblings,

230
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,039
so we don't get any homework done.

231
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,574
From angle AHC...

232
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:29,493
I could tell that I was changing.

233
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:32,825
Ever since I was a kid, I was diligently building a wall,

234
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,277
or some kind of barrier around me.

235
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,801
And Koichi tore it down.

236
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:40,531
Now I get it. That was so easy to understand.

237
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:41,678
Yeah.

238
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,811
See? Isn't he amazing?

239
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:46,274
Micchan is amazing, right?

240
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,086
Tore it down?

241
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,164
That's not quite right.

242
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:52,666
He built a door.

243
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,821
A door without a lock.

244
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,905
But I didn't get anxious about it.

245
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,111
Oh, so that's how you do it?

246
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,353
Then, 3C...

247
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:12,228
Hey, Oumi! What're you going to do about this?

248
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:15,124
Your exam target was off!

249
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,756
What the hell? Move, Yamada.

250
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:26,004
Koichi was always standing in front of my door.

251
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,329
That was enough for me.

252
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:33,808
As long as he was always with me.

253
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:49,196
Yet in the blink of an eye, Koichi...

254
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:57,701
Is it a cold?

255
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:59,478
Are you feeling chilly?

256
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:02,819
Don't exaggerate, it was just a sneeze.

257
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,551
You are so overprotective.

258
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,305
Sorry.

259
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,295
Hey.

260
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:20,544
What, Micchan?

261
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:23,463
Why are you always on my left, Koichi?

262
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:27,931
Oh, you noticed?

263
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,537
Yeah.

264
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:32,564
Obviously, I'm doing it to be your shield.

265
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:35,587
What?

266
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:38,455
Well, you never know when a ball might fly over

267
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:41,531
or when a bike might come crashing in.

268
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,176
And I'm right-handed.

269
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,888
But your right hand is holding an umbrella.

270
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,049
It's okay.

271
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,162
If a ball comes, I'll do this.

272
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:52,604
And if it's a bike, I'll go, "Wham!"

273
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:55,761
- You got me wet.
- Oh, sorry.

274
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,306
And a ball's never flown over.

275
00:20:57,307 --> 00:21:00,012
In fact, you're the one who always flies over. Twice.

276
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,172
Oh, really?

277
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:04,557
You threw yourself at me over a dead cicada.

278
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,385
But it's all right.

279
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,974
It was in the blink of an eye.

280
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,512
What the hell?

281
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:30,644
It was so sudden, it was inevitable.

282
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,151
I couldn't do anything.

283
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,686
Koichi?

284
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,476
Koichi.

285
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,647
Koichi!

286
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:32,050
Koichi!

287
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,687
In the blink of an eye,

288
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,608
Koichi became a dead body.

Koichi, you're probably...

296
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:48,959
Chaos is inevitable.

297
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,683
I want to tell everyone in class and let them help out.

That's absurd!
- Still, we'll do it.

The situation is already absurd.

Aren't you scared of him?
