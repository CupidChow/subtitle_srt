00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:30,192
Ogawa... Sensei?

2
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,418
Ogawa Sensei!

3
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:50,133
This is bad!

4
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,546
What happened?

5
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,655
Ogawa Sensei is...

6
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:55,055
What?

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,300
♫ I would like to send my unvoiced feelings ♫

8
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,320
♫ To the day that has passed ♫

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,430
♫ "I miss you" ♫

10
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,400
♫ A momentary illusion once again ♫

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,480
♫ I would like to keep seeing this squeaky day ♫

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,410
♫ True love is always there ♫

13
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,560
♫ The pouring rain and the light ♫

[Eternal Yesterday]

15
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:41,806
[Episode 5]

16
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:55,909
Ogawa Sensei is our homeroom teacher and teaches modern Japanese literature.

17
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,256
He has a calm, serious demeanor

18
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,744
and never fails to iron his shirt.

19
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,238
Sensei!

20
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,687
That is Ogawa Sensei, right?

21
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:35,421
I knew it.

22
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,023
Masahiko.

23
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,770
Let's just break up already.

24
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,573
Where is this coming from?

25
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,226
Please, say something.

26
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:05,056
Ogawa Sensei?

27
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,358
Stop it, Masahiko!

28
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,439
This isn't like you.

29
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,891
No.

30
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,534
Masahiko.

31
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,351
Just go away.

32
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,534
Leave me alone.

33
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,838
It's none of your business anymore.

34
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:34,135
I can do what I want!

35
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,596
Yamada, stay back.

36
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,523
Stay away!

37
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:03,936
Yamada, don't go.

38
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,531
Stop.

39
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:24,482
What?

40
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,699
Yamada?

41
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,082
Yamada, you...

42
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,371
Sensei.

43
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:36,216
What are those bruises?

44
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,444
Did something happen?

45
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:42,041
Yeah, I got in a traffic accident.

46
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,038
Traffic accident?

47
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,185
I got hit by a truck.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,413
My heart isn't beating now.

49
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,342
What are you say—

50
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,093
It's true.

51
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,061
It's dangerous, so get back.

52
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,591
You're in more danger than me.

53
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,635
I'm...

54
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,570
I'm fine.

55
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:07,707
You know, Sensei.

56
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,878
You might think it'll all be over if you fall down from here,

57
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:15,057
but that might not be the case.

58
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,508
Yamada?

59
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,386
- Touch me here.
- Stop—

60
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,344
My heart's not beating, right?

61
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:36,235
It's not beating at all.

62
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,616
Oumi, what is Yamada talking about?

63
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:49,761
- Those bruises and his heart...
- You're so annoying.

64
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,719
Go talk him out of it.

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,600
Aren't you his boyfriend?

66
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,206
Your problem's none of my business, but what if Koichi falls?

67
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,095
He's already...

68
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:06,832
He's already a corpse.

69
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:09,168
And he's all battered up.

70
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,810
Hey.

71
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:23,682
Micchan.

72
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,792
Sensei.

73
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,973
Let me start with this.

74
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:29,527
Oumi.

75
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:35,869
There's a high chance that falling down from here won't kill you.

76
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:40,029
And the soil below is soft.

77
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,830
Your bones will break all over your body.

78
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:46,807
It's guaranteed to leave you impaired.

79
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,653
But you know,

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,582
Koichi is different.

81
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,854
If he falls from this height,

82
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,524
I don't think he'll recover.

83
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,472
Yeah.

84
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:14,412
Micchan is right.

85
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,904
- What are you two—
- Koichi is in trouble now.

86
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,573
It's not beating, right?

87
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,245
What the hell is going on?

88
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,050
He's a corpse.

89
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,465
A moving one.

90
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,325
Yeah, I'm a corpse.

91
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:42,629
That's crazy, right?

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,098
But it's true.

93
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,170
I turned into a corpse, but it's like I'm still alive.

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
But maybe my time is almost up.

95
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Yamada...

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Masahiko.

97
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,390
Masahiko!

98
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,500
Masahiko.

99
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,400
- Masahiko...
- I was freaking out.

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,700
Masahiko.

101
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,300
It was still early morning,

102
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,200
so no one else knew about this commotion.

103
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,400
If you do this here...

104
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
- No, not like that. Do this here.
- Okay.

105
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,168
Drag it over here, and then click here.

106
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,716
Okay.

107
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:58,968
Whoa, that's amazing!

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
- Try it again.
- What?

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,200
- Over here.
- Oh, over here?

110
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,030
Jeez, I was worried there for a second.

111
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,100
But you were so intense, Yamada.

112
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,900
Oh, what was that, by the way?

113
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,600
You put your hand on his neck.

114
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, I don't really get it myself, but I got this urge to do it. It felt like I had to.

115
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,200
- It felt like I had to.
- Wait, explain this.

116
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,250
What is it, Sumi-chan?

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Hey, Koichi.

118
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,300
What was that? "My time is almost up"?

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Koichi.

120
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,900
Thanks, Micchan.

121
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,100
Hey...

122
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Nothing.

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
You were great.

124
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
I was great?

125
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,700
You think so?

126
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
I couldn't ask him.

127
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,300
It felt like it would all end if I asked him there.

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like I'd be waking up from a dream.

129

[Shunkou | Monument]

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
Whoa, that caught me off guard.

131
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,500
What are you doing?

132
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,880
Right.

133
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,000
Hey Micchan, drink this and keep hydrated.

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
Sorry.

135
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, Micchan.

136
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,800
Can you come over to my place today?

137
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Why?

138
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,900
I feel uneasy on my own.

139
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,100
Won't you be fine? You don't look like a corpse.

140
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,200
Well, the kids have a lot of energy.

141
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,300
They always keep attacking me, like on my neck and legs.

142
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,900
If you're there, they don't do it as much.

143
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
- Oh, really?
- Come on, just come.

144
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
The kids are always asking when you're going to visit.

145
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,200
Honestly, I was uneasy, too.

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,700
What Koichi said earlier

147
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,778
meant that this abnormal corpse was going to become a normal one.

148
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,762
Then we can't talk like this anymore.

149
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,900
Hey, Micchan.

150
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah?

151
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,500
I wonder if Oga-chan and Tama-chan were dating.

152
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
I guess so.

153
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
Did you know about that already?

154
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
I had a feeling.

155
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
They made a lot of eye contact with each other.

156
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,500
I couldn't tell at all.

157
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,653
Well, no one else could either.

158
00:12:57,654 --> 00:13:00,354
It was probably only me and Kagamiya.

159
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,918
I wonder if they broke up.

160
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Maybe Oga-chan loved Tama-chan so much that he couldn't handle it.

161
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,082
I also...

162
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,800
Are you sick?

163
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,960
You're overreacting again. I just sneezed.

164
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,356
All right, let's eat something warm.

165
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,110
Let's go.

166
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,884
I'm hungry.

167
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,700
Is it ready yet?

168
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,457
Yeah, this looks delicious and ready to eat.

169
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,700
That looks so good.

170
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,900
Come on, let's eat. You too, Micchan.

171
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,727
Okay, you can really taste the broth, so don't use the ponzu sauce.

172
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,918
It's great even without it.

173
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,700
Here we go.

174
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,900
Oh, thank you.

175
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,100
Are you really okay with hotpot? It's summer, you know.

176
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,157
Our household has hotpot all year long nonetheless, right?

177
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,357
I'll help out.

178
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:24,123
It's fine, I feel better when I move around.

179
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:29,254
You know, we're getting a little sister soon.

180
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,700
No, it's a boy.

181
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
- A girl.
- A boy.

182
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,229
Come on, it's fine either way as long as they're healthy.

183
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,294
Minato, I'll give you some food, so pass me your dish.

184
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,932
No, you're going to give me green onions.

185
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,899
I hate green onions too.

186
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,522
You two are exactly the same when it comes to this stuff.

187
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:48,190
Give me your dish.

188
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,400
Don't put in any green onions then.

189
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,500
Well, okay then. Great.

190
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
Here comes the green onion.

191
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,196
Are you still being picky?

192
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,684
- They're hopeless.
- But...

193
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,762
Here, eat this too.

194
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:06,437
Thank you.

195
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,340
I'll get some for you, Minato.

196
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,200
What do you want?

197
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,100
When I was a child, I was often alone.

198
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,600
My mother died early, and my father was busy with work.

199
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,100
I'm an only child.

200
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,900
I had my own room for as long as I can remember.

201
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,200
The hot pot made by our maid was small and for a single person.

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,800
It's fun coming to Koichi's house.

203
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,664
It's fun, but I can't get used to it.

204
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:38,706
Is it good?

205
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,966
- Here.
- Thank you.

206
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,750
Wait, are you not eating, Koichi?

207
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,868
I'm not that hungry.

208
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,958
Oh, really?

209
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,500
Then make sure you eat a lot, Micchan.

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
Sure. Eat my portion, too.

211
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,180
Let's eat.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Minato, blow on your food.

213
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,632
It's hot.

214
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,389
That's gross. Just blow.

215
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,634
Wow, that's tasty.

216
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:16,375
Honestly, I feel relieved when I'm alone.

217
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:25,884
And... I hate myself when I feel relieved.

218
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:33,193
Right down to the core... I'm a cold person.

219
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:47,141
Here, Micchan.

220
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,401
Thanks.

221
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:52,778
Sure.

222
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,831
You're not drinking anything?

223
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,981
Yeah, do you want it?

224
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,317
That's not what I mean.

225
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:10,016
I don't get thirsty anymore.

226
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:15,018
I just need a little once in a while to keep my mouth moist.

227
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:58,179
Hey, Micchan.

228
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:07,279
If we were adults, do you think we'd be toasting with beer right now?

229
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,151
I think so.

230
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,101
Sorry.

231
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:07,572
It won't beat anymore.

232
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,219
How do you know?

233
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,191
I get this feeling that it won't.

234
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,233
It's my body, after all.

235
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,603
You're giving up too easily.

236
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:36,563
Hold out a bit longer.

237
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:41,673
Well, I am holding out in a sense.

238
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:45,458
I'm moving my body, even without a beating heart.

239
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,340
Tired?

240
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,810
A little.

241
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:20,278
I'm sorry my family likes you so much.

242
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,417
Oh, but I like you the most, okay?

243
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,120
I like you the most, Micchan.

244
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:23,876
You're so warm, Micchan.

245
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,405
I'm cold.

246
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,983
No, you're not.

247
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:38,073
Micchan, you're warm.

248
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:51,207
It hurt a bit, but it made me happy

249
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:56,316
since I could feel Koichi.

Him, too?

257
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,112
He probably doesn't notice me.

258
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,312
You're alive, aren't you?

259

I've already told you. You are a corpse, but you are alive!

260

My number one is no longer here.

261
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,668
Sorry, Micchan.

262
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,019
Stay by my side.
