It's raining as usual.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,923
Hey, Micchan.

3
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,137
What is it?

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,901
Isn't it somewhat hot in here?

5
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:37,248
So hot!

6
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:55,819
I suddenly wondered, which one of us has bad luck with the weather?

7
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:05,073
Perhaps, most likely, maybe...

8
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,110
it's probably both of us.

[Episode 8]

18
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:59,151
Hey.

19
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,140
What?

20
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,253
Well...

21
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,036
It's my first time.

22
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,668
So what?

23
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,866
It's my first time, too.

24
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,575
Right.

25
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:25,997
That's true.

26
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:31,092
Okay, that's good.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,641
Yeah.

28
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,735
Micchan.

29
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,970
Hey...

30
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:57,305
I'm actually pretty sure I'm dead.

31
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,318
But, um... well...

32
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:18,197
Sorry, actually, I don't know.

33
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,120
Koichi,

34
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,271
I have been thinking

35
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:29,876
ever since that morning,

36
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:35,114
why you can still move even after you've died.

37
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,744
Micchan, I love you.

38
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:15,154
I kept saying that you're not dead and that you're a living corpse.

39
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,224
But I knew you were dead.

40
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,630
I love you, too.

41
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,942
But it was hard for me to accept.

42
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:43,983
That's why I tried too hard to twist my words that way.

43
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:53,726
Sorry, Koichi.

44
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:59,319
I made you play along.

45
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:08,810
Micchan.

46
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm... probably already...

47
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,632
I don't want this.

48
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,834
I don't.

49
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,688
I love you so much, and yet...

50
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,596
This sucks.

51
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,767
Sorry, Micchan.

52
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:59,659
Sorry.

53
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,427
Koichi.

54
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:25,484
Yeah.

55
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,743
It's okay.

56
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:35,594
I won't forget you.

57
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:47,306
I'll never forget you until the day I die.

58
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,012
Micchan.

59
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,985
Koichi.

60
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,542
My number one.

61
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,676
The one I love the most.

62
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:21,206
It's the same for me.

63
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,103
You're my number one.

64
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,323
My number one until I die.

65
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,762
Thank you.

66
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,421
Stop crying already.

67
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,724
Sorry.

68
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,383
Come on.

69
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,341
Micchan.

70
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,905
Yeah?

71
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:10,962
Let's do it.

72
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,600
That night, we kissed over and over,

73
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,970
and became one.

74
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,719
Why are you up so early?

75
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,423
I'm always up this early.

76
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:57,052
You're a morning person too, huh? Just like your mother.

77
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,280
Do you want some coffee?

78
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,766
I do.

79
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:17,457
Do you remember your mother?

80
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,935
Yeah, I guess.

81
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:31,770
She knew she didn't have much time left.

82
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,404
What?

83
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:36,055
She was cold to you, right?

84
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:42,173
She did that to make sure you didn't mourn her.

85
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,825
She was determined to do so.

86
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:51,430
So that you wouldn't care

87
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,488
when your mother passed away.

88
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,701
I should've stopped her.

89
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:07,783
I realized she made the wrong choice.

90
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,771
Why bother telling me now?

91
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:20,979
Yeah, sorry.

92
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,699
I always wanted to hear her say,

93
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:29,321
"Mitsuru, you mean everything to me."

94
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:36,528
That guy, Koichi-kun, stayed over last night, right?

95
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:45,088
He left already.

96
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,343
Can his family still see him?

97
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,277
What?

98
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,982
Do they still see Koichi-kun?

99
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,033
Did Kasumi Sensei tell you?

100
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,060
This happened to your mother too.

101
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,078
I was shocked.

102
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:19,560
At that time you could see, feel, and talk with your mother,

103
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:23,700
but her heart wasn't beating.

104
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,815
She was like a living corpse.

105
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,222
But I was happy.

106
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,899
I didn't care that she was a corpse,

107
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,201
as long as she was by my side.

108
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:49,534
It was a peaceful smile.

109
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,082
As if he had overcome this storm full of sadness

110
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:58,496
and fished up nostalgia out of the calm sea.

111
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,752
I wanted to ask him,

112
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:05,450
"Dad, how did you weather the storm?"

113
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,889
Mom smiled.

114
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,709
What?

115
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,351
She gave me a very kind smile.

116
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:20,500
I see.

117
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,969
You saw her too?

118
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,866
Dad.

119
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,613
What?

120
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:46,073
I received a gift and had it stolen from me.

121
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,096
How do I get over this sadness?

122
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,505
He moved on, huh?

123
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,626
Don't force yourself to get over it.

124
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:00,511
It's been five years.

125
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,681
I'm still a student studying at med school.

126
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:11,689
Everyone got a job. Also, my dad and Kasumi Sensei...

127
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,435
I mean, Haruka-san, live together now.

128
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:19,873
Her divorce went through last year.

129
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,300
Hello?

130
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,444
That's all you have to say?

131
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:45,323
- Where are you? Pick up your phone!
- Ah...

132
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:48,289
Wait, what? Hey, stop that!

133
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,481
Hello? Aren't you coming over here?

134
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:56,388
Come on, we haven't seen you in forever.

135
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,129
Oumi-kun.

136
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,832
Is this Kagamiya?

137
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,595
Yeah, we went to Yamada-kun's grave today.

138
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,480
I see.

139
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,780
Koichi was found in that grassy field.

140
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,466
The one where the accident happened.

141
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:30,221
To everyone else,

142
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,264
it was an accidental death that was simply discovered late.

143
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:41,263
No one remembers him as a living corpse.

144
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:49,403
I cried so much, I felt like I was turning into a puddle of tears.

145
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:53,745
In the end, my sadness never went away...

146
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,349
and it probably never will.

147
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:06,124
I still keep looking for him.

148
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:25,877
For some reason, Tamaki Sensei sent me this photo.

149
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,496
He shouldn't remember that time.

150
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:32,074
I don't understand him.

151
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,753
What about a tie for first?

♫ A momentary illusion once again ♫

164
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,934
I met you in spring, two years ago, Micchan.

165
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:37,282
I don't know how many freshmen there were that year,

166
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,831
but I think it's a miracle that we met.

167
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,864
You had a scary face,

168
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:50,962
but I was impressed by your stern gaze.

169
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:57,214
Yeah, I fell in love.

170
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:05,774
I never thought I would fall for a guy, so I was a bit surprised.

171
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:08,213
But that didn't matter.

172
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:13,459
I would've fallen for you even if you were a girl.

173
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:21,368
No, if you were a girl, you wouldn't be yourself anymore.

174
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,166
Can we be friends?

175
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:33,572
You were so shocked and confused.

176
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:38,143
But I pushed on.

177
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:44,282
In the two years after that, we slowly got closer,

178
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:47,686
and I made so many memories.

179
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:59,264
No, at a certain point, we made memories together.

180
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:11,076
You called me your number one.

181
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,892
I had never been someone's number one before.

182
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,588
The Yamada family was never my real family.

183
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,310
I've never met my real father.

184
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:44,175
My real mother abandoned me when I was young.

185
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,947
I was extremely lucky.

186
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,484
My mother's older brother took me in.

187
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,898
Then they raised me like their real son.

188
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:05,639
They let me be the first to hold my little sister exactly because of that.

189
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,845
They wanted to involve me.

190
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:14,221
I was so happy... and a bit sad, too.

191
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,611
That's why I always hoped

192
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,773
to meet someone who would call me their number one one day.

193
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:40,007
And if they were my number one,

194
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:44,769
that would be a real miracle.

195
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,020
Channel Manager : drboo

196
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:58,926
Micchan, thank you for this miracle.

197
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,700
Thanks to the Segmentation team : kitty100 (CS) and mirjam_465

198
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,590
Thanks to our Editors :
yunoilwoo (TE), xylune (GE) and cerejacult (CE)

199
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,970
Thanks to all our Other Language Moderators and their teams

200
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:15,082
I'll leave before you wake up.

201
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,574
There'd be a lot of problems if they found my corpse here.

202
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:29,451
Micchan.

203
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:40,136
I love you more than anyone else.

204
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:47,120
♫ Fooling around on the way home ♫

205
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,890
♫ Like yesterday, today is also coming to an end ♫

206
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,340
♫ That's all right then ♫

207
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,050
♫ We pretend to be fine ♫

208
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,060
♫ In order to burn with love ♫

209
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,880
♫ Blooming in summer and coloring the night sky ♫

210
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,480
♫ Chasing the sound of the vanishing waves ♫

211
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,490
♫ Everything about you that's shining now ♫

212
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:42,620
♫ The eternal summer sky engraved in one's heart ♫

213
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,926
