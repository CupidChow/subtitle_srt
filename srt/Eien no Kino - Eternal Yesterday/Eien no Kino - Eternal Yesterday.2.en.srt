00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:05,405
It was in the blink of an eye.

2
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:11,122
It was so sudden, it was inevitable.

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:12,723
Koichi?

4
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,542
Koichi.

5
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,512
Koichi!

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,065
Koichi!

7
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:28,027
I couldn't do anything.

8
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,306
On this day, in the blink of an eye,

9
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,143
Koichi became a dead body.

[Episode 2]

19
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,586
Hey, Koichi.

20
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,280
Koichi!

21
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,376
Come on, Koichi.

22
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:06,959
A-Ambulance! We need an ambulance!

23
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:46,550
Micchan, did the truck hit you?

24
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,136
No, I'm fine.

25
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,705
I'm glad.

26
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,205
Whoa, it's blood.

27
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,975
Micchan, I'm bleeding.

28
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:00,205
What the hell?

29
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,443
Doesn't it... hurt?

30
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:08,087
Oh, right.

31
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,409
I was run over, huh?

32
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,011
How can you be so relaxed?

33
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:17,096
You just got into a car accident.

34
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,954
- The ambulance will...
- It's fine, we don't need one.

35
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:22,214
What the hell are you saying?

36
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,460
It's not a big deal, Micchan.

37
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:28,694
I saw on TV that too many people are calling ambulances over small things.

38
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,405
This isn't a small thing.

39
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:33,113
But it doesn't hurt at all.

40
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,927
I'm feeling just fine, so it'd be embarrassing.

41
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,920
Hey, stop!

42
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,956
Huh? My neck feels weird.

43
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,526
I guess I have no choice.

44
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,696
How's this?

45
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:55,397
Well, Micchan?

46
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:01,349
Your... legs, too.

47
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,995
Hey, what is this?

48
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,649
Whoa, wait, I can't walk.

49
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:14,896
Your knee or hip is dislocated.

50
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:18,252
Nice, you really are the son of a doctor.

51
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,853
Fix it.

52
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:22,981
Me?

53
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:27,400
Yeah, I can't find my balance.

54
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,293
Does it really not hurt?

55
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:35,041
No. Just do it in one go.

56
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:38,712
Okay.

57
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:55,506
Thanks! It looks good.

58
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,872
Oh, the umbrella.

59
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,320
Where is it? You'll catch a cold.

60
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:05,596
What is it?

61
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,270
- That tickles.
- Quiet.

62
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:13,880
I'll go to the hospital later, so...

63
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,904
Wait, what're you doing?

64
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,624
Geez.

65
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,551
A check-up is pointless.

66
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,163
Why?

67
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,970
I was going to go to your dad's.

68
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,571
Koichi.

69
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,924
You're probably just...

70
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:17,898
a dead body now.

71
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,626
What?

72
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,117
Okay.

73
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:33,546
- I'm totally lost.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:36,132
So, Koichi got hit by a truck

75
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:38,864
and died from a spine injury.

76
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:43,625
You've never told a joke before. It's too difficult to understand.

77
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,465
Yeah, I don't tell jokes.

78
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:49,518
Yeah, Micchan's cute, but he acts more cool than cute.

79
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,811
He doesn't tell jokes.

80
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,290
Oumi is saying that you died.

81
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,763
He hasn't died.

82
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,221
His heart has simply stopped beating.

83
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:00,065
That means he's dead, right?

84
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,300
He wouldn't move and talk if he were.

85
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,673
Yeah, but...

86
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,387
Hey, Yamada.

87
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,036
Can I touch you?

88
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,834
Hashimoto!

89
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:17,030
What are you saying?

90
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:20,038
Hey, don't misunderstand me.

91
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:26,555
I just want to see if his heart really stopped.

92
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,871
Micchan.

93
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,109
Can she?

94
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,241
Why're you asking me?

95
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:38,171
Just in case.

96
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,772
Let her touch you.

97
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,731
It'll speed things up.

98
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,439
I see.

99
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:46,261
If you say so, Micchan.

100
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,047
Wait, under the shirt?

101
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,070
Try touching him.

102
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,750
He's ice-cold.

103
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,706
He really is cold.

104
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,165
Try listening. There's no heartbeat.

105
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,832
Yeah.

106
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:29,191
No, I'll pass.

107
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,778
Class President, please go ahead.

108
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,967
He's right.

109
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,305
I hear nothing.

110
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:05,283
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

111
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,284
Your family runs one, right?

112
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,792
Yeah.

113
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:13,220
And my dad is a shrewd businessman who loves money and fame.

114
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,754
He's good at manipulating the media.

115
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:21,030
"A living corpse. Yamada Koichi-kun, the miraculous high schooler."

116
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,495
That's how he'd spin it.

117
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,217
Wouldn't it hurt to expose your own classmate to the world's prying eyes as Class President?

118
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:34,038
But we can't hide this either.

119
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,500
We can, since Koichi is alive.

120
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,918
Didn't the truck driver report the accident to the police?

121
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,858
But the victim disappeared.

122
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:44,959
And the blood?

123
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,186
The rain washed it away.

124
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:56,996
Continuing life as usual is the best way to keep him from being discovered.

125
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,317
Yeah.

126
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,687
Having said that,

127
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:06,204
his face is pale, and his skin feels cold.

128
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,879
It'll be hard to hide it from our class, since we see them every day.

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,557
Chaos is inevitable.

130
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,920
So we'll tell them before they find out.

131
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:23,038
I want to tell everyone about Koichi and have them cooperate.

132
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,583
That's absurd! How will we convince them?

133
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,129
It is absurd, but still.

134
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,595
The situation is already absurd.

135
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,902
Just accept this absurdity.

136
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,958
Otherwise, Koichi will be quarantined in a hospital

137
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,793
and maybe even dissected by the WHO.

138
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,498
Do you want your classmate to get chopped up?

139
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,043
Fine.

140
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,716
Let's try it.

141
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,266
I don't know if it'll work,

142
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:12,371
but at the very least, I'm your ally.

143
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,848
Me too. We'll figure it out somehow.

144
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,813
I mean, Yamada seems lively, too.

145
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,053
"Lively"?

146
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,700
I am lively.

147
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,967
Even as a corpse.

148
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,739
Excuse us.

149
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,464
Thank you.

150
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,203
Where's Ogawa Sensei?

151
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:37,419
Let's keep looking.

152
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,920
Yeah.

153
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:43,702
Class President and Hashimoto got to work right away.

154
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,930
What do you mean?

155
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,409
Say something!

156
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,354
Ogawa Sensei!

157
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,971
Ogawa Sensei?

158
00:11:56,972 --> 00:12:00,066
- What is it?
- Actually, we have a question.

159
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,040
Class President asked our homeroom teacher

160
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,612
if we could have time during the first period to talk to the class.

161
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:09,761
We plan to get everyone's cooperation then.

162
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:15,197
Hashimoto apparently told a lie about a conflict between the boys and girls.

163
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,685
Please.

164
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:20,472
But, well...

165
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,357
Please, we're begging you!

166
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,649
- Please, Sensei.
- Please.

167
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,487
Well...

168
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:30,416
Ogawa Sensei is the definition of serious, so he obviously hesitated.

169
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,453
Well, that sounds fine to me.

170
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:36,345
You need to work through some stuff, right?

171
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,406
Wait, Sensei...

172
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,922
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

173
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:45,644
Tamaki Sensei, from the class next door, took the Class President's and Hashimoto's side.

174
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:48,549
He's famous for being irresponsible,

175
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,756
- but he was a huge help this time.
- Fine.

176
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,528
- That's what Class President said.
- All right!

177
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,063
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

178
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:04,277
Meanwhile, I was wiping Koichi down while checking on his wounds.

179
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,063
His injuries looked severe.

180
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:09,245
This bone is probably broken.

181
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,690
It's a bit gross, right?

182
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,156
Not just a little.

183
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:19,934
But I'm glad you're the son of a doctor.

184
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:23,841
Why?

185
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,390
A normal person wouldn't be able to check my wounds like this.

186
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,236
Well, barely.

187
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,245
Just barely.

188
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:44,634
Thanks.

189
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,556
You're welcome.

190
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:57,863
There was a big gash on Koichi's left thigh.

191
00:13:57,864 --> 00:13:59,972
It was split wide open.

192
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:03,908
Ouch.

193
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,038
I used that to my advantage.

194
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:11,261
Koichi doesn't look like a corpse at first glance,

195
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:14,220
so I used that to convince the others.

196
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,921
Great.

197
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,026
It hurts just to watch.

198
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,593
- I didn't want to make him a spectacle.
- Nice, Oumi.

199
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:23,602
Yeah.

200
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,031
But it worked like a charm.

201
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,808
I got everyone to cooperate with us.

202
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:40,475
Geez, why is Sumi-chan absent today of all days?

203
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:42,391
Why's that important?

204
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,816
I mean, it feels like it's related to occultism.

205
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,555
Sumi-chan knows a lot about this stuff.

206
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,543
- Occultism?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,793
Like zombies and ghosts.

208
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,206
Am I a zombie?

209
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,380
That sucks.

210
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,641
You're not.

211
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,529
So don't worry.

212
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,280
Oh, I guess it's fine then.

213
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,768
It's fine if you say so, Micchan.

214
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,756
He can't be a zombie.

215
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:09,402
Even if his brain is dead, his heart isn't.

216
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:12,819
He's not like a zombie. But...

217
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,226
You're not eating?

218
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:17,835
Yeah, I'm not feeling very hungry.

219
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,155
Organisms rot when they die.

220
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,336
That's an inescapable law of nature.

221
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:32,104
So he might rot just like a zombie.

222
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:36,276
Koichi, let's go to the hospital after all.

We're not here for an appointment.

It's a personal visit.

Can you tell her that Oumi Mitsuru is here?

233

Oh, you're the Director's...

234
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,132
Understood. Please wait a moment.

- Thanks again.
- Understood.

That was your dad, right, Micchan?

Yeah, how did you know?

The physician here.

244

It's her fifth year here, I think.

Oh, so you know her pretty well.

246
00:16:57,102 --> 00:17:00,085
No, I've never talked to her before.

Koichi couldn't have a normal examination...

00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:11,729
Take a deep breath.

252
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,730
so we had to rely on Dr. Kasumi.

253
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:18,570
She's married and has an affair with the Director...

254
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,606
In other words, an affair with my father.

255
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,127
I didn't want to do this, but I had no choice.

256
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,443
I threatened her, explained the situation,

257
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:33,502
and somehow got a secret check-up.

258
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,762
Take another deep breath.

259
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:44,232
She examined him as thoroughly as possible.

260
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,489
What?

261
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:59,268
She could barely draw any blood.

262
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:03,148
The coagulated blood wouldn't get sucked into the needle.

263
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:12,038
Dr. Kasumi also did a simple X-ray on her own.

264
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,276
She wanted to take a CT scan and MRI too,

265
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:19,383
but it was impossible, as the technician would find out.

He's actually dead.

Not only that, but you have terrible wounds too.

270
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:50,328
A lethal spinal cord injury,

271
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:56,334
and your third and fourth ribs are broken on the left side.

272

Do you want to be a doctor, after all, Mitsuru-kun?

No, I don't.

277

- Um, Dr. Kasumi...

I came to learn about the decay.

280
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,036
All I want to know is if Koichi will rot or not.

281
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,760
A normal corpse would decay,

282
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,687
but Koichi-kun is abnormal in a lot of ways.

283
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,292
You're a corpse,

284
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,531
yet you're way too lively.

285
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:53,824
Although your face is pale, it isn't a sign of livor mortis.

286
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,227
Your pupils aren't dilated either.

287

Your heart has stopped, yet you're still breathing.

288
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:04,769
And it's the dead of summer, but I see no signs of decay.

289
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,965
But won't it progress from here on out?

290
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:13,278
Is it okay for me to say this?

291
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,391
Well, Mitsuru-kun...

292
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:25,590
I think Koichi-kun's body is disregarding time.

293
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:29,078
"Disregarding time"?

294
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,228
In other words,

295
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:35,378
your body is the way it was when you died.

296
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,822
You could say it's in a state of rest.

As a doctor, your very existence

I didn't like that question.

I've never been afraid of him.

311
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:07,359
Micchan, you should become a doctor.

339
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,065
