You're not a celebrity.

He's a nice and kind guy,

Koichi sometimes looks transparent to me today.

171
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,058
But when you talk to him, I see him clearly.

172
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,745
How do I put it? He doesn't feel stable.

173
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,849
Sensei.

174
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,582
Yes?

175
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,117
I understand...

176
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,383
So please, stitch him up.

177
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,219
Right.

178
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,494
Koichi, she said you're transparent.

179
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,755
You're like a ghost.

180
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,514
I wanted to joke about it with him, but I couldn't.

181
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:39,553
Micchan. I'm fine.

182
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,580
Really, I'm all right.

183
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,736
You're fine?

184
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,714
This isn't fine at all.

185
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:48,828
It's fine.

186
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,442
It's fine, as long as you can see me.

187
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,037
That's all I need.

188
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:59,631
The Class President, Hashimoto, and other people still see me too.

189
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:04,354
The doctor even stitched me up even though I'm transparent.

190
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:09,352
But isn't it just a matter of time?

191
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:13,394
For example, when we go to school tomorrow,

192
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:17,055
more people won't be able to see Koichi.

193
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:22,218
I can't handle something like that...

194
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,842
Sorry, I'm in a hurry!

195
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,297
What?

196
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:30,111
Oh! You.

197
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,744
You were there, right?

198
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,760
You were there back then, right?

199
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:39,873
Oh, I remember.

200
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,788
This guy...

201
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,361
is the one who hit Koichi.

202
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:52,890
What happened to that guy?

203
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,205
Is he alive?

204
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,818
Hey, you were there, right?

205
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:01,176
Where is he now?

206
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,583
Is he okay?

207
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,387
You did this to Koichi.

208
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:13,085
He's right here.

209
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:16,313
What? Where?

210
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,298
Where is he?

211
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,956
You hit Koichi.

212
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:22,277
How could you ask that?

213
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:23,960
What?

214
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,586
You killed Koichi.

215
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,830
I'm telling you, he's...

216
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:44,068
He's alive.

217
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,632
I see.

218
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:51,613
Is he? What a relief.

219
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,333
Oh, but... was he injured?

220
00:16:56,951 --> 00:17:01,506
It seems he's not in pain.

221
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,734
What do you mean?

222
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,807
Don't worry.

223
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:12,878
Just know that he's alive.

224
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:14,718
It was a miracle.

225
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:17,926
I see.

226
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:21,563
I've asked at so many hospitals, but I couldn't find him anywhere.

227
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:25,357
The police got mad too since no one was there.

228
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,047
Um, do you have time now?

229
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,808
Can you wait for a bit?

230
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,373
For what?

231
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:38,372
My mother isn't doing so well,

232
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,840
so I'm going to check on her.

233
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:46,919
To be honest, that day, I was speeding and...

234
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,965
Okay.

235
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:58,843
I'll punish him. Thoroughly.

236
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:01,111
Please hurry to her.

237
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,379
I won't forgive you.

238
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:10,796
Sorry, I want to apologize to him too, so I want to ask you some things.

239
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,917
Wait here for a second.

240
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,916
Whoa, that surprised me.

241
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,270
Let's get out of here.

242
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:53,238
Hey, Koichi.

243
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,256
Aren't you mad?

244
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,463
What?

245
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:00,794
He ignored you after he hit you.

246
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,205
He didn't ignore me.

247
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,927
He just didn't see me.

248
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,201
But he hit you!

249
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,335
Yeah.

250
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:12,608
That's true.

251
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,902
Wait, let me think.

252
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,926
Actually, it might be okay for me to be mad.

253
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,637
Do you have to think about that?

254
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:46,311
But I can't get mad at him for some reason.

255
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,045
I wonder why.

256
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:53,398
Maybe it's because you're mad enough for the both of us.

257
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:54,964
What?

258
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:01,911
Micchan, you look really scary right now.

259
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,998
This is cuter.

260
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,831
Stop it!

261
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,098
Sorry.

262
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,479
I'm sorry, Micchan...

263
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:32,365
for being like this.

264
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,026
Damn it.

265
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,125
Damn it...

266
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:57,552
Sorry, Micchan.

267
00:20:57,552 --> 00:21:01,038
Sorry. I'm sorry.

268
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:21,822
That night, I had a fever.

269
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,419
What time is it?

270
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,553
It's 11 p.m.

271
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,440
Get some sleep.

272
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,080
Do you see the humidifier?

273
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,173
Yeah.

274
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:44,784
Put in some water and set it on high.

275
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,500
There's an ice pack in the freezer too.

276
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:52,113
Bring that and a towel.

277
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,666
Got it.

278
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,570
And some water.

279
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,250
There's lukewarm water in the kitchen.

280
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:03,760
Okay.

281
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,591
What else?

282
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:15,208
Stay... by my side.

283
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:28,172
That's a given.

284
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,305
I'll go get it then.

285
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,163
My fever wouldn't go down.

286
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,998
That was probably...

287
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,709
partially Koichi's fault.

Koichi!

It's unfortunate, but he's almost at his limit.

I'm probably out of time.
