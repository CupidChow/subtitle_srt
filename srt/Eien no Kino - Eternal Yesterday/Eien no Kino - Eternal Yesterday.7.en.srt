It hasn't gone down yet, huh?

How do you know?

00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,049
It's 37.6 degrees.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,000
Stay home today.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,299
That was my intention.

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,369
Yeah, Koichi was here.

12
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:45,903
I see.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,500
Your dad is cool, Micchan.

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,699
What are you doing over there?

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,299
I came down here for this.

16
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,630
I thought your dad might think this was floating in the air.

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,160
Koichi has been a corpse for four days.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,820
I made Koichi go to school

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,990
to minimize how much Koichi is being forgotten by our classmates.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,610
But that backfired.

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,350

[Episode 7]

31
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,900
My fever went down, and I had nothing to do.

32
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,760
The time felt too long.

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,070
It's because I've been stuck with Koichi these past few days.

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,220
Koichi.

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Sorry for visiting randomly.

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,330
I wanted to talk.

37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,149
Yes.

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,989
Nice home.

39
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,040
But it's pretty old.

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,619
It's nice.

41
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,720
This house is well purified.

42
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,370
Your father probably brings home many spirits from his work,

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,810
but this will keep the bad ones at bay.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,413
This is hot.

45
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:40,220
Were you able to see things since childhood?

46
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,680
I saw more as a child.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,840
I can't see half of what I used to see now.

48
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,573
I see.

49
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,380
Yamada-kun left early today.

50
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,399
What?

51
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,220
He left during the second period.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,250
Almost the whole class no longer sees Yamada-kun.

53
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,339
When Yamada-kun left the class,

54
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,310
only five people saw him at most.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,659
Hello, this is Mitsuru.

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,110
Thank you for the other day.

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,179
Yes.

58
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,440
About Koichi...

59
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,383

60
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,183
Yes.

61
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,860
Okay.

62
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,713
Goodbye.

63
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,770
It was a mistake to let him go.

64
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,023
Well...

65
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,260
I want you to tell Yamada-kun something.

66
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,873
What is it?

67
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,600
Yamada-kun asked me this morning

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,610
if you became sick because he was around.

69
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,140
He thought it might be because he is an "Oni."

70
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,030
I couldn't say it wasn't,

71
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,370
since I thought he was feeding on you.

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,250
It's common for Oni to absorb life energy.

73
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,270
Koichi would never do that.

74
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,653
Yeah.

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,830
I know that now.

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,593
That's why

77
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,930
I want you to tell him it's not true.

78
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,739
I think the energy that keeps him going

79
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:46,720
might be the emotion that you give off, Oumi-kun.

80
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,619
He's not absorbing your life energy,

81
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:55,050
but rather taking in what you are simply handing to him.

82
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,950
What do you mean?

83
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,490
Without you around, he loses his shape.

84
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,850
Even my eyes have trouble seeing his outline.

85
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,159
If he needs life energy, there should've been plenty in our class.

86
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,959
That's why Yamada-kun isn't an Oni, but rather...

87
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,959
I had made a wish.

88
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,493
What?

89
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:32,540
That everything would continue to be just like yesterday.

90
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,130
I couldn't get in touch with Koichi even at night.

91
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,670
Where in the world did he go?

92
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,750
He didn't come back, and he wasn't at his home either.

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,350
Hey, Oumi-kun.

94
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,950
It's unfortunate,

95
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,480
but he's almost at his limit.

96
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,693
What?

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
It's a miracle that Yamada-kun's body hasn't rotted yet.

98
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,699
If his body is still just like how it was when he died,

99
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,520
it means that time has stopped in his surrounding space.

100
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,650
- I told you, Koichi—
- I know.

101
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,440
I know he's not dead,

102
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,643
but...

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,069
I can't even imagine how much energy is needed for such a miracle.

104
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,710
If it were just based on feelings, then...

105
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
Can he stay on feeling alone?

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,133
Yeah.

107
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,210
Even without a body, are feelings

108
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,090
enough to keep him by my side?

109
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,330
It's not impossible, but...

110
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,010
It won't work unless Yamada-kun wants it too.

111
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,470
Always staying by a spirit's side

112
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,480
would mean that you have to completely cut

113
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,720
off your ties with those in the living world.

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,340
It would be no different from being dead, although technically alive.

Is that...

116
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,190
what Yamada-kun wants?

117
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,830
He wouldn't want that. I'm sure he wouldn't.

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,199
Don't do that here, stupid.

172
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,980
See? Isn't it nice being invisible sometimes?

173
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,249
Oh, but when you talk to me,

174
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,249
it looks like you're talking to yourself, so be careful.

175
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,320
Brother!

176
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,210
Minato!

177
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,859
Wait, why are you here?

178
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,779
You got here first?

179
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,159
Dad was mad.

180
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,709
Why was he mad?

181
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,169
Oh, Brother.

182
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,879
Nagisa.

183
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,020
Koichi!

184
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,639
Hey, how'd you know it was here?

185
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,779
What?

186
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,830
Hey, Micchan.

187
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,300
Oh, now I see. This is Micchan's father's hospital?

188
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,120
- Hey, was it born?
- What do you mean?

189
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,359
The date isn't here yet. And this isn't her hospital—

190
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,369
Oh, Sir, she's in the room now.

191
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,839
- Oh, really?
- This way.

192
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,220
Oh, all right.

193
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,250
Hold on, Minato!

194
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,630
What?

195
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,179
Micchan, what's...

196
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,599
Your brother or sister is being born now.

197
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,429
A sudden delivery.

198
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,669
She's here because her usual hospital is full.

199
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,299
- What?
- Hurry.

200
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,700
Sorry for not calling you today.

201
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,130
Answer my calls at least.

202
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,840
My phone broke when I got hit by the truck.

203
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,533
I see.

204
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,760
Thank you for waiting. Please come in.

205
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,620
Koichi, let's go see the baby first.

206
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,053
Was it born?

207
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,299
You'll be the first to hold it.

208
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,279
That's what your mom said.

209
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,780
You can come too, Micchan.

210
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,300
Koichi's mom looked like she had just run a full marathon.

211
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,340
And yet...

212
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,820
I'm glad.

213
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,360
her eyes were sparkling.

214
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,840
The baby was small. She was so small.

215
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,829
Look.

216
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,479
Can you hand her to my son?

217
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,619
Yes.

218
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,249
Here we go.

219
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:43,920
Go, go!

220
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,149
Here's your big brother.

221
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:49,340
Be careful.

222
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,779
She's smiling.

223
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,620
Koichi and I were once like that.

224
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,640
Unable to survive without protection.

225
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,939
I'm alive today because I was protected.

226
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,510
I just realized this.

227
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,940
She smiled.

228
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,820
Micchan, come over here.

229
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,000
She is so cute.

230
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,699
- Come here.
- Let me see.

231
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,550
Look. See?

232
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,439
Minato, your sibling is here.

233
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,059
So cute. It's sleeping.

234
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,589
This happy scene

235
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,659
Is it a boy or a girl?

236
00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:00,590
- was so incredibly radiant.
- It's a girl.

237
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,340
Maybe I was imagining it,

238
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,710
but he looked like he was shining.

239
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,863
Micchan.

240
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,839
I'm leaving now.

241
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,730
Can I come over?

242
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,010
No, stay with your family tonight.

243
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,070
I want to be with you.

244
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,450
- But...
- I am probably...

245
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,010
running out of time.

246
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,340
But why?

247
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,800
Everyone could see you.

248
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah, it was the baby's power.

249
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,920
It was incredible.

250
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,830
But I don't think it'll last long.

251
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,119
I can just tell.

252
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,670
It's my body.

253
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,580
I was lucky.

254
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,950
Normally, you don't get extra time like this.

255
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,813
Koichi...

256
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:37,850
But I got to spend time with you and

257
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,340
met my little sister too.

258
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,519
So...

259
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,869
Mitsuru.

260
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,189
Why are you here?

261
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,129
Is your fever okay?

262
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:48,319
Yeah, it went down.

263
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,949
Are you Yamada Koichi-kun?

264
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,199
Yes.

265
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:56,879
Um, my mother just gave birth here.

266
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,669
Oh, my little sister was just born here.

267
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,929
Wow, congratulations.

268
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,160
I'll go say hello in the morning.

269
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,989
Thanks for always looking out for Mitsuru.

270
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:10,900
No, I should be saying thanks.

271
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,840
You two seem like good friends.

272
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,249
Sorry, I have an urgent surgery now,

273
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,209
so I have to go.

274
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,169
I'll be home in the morning.

275
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:23,703
Bye.

276
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah, your dad is cool.

277
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,640
Is he?

278
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,220
Maybe you'll be like that when you grow up.

279
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,030
Let's go home.
