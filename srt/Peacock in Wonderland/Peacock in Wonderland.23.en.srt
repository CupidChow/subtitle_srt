00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,730
Episode 23

4
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,800
Qian.

5
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,370
You're still busy at this hour?

6
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,050
Ni.

7
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,350
Why are you here?

8
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,780
I brought you light refreshments made by Uncle Li.

9
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,840
Come. Have a taste.

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,540
-Thank you.
-Have a taste.

11
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,130
Qian.

12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,539
I heard Yu sent someone to deliver Master's Decree today,

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,010
but you didn't accept it.

14
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,610
I didn't.

15
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,240
You like her so much.

16
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,329
Why didn't you accept it?

17
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,690
Yu doesn't like me.

18
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,579
It's just my wishful thinking.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,820
She issued Master's Decree.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
It means she's willing to marry you.

21
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,970
Besides,

22
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,329
I think

23
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,490
she likes you.

24
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,170
She just hasn't realized it.

25
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,230
You are so nice.

26
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,150
It won't be a problem that your love grows over time.

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,600
We've known each other for so many years.

28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,130
We were together every day.

29
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,910
Love growing over time

30
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,240
is the most useless.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,579
You spent every day together

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,860
as friends.

33
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,690
How do you know it won't work this time?

34
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,410
I know

35
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,930
Yu feels guilty towards me.

36
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,280
She doesn't have romantic feelings for me.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,370
That edict

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,040
was just to fulfill

39
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,890
her dead mother's last wish.

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,490
But I think...

41
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,090
Ni.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,450
If Muyang doesn't have feelings for you,

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,730
will you marry him

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,970
just because of an edict?

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,050
Of course I won't.

46
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,410
Sorry.

47
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,880
I shouldn't have tried to persuade you.

48
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,410
I was being too subjective.

49
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,640
I didn't care about your feelings.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,370
It's okay.

51
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,820
In love,

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
people should follow their own hearts.

53
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,710
But don't try to persuade me again.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,050
I've made up my mind.

55
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,350
Yu.

56
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,850
What do you think?

57
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,320
The clothes made by you

58
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,390
are all beautiful.

59
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,890
Since childhood,

60
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,830
you've always been the one making clothes for me.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,650
Now,

62
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,350
you even made a wedding dress for me.

63
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,970
Moqian,

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,320
I like it very much.

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,380
Master,

66
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,159
what brings you here?

67
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,920
This belongs to you.

68
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,450
Why didn't you accept it?

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,870
Do you really want to marry me?

70
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,350
I know you have a lot of resentment in your heart.

71
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,170
But you've fulfilled my mother's last wish

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
by making a wedding dress for me.

73
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,970
How can I ignore her wish?

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,120
Moqian.

75
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,110
Du Moqian!

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,909
I'm here

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,250
to deliver the edict as the master.

78
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,530
I summon Du Moqian, the boss of Yanxia Shop,

79
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,660
to the palace today.

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,930
The relevant department should pick an auspicious day for the wedding.

81
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,350
Yes,

82
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,440
Master.

83
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,030
Why did you ask me here?

84
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,090
Kneel.

85
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,400
No.

86
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,770
You broke the rules

87
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,040
by changing the procedures at the ceremony without permission.

88
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,930
You don't admit your mistake?

89
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,720
Master Rong didn't say anything.

90
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,170
Who are you to criticize me?

91
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,440
The rules have remained unchanged

92
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,650
for a century.

93
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,690
You took the belongings of the deceased

94
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,840
to the ceremony.

95
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,730
It was really ominous.

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,530
Ominous?

97
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,620
It's called inheritance.

98
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,740
Understand?

99
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,520
So you mean

100
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,360
the late master is ominous?

101
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,540
Are you despising the late master

102
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,610
or the current master who accepted the inheritance?

103
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,120
You...

104
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,270
What do you want?

105
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,690
Stop.

106
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,810
I have something to tell you.

107
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,780
I tolerated you

108
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,130
for the sake of Master Rong.

109
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,300
Now,

110
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,450
I don't want to tolerate you anymore.

111
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm going to be frank with you.

112
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,430
If you don't like me,

113
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,220
just confront me directly.

114
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,010
Don't play tricks

115
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,730
behind my back.

116
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,730
Childish.

117
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,620
Think about it.

118
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,120
Hua Ni!

119
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,740
How dare you!

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,690
She has Master Rong's support.

121
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,310
Of course she's arrogant.

122
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,860
It was such a good opportunity in Lisha Town.

123
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,320
But she managed to escape.

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,010
If we had succeeded,

125
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,890
she wouldn't have had the chance to argue with me here.

126
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,610
I was thoughtless.

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,179
I didn't expect

128
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,000
Li Muyang to save her again.

129
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,730
Didn't you say you're not feeling well?

130
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,290
Why are you still here standing in the wind?

131
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,290
The moon is very beautiful tonight.

132
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,820
I don't want to miss the moonlight.

133
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,450
Although the moon is cold and bright,

134
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,210
it's something in the sky.

135
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,940
We can only look at it from afar

136
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,960
and put our admiration for it in our hearts.

137
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,220
The moonlight is cold.

138
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,140
It has nothing on the warm candlelight in the room.

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,530
In the past,

140
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,330
there was moonlight in my heart.

141
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,770
But now it has dimmed.

142
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,210
Moqian,

143
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,930
since I've chosen you,

144
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,250
I will never let you down.

145
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,420
Come with me.

146
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,130
I, Rong Yu,

147
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,250
came with my husband, Moqian,

148
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,340
to visit my late parents today.

149
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,360
In front of your memorial tablets, I swear

150
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,680
in this life,

151
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,690
I will share weal and woe with Moqian

152
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,340
and be with him forever.

153
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,640
I will never let him down in this life.

154
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,970
I'll only accompany him

155
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,090
for the rest of my life.

156
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Ancestors,

157
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,090
I, unfilial Moqian,

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,030
married Rong Yu today.

159
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,970
She's the only one I love.

160
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,980
I'll never betray her.

161
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,130
From now on,

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,450
I'm your only wife.

163
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,850
You are my only husband.

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,230
There will never be anyone else

165
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,210
between you and me.

166
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,290
I trust you.

167
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,560
Li Muyang, Assistant Minister of Rites, you addressed the drought.

168
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
So I promote you

169
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,730
to the position of Minister of Rites.

170
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,530
I hope you can encourage yourself more in the future

171
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,830
and serve the city-state well.

172
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,430
Thank you, Master.

173
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,330
Chen Mo, Minister of Revenue, you are talented,

174
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,450
upright, and straightforward.

175
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,730
You've achieved remarkable feats many times.

176
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,480
You're indeed a trustworthy minister of Peacock City-State.

177
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,960
Now I promote you

178
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,980
to the position of Glorious Grand Master.

179
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,010
I hope you can assist me meticulously

180
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,330
and devote your wisdom and loyalty to me in the future.

181
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,610
I will do my best

182
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,980
to assist you loyally.

183
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,840
Also,

184
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,900
Hua Ni, Holy Envoy of Peacock City-State,

185
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,290
you always care about the people

186
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,850
and have prayed for blessings for them.

187
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,130
So you are rewarded with nine pieces of silk fabrics

188
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,860
and a pair of phoenix hairpins.

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,980
Thank you, Master.

190
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,400
-Master, you're wise.
-Master, you're wise.

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Master, you're wise.

192
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,980
Master, you're wise.

193
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,870
Guanbuzhu

194
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,550
Muyang.

195
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,840
-You've been an official for years.
-Come and eat.

196
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,190
You've been doing your best for the city-state and the people.

197
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,290
Your promotion today

198
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,220
is a great honor to our family.

199
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,640
It's so lively.

200
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,010
Cool Guy.

201
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,610
How have you been?

202
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,680
You've solved Moon Pavilion's problem?

203
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,740
Li's Mansion is indeed magnificent.

204
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,150
Holy Envoy, thank you for your concern.

205
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,000
It was not a big problem.

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,260
It was solved long ago.

207
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,030
Maybe someone thinks I'm an eyesore.

208
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,250
So he made things difficult for me for a few days.

209
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,510
But it doesn't matter.

210
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,700
Greetings, Uncle.

211
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,960
Who is he?

212
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,530
He's gone too far.

213
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,650
Jing.

214
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,080
Lord Li, I heard that you got a promotion.

215
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,740
So I came to congratulate you.

216
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,850
I wish you a smooth career

217
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,440
and great success.

218
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,180
Cool Guy, impressive.

219
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,130
You're so generous.

220
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,590
It's real.

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,130
Mr. Qing Jian, impressive.

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
You're really generous.

223
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,010
But I'm an official.

224
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,850
I dare not accept it.

225
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
Thank you.

226
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,490
I didn't know you would come here.

227
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,600
I only prepared humble fare.

228
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,950
So I'm not going to ask you to stay for the meal.

229
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,520
I don't think

230
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,230
I said I wanted to stay.

231
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,170
Lord Li, you think too much.

232
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,680
Except congratulating you,

233
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,950
I have another very important thing.

234
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,000
Holy Envoy.

235
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,130
Are you free tomorrow?

236
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,990
I'd like to ask you out.

237
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,450
Ask me out?

238
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,000
You have forgotten?

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,520
This makes me sad.

240
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,510
That day in Lisha Town, you promised me

241
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,860
you would buy me a drink.

242
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,010
I still remember it.

243
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,590
But it doesn't matter.

244
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,240
I have a bottle of fine Autumn Dew.

245
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,390
Why don't you come to my Moon Pavilion tomorrow to have a drink?

246
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,150
Sure.

247
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
In that case,

248
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
I won't disturb you any further.

249
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,590
Holy Envoy.

250
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,450
See you tomorrow.

251
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll wait for you.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,810
See you.

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,730
Bye.

254
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,380
Moon Pavilion

255
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,090
I don't think I invited Lord Li.

256
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,130
I learned to be an uninvited guest

257
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,810
from Mr. Qing Jian.

258
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,140
He insisted on coming.

259
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,270
I couldn't stop him.

260
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,890
Forget it.

261
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,480
It's livelier with more people around.

262
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,280
Have a seat.

263
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,790
Moon Pavilion

264
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,080
I think

265
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,680
drinking like this

266
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,870
is too boring.

267
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,050
How about... playing a game?

268
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,250
Okay.

269
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
As you wish.

270
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,440
The game

271
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,250
is called Truth or Dare.

272
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,270
We take turns to spin the chopstick.

273
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,570
The person who the chopstick points at

274
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,330
should answer a question

275
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,130
asked by the person who spins the chopstick.

276
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,120
This is called Truth.

277
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,440
If that person can't answer it,

278
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,370
drink.

279
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,490
This is called Dare.

280
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
What do you think?

281
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,200
Interesting.

282
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,420
What do you think, Lord Li?

283
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,810
Who spins the chopstick first?

284
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,450
Me.

285
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,840
Me?

286
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,490
Fine. Go ahead.

287
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,930
Do you have someone you like?

288
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,880
Cool Guy,

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,520
it's your first time playing this game. You're so good at asking questions.

290
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes.

291
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,940
Who is he?

292
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,120
Sorry.

293
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,600
This is another question.

294
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,980
Continue. Who's next?

295
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,530
I...

296
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,050
You're quite active.

297
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,290
Me again?

298
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,230
Who do you like?

299
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,890
I... I choose Dare.

300
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,070
Don't compete with me this time.

301
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,300
I'll spin it.

302
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,250
This is weird.

303
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,619
Cool Guy.

304
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,450
Come on, answer my question.

305
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,580
Cool Guy, do you have someone you like?

306
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,050
I like you.

307
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
We're out of wine.

308
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,830
W-Where is your wine? I'm going to get it.

309
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,650
Upstairs. Don't take the wrong way.
