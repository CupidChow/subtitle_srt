00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,759
I brought a guest here.

8
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,990
This is Moqian.

00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,000
This is Hua Ni, the new Holy Envoy of the Peacock Sect.

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,110
Hello, my name is Hua Ni.

11
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,200
Du Moqian.

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,509
Moqian is my good friend.

13
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,560
He's a somewhat cold person.

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,020
He only focuses on embroidery.

15
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,400
Please don't mind, Holy Envoy.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
I understand.

17
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,870

What brings you here?

20
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,790
To be honest,

21
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,870
the Holy Envoy and I were planted the Red-tailed Bugs.

22
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,579
But now the Moon Epiphyllum that can draw out the Red-tailed Bugs

23
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,490
is not in the flowering phase.

24
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,110
But you're the expert in planting flowers.

25
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,030
But there's one thing

26
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,340
that I need your help with.

27
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,600
We need a kind of cloth.

28
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,910
It should be light and pervious to light, but at the same time airtight.

29
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,440
The fabric should be dense.

30
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,390
Can you weave this kind of cloth?

31
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,860
Yes.

32
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,100
Really?

33
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,030
If I fail,

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,310
then there will be no one else in the world who can make it.

35
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,510
We're saved!

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,460
Cloth.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,810
Have a look at the cloth.

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,550
We can't let anyone know

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,310
that you are connected to me.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,950
So you have to condescend

41
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,060
to stay at my humble abode for a few days.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,990
I don't have trouble sleeping in a new bed. It's okay.

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,750

as an apology.

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,240
This is the pollen of the flower of Cangqu.

47
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,730
It's conducive to sleep and nerve-calming.

48
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,910
Lord Li, you're very thoughtful.

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,290
Thank you, Lord Li.

plus several houses and stores,

64

all located in the busiest East Market.

65

How did she

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,019
build up all the muscles?

67
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,750
I don't know.

68
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,230
General Chen is a third-rank military officer.

69
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,760
That's his family tradition.

if she's strong,

72
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,410
she can protect you.

73
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,930
Who is this lady?

74
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,030
I wanted to introduce her to you.

She has something important to discuss with me,

78
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,950
so she needs to stay in our house for a few days.

79
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,430
Holy Envoy, how old are you?

80
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,730
Do you have siblings?

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,170
Have you bought any carriages and horses?

82
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,130
Where is your mansion?

83
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm new here.

84
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,120
I don't have those things.

85
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,670
It doesn't matter.

86
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,270
You have a distinguished status.

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,330
Of course you're not to be affected by those worldly things.

88
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,810
I've already prepared an estate and carriages

89

90
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,550
You just need to move in with your personal stuff in the future.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,060
Get married?

92
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,010

Don't be rude to the Holy Envoy.

Please forgive me, Holy Envoy.

95
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,840
Since you're here,

96
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,720
you can stay as long as you want.

97
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,370

You'll know when you spend more time with him.

114

Uncle Li, where is Lord Li?

115
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,730
Look.

116
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,300
You haven't exercised for a long time.

117

Recently, muscular men have been in

118
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,850

119
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,240
Go and work out.

120

Father, do you know

121
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,610
exercising before dinner is bad for the spleen and stomach?

122
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,370
It's just some exercise before dinner.

123
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,730
How could it harm your health?

that stone dumbbell is so light.

139
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
It can't be used for exercise.

140

Get a heavier one.

Lord Li,

164
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,620
if you sleep on the floor,

165
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,680
won't you feel the floor is too hard? Won't you be too cold?

166
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,880
Won't you have trouble falling asleep?

167
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,890
It's fine.

168

Don't worry, Holy Envoy.

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,430
Did you take my father's words seriously?

176

Yes.

I can move in with my personal stuff. That's not bad.

179

Lord Li and the Holy Envoy are not like what you think.

187
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,410
Nonsense.

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,970
There must be something wrong.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,570
Maybe the conditions don't permit it.

193
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,220
I've been through this.

194
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,330
Men are all double-faced.

195
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,980
They refuse something,

196
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,810
but deep down, they want it so much.

197
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,060
You really love to joke.

198
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,170
I like…

199
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,410
I like soft pillows.

200
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,250
Soft ones?

201
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,250
Lord Li.

202
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,090
What kind of soft?

203
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,160
Your Excellency.

204
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,850
Good night.

205
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,450
Good night.

206
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,540
Timid Boy is so shy.

207
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,090
It's okay.

208
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,450
There will be ample time.

209
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,570
Love can be developed gradually.

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,970
If it weren't for the Red-tailed Bugs,

211
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,840
I would have killed you long ago.

212
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,160
She's the Holy Envoy.

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,290
If my son can marry her,

214
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,640
our whole family will be honored.

215
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,980
Shameless!

216
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,090
Didn't you promise that nothing would go wrong?

217
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,350
Why is she still alive?

218
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,930
Please calm down, Lord Envoy.

219
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,140
The Red-tailed Bugs have indeed been planted.

220
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,780
I don't know why.

221
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,270
There's no cure for the Red-tailed Bugs.

222
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,810
Something must have gone wrong.

223
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,890
Qiang, good morning.

224
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,060
You're quite capable.

225
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,810
Come and eat.

226
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,430
This room has never been so clean!

227
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,680
Could it be that the secret helper Miss Tianluo in the folklore becomes true?

228
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,010
Good morning, Uncle Li.

229
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
I've made breakfast.

230
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,640
Come and have some.

231
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,290
Lai, you are a guest.

232
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,290
How can I let you do these things?

233
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,210
I'm used to

234
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,380
doing these things at home.

235
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,570
It's okay.

236
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,080
What a good boy.

237
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,830
Uncle Li, have some.

238
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,070
Try my cooking.

239
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,090
Qiang, sit down and eat.

240
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,670
No, I'm going to exercise.

241
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,170
I haven't had

242
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,370
such a hearty breakfast for a long time.

243
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,330
Qiang,

244
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,160
I've kept some food for you.

245
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,690
Go eat after your practice.

246
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm not hungry.

247
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,120
Do you have any clothes to wash?

248
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,630
I can wash them for you.

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,530
No.

250
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,250
Okay.

251
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,970
Wait.

252
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,350
Wash my handkerchief.

253
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:36,970
Sure.

254
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,150
He has no temper.

255
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,170
Look at Lai.

256
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,840
He got up before dawn.

257
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,730
Not only did he clean the whole house,

258
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,650
but he also made several dishes for breakfast.

259
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,410
Look at you.

260
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,490
You are so lazy.

261
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,610
You didn't get up until the sun was so high above.

262
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,470
How can you win the heart of the Holy Envoy like that?

263
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,010
Father.

264
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,970
Since I'm so hopeless,

265
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,720
I might as well give up.

266
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,400
No way.

267
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,200
Now,

268
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,760
the Holy Envoy is staying at our place.

269
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,090
You must behave well.

270
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,670
The phoenix on this handkerchief

271
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,000
is just short of one eye.

272
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,290
Finish the embroidery

273
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,090
and give it to the Holy Envoy.

274
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,770
Make her like you!

275
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,500
Father,

276
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,970
the Holy Envoy and I are just colleagues.

277
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,170
Colleagues!

278
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,490
Be good.

279
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,560
Here.

280
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,960
Yes, I'll embroider it right away.

281
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,290
My finger!

282
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,250
Holy Envoy, why are you under the bed?

283
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,620
Uncle Li.

284
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,070
Holy Envoy, you...

285
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,120
I thought you went out long ago.

286
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,860
Be careful, Holy Envoy.

287
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,330
Uncle Li.

288
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,450
It's my bad.

289
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,490
I rolled around.

290
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,730
Stop.

291
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,290
Lord Li, you did an excellent job in embroidery.

292
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,410
Don't do it again.

293
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,130
It pricks your fingers,

294
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,590
but my heart felt the pain.

295
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,490
In that case,

296
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,570
I'll listen to you, Holy Envoy.
