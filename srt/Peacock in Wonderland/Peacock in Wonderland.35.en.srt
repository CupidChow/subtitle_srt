Your Ladyship.

5
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,380
We went to Master's Mansion.

6
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,039
Why did Master refuse to see us

7
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,700
and kick us out?

8
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,940
Rong Yu refused to see me.

9
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,140
Muyang is missing.

10
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,700
Something must be wrong.

11
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,539
Lord Li is always cautious.

12
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,140
He wouldn't have got missing for no reason.

13
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,740
He must have fallen into a trap in Master's Mansion.

14
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,740
Anyway,

15
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,680
don't tell anyone about this.

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,610
I don't want Uncle Li to be worried.

22
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,420
Do you know what roses are?

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,410
Roses?

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,140
What is the rose?

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,380
Today, people are looking for roses everywhere in the city.

26
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,780
I've never heard of roses.

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,010
It's so strange.

28
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,700
I can't believe there are flowers that people at Guanbuzhu have never heard of.

30
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,380
I know roses.

31

Sir.

32

These are the flowers our master brought for you.

Look, these are roses.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,260
These are baby's breath flowers.

35
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,950
All right.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,980
Got it.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
You may leave.

38
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,660
Yes.

Muyang.

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,310
I missed you so much.

42
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,070
It's so dangerous here.

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,730
How did you know I was here?

44
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,740
Only we know what roses are in the city.

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,780
I saw your signal.

46
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,860
So I came.

47
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,760
I gave the signal to let you know I'm fine.

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,329
I didn't want you to be too worried about me.

49

I didn't want you to risk your life.

50

No matter how dangerous it is,

52

I must be here with you.

Are you satisfied with these flowers?

61
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,710
Not bad.

62
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,970
I'm glad you like them.

63

Zhiyang, do you still remember these flowers?

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
In our childhood,

65
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,220
you often used baby's breath flowers to make me garlands.

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,420
So many years have passed.

67
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,209
You still remember this?

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,980
You used to be a good boy.

70
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,420
No matter where I went,

71
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,550
you would follow me.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,460
I really hope we can

73
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,409
be good brothers like we used to be in our childhood.

74
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,700
I hope you'll only trust your elder brother

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,300
and help your elder brother.

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,940
Of course I remember my elder brother.

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,030
When there was only one bowl of red bean porridge,

78
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,180
my elder brother let me

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,310
have it and lied to me

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,340
that he had had one before.

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,260
When he knew I had lost the ax to chop firewood,

82
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,020
he went into the dark forest

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,620
and spent the whole night looking for the ax

84
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,150
just because he didn't want me to get scolded.

85
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,330
My elder brother

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,060
chose to sacrifice his own life

87
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,180
to save me

88
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,940

89
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,720
Where did my elder brother go?

90
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,570
Can you give him back to me?

91
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,100
Give him back to me.

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,620
I also want to know

93
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,700
where he went.

94
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,830
Have you forgotten,

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,810
"Zhiyang.

96
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,659
Listen to me.

97
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,980
Let me go.

98
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,360
Goodbye, Zhiyang."

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,440
My elder brother died.

100
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,480
You don't have the right to mention him in front of me.

101
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,610
He died?

102
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,570
Yes, he died.

103
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,060
But have you forgotten how he died?

104
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
If he sacrificed his life to save you and had died,

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
that would have been good.

106
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,890
But he survived.

107
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,220
And he has to take revenge.

108
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,550
He has to get those people to pay the price.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,730
You...

110
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,180
You've forgotten the blood feud between us and them.

111
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,380
You've forgotten it.

112
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,780
But I haven't.

113
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,580
You chose to forgive them.

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,110
But you have no right to ask me to forgive them.

115
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,080
No one has the right to ask me to forgive them.

116
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,510
No one has the right.

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,420
It's okay.

118
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,930
Everything will be fine.

119
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,980
What are these?

120
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,630
Qing Jian now has

121
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,780
the key to the chains on you.

122
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,450
I can't get it.

123
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,530
And you're injured.

124
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,500
So we can only rely on this.

125
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,380
This is called dilute sulphuric acid.

126
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,940
This acid is very corrosive.

127
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,850
If I add nitre into the acid,

128
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,090
it can corrode the chains on you.

129
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,850
Unfortunately, we don't have enough substances we need,

130
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,540
so we can't make dilute sulphuric acid that is highly concentrated.

131
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,240
So we can only keep the dilute sulphuric acid here for a while

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,810
to let the moisture in the acid evaporate

133
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,000
so that this acid is more concentrated.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,780
That's it.

135
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,659
Just wait.

136
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,300
Miracles will happen soon.

137
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,580
This time,

138
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I'll protect you.

139
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,380
Okay.

140
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,190
I asked you to arrest Li Muyang

141
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,980
and kill him.

142
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,150
Why didn't you kill him?

143
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,100
Boss.

144
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,520
Zhiyang is bewitched by them.

145
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,780
I'm sure I can persuade him

146
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,970
into joining us.

147
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,500
He has always been hard to deal with

148
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,220
and kept causing us trouble.

149
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,820
How can we keep him alive?

150
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,930
We've been planning for years

151
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,450
for that position.

152
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,530
Rong Yi is a man of indecision and incapable.

153
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,710
Rong Yu is blinded by romantic love and also incapable.

154
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,440
Only I am fit for that position.

155
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,330
This position should only belong to me.

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,780
Zhiyun.

157
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,900
I took you in

158
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,650
and has been training you since then

159
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,620
because I wanted you to work with me and we could achieve the success.

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Don't forget

161
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,020
what your promised to me.

162
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,820
I dare not forget

163
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,120
what you did to save my life.

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,510
That's good.

165
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,180
Don't let your compassion

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,530
make you soft-hearted.

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,540
If you can't control it,

168
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,540
you must get rid of it.

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,980
Zhiyang.

170
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,230
Have your lunch.

171
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,260
Why are you ignoring me?

172
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,250
Aren't you curious

173
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,070
what I've been doing these days?

174
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,420
These days,

175
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,140
Master has been crazier and crazier about the bamboo flute performances.

176
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,820
If she couldn't hear one play the bamboo flute for one day, she would be mad.

177
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,490
I need to ask the performers to play it every day.

178
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,500
It's annoying.

179
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,550
Do you want to see

180
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,650
how crazy she is?

181
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,050
She's like a pet being raised.

182
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,690
Interesting.

183
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,560
Why don't you control me with the bamboo flute music?

184
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,240
That's for our lowly enemies.

185
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,060
How can I use it to control my brother?

186
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,950
I still hope we can be the way

187
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,350
we used to be when we were kids.

188
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
I hope no matter what I do,

189
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,470
you will support me unconditionally.

190
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,140
It's okay if you don't understand for the time being.

191
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,460
We have plenty of time.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,450
I'm sorry

193
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,220
that I hit you and injured you last time.

194
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
So I asked a famous doctor

195
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,220
to give me some ointment

196
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,280
for you to heal your wound.

197
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,430
No need.

198
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,380
Be good.

199
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,660
I said no need.

200
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,510
Be good, my brother.

201
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,610
Your would will be healed

202
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,410
only after you use the ointment.

203
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,550
-Why are you so wary of me?
-What a jerk.

204
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,790
When I succeed

205
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,460
and the state has its new ruler,

206
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,190
I'll share what I have with you.

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,780
Leave.

208
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,730
Take a good rest.

209
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,990
Remember to use the ointment.

210
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,610
Muyang, are you okay?

211
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,780
I'm fine.

212
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,980
Listen.

213
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,300
You must leave here now.

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,580
The dilute sulphuric acid is not ready to use yet.

215
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,380
I can't leave.

216
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,980
We don't have time now.

217
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,500
You rubbed ointment on my wound.

218
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,830
He must have noticed it.

219
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,580
No.

220
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,570
I can't leave you here alone.

221
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,700
Qingqing.

222
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,890
I'm not leaving.

223
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,460
How come Her Ladyship decided to take action in advance?

224
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,060
Something bad must have happened.

225
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,860
Whatever, let's go there first.

226
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,250
What should we do?

227
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,880
Hurry! The other one. Be careful.

228
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,780
It's not working.

229
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,140
The sulphuric acid is not concentrated enough. It corrodes the metal too slowly.

230
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,020
What should we do?

231
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,820
More acid.

232
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,860
Qingqing.

233
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,230
Listen to me.

234
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,220
Send a message to Qiang and Lai

235
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,970
-and ask them to take you out of here right now.
-No.

236
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,210
I said I would protect you this time.

237
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,180
Give me some more time.

238
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,580
This place is too...

239
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,640
How much time do you need, Holy Envoy?

240
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,770
Why are you avoiding me, Holy Envoy?

241
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,690
Aren't we good friends?

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,020
If you really think of me as your friend,

243
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,620
give me the key to the chains.

244
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,140
Are you really stupid

245
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,870
or too naive?

246
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,460
You...

247
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,580
Ridiculous.

248
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,300
I knew it.

249
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,510
Zhiyang is smart.

250
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,290
He asked me to get flowers for him for a reason.

251
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,220
Let her go.

252
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,180
I'll stay.

253
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,100
I won't go.

254
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,980
Qingqing.

255
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,910
You two love each other so much.

256
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,730
They love each other so much.

257
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,020
But I never expected

258
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,430
that my good brother

259
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,960
would sacrifice so much for his girlfriend.

260
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,180
Is she really that good?

261
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,330
Muyang.

262
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,550
Are you okay?

263
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,750
Take Holy Envoy away.

264
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,930
No one can touch her!

265
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,860
I'll go with you.

266
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,100
Muyang, don't worry.

267
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,210
I'll be back soon.

268
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,450
Everything will be fine.

269
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't worry.

270
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,110
I'll return her to you soon.

271
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,100
Are you okay?

272
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,740
Let me go!

273
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,840
What do you want to say?

274
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,040
You're shouting to me.

275
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,020
You didn't

276
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,180
use to treat me like this.

277
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,570
I was too stupid

278
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,620
back then.

279
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
I treated you as my friend back then.

280
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,080
I treated you as my confidant.

281
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,880
I thought you were such a good person.

282
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,620
Why did you lie to me?

283
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,950
I thought...

284
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,020
You thought I liked you?

285
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,540
What if

286
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,680
I do like you?

287
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,090
Do you believe

288
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,670
what you're saying?

289
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,800
I was not interested in you at first.

290
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,020
You're the Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect.

291
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,850
I wanted to kill you badly.

292
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,780
But I was curious

293
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,260
what kind of woman

294
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,940
could make Zhiyang soft-hearted

295
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,370
and make him break his principles again and again.

296
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,810
Was it fun to lie to me and get me to fall into your trap?

297
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,810
Yes, it was.

298
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,630
It was great fun.

299
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,220
What do you want me to do to let you free Muyang?

300
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,400
I want you to die.

301
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,860
Take it.

302
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,430
The life of the Holy Envoy is precious.

303
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,990
Your death should save more lives.

304
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,120
Your Ladyship.

305
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,380
Qiang.

306
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,060
Your Ladyship.

307
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,660
Lai.

308
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,400
Your Ladyship.

309
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,610
Why did you capture them?

310
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,550
-Qing Jian, are you crazy?
-Lai.

311
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,660
Lai.

312
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,900
Don't you have a compassion

313
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,410
for everyone in the world?

314
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,060
Why are you hesitating?

315
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,900
Choose.

316
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,420
Your Ladyship, don't believe him.

317
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,270
Don't take it.

318
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,940
Choose.

319
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,510
Your Ladyship, don't.

320
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,770
Don't take it.

321
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,280
No, Your Ladyship.

322
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,280
No, Your Ladyship.

323
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,550
Will you keep your word?

324
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,500
You're late.

325
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,060
Qingqing.

326
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,849
Don't be sad.

327
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,460
She did it voluntarily.
