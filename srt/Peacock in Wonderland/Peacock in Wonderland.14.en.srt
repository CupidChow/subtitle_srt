00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,670
Alright.

193
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,110
I'll tell you a story.

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,030
Once upon a time,

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,560
there was a very beautiful girl

196
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,980
who lived in a tower.

197
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,430
She had very long hair.

198
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,910
So long that it could reach

199
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,800
the ground from the high tower.

200
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,540
Don't listen to her nonsense.

201
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,200
Whose hair would reach the ground from a high tower?

202
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,750
Shut up!

203
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,070
Let me continue.

204
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,470
This beautiful girl's mom

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,710
stole and ate the lettuce

206
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,790
from the witch's garden,

207
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,230
so she was cursed.

208
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,880
This curse...

209
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,830
Getting cursed for eating lettuce?

210
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,350
Isn't this story too...

211
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,720
What do you know?

212
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,250
In a child's world,

213
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,730
it's full of imagination.

214
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,340
You have no childlike innocence at all.

215
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,750
Go to sleep.

216
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,670
Good boy, Tong.

217
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,870
Go to sleep.

218
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,840
Good boy.

219
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,600
Mom.

220
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,790
Go check in the room.

221
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,990
No! No!

222
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,130
Let's go.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,400
No! No!

224
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
Where is the child?

225
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Check over there.

226
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,520
He has already run away.

227
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,240
You won't find him!

228
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,840
Don't!

229
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,430
Dad!

230
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,060
Chase him!

231
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,870
No!

232
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,400
Li Muyang, wake up.

233
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,700
Li Muyang?

234
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,720
Did you have a nightmare?

235
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,800
Just let Mom hold you, and you'll be fine.

236
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,390
What are you talking about, kid?

237
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,510
Go wash up.

238
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,950
Okay, I'm going now.

239
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,960
My Lord, last night, I...

240
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,710
I crossed the line.

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,860
What are you doing?

242
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm going to check if Tong is ready.

243
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,030
I need to pee.

244
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,400
I can't hold it anymore.

245
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,430
Stop the car.

246
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,110
I can't hold it anymore.

247
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,630
Come.

248
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,710
I can't hold it anymore.

249
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,390
Slow down.

250
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Hurry up.

251
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,230
Tong?

252
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,410
Are you done?

253
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,350
Almost. Wait a minute.

254
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,130
Tong,

255
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,110
are you done?

256
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,360
Tong?

257
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,630
Tong?

258
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,320
Tong?

259
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,000
Tong?

260
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,200
Tong!

261
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,450
Tong! T...

262
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,230
Honey, help!

263
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,710
-Let go of me!
-Hurry!

264
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,200
Let go of me!

265
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,690
Who are you guys?

266
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,440
-Let go of me!
-Who are you guys?

267
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,790
Go.

268
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,510
Let go of me!

269
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,360
Let go of me!

270
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,450
They took the bait.

271
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,550
Follow up!

272
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,270
Help me!

273
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,280
Let go of me!

274
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,280
Let go of me!

275
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,160
-Let me go!
-Let go of me!

276
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,180
Tong.

277
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,960
Mom.

278
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,110
Mom.

279
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,280
Where are we?

280
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,950
The Peacock Sect?

281
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,690
How could it be?

282
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,780
What are you doing?

283
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,950
-Let go of me!
-Let him go!

284
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,480
Let's go.

285
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,210
Let go of him!

286
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,970
Let go of him!

287
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,860
-Let go!
-Let’s go.

288
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,790
-Let go!
-Let go!

289
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,480
I'm the Holy Envoy.

290
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,960
Kneel!

291
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,080
Greetings, Holy Envoy.

292
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,240
Who told you

293
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,210
to bring all these children here?

294
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,070
It was me.

295
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,080
Chief?

296
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,700
Take the child inside.

297
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,360
Bring the Holy Envoy to the main hall.

298
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,260
Yes.

299
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,350
-Let's go
-Come here.

300
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:20,970
Mom!

301
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,750
-Mom!
-Tong.

302
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,750
-What are you doing? Let go of me!
-Mom!

303
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,550
Let go of me!

304
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,170
Let go of me!

305
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,740
It turns out this is for sacrifice.

306
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,340
My Lord, aren't we going to save the Holy Envoy?

307
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,070
If we act now,

308
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,890
we'll only expose ourselves.

309
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,120
Besides, there are still some days before the sacrifice.

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
They won't harm those children for now.

311
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,130
Let's go.

312
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,210
We have more important things to do.

313
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,090
Let go of me!

314
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
What does the Peacock Sect want

315
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,640
with those children?

316
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,460
Sacrifice.

317
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,200
Sacrifice!

318
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,850
Human sacrifice? Are you insane?

319
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,350
Every decade,

320
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,200
our sect offers two children to the Peacock God

321
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,470
in exchange for its blessings.

322
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,270
This tradition has been upheld for over 100 years

323
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,210
since the founding of the sect.

324
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,670
What an absurd tradition.

325
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,089
It's murder!

326
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,440
What is murder?

327
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,869
To die for the Peacock God

328
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,430
is their honor.

329
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,089
Ridiculous.

330
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,670
You want to sacrifice two children's lives

331
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,069
in exchange for those meaningless things?

332
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,329
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

333
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,680
What kind of god is this?

334
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,410
How dare you!

335
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,140
How could you, the Holy Envoy,

336
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,540
slander the Peacock God?

337
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,270
Kneel!

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,460
If the Peacock God relies on harming the people for blessings,

339
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,790
then I don't acknowledge this god!

340
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,930
What are you doing? Let go of me!

341
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,520
You spoke disrespectfully and offended the true god.

342
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,930
Kneel here overnight

343
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,630
and reflect on your actions.

344
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,790
Sacrifice?

345
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,430
How could it be the Peacock Sect?

346
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,070
Muyang,

347
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,950
is there a misunderstanding?

348
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,370
This was stated by Ruan Jiushu himself,

349
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,630
it's absolutely true.

350
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,280
The Holy Envoy disagrees with them.

351
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
She has been detained in the sect.

352
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,840
Young Master, if you have doubts,

353
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,880
you can send someone to investigate.

354
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,670
But the Peacock Sect has clearly stated

355
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,330
that the sacrificed children

356
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,470
were transformed by the divine power of the Peacock God.

357
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,160
Could it be

358
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,310
that these children

359
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,790
were really abducted from various places by them?

360
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,760
Sacrifice?

361
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,530
Isn't this just murdering innocent lives?
