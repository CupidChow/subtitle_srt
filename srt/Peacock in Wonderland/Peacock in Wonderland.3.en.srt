the Holy Envoy fell from the sky.

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,410
It's expected that she acts differently from ordinary people.

Don't be so serious. Smile.

He Huan.

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,620
Why don't you bow?

43

Her background is unknown.

I grew up in the Peacock Sect.

I don't know you.

50
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,020
Don't try to act like you're close to me.

51
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,810
So rude.

52
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,280
He Huan is disrespectful to the Holy Envoy.

54

He Huan is my junior.

55
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,660
He has been trained as the Holy Envoy since he was young.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,050
His long-cherished wish has fallen through,

57
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,580
so he can't accept it for now

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,140
and has violated the principle of appropriateness.

59
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,780
Please don't mind, Holy Envoy.

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,460
I don't mind. I'm okay.

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,800
We are all in the same sect.

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,620
No need to bow.

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,909

64
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,490
Just behave like what we usually do.

Our sect rules cannot be shaken.

66
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,740
All must bow to the Holy Envoy.

That can't be changed.

68
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,620
Since you are in our sect,

69
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,190
you must also follow the rules of our sect.

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes, Chief.

71
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,500
I see.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,850
Tomorrow, we'll worship the God.

73
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,140
Prepare well, Holy Envoy.

74
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,770
What?

75
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,650
Prepare for what?

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,600
It was your fault.

77
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,650
Now that she is already the Holy Envoy of our sect,

78
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,050
you should follow the rules and bow to her.

79
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,610
Don't cross the line.

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,290
Senior.

81
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,340
I won't admit it.

82
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,410
You said she was a member of Flowers Kill.

83
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,540
Why did you still make her the Holy Envoy?

84
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,070
Now, she's very powerful,

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,450
and she succeeded in praying for the holy rain.

86
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,730
She's gained the people's support.

87
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,930
I have to welcome her.

88
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,180
I know you feel it's unfair.

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,770
In my heart,

90
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,860
you are the only Holy Envoy of our sect.

91
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,930
But now that she's the Holy Envoy,

92
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,659
she has much more power.

93
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,540
I won't let her meddle in the major affairs

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
of the sect.

95
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,450
She just owns the title of Holy Envoy.

96
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,620
Junior,

97
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,900
keep an eye on her for me.

98
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,570
Senior, don't worry.

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,780
I will take good care of her.

100
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,659
In the past three days, I've been with you, Holy Envoy.

101
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,659
I wonder how you prayed for the rain.

102
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,930
I hope you can enlighten me.

103
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,659
You really want to know?

104
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,690
I'll tell you, then.

105
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,300
There are three conditions

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,160
you need  to meet to have rainfall.

107
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,330
First, rich vapor in the air.

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,070
Second,

109
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,230
the air is rising and vapor-saturated.

110
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,620
Third,

111
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,820
there are enough condensation nuclei.

112
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,050
A few days before the rain,

113
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,910
I saw the cirrocumulus in the sky.

114
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,570
The cirrocumulus?

115
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,500
Then, I tested with a handkerchief and a measuring cup

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
to decide the level of air humidity.

117
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,470
The more vapor there is in the air,

118
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,580
the more vapor the silk handkerchief absorbs.

119
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,820
Vice versa.

120
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,700
I conducted this experiment

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,050
in Peacock City and Fengnian Village, respectively.

122
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,690
As expected,

123
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,610
the vapor in Fengnian Village

124
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,409
is far more than in Peacock City.

125
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,180
The village has been harvesting recently.

126
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,130
They are burning fresh straws every day.

127
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,390
There are enough condensation nuclei and rising airflow.

128
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,540
As long as these three conditions are met,

129
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,170
the possibility of rainfall in Fengnian Village

130
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,500
will greatly increase.

131
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,700
In fact,

132
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,870
I was gambling, too.

133
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,270
It's only I won this time.

134
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,230
My Lord,

135
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,010
I don't understand a word.

136
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,780
This is indeed

137
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,140
a bit ahead of your time.

138
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,980
It's difficult for you

139
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,970
to understand it.

140
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,770
But all of it

141
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,720
is down to the power of knowledge.

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,450
What you said just now is amazing.

143
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,460
I am not talented and knowledgeable.

144
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,060
I can't fully understand it.

145
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,570
I hope you can enlighten me in the future.

146
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,970
Lord Li, what are you doing?

147
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,530
I'm not knowledgeable.

148
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,140
It's just some kind of natural phenomenon.

149
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,810
In the future,

150
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,250
as long as you stay with me often,

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,370
you'll find more magical things.

152
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,540
How could it be her?

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,340
Who is it?

154
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,290
Me.

155
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,250
Come in.

156
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,480
Did you find anything new?

157
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,380
We've investigated in secret and confirmed

158
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,010
that the new Holy Envoy has no parents,

159
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,740
siblings, or other relatives.

160
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,880
What do you think of her

161
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,140
based on what she did today?

162
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,179
I think she's very strange.

163
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,850
She talks weirdly

164
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,650
and acts even more weirdly.

165
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,780
And weirdest of all,

166
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
she did succeed in praying for rain.

167
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,660
I've never heard a word of

168
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,370
what she said today.

169
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,260
My Lord,

170
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,850
is she lying to us?

171
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,050
She is different from the Peacock Sect.

172
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,810
When we dealt with the Peacock Sect before,

173
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,860
every time they played tricks,

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,260
we could always expose them and fight back.

175
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,620
The scariest thing about this woman is

176
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,300
she's honest and forthright,

177
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,940
yet we can't even notice anything wrong with her,

178
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,300
not to mention exposing her.

179
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,590
What's more frightening,

180
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,020
ever since I met her,

181
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,230
I don't know how she did it,

182
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
but I dreamed of her again and again.

183
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,260
Do you even dream of her?

184
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,850
Since when?

185
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,330
What did you dream about?

186
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,330
Tell me in detail.

187
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,430
It doesn't matter.

188
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,280
What matters is

189
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,420
she can influence me.

190
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,770
I didn't expect her to be so capable.

191
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,550
If she is used by the Peacock Sect,

192
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,430
she will be our biggest enemy.

193
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,570
So,

194
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,320
we can't keep this person.

195
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm Hua Ni, the Holy Envoy.

196
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,930
I choose today

197
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,530
to worship God

198
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,090
and swear to be the servant of God all my life.

199
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,890
I'll defend God's dignity and honor day and night.

200
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,010
The blood of the Holy Envoy will be dripped into the Holy Spring

201
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,180
to blend in it

202
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,900
to prove that she shares our sect's origin

203
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,510
and will live and die together with our sect.

204
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,920
What are you doing?

205
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,890
Has it been disinfected?

206
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,810
Will I have tetanus?

207
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,290
This is the Peacock Token, the holy article of our sect.

208
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,170
It is now handed over to the Holy Envoy.

209
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,380
The Peacock Token can command the congregation,

210
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,420
so you must abide by your duties

211
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,910
and help develop our sect.

212
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,850
Okay.

213
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,530
Kneel.

214
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,660
It's not over yet?

215
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,180
Although the ceremony is over,

216
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,770
the Holy Envoy must stay in the Holy Land for one night

217
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,050
and meet the Peacock God

218
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,510
to gain enlightenment and inspiration.

219
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,730
Meet the God?

220
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,850
How?

221
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,490
The ceremony can be non-mainstream,

222
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,890
but it can't be abnormal.

223
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,010
Yes.

224
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,540
How is it?

225
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,420
Don't worry, Lord Envoy.

226
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,580
Everything is done

227
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,010
according to your order.

228
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,130
After tonight,

229
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,150
the Holy Envoy will die a horrible death before the painting of God

230
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,060
because she provokes the Peacock God.

231
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,740
Since you took my place,

232
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,210
I will make you die in that position.

233
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,050
If she is used by the Peacock Sect,

234
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,550
she will be our biggest enemy.

235
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,230
So,

236
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,840
we can't keep this person.

237
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,900
Since when can you even hurt people with your sword energy?

238
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
What is that?

239
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,420
Is it some evil magic of the Peacock Sect?

240
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,450
We'll see.

241
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,980
My Lord,

242
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,740
if you cut her,

243
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,620
she will die.

244
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,870
Didn't we come here

245
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,170
to kill her?

246
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,890
My Lord.

247
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,190
It's the Red-tailed Bug.

248
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,490
Holy Envoy.

249
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,010
Holy Envoy!

250
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,410
Holy Envoy, are you alright?

251
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,570
Qiang?

252
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,620
Yang?

253
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,660
Thank you.

254
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,490
Wasn't I communicating with the Peacock God?

255
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,370
Where am I?

256
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,450
Why are you here?

257
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,550
I came to ask you

258
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,010
about the rain-praying.

259
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,980
I heard that you were praying to God in the Holy Temple.

260
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,380
I wanted to wait outside.

261
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,570
But unexpectedly,

262
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,430
we saw someone fishy sneaking in.

263
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,540
Qiang and I followed him in because we were worried about you.

264
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,470
But we were still one step too late.

265
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,450
The Holy Envoy has been planted with parent-Child Red-tailed Bugs.

266
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,900
What is a Red-tailed Bug?

267
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,590
It is a kind of green bug.

268
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,730
The mother and the child live together.

269
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,180
If they are planted in one person at the same time,

270
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,370
they will gradually gnaw away his organs

271
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,740
and eventually cause his tragic death.

272
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,290
If they are planted separately in two people,

273
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,290
then these two will feel the same thing at the same time

274
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
and die together.

275
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,500
What's more horrible is

276
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,490
these two people must stay close to each other.

277
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,500
The farthest distance can't exceed 10 meters.

278
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,160
Otherwise,

279
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,930
the heartache will be intolerable.

280
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,330
Intolerable heartache?

281
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,570
In order to protect you,

282
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,410
I've lured one of them

283
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,570
into my body.

284
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,210
His lordship is really something.

285
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,650
He made up this story on the spot.

286
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,420
What?

287
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,230
Into your body?

288
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:01,980
Lord Li,

289
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,260
you have…

290
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,130
have gone that far for me?

291
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,240
As long as you're safe,

292
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,980
there's nothing I can't do.

293
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,650
By the way,

294
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,930
the Red-tailed Bugs enter the human body through the blood vessels.

295
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,050
Did you bleed today?

296
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,780
Bleed?

297
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,000
The only time I bled

298
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,820
was that someone pricked my finger

299
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,060
at the ceremony.

300
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,050
I see.

301
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,930
It must be because I have appeared out of nowhere

302
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,130
and took the position of Holy Envoy,

303
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,260
Ruan Jiushu and He Huan didn't like me.

304
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,750
Besides, only the two of them

305
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,030
can tamper with the ceremony,

306
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,540
right?

307
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,830
But those are just your speculation.

308
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,340
There is no evidence.

309
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,900
That means

310
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,780
I have no choice but to bear it without a way to accuse them.

311
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,700
They are the Chief and the Envoy.

312
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,600
I can't afford to offend them.

313
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,970
We can't stay here for long.

314
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,300
Let's discuss it later.

315
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,790
This is the Moon Epiphyllum.

316
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,920
Red-tailed Bugs love to suck its nectar.

317
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,090
As long as we wait until it blooms

318
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,420
and collect its nectar,

319
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
we can lure the Red-tailed Bugs out.

320
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,650
Then, we can untie the link.

321
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,380
Exactly.

322
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,010
It's just a bud.

323
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,090
When can it bloom?

324
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,420
The Moon Epiphyllum likes the hot weather.

325
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,020
It only blooms in midsummer.

326
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,130
Midsummer? It's still a long time.

327
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,530
How can we make it bloom sooner?

328
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,530
If only there were plastic or glass.

329
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,730
Then, we can create a greenhouse

330
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,130
where the temperature and humidity are constant.

331
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,370
It can bloom

332
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,560
whenever it wants.

333
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,580
What is plastic?

334
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,270
Plastic

335
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,780
is a kind of material that is airtight

336
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,770
but transparent.

337
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,130
As long as we cover the Moon Epiphyllum with it,

338
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,940
we can accelerate its growth.

339
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
It's easy.

340
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,660
You can find all the textiles in the world in Yanxia Shop.

341
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,430
Yanxia Shop?

342
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,370
[Yanxia Shop]

343
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,210
This is the first embroidery house in Peacock City,

344
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,010
Yanxia Shop.

345
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,490
The embroidery here is the best in the world.

346
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,849
Even if the Master wants something from here,

347
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,380
it'll not be so easy for her.

348
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,410
Please, Holy Envoy.
