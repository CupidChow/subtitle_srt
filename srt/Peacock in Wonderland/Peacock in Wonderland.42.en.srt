[Episode 42]

4
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,270
Li Zhiyun.

5
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:34,870
Stop.

6
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,320
They deserve to die.

7
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,950
You...

8
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,560
Pick it up or not?

9
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,920
I knew

10
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,150
Rong Yu wouldn't give up.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,600
She will take back everything that should belong to her.

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,550
I am Rong Yu, master of Peacock City-State.

13
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,870
Qing Jian committed treason

14
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,200
and usurped the throne.

15
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,760
I'm going to defeat the rebels today.

16
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,410
Attention, generals!

17
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,610
Defeat the rebels!

18
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,150
Repel the evil!

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,950
Defeat the rebels!

20
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,430
Repel the evil!

21
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,080
Defeat the rebels!

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,430
Repel the evil!

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,540
What are you happy about?

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,940
We're lawfully wedded.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,800
It's a good thing

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
that we can die together.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,160
Today is Master's wedding day.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,890
How dare you make trouble here?

29
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,670
Ask your master to come out

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,079
and let Qingqing come back to me.

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,880
Muyang.

32
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,260
Brother.

33
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,730
Today is my wedding day.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,950
You brought such a gift for me.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,470
That's really a surprise.

36
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,540
Go!

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Go!

38
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,630
Bow and arrow.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,600
Get me a bow and arrow.

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,200
Yes.

41
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,960
Why are you laughing?

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,020
Didn't you say we could die together?

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
Don't run away.

44
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,600
What should we do, My Lord?

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,150
Her Ladyship is still up there.

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,829
Rope.

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,450
Find a rope!

48
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,310
Go!

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,280
Hua Ni.

50
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,370
What are you doing?

51
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,750
I extracted white phosphorus from the flint.

52
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,150
The white phosphorus burns easily.

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,610
So it's not easy to put out the fire it causes.

54
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,710
This time,

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
both of us won't be able to escape.

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You wanted to take a hot air balloon on our wedding day.

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
So it was a trap?

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
What do you think?

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,510
Muyang.

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,600
Let it go.

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,430
It won't work.

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,950
I won't.

63
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,030
Muyang.

64
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,890
I've never forgotten you.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,790
I know.

66
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,240
I always know it.

67
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,210
Your Ladyship.

68
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,190
Hang in there.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
We'll pull you down soon.

70
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,760
Hua Ni.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,200
Didn't you promise me

72
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:50,370
that you wouldn't do anything stupid again?

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
Rong Yu.

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Moqian.

00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Qiang.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,310
And Lai.

77
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,150
I really...

78
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,670
I really like you guys.

79
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,750
Didn't you promise me

80
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,470
you wouldn't leave me again?

81
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,680
Li Muyang.

82
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,070
I love you.

83
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,570
Let go.

84
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,590
No.

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I won't.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,560
I won't let go!

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,400
You won.

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,840
You won.

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Stop gathering here.

90
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,670
You're awake.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,910
How do you feel? Are you okay?

92
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,270
Where is Li Muyang? Where is Peacock City-State?

93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,380
Peacock City-State?

94
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
There is no Peacock City-State

95
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,640
or Muyang.

96
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,110
You're the only one who fell down.

97
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,790
It's impossible.

98
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,360
I just came back from Peacock City.

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,820
I was the Holy Envoy there.

100
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,440
You just passed out.

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,510
It's possible you went to Peacock City.

102
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:36,880
You

103
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,080
just passed out.

104
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,560
Did you have illusions?

105
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,040
Let me take you to the hospital.

106
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,850
Everybody, leave.

107
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,200
Please leave.

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,640
Please leave. It's okay.

109
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,610
Let me help you up.

110
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you really okay?

111
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,070
Thank you.

112
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,160
You're welcome.

[Little Heroine in Peacock City]

114
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,310
It's said on Mangjiuzhou there was a Peacock City-State.

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,230
People there worshipped Peacock Gods.

116
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,630
and were believers of the Peacock Sect.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,240
Today the Peacock Sect was holding its Holy Fire Ceremony.

118
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,800
The bells and drums are clanging.

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,530
The feathers of gods are clear.

120
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
The ceremony is ready.

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,820
We are here to invite gods.

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,710
The Peacock Sect is blessed by gods.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
Today we will choose our own Holy Envoy.

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,870
The Envoy is He Huan.

125
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,390
He has been blessed by gods for over ten years.

126
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,770
He served the gods day and night

127
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,370
and devoted his life to gods.

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,560
Peacock Gods, please make him Holy Envoy

129
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,110
and light the Holy Fire

130
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,660
to show your guidance.

131
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,950
Peacock Gods, please light the Holy Fire.

132
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,680
Peacock Gods, please light the Holy Fire.

133
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,240
Didn't the Peacock Gods hear it?

134
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,440
How is that possible?

135
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,320
I think

136
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,790
Peacock Gods don't think He Huan is qualified to be the Holy Envoy.

137
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,430
Moqian.

138
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,910
What's going on?

139
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,350
I don't know.

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,050
Peacock Sect likes making dramas.

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,690
Is anything wrong this time?

142
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,790
They like to pretend that there are ghosts and gods.

143
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,560
Today,

144
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,640
their tricks failed.

145
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Chief.

146
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,400
What’s going on?

147
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,760
Master, please let me go to the giant vessel

148
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,250
and see what's happening.

149
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,510
Approved.

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,800
What's going on?

151
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,130
How come you can't even do a tiny job well?

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,830
The gods have shown their kindness.

153
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,870
He Huan has become the Holy Envoy.

154
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,750
What is it?

155
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,910
Show it to me.

156
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,040
So many people

157
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,470
accused the Peacock Sect of committing crimes

158
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,800
and signed the petition with their blood.

159
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,560
Chief.

160
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,560
Anything you want to explain?

161
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Master.

162
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,370
Someone is trying to stop us from holding the ceremony.

163
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,680
We serve the gods with all our hearts

164
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,810
and are loyal to you.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We have never committed any crimes.

166
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,270
What's going on?

167
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,200
What's going on?

168
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,560
What is this?

169
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,290
What is this?

170
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,790
What's going on?

171
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,480
The Peacock Sect pretended there were gods and ghosts

172
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,000
and fooled people in the name of gods.

173
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,680
They deserve to die.

174
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,970
By Flowers Kill.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,030
Flowers Kill?

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,310
I've never heard of this organization before.

177
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,950
Are they against Peacock Sect?

178
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Imperial Commander!

179
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,920
Arrest those from Flowers Kill.

180
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,160
I must interrogate them

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,560
and find out the truth.

182
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,710
Yes.

183
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,470
Zhiyang.

184
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,170
It's done. Let's go.

185
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,390
Yu.

186
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,030
There're still many days before our wedding day.

187
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,430
Why are you making the wedding outfits now?

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,000
The wedding outfits are not ordinary clothes.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Every stitch matters.

190
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,630
So I should make them in advance.

191
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,950
Moqian.

192
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,020
You'll make clothes for me for the rest of your life.

193
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,070
Okay.

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,170
I'll only make clothes for you for the rest of my life.

195
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,990
By the way,

196
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,930
Flowers Kill suddenly appeared during the ceremony.

197
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,190
It's very suspicious.

198
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,390
What are your thoughts about it?

199
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,110
Although they destroyed the ceremony,

200
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,270
I have a feeling that

201
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
they are not bad people.

202
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,910
Right.

203
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,860
I think Flowers Kills

204
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,680
must be a group of righteous people.

205
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,540
They didn't want the Peacock Sect

206
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,630
to keep making dramas and fooling people

207
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,080
so they collected evidence secretly

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
and told everyone the crimes the Peacock Sect committed.

209
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,410
I read the petition carefully.

210
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,930
What it says is true.

211
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,030
Now,

212
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,760
Mother is deceived by the Peacock Sect.

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,050
So she believed what Ruan Jiushu said.

214
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,300
When I become the master of Peacock City-State,

215
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,360
I'll teach the Peacock Sect a lesson.

216
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,630
I trust you, Yu.

217
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,440
Commander.

218
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,190
We’ve searched all the blocks around,

219
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,590
but no trace of Flowers Kill has been found.

220
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,690
Where did the Flowers Kill come from?

221
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,970
How dare they

222
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,520
make trouble in front of me?

223
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,120
I'll arrest them all!

224
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,330
Keep searching!

225
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,080
Yes.

226
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,610
Stop!

227
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,510
Why are you sneaking around?

228
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,160
What are you doing here?

229
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,720
Sir.

230
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,250
I am not a fugitive.

231
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,060
Stop!

232
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,510
Come back with me.

233
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,560
I don't want to marry you.

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,320
What's going on?

235
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,200
He refused to marry me.

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,590
You forced me to marry you.

237
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,860
Nonsense!

238
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,840
I gave your mother 30 taels of silver as the gift money.

239
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
You did a wrong thing.

240
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,160
Two people should love each other

241
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,800
and be willing to get married if they are to get married.

242
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,950
If he doesn't want to marry you,

243
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,010
then you're forcing him to marry you.

244
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,470
You...

245
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,480
What about my gift money?

246
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,540
How come I paid money and got nothing?

247
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,210
That's more like it.

248
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,670
Let's go.

249
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,140
Thank you, sir.

250
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,280
I should repay you.

251
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm Lai.

252
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll be at your disposal from now on.

253
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
I can be your servant.

254
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,790
Let me ask you.

255
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,100
What can you do?

256
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,590
I can wash clothes clean.

257
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,920
I'm good at cooking.

258
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,150
I'm also good at sewing clothes and doing needlework.

259
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,000
From now on,

260
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,710
I'll take care of every aspect of your life.

261
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,910
Good. You're worth the money I gave her.

262
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,310
Just follow me from now on.

263
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,310
I'll protect you.

264
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,550
It's really exciting today.

265
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,550
Flowers Kill took action for the first time today.

266
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,160
And we told people in the city

267
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,190
the crimes Peacock Sect committed.

268
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,240
This is so great.

269
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,310
But today,

270
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,970
Master didn't punish Ruan Jiushu at all.

271
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,710
If we continue to keep a low profile,

272
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,170
can we really defeat them?

273
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,870
If not,

274
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,440
I will kill them

275
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,960
even if I have to die with them.

276
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,850
Brother, don't be so impatient.

277
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
We let people

278
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,460
start to realize the Peacock Sect has done so many bad things.

279
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,120
They will gradually begin to fight against the Peacock Sect.

280
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,470
Though only a few of the people are on our side now,

281
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,380
there will be more and more people who will help us as time goes by.

282
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,400
We just need to let more people know the crimes the Peacock Sect committed.

283
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,590
Eventually, all the people will help us fight against them.

284
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,390
You're right.

285
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,330
As long as we're united

286
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,630
and do things gradually,

287
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,490
we'll succeed.

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,070
You must be hungry after a long day.

289
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,200
I'll make you some noodles.

290
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,830
Okay.

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Don't drink too much.

292
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
Brother.

293
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,630
I'll distract them.

294
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,400
Hurry up.

295
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,940
This way.

296
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,630
Yes.

297
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,760
Over there.

298
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,230
Hurry.

299
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,600
♫Flowers fall with the gentle kiss of the wind♫

300
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,300
