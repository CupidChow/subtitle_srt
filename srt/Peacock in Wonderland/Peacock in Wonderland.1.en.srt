It is said that there is a Peacock City-State in Mangjiuzhou.

It's up to the Master to decide right and wrong.

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,310
She descended from the sky and lit the Holy Tripod.

127
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,340
Could she be the Peacock Holy Envoy?

128

She must be an accomplice of Flowers Kill.

132
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,620
She should be executed.

133
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,780

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,909
She lit the Holy Fire just now.

135
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,270
She must be the Holy Envoy. There's no doubt.

I am the Peacock Envoy.

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,950

141
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,080

that according to the rules of the Peacock Sect,

143
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,500
whoever lights the Holy Tripod should be the Holy Envoy.

144
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,080
Could it be that the Peacock God's will

145
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,310
can be changed at will by you, Chief?

146
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,180

154
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,100
I don't know.

155
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,980
Where did the flowers come from?

156
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,030
Yeah.

157
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,000
How could there be flowers?

158
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,340

This famous flower is the most beautiful in the world.

162
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,560
Only it can match with you, Master.

163
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100

164
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,640

165
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,580

166
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,940
Yes.

167
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,870
The Holy Envoy is really powerful.

168
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,860
That was close.

169
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,230
I think I've bluffed it out.

170
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,460
Master.

171
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,820
The Holy Envoy is the foundation of our sect.

172
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,720
Not only must they be unswervingly loyal to the Peacock God,

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
but they must also bring benefits to the people.

174
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,790
An ordinary person cannot serve as a Holy Envoy.

175
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,710
What can you do?

176
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,900
I heard that the Holy Envoy of every generation was able to pray for rain.

177
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,630
May I ask

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,110
the Holy Envoy to pray for the rain

179
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,520
so as to help the people?

180
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,550
What do you think, Master?

181
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,100
That is a great idea.

182
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,790
The Holy Envoy will pray for the rain

183
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,340
for our Peacock City-State in three days.

184
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,320
If it succeeds,

185
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,860
the whole city will be blessed.

186
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,940
If it doesn’t work,

187
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,860
then we'll listen to Chief

188
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,340
and execute her.

189
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,610
Lord Li,

190
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,800
I order you to work with the Holy Envoy.

191
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,150
Oh no.

193
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,780
That's getting bad.

194
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,700
Chief,

195
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,060
the origin of this woman is unknown.

196
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,390
She must be a villain sent by Flowers Kill.

197
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,270
Do you really want her to be the Holy Envoy?

198
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,300
Don't worry.

199
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,060
The position of the Holy Envoy will only be yours.

200
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,300
As for that woman,

201
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,040
I will never let her get what she wants.

202
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,300
The fire-lighting ceremony

203
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,160
must be tempered by Flowers Kill.

204
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,810
Go investigate!

205
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,290
Yes.

206
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,690
They're so weak.

207
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Is that woman from the Peacock Sect?

208
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,710
But Ruan Jiushu looked like she wanted to kill her.

209
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,980
So, it doesn't feel it.

210
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,510
They didn't notice

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,580
that we changed the iron dust in advance.

212
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,110
This isn't even flammable.

213
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,470
How did that woman fall from the sky

214
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,750
and light the Tripod?

215
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,250
Ruan Jiushu is full of tricks.

216
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,200
Maybe she did it deliberately.

217
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,740
Li Muyang.

218
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,150
Li Muyang!

219
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,740
Li Muyang.

220
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
Let me teach you to dance.

221
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,610
Come on.

222
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,900
One.

223
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,740
Two.

224
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,660
Three.

225
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,300
Relax.

226
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,990
Why did I have a dream like that?

227
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,750
Who was that woman in the dream?

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,380
Where's my phone?

229
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Where's my phone?

230
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,110
Holy Envoy.

231
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,560
Holy Envoy.

232
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,900
Holy Envoy.

233
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,240
Time to get up.

234
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,700
Why am I still here?

235
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,660
This isn't a dream, is it?

236
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,660
Holy Envoy,

237
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,720
please allow me to serve you to wash and get changed.

238
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,200
Holy Envoy,

239
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
please choose what you want to wear.

240
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,260
Am I not scantily clad to dress like this

241
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,840
in this era?

242
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,150
Of course not.

243
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,700
In our Peacock City-State,

244
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,830
what you dress is all up to your preference.

245
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,580
No one will restrict you.

246
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,780
Even women are not restricted, either?

247
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,180
Of course not.

248
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,110
In Peacock City-State,

249
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,610
there is no difference between men and women.

250
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,420
Women

251
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,030
can battle on the battlefield

252
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,510
or become an official in the court.

253
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,230
Men

254
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,790
can stay at home to take care of their children and

255
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,450
do the embroidery and sewing,

256
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,500
Women can get married three or four times. There's no problem.

257
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,990
I can do whatever I want.

258
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm happy to get married three or four times.

259
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,550
What does it have to do with you?

260
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,670
Interesting.

261
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,260
In our Peacock City-State,

262
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,340
men and women are equal.

263
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,860
You can do whatever you want.

264
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,430
Whatever I want?

265
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,310
The Peacock City-State is quite open.

266
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,520
If possible,

267
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,940
I really want to have fun.

268
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,980
Unfortunately, I have to complete a mission as soon as I get here.

269
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,950
-Freshly baked naans.
-What's that smell?

270
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,900
Come and have a look.

271
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,900
Miss, do you want to buy some to have a taste?

272
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,740
Sure, boss.

273
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,740
I'll take two, please.

274
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,210
Okay.

275
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,660
This is made from the newly harvested wheat from Fengnian Village.

276
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,790
It tastes very good.

277
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,750
Where is Fengnian Village?

278
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,860
It's outside the city.

279
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,540
The whole village grows wheat.

280
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,420
But there's a drought this year, hence the poor harvest.

281
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,230
The villagers are all burning the straws to fertilize the fields.

282
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,030
Boss, two more roasted chicken.

283
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,810
Sure.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,460
Guanbuzhu is selling sachets today.

285
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,370
It'll be sold out if we're late.

286
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,420
The fabric of the sachets

287
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,500
is from Yanxie Shop.

288
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,520
I have to buy some more this time.

289
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,070
Sure.

290
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,740
Let's go.

291
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,630
Miss.

292
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,050
Take care.

293
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,240
Thank you, boss.

294
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,700
I want the scent of Gardenia.

295
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
And one with the scent of Butterfly.

296
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,310
This, that, and that.

297
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,350
Boss.

298
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,500
Do you still have Lotus left?

299
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
I think this one is good, too.

300
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,750
So beautiful.

301
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,360
I like this one, too.

302
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,170
I want this one.

303
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,800
I want them all.

304
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,360
This one.

305
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,050
Great. We all got it.

306
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,350
That was fast.

307
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Your Excellency,

308
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,710
do you like these sachets, too?

309
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,580
Lord Li,

310
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,790
why are you here?

311
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,990
This is my father's shop.

312
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,940
I come here to help when I'm free.

313
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,960
I didn't know you were coming. Please forgive me for not welcoming you.

314
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,599
Please.

315
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,569
-Hello, Lord Li.
-Thank you.

316
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,630
Hello, Lord Li.

317
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,220
Morning.

318
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,190
-Morning.
-Good morning, Lord Li.

319
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,820
Welcome to Guanbuzhu, the flower shop, Holy Envoy.

320
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,370
This flower shop does not only sell flowers

321
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,980
but also sells sachets.

322
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,380
Lord Li,

323
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,820
did you make these sachets yourself?

324
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,740
Of course not.

325
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,910
I'm usually busy with being an official.

326
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,970
I only come back to help when I'm free.

327
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,350
Do you also raise the birds?

328
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,280
Two of them, yes.

329
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
The chubby one is called Chu.

330
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,770
The thin one is called Han.

331
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,090
You are...

332
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,460
This sachet here

333
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
is made by me in person.

334
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
It smells so good.

335
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,520
Is this what they call

336
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,100
Butterfly

337
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,660
or Gardenia?

338
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,520
This is the one and only scent.

339
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,190
I specially made it for you, Holy Envoy.

340
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,360
The butterflies flutter friskily, and the flowers sway gently.

341
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,240
Their red and white colors make for a motley scene.
