[Episode 17]

4
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,330
In the past, I didn't understand

5
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
why Flowers Kill always stands against Peacock Sect.

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,039
But now I understand.

7
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,610
Peacock Sect is a tumor.

8
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,560
Drink, Lord Li.

9
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,870
But actually,

10
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,759
Peacock Sect's members

11
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,110
and the civilians

12
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,440
pin their hope on the intangible Peacock God

13
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,160
because of their ignorance

14
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,880
and hardships.

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,759
If we give them livelihood guarantees

16
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,780
and teach them knowledge,

17
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,370
no one will be deceived, right?

18
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,880
As the saying goes,

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,919
all remarkable accomplishments start from scratch,

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,150
and success can only be attained through our own efforts.

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,410
I think it makes sense.

22
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,360
You're right.

23
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,720
I used to go against Peacock Sect.

24
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,930
But I never thought about solving problems from the roots.

25
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,990
Just like you said,

26
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,710
if the civilians

27
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,840
are so foolish,

28
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,810
even without Peacock Sect,

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,340
there would be other sects.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,100
But it's easier said

31
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,210
than done.

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,650
Don't worry.

33
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,260
No matter how challenging the journey is,

34
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,890
I'm willing to go with you.

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
Okay, it's a deal.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,650
Deal.

37
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,290
Lisha Town has suffered from drought for three years.

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,420
Why haven't they reported it until today?

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,140
Master,

40
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,640
among the three towns in the north, Lisha Town is at the border.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,860
It's beyond the influence of royal power.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,710
If it weren't for the recent investigation,

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,460
we wouldn't have known the local officials have been hiding the truth

44
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,360
and lying to you.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Ridiculous!

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,530
How dare they ignore the people and be so selfish!

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,940
Remove all the officials in Lisha Town from office

48
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,220
and investigate them.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,579
I'll punish them later.

50
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,930
Master, you are wise.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,300
The drought situation is urgent.

52
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,060
Is there a way to deal with it?

53
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm willing to go to Lisha Town for disaster relief.

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,190
As long as

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,150
the problem is not solved,

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,590
I will not come back.

57
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,790
Master, please allow me to go.

58
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,850
Okay.

59
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,110
Thank you, Master.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,720
Mother,

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,360
I also want to make some contributions to addressing the drought.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm willing to go to Lisha Town with Lord Li.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,530
Holy Envoy,

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,690
are you willing to go to Lisha Town?

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,480
It's my honor

66
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,610
to do things for Peacock City-State.

67
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,770
Good.

68
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,900
Master,

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,450
He Huan made a big mistake before.

70
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,930
He has been repenting.

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,690
Can you let him go with them

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,560
to make up for his mistake?

73
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,339
Let He Huan go with them.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,680
Master, you are wise.

75
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,470
-Mother.
-No need to say more.

76
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,790
It's been decided.

77
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,680
Chief.

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
You suffered in prison.

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
Get up.

80
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,670
I begged Master Rong for an opportunity

81
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,750
of letting you go to Lisha Town for disaster relief.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
You must seize it.

83
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,330
Chief,

84
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,200
I will make up for my mistake.

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,430
There is something more important.

86
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,600
After Holy Envoy appeared,

87
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,500
she prayed for rain and blessings.

88
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,250
She offered a sacrifice and was summoned.

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,060
Now she's more popular

90
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,420
than anyone else.

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,870
The people in the city worship her as a god.

92
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,640
This is not a good sign.

93
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Chief, you're very distinguished.

94
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,810
She is just a Holy Envoy.

95
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,690
How dare she cross the line!

96
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,600
So,

97
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,210
I need you.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,800
Chief,

99
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,570
I understand.

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,080
How much longer will it take?

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,860
If we travel day and night,

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,850
it will take more than five days.

103
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,780
Five days? That long?

104
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,730
Lisha Town is the northernmost in Peacock City-State.

105
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,010
Although the weather is dry,

106
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,860
it's still prosperous

107
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,810
as it's situated on a vital trade route.

108
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,070
There are many vendors coming and going.

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,680
The market is crowded every day.

110
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,540
You remember a small town so clearly.

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540

Lord Li,

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,380
is this the Lisha Town you said

115
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
that is very liveable?

116
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,159

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm Li Muyang, Assistant Minister of Rites.

120
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,250
This is Hua Ni, Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect.

121
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,010
Master Rong heard Lisha Town has long been troubled by the drought.

122
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,360
So she sent us to help.

123
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,100
You came all the way here to help us.

124
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
Thank you very much.

125
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,000
On behalf of the civilians in the town,

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,050
-I thank you.
-Don't.

127
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,010
Lord Liu, get up.

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,840
Get up.

129
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,470
Lord Liu, you don't have to do this.

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,840
Tell me

131
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,790
what on earth happened in this town first.

132
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,170
According to my inspection and investigation these days,

133
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,370
the drought has lasted for three years.

134
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Hardly a drop of rain has fallen.

135
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,090
In the first year of the drought, the town had surplus grain

136
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,950
and could barely support itself.

137
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,270
In the second year,

138
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,930
the town ran out of its surplus grain,

139
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,610
and there was no harvest at all.

140
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,960
The young and the strong

141
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,280
left the town to make a living.

142
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,090
The old, the weak, women, and children

143
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,409
could only look for wild grass

144
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,909
and eat uncooked plants.

145
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,430
This year is the third year.

146
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,270
If you hadn't come,

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,370
I'm afraid...

148
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,500
In my opinion, it's not difficult

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,610
to deal with the drought.

150
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,710
If so,

151
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,900
you deal with it.

152
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,930
Yes.

153
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm incompetent.

154
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,210
I'm not like you.

155
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,650
You're very powerful.

156
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,180
You prayed for rain successfully by dancing.

157
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,050
This place is so dry.

158
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,760
Holy Envoy, why don't you pray for rain as soon as possible

159
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
to address the drought here?

160
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,760
Praying for rain is about the time, place, and people.

161
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,820
I can't do that just because I want to.

162
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,030
Besides,

163
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,160
even if we successfully pray for heavy rain,

164
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,220
maybe we still can't address the drought from its root.

165
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,370
Lord Liu,

166
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,970
Holy Envoy is right.

167
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,610
If we can't solve the problem from its root,

168
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,800
it won't be useful.

169
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,570
How about this? Let's talk inside.

170
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,140
Please.

171
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,850
Please.

172
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,750
My Lords, please.

[Landform Map of Lisha Town]

174
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,660
What a shabby place!

175
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,010
Where is my room?

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
Upstairs.

Is he here for disaster relief or for fun?

179
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,390
Forget it. Ignore him.

180
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,590
Lord Li, you said

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
in the past, Lisha Town was surrounded by lush vegetation

182
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,830
and encircled by mountains.

183
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,230
According to the terrain,

184
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,090
there must be underground water.

185
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,990
Since it doesn't rain,

186
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,280
let's look for underground water.

187
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,800
Then the drought can be addressed, right?

188
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,100
Holy Envoy, you are right.

189
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,230
But we already used the way of digging a well to get water.

190
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,510
We didn't see water

191
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,990
after digging down 1.667 meters underground.

192
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,630
What?

193
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,400
The location is the most important to opening a well.

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,580
Look at this place.

195
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,520
But the Peacock River has already dried up.

196
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,990
The riverbed has sunk.

197
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,030
The water level of underground water

198
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,670
must have sunk with it too.

199
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,840
Looks like the key really lies in finding the water outlet accurately.

200
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,880
In that case,

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,810
let's set out for an inspection immediately.

202
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
According to the map,

203
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,670
this area is the basin of the Peacock River.

204
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,330
But the land has suffered severe desertification.

205
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,790
There's no sign of underground water at all.

206
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,120
It's because of the weather.

207
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,580
Maybe there is still hope.

208
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
Let's take a look first.

209
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,360
Look.

210
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,320
This kind of plant is highly water-dependent.

211
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,430
If it can grow here,

212
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,140
it means

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,670
the underground area here

214
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,760
must be moister than other places.

215
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
So there must be water underground.

216
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,570
But there is only one plant here.

217
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,500
It's hard to say.

218
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,140
You're right.

219
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,800
I have an idea.

220
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,590
We just need to dig a pit here

221
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,330
and observe carefully

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,910
before the sun rises tomorrow.

223
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,550
If there is moisture

224
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,870
in this pit,

225
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,190
it means there must be underground water.

226
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,750
Okay.

227
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,080
Let's do as you said.

228
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,830
Hua Ni.

229
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,970
[Posthouse]

230
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,970
Where are they?

231
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,070
Holy Envoy went out for an inspection with Lord Li.

232
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,080
Why didn't they tell me they went for an inspection?

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,670
You said you were tired as soon as you arrived here.

234
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,440
Now you have the energy to go out?

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,500
It's getting dark.

236
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
There is sand in the wind everywhere outside.

237
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,190
If you want to go, I can take you there.

238
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm not going. I haven't eaten yet.

239
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,440
You.

240
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,030
You.

241
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,440
Go cook some in the kitchen.

242
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,270
There must be meat and vegetables.

243
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,430
I can't eat this.

244
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,670
I'm not going.

245
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,710
You're not going?

246
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,630
You are a servant. How dare you disobey my order!

247
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,710
I only obey Holy Envoy's orders.

248
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,440
I don't obey other people's orders.

249
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,500
Holy Envoy, right?

250
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,170
Holy Envoy! Holy Envoy!

251
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,310
If you dare to touch him,

252
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,710
I'll chop your hands off.

253
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm a member of Peacock Sect.

254
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,370
Do you believe I'll...

255
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,110
I'm not a member of Peacock Sect.

256
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,150
Just tell on me.

257
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,790
See if I'm afraid of you.

258
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,220
Qiang, forget it.

259
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,570
You two.

260
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,910
Just you wait.

261
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,120
Thank you.

262
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,310
You almost got beaten.

263
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,590
Why didn't you fight back?

264
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,230
Holy Envoy asked us to stay here.

265
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,430
I'm worried I would cause her trouble if things got worse.

266
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,390
You

267
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,150
shouldn't always think for others.

268
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,880
Think for yourself sometimes.

269
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,400
Forget it.

270
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,480
Don't worry.

271
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,970
As long as I'm here,

272
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,400
he can't cause any trouble.

273
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,390
Okay.

274
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,360
It's too dry.

275
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,460
My throat hurts.

276
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,190
Thank you.

277
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,600
This is the best food in Lisha Town.

278
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,350
It seems you are very familiar with this place.

279
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,410
It's not your first time here, right?

280
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,160
It's not my first time here.

281
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,070
I was born here.

282
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,890
This is my hometown.

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,160
So you and Uncle Li

284
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,040
moved to Peacock City-State later?

285
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,300
He is my foster father.

286
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,260
Lisha Town was not like this when I was little.

287
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,150
Although there was a water shortage at that time,

288
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,750
the rainfall was sufficient

289
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,280
for the townsfolk to be self-sufficient.

290
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,230
At that time,

291
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,970
I lived here with my biological parents.

292
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,170
Although we were not rich,

293
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,420
we were very happy.

294
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,950
In childhood,

295
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,320
my brother and I often came here

296
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,120
to look at stars.

297
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,210
This place could avoid the town's lights.

298
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,590
The stars here were the brightest.

299
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,190
Since I went to Peacock City,

300
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,550
I haven't looked at the stars for a long time.

301
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,670
You have a brother?

302
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,640
You never told me this.

303
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,090
He passed away.

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,390
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,230
It's okay.

306
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,030
It's been years

307
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,400
since he died.

308
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,030
It's just that returning to this place

309
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,750
reminds me of him.

310
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,110
You have returned to your hometown.

311
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,670
I don't know when I can go back.

312
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,430
It's strange.

313
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,150
Actually, I asked Qiang to investigate you secretly.

314
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,200
But we just couldn't find anything.

315
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,190
Are you really Peacock Sect's Holy Envoy

316
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,670
falling from the sky?

317
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,470
That's nonsense.

318
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,230
Look, I'm a human too.

319
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,120
I also have a home and kinsfolk.

320
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
It's just that...

321
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,910
my home is far away.

322
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,920
It's different from Peacock City-State.

323
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,590
Although Uncle Li is your foster father,

324
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,090
he treats you very well.

325
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,280
No matter what you want to do,

326
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,790
he will support you unconditionally.

327
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,920
My dad is different.

328
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,880
He is a chemistry professor.

329
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,210
He's a male chauvinist.

330
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,550
He wants to decide what I learn, what I do,

331
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,720
and what I like.

332
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,350
I was miserable when I was little.

333
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,920
When I couldn't even recognize many Chinese characters,

334
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,090
my dad forced me to study chemistry

335
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
and do experiments.

336
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,550
He wanted me to become someone like him.

337
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,390
Do you know

338
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,680
what my nickname is?

339
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,350
Qingqing.

340
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,310
Qing as in Ai Qing (Ai Qing is how an emperor calls his courtiers)?

341
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,430
No.

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,590
Let me write it for you.

343
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,590
Give me your hand.

344
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,670
Watch carefully.

345
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,790
I've never seen this Chinese character before.

346
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,790
What does it mean?

347
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,110
What does it mean?

348
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,940
How should I explain it to you?

349
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,780
It's...

350
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,530
an element.

351
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,280
It's the first in the periodic table of elements.

352
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,200
This element...

353
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,350
is contained in water

354
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,470
and in the air we breathe.

355
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,450
Anyway,

356
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,610
this character doesn't represent any good wish,

357
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,340
and it is difficult to write it.

358
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,230
Later,

359
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,600
when I went to college,

360
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,400
my dad wanted me to major in Chemistry.

361
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,810
But I was rebellious.

362
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,099
I chose Physics directly.

363
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,170
I never thought

364
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,329
Physics is more difficult than Chemistry.

365
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,339
Is Physics the study of the principles of everything

366
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,819
you mentioned before?

367
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,880
You still remember?

368
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,359
When you mentioned it before,

369
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,560
I also yearned for it.

370
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,819
Of course I remember.
