Peacock in Wonderland

3
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,680
Episode 24

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,960
A handsome guy said he likes me.

5
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,370
No.

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
No, no.

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,320
Did I hear it wrong?

8
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,120
I definitely heard it wrong.

9
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,810
But...

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm so distressed.

11
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,079
Holy Envoy, have you found the wine?

12
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,600
Cool Guy, why are you here?

13
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,160
I was worried you couldn't find the way.

14
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,820
I've found the wine.

15
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Let's go downstairs.

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Holy Envoy.

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,540
I'm sorry that I offended you at the table just now.

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,340
My apologies.

19
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
But I want you to know

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,900
what I said just now

21
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,040
is sincere.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
You may not know this.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Since we first met in Moon Pavilion,

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I've felt we hit it off.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,260
As I get to know you better,

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
I'm more attracted to you.

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,329
You're knowledgeable,

28
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,260
smart, and cute.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,400
You also care about the world and the people.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,860
I know I don't deserve you.

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,920
But I still want a chance.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,100
If I can win your heart,

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
I promise

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
I will cherish you.

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,090
Cool Guy,

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,900
are you drunk?

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Do you know what you're talking about?

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,240
I know.

39
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,360
I'm begging you.

40
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,930
I'm begging for your love.

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm drunk. Holy Envoy, take me home.

42
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,130
Let go. You're hurting me.

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,220
What are you doing?

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
If you want to drink wine, go home.

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
We have plenty of wine at home.

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,079
Who are you to me?

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Why do you even care

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,970
where I drink?

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,630
I'm your...

50
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,210
What?

51
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,410
I'm your friend.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,120
I have the responsibility to give you advice.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,760
Friend?

54
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,440
Just friend, right?

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,440
Fine.

56
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,840
You are my friend.

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,080
Cool Guy is also my friend.

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,540
Why can't I drink with him?

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,640
Besides, he likes me.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
He's not like you.

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,019
You're so stubborn.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,060
Leave me alone.

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,260
Didn't you say

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,340
you don't like him?

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Why are you defending him

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,320
and siding with him?

67
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,480
I didn't like him. It doesn't mean I don't like him now.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,800
It doesn't mean I won't like him in the future either.

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Love grows over time, understand?

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,370
Friends can become lovers too.

71
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,720
Right.

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,450
He even confessed his love to me.

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,760
How do you know I won't say yes?

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Lord Li,

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,730
don't hinder me from finding my true love.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,020
Li Muyang, what are you doing?

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,640
You bastard!

78
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,640
You bastard.

79
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,810
Li's Mansion

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,920
My Lord.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,490
It's been two hours.

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
Why have you remained motionless?

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,570
What on earth happened?

84
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,520
My Lord,

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,320
where did you go just now?

86
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,000
I forcibly kissed...

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
You forcibly kissed?

88
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,340
If a woman forcibly kissed me...

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,000
Holy Envoy forcibly kissed you?

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,260
I didn't say it was her.

91
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,400
I didn't expect Holy Envoy to be so frivolous.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,670
How dare she do that to you!

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm going to her now.

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,320
Sit down.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
My Lord,

96
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,410
she must have coveted your beauty

97
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,400
and developed lustful desire.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,560
Then she took advantage of you while she was drunk.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,020
How could you tolerate it?

100
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,090
She didn't drink.

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,380
She didn't do it under the influence of alcohol either.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,450
Then she... likes you.

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
But no matter how much she likes you,

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
she can't force...

105
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,840
My Lord,

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,210
considering your martial arts skills,

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,320
I don't think you could possibly be forced.

108
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Alright.

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
You may leave.

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,720
My Lord,

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
could it be you...

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,000
Muyang.

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,640
I like it very much.

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,410
It's flying so high.

115
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,080
What is this?

116
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,730
This is a love bell.

117
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
I tied this love bell for you personally.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
It represents my love for you when it rings.

119
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,120
I've liked you for a long time.

120
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,770
I like you too.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Li Muyang

122
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,160
ran away after kissing me yesterday.

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Today, he asked me out.

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,100
Why did you ask me here?

125
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,050
It's a sunny day.

126
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920
I asked you here to fly a kite.

127
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,280
Since you're already here,

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,539
just fly it for a while.

129
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,240
Holy Envoy.

130
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,000
Lord Li.

131
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,330
It's you. I'm really sorry.

132
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,160
The weather is nice today.

133
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,820
I wanted to shoot a wild goose.

134
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,800
I didn't expect to shoot your kite.

135
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,280
We truly are destined to meet.

136
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,770
Mr. Qing Jian, you really are good at archery.

137
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,750
Autumn Dew we drank yesterday

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,660
tastes sweet

139
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,480
and has a strong delayed effect.

140
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,320
When I woke up this morning,

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,980
I forgot everything that happened yesterday.

142
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,610
Holy Envoy, I wonder if I talked nonsense

143
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,240
and made a fool of myself in front of you after drinking.

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,040
No, no.

145
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,090
You were drunk. It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

146
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,550
Nonsense after drinking?

147
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,640
I think you overstepped the mark after drinking.

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,040
I think someone else overstepped the mark.

149
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,960
Anyway, it's my fault.

150
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
I'll shoot a wild goose for you

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,110
as an apology. What do you think?

152
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,800
Really?

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Shooting a wild goose is much more interesting than flying a kite, right?

154
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Interesting.

155
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,620
If you are interested,

156
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,040
why don't you come with me?

157
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,760
Okay.

158
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,070
What are you doing?

159
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,880
Why don't we shoot a wild goose together?

160
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
Okay.

161
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,890
I'm not interested.

162
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,090
Let me go.

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,600
Let me go!

164
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Your Excellency.

165
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Can we... meet at Mount Yunyin tomorrow?

166
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,240
I have something to do tomorrow. I don't have time.

167
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,080
But I have something important to tell you.

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,340
Something important?

169
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,020
What's so mysterious?

170
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,000
Tell me now.

171
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
Hua Ni.

172
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,520
I...

173
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,120
Anyway...

174
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,160
I have something important to tell you.

175
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll see you at Mount Yunyin tomorrow.

176
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
See you there.

177
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
What's wrong with him again?

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,730
He didn't tell me anything.

179
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,440
The flower tree is like you, and the jade pendant is like me.

180
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,160
From now on,

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,140
let's go our separate ways and take care.

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
Why is there dew on your clothes?

183
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Where did you go just now?

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
I took a walk around.

185
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
It's late.

186
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
Go to bed early.

187
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,280
Yu.

188
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,160
We're a couple.

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,120
Yes.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
We're already a couple.

191
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,110
♫The moon is hazy when the wind passes the court♫

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,670
♫How can I dream about the past when it's gone?♫

193
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:26,490
♫When we parted, I understood♫

194
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:32,180
♫The deep love hidden in your eyes♫

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,440
Why does he have to talk about it in a place like this?

196
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,480
It's weird.

197
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,800
Li Muyang, where are you?

198
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,620
I'll leave if you still don't show up.

199
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,640
I play my zither

200
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,810
to show my feelings.

201
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,700
I hope I can be a good match for you,

202
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,090
so that we can be together hand in hand.

203
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,560
You... prepared this for me?

204
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,840
This song is called "A Phoenix Seeks His Mate".

205
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,800
I'll only play it for you.

206
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,450
What's going on?

207
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
Which one is played by Li Muyang?

208
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,160
Li Muyang,

209
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
you're fooling me again.

210
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,380
I would become a dog if I talk to you again.

211
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,070
Why does he know how to play the Song of Yarn?

212
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,180
The Song of Yarn was composed by my mother.

213
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,780
Why does he know how to play it?

214
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,040
Brother.

215
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,120
What's wrong?

216
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,720
Brother.

217
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,940
Hang in there.

218
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,520
We'll be home after crossing that mountain.

219
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,240
But I can't take another step.

220
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm so hungry.

221
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,000
You eat first.

222
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,320
My flower.

223
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,630
This...

224
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,880
Father,

225
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,360
please think hard again.

226
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,880
Are you sure

227
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,800
there was no other kid nearby when you found me?

228
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,020
When I found you,

229
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,710
you had wounds all over your body.

230
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,640
That place was surrounded by mountains and forests.

231
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,370
There was no one else as lucky as you.

232
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,420
What a pity.
