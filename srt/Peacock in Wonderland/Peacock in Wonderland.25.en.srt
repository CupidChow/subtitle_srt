Episode 25

4
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,050
Lai, are you making lanterns?

5
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,550
-Yes.
-What for? Is there a festival coming?

6
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,080
Qiang asked me to make them.

7
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,750
She said they are going to the lake tonight to enjoy the scenery.

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,070
If they put these lanterns on the lake,

9
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,770
it will be very beautiful.

10
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,789
Lord Li is really thoughtful.

11
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,729
Who is he going boating with on the lake?

12
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,720
Holy Envoy, you don't know?

13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,259
I saw that Uncle Li was very attentive.

14
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,230
I thought they invited you to go with them.

15
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,560
Muyang,

16
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,950
I put a lot of effort into today's plan.

17
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,020
You must win this girl over.

18
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,530
My Lord, everything is ready.

19
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,950
Wait.

20
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,510
This outfit is too plain.

21
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,040
Go change into another one.

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,540
Dress more playfully.

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,870
Playfully?

24
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,070
Don't worry, My Lord.

25
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,670
I have prepared your battle robe.

26
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,130
Go change into it, My Lord.

27
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,910
Holy Envoy.

28
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,150
Uncle Li.

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,680
One day ago

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,530
Come with me.

31
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,490
-Hurry.
-What’s wrong?

32
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,360
Come with me.

33
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,570
Uncle Li, slow down.

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,200
Uncle Li.

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,650
Holy Envoy.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,150
Please help me take a look.

37
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,910
Uncle Li, what does it mean?

38
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,060
Holy Envoy.

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,600
These are all eligible young women in Peacock City.

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,470
You are familiar with my Muyang.

41
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,040
Take a look and see which one suits him better.

42
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,590
Uncle Li,

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,000
you really don't understand your son.

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,190
He's just a blockhead.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,210
Don't let other girls waste their time on him.

46
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,500
Even a blockhead needs a match, right?

47
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,280
As his dad, I have to arrange his marriage.

48
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,570
If he's not meant for you,

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,430
he'll have to find someone else.

50
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,450
He can't stay single

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,220
for a lifetime like me, right?

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Personally,

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,510
I think this Miss Shen from the Shen family is not bad.

54
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,410
Shen Weilan, daughter of Chief Historian Shen

55
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,320
Not only does her background,

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,300
but also her appearance matches well with Muyang.

57
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,880
The more I look, the more I like her.

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,380
He used to ask me to do various things before.

59
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,660
But now, starting from today,

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,390
he's already making lanterns for another woman?

61
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,630
What a scumbag.

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,020
I must expose his true colors.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,740
Holy Envoy, you are rarely this assertive.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,780
You are truly domineering.

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,820
That's what I wanted.

66
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,750
We can't lose in terms of momentum.

67
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,380
Li Muyang, you brat!

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,960
You've never dressed up when you see me.

69
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,790
And today, you're so meticulously dressed up.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
And you're wearing pink.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,420
Am I pretty?

72
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,260
Yes.

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,380
Trust me. You really are beautiful.

74
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,940
Li Muyang.

75
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,909
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,570
I'm here for a date, of course.

77
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,760
Your Excellency, I thought you already knew.

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,350
Why are you so irresponsible?

79
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,280
The other day, weren't you just...

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,970
You scumbag!

81
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,990
Who is your date?

82
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,900
It wouldn't be Miss Shen from the Shen family, would it?

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,700
I must tell her

84
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,230
what kind of person you are.

85
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,600
My date is standing right in front of me.

86
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,140
Lord Li?

87
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,150
Shall we...

88
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,910
You bribed Lai and Qiang,

89
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,480
and are playing these tricks.

90
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,970
Do you have something to say to me?

91
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,580
What is it?

92
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,940
Stop pretending you don't understand.

93
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,710
Recently, you've been playing the piano for me,

94
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,260
taking me mountain climbing,

95
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,190
and now you're waiting for me here.

96
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,440
What do you mean?

97
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,880
Do you really not know what I mean?

98
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,780
How would I know if you don't tell me?

Whatever.

106
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,580
I'll go first.

107
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540

you were really going on a date with someone else.

145
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,570
I'm ready to fight.

146
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,300
Actually, this method was thought up by my father,

147
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,220
not me.

148
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,860
Uncle Li?

149
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,870
Indeed, age does bring wisdom.

150
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,030
I'll arrive at the next corner.

151
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,460
Go back first.

152
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,240
You're a boy.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,940
It's too dangerous for you to go home alone at night.

154
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,030
Let me take you back.

155
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,560
Have you forgotten who I am?

156
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,390
Who in this city is my match?

157
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,780
I don't want to be separated from you.

158
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,669
Stand properly. There are people on the street.

159
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,390
Alright.

160
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,490
I'm going back.

161
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,500
Remember to think of me.

162
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,730
Yanxia Shop

163
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,870
You are indeed amazing.

164
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,390
Every piece is haute couture.

165
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,190
Do you like them?

166
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,100
Of course.

167
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,540
Qian.

168
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,760
Could you make two outfits for me?

169
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,460
Sure.

170
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,490
His height,

171
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,980
I estimate it to be around 1.85 meters.

172
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,820
Converted to the unit here, it's...

173
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,590
Ni.

174
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,100
I have Muyang's measurements.

175
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,360
I didn't say it was him.

176
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,720
If it's not Muyang,

177
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,070
then could it be Mr. Qing Jian from the Moon Pavilion?

178
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,070
If so, Muyang will come with a sword.

179
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,820
I can't hide anything from you.

180
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,020
Alright, I'll tell you.

181
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,880
It's Li Muyang.

182
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,510
Is it that obvious?

183
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,790
When you like someone,

184
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,450
you can't hide it in your eyes.

185
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,480
He treats you differently.

186
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,000
And you treat him the same.

187
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,630
Qian, let me tell you a secret.

188
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,150
Actually,

189
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,870
we are in a relationship.

190
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,780
I grew up with Muyang since we were kids.

191
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,300
I've never seen him treat any girl differently.

192
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,580
When he started changing step by step for you,

193
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,260
I knew

194
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,340
you would eventually enter his heart.

195
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,910
Really?

196
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,480
As his brother

197
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,710
and his friend,

198
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,220
you're my friend now too.

199
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,620
You can't deceive me.

200
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,950
Actually, I've always been thinking,

201
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,240
he's handsome,

202
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,190
he has a good job,

203
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,490
and there are so many people like him.

204
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,360
Has he really never had feelings for anyone else?

205
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,420
I don't know if he has had feelings for anyone else.

206
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,230
But I know

207
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,570
he has never treated any other girl

208
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,770
the way he treats you.

209
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,860
Really?

210
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
That's good then.

211
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,480
The person I like

212
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,760
must be faithful to me.

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,220
There absolutely cannot be any other women around him.

214
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,230
Other women?

215
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,510
Qiang is also one of "other women".

216
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,580
They even spend time together day and night.

217
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,540
Qiang? I don't think so.

218
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,380
No employee would fall in love

219
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,910
with their boss who is always torturing them.

220
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,430
That makes sense.

221
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,930
But lovers eventually getting together

222
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,670
is a great joy in life.

223
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,110
Ni?

224
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,310
Thank you.

225
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,180
This place is forested with mountains

226
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,060
and has complex terrain,

227
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,790
making it suitable for hiding.

228
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,980
To find the flower field

229
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,260
will take time.

230
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,620
We need to be patient.

231
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,710
Also,

232
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,590
Master Rong has been investigating closely lately.

233
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,790
We must find the clues

234
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,740
before she does.

235
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,270
Yes.

236
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,950
Boyfriend, where have you been?

237
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,430
I've been looking for you.

238
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,140
I...

239
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,240
I just bought some freshly baked bean cakes.

240
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,500
I don't know if you like them or not.

241
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,430
Of course I do.

242
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,460
Really?

243
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,140
My Lord, you don't like sweets.

244
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,130
It's so cold, Let me make some tea for you.

245
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,200
Qiang, what have you been up to lately?

246
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,530
-I've been...
-Your hair has grown long.

247
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,260
Did you buy new accessories?

248
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,240
Goodness!

249
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,620
Did you get scalded?

250
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,500
Does it hurt?

251
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,580
Yangyang, look.

252
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,430
Your hand is turning red.

253
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,840
Do you have any ointment? Let me apply it for you.

254
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,780
What are you doing?

255
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,580
A magic trick?

256
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm giving you a love bell.

257
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,780
Every time you take a step, it chimes,

258
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,150
symbolizing that every step you take, you think of me.

259
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,600
Lord Li, I didn't expect you

260
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,260
to be quite good with sweet words.

261
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,790
That's sweet words for you?

262
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,000
So you are a bit easy to please.

263
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,280
What do you mean?

264
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,260
Did you pleased other girls?

265
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,260
No.

266
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,860
Only you.

267
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,780
Really?

268
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,710
Really.

269
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,620
Really?

270
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,350
Really.

271
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,990
Really?

272
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,630
Really.

273
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,960
I knew it.

274
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,770
Does your hand still hurt?

275
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,830
Yes.

276
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,670
It won't hurt if I hug you.

277
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,330
Guanbuzhu

278
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,950
He's the esteemed chief of the Flowers Kill.

279
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,270
When did he become so clumsy that he couldn't even hold a cup of tea?

280
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:26,910
Wait.

281
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,320
He clearly poured it onto his hand on purpose.

282
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,370
But why did Lord Li do that?

283
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,320
To make the Holy Envoy feel bad for him, of course.

284
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,680
Lord Li is really cunning.

285
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,210
Where have you been?

286
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,610
You're all dirty.

287
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,270
I've been crawling into holes on the mountain all day, how could I not be dirty?

288
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,130
It's okay, just a few pats will do.

289
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,480
Look, your sleeve is torn.

290
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,020
Here, let me you sew it up for you.

291
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,910
No need, really.

292
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,510
It's okay.

293
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,230
Done.

294
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you.

295
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,040
No problem.

296
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,240
These are fruits I picked on the mountain.

297
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,760
Have a taste.

298
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,470
Thank you.

299
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,090
The Holy Envoy and Lord Li are so happy together.

300
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,460
They are the envy of everyone.

301
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,660
What's there to envy?

302
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,330
You'll have someone sooner or later.

303
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,410
Yanxia Shop

304
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,960
They are couple's outfits.

305
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,150
They were specially customized by Moqian for us.

306
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,380
Shall we wear them together?

307
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,710
But won't it be a bit too conspicuous?

308
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,510
Conspicuous?

309
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,920
Do you want to hide me away?

310
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,250
No, I don't.

311
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,020
Muyang is always saying one thing but meaning another.

312
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,950
He's calling it conspicuous now,

313
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,300
but who knows how ostentatious he'll be in the future.

314
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,310
I see.

315
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,040
I've never been like this.

316
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,840
Before, who said

317
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,110
he would never like the Holy Envoy

318
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,370
and wanted to kill her?

319
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,800
Back then, I thought she was from the Peacock Sect.

320
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,810
I thought she was associated with them.

321
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,870
Do you think I should have killed her?

322
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,300
But then,

323
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,750
I found out that you are not only intelligent

324
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,900
and kind-hearted,

325
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,910
but also considerate of the people in every aspect,

326
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,140
completely different from those people in the Peacock Sect.

327
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,470
Then who said

328
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,690
the Holy Envoy was not qualified to join our Flowers Kill?

329
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
Tell me if what I said is right or not.

330
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,980
You are not only intelligent

331
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,830
but also particularly good at leading us.

332
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,490
It's our fortune to have you in the Flowers Kill.

333
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,230
Alright, Muyang.

334
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,340
Stop arguing with me.

335
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,510
Among all these things,

336
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,340
in which one have you acted in accordance with your words?

337
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,400
-Du Moqian!
-Qian!

338
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,890
Li Muyang,

339
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,630
were you the one who said all these things?

340
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,620
I harbored resentment against you before,

341
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,610
so I spoke without restraint.

342
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,500
Put on this outfit tomorrow,

343
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,700
and I'll forgive you.

344
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,340
Guanbuzhu

345
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,230
Father.

346
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,460
Father.

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,660
Where is this delivery going?

348
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,020
I'm going to the Moon Pavilion to deliver flowers.

349
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,080
The Moon Pavilion?

350
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,460
Let me take it.

351
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,870
Muyang,

352
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,620
now that you've been promoted,

353
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,270
how can you do such things?

354
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,870
No matter how high my position is,

355
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,930
I'm still your son.

356
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,730
Let me do it.

357
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,300
You truly are my good son.

358
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,020
Take a rest.

359
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,420
Be careful.

360
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,510
Muyang!

361
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,940
Muyang! Muyang! Muyang!

362
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,190
You're here.

363
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,250
What are you doing?

364
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm going to deliver flowers to the Moon Pavilion.

365
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,849
Alright. I'll go with you.

366
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,740
Wait for me at home.

367
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,540
I'll be back soon.

368
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,260
Why?

369
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,140
Are you still minding the relationship between me and Cool Guy?

370
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,750
We really are just friends. Really.

371
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,500
I know.

372
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,940
Then why are you still minding?

373
