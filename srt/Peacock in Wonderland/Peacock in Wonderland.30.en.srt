00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,150
Holy Envoy,

6
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,930
if we leave like this,

7
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,030
will Peacock Sect come after us?

8
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,030
I've submitted my resignation letter.

9
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,630
Why would they come after us?

10
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,750
Besides,

11
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,420
my boyfriend is the leader of Flowers Kill.

12
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,259
Ruan Jiushu can't defeat him.

13
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:47,950
You are right.

14
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,770
Li Muyang

15
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,539
should marry Hua Ni, the Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect, on an auspicious day.

16
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,670
The announcement will be issued

17
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,470
so that everyone will know this.

18
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,759
I, Li Muyang, accept the edict.

19
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,390
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

20
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,590
I'm going back first.

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,480
Thank you.

22
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,710
Bye.

23
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,950
You heard it?

24
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,280
Don't you think it's too early?

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,220
It's not.

26
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,500
You and Muyang are with each other every day.

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,300
Everyone in the city knows that.

28
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,110
You must make your relationship with Muyang official.

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,510
Father.

30
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,100
Got it.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,980
We don't have much time left before the wedding.

32
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,880
Lai, Qiang,

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,990
leave everything you are doing behind

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,510
and prepare for the wedding with me.

35
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,310
-Okay.
-Okay.

36
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,620
My Lord,

37
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,710
why are you still worried?

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,110
I still think something is wrong

39
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,920
with Moqian's case.

40
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,230
Du Moqian has said everything he should.

41
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,510
He did everything.

42
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,750
Is there still a problem?

43
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,150
That day in the ancient temple,

44
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,390
why did your men know how to perform the Feitian leap?

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,900
What is your relationship with Moon Pavilion?

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,570
Why were there only White Sakura and Cangshuo in the flower field?

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,260
How come there wasn't Yuekui?

48
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,950
Yuekui?

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,250
What Yuekui?

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,560
White Sakura and Cangshuo can make people fall asleep.

51
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,680
But if Yuekui is used with them,

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,180
they can kill people.

53
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,070
I believe you wouldn't do this.

54
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,790
Back then, I put White Sakura

55
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,060
and Cangshuo in the late master's room

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,990
to put her into a deep sleep.

57
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,790
I never put...

58
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,630
Yuekui!

59
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,040
I did everything I could.

60
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,860
It turns out that I'm just someone else's pawn.

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,960
You know what I want to ask.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920

64
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,320

65
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,620

67
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,590

69
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,820
Moon Pavilion?

70
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,170
Let me do it.

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,870
Lord Li, you delivered flowers to Moon Pavilion personally.

72
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,790
I didn't expect us to have such an honor.

73
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,860
Actually, Mr. Qing Jian, you helped increase

74
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,670
Guanbuzhu's sales by buying our flowers.

75
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,900
I should thank you.

Sir,

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,460
Du Moqian has been sent to the cold palace.

79
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,340
Master Rong bestowed a marriage upon Li Muyang and Holy Envoy.

80
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,620
Boss thinks it's time

81
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,050
and asked us to take action immediately.

82
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,940
Well...

83
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,260
My Lord,

84
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,350
what should we do with Du Moqian?

85
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,750
He's useless now.

86
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,780
He's worthless to us.

87
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,750
Let him be.

Who is behind you?

91
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,610
Muyang,

92
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,000
you already have the answer

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,140
to this question, right?

94
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,900
He's around you.

95
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,420
The Song of Yarn you played in the bamboo forest that day

96
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,420
is indeed worthy of its reputation.

97
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,000
Mr. Qing Jian, I want to ask

98
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,780
where you learned it.

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,670
I accidentally heard it

100
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,560
from a musician of Moon Pavilion.

101
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,330
I thought it's beautiful.

102
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,260
So I learned it.

103
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,470
It was fate.

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,640
Why am I here all of a sudden?

105
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,930
Is this another prophetic dream?

106
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,320

Chief Ruan Jiushu broke the rules on purpose.

125

She framed Holy Envoy many times.

126
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,380
She's unforgivable.

127
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,220

No.

133
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,650
Qingqing would never do that.

134
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,020
It looks like she's being controlled by someone.

135
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,660

138
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,370
It was a dream about the future.

139

That was the ending of me and Qingqing.

141

will only be a problem if she stays with you.

185
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,480
Why don't you give her to me?

186

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,260
You're so stubborn.

192
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,860
Wait for me.

193
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,590
Let's go!

194
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,330
Muyang, wait!

195
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,110
Why is this happening?

196
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,840
We are getting married.

197
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,610
Why did Cool Guy come here?

198
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,450
He sent men to kidnap you.

199
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,320
Why would he ask his men to ambush here

200
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,050
to kidnap me?

201
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,010
Didn't I tell you I had dreams?

202
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,060
Those are not dreams.

203
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,190
They will come true.

204
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,170
This is ridiculous.

205
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,300
I don't believe you.

206
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,480
15301010200.

207
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,480
I...

208
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,720
Let's go.

209
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,910
This is my phone number.

210
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,060
You majored in Applied Physics in South University.

211
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,710
Your research direction is superconductivity.

212
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,100
Your mentor is Mr. Chen.

213
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,870
He's your father's best friend.

214
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,980
You even know this?

215
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,030
Do you believe me now?

216
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,990
My Lord, let's go.

217
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,780
Go!

218
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,310
Let's get out of here first.

219
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,190
Qingqing.

220
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,830
What happened today is not what I want.

221
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,640
It happened suddenly.

222
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,340
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

223
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,470
In my dream,

224
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,280
Qing Jian kidnapped you from the wedding.

225
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
He used you to control Peacock Sect.

226
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,080
Then he forced Rong Yu to step down through Peacock Sect

227
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,330
and destroyed Peacock City.

228
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm worried if I don't interfere,

229
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,900
he will still succeed.

230
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,910
A wedding ended up like this.

231
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,380
No girl can stand it.

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,630
Qingqing.

233
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,050
These are what happened in my dreams.

234
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,150
Trust me.

235
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
I won't let you down in this life.

236
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,510
But our wedding

237
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,080
is indeed an important turning point.

238
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,130
I'm worried Qing Jian will use you again

239
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,530
to control Peacock Sect.

240
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't dare to take the risk.

241
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,430
I hope

242
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,400
you can quit being the Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect immediately.

243
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,420
From now on,

244
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,660
let's live in the countryside

245
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,720
and not care about the outside world anymore.

246
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,250
We can also make Peacock City peaceful again.

247
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,220
You want to resign from the position of the Holy Envoy?

248
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,859
Yes.

249
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,530
The wedding of you and Muyang was ruined.

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,599
I promise

251
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,060
I will send men to catch those villains.

252
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,720
It has nothing to do with this.

253
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,890
Then why do you want to resign?

254
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,859
Actually...

255
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,220
Actually, I've been thinking about it

256
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,150
for a long time.

257
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,600
I told Chief about it long ago.

258
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,430
The responsibility of the Holy Envoy is heavy.

259
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,390
I'm not that competent.

260
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,270
So,

261
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,200
Master, I hope you can approve it.

262
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,940
I...

263
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,350
can't approve it.
