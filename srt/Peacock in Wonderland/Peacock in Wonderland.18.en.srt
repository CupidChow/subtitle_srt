[Episode 18]

4
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,810
When you mentioned it before,

5
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,009
I also yearned for it.

6
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,470
Of course I remember.

7
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,910
Actually, in the past,

8
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,310
I didn't really like Physics or Chemistry.

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,870
I couldn't learn all of them.

10
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,030
I couldn't understand them either,

11
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,009
not to mention putting forward

12
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,350
new theories.

13
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,110
I had to learn

14
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,410
to deal with my dad.

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,270
In the end, I made myself

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,479
a straight A student.

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
In the past,

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,390
I didn't understand

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,200
why my dad is so passionate about chemistry.

20
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,070
He has even dedicated his life to chemistry.

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,600
I didn't understand until I came to Peacock City-State.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,610
If

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,750
I hadn't learned those knowledge,

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,490
I would have died

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,840
thousands of times.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,660
But most importantly now,

27
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,470
I can use these knowledge

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,060
to help many people

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,850
and save many lives.

30
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,570
I think I'm awesome.

31
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,070
So,

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
I want to thank my dad.

33
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,210
I didn't understand before.

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,410
But now I understand.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,410
You are

36
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,870
weird

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,260
and act strangely.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,420
You're not like ordinary people.

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,490
I always feel

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,440
you have the truth I'm looking for.

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,010
Are you lying to me again?

42
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,410
Look.

43
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,050
There's a shooting star.

44
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,450
When I was little, my mother told me

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,420
♫Flowers fall with the gentle kiss of the wind♫

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,880
after the person you really miss dies,

47
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,700
his soul will become a star in the sky.

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,270
♫Lost in reincarnation repeatedly♫

49
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,570
If you love someone very much,

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,410
♫Waiting for someone to turn around in Peacock City♫

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
remember his eyes.

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,730
In this way,

53
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,780
♫The past is like falling snow♫

54
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,660
no matter how many times you are reincarnated,

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,700
you can find him.

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,050
♫Who turned the wheel of time♫

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,700
In this way, you will never

58
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,000
be separated.

59
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,840
♫To find the person in the dream?♫

60
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,230
Never be separated?

♫If I can be with you in this life♫

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,690
Let me tell you a secret too.

♫I'll be willing to be trapped by love♫

64
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,910
Actually,

65
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,660
the land under our feet

66
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,810
is also a star.

67
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,540
♫A few teardrops♫

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,270
But

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,760
this star is very small

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,300
♫I still remember your eyes♫

71
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,090
to the universe.

72
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,050
Just like the sand in the desert.

♫If I can let the past go♫

74
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,890
So we

75
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,510
are stepping on a star.

76
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,710
♫Without love or hatred♫

77
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:04,330
♫We'll be fearless of separation♫

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,010
A star?

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,560
There really is water.

80
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,409
This well has to meet the needs of the whole town.

81
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm afraid an ordinary well can't do that.

82
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,720
These are the design drawings of a stream well.

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,780
Please have a look.

84
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,290
The drawings are so accurate.

85
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,640
You drew them yourself?

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,230
I did some research in the past.

87
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Lord Li, this is a good idea.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,920
But young and strong people

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
have moved out of Lisha Town.

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,090
The rest are old and weak.

91
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,050
The tools in the town are old.

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
Even if they are still usable,

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,660
it will take months to dig this well.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lord Li has always been thoughtful.

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,430
Why couldn't you think of such a trivial matter?

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,540
Under the circumstance,

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,820
why don't you join them

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,170
and dig the well yourself?

99
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,930
Lord Liu,

100
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,730
once the well is built,

101
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,770
it can provide water for Lisha Town

102
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,300
over the next decades.

103
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,730
So even if it will take months or years,

104
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,840
we have to build it.

105
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,090
This...

106
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,290
It won't take months.

107
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,130
Cool Guy, why are you here?

108
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,710
I came for you.

109
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,420
Me?

110
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,370
Come in.

111
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,650
Holy Envoy once said

112
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,140
what we do should benefit the people.

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,420
Peacock City has helped Moon Pavilion.

114
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,320
Of course we should do something for Peacock City.

115
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,780
So when I heard that Lisha Town is in trouble,

116
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,980
I assembled some men

117
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,040
and got some tools.

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,400
We came all the way here

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
because we want to make contributions too.

120
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,110
Now,

121
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,220
we have both manpower and tools.

122
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,470
We can dig the well more quickly, right?

123
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,580
Let's get to work then.

124
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,140
Look.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,060
It's better to go this way.

126
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
We can do it.

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,080
There?

128
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,100
From there to the town.

129
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,420
Do you think it will work?

130
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,530
I think it should...

131
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,730
The sun is scorching.

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
Holy Envoy, you should avoid prolonged exposure.

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,380
Cool Guy, you're so considerate.

134
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,710
It's cold and dry here.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,850
Holy Envoy, I guess you haven't eaten fresh fruits

136
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,210
for a long time.

137
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,210
These were delivered in an ice jar

138
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,990
at top speed from the south.

139
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,390
Have a taste, Holy Envoy.

140
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,210
That place should be okay.

141
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,730
Holy Envoy, you are busy.

142
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,590
Let me feed you.

143
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
It's okay. I can...

144
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,070
Thank you, Cool Guy.

145
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,960
You are so nice.

146
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,620
Is it sweet?

147
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,090
Yes.

148
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,900
Lord Li.

149
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,700
-Should we open the well here?
-It's good.

150
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,840
We need Holy Envoy to confirm this.

151
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,630
What's wrong?

152
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,590
We need to use the butterfly awl

153
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,060
to remove the sandy soil here first.

154
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,200
After there is moisture, we'll install the well's support frame.

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,350
After we wet the well's support frame,

156
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,470
we can do the rest.

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,690
But the initial digging and drilling work for the well project is enormous.

158
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,220
We have to start right away.

159
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,310
Didn't we check the process before?

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,210
I just want to confirm it again.

161
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,620
Since there's no problem,

162
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,520
let's get started.

163
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay.

164
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,820
Let's go.

165
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,170
Holy Envoy, you just spoke a lot.

166
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,970
You must be thirsty.

167
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,900
Eat one more to quench your thirst.

168
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,130
Lord Li, you want to eat one too?

169
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,180
Mr. Qing Jian, are you going to feed me too?

170
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,410
It's okay.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,930
No need for that.

172
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,560
Mr. Qing Jian, if there's nothing else,

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,460
why don't you go back to the inn and rest early?

174
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,760
The sun is scorching here,

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,090
and this place is dusty.

176
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,120
Don't ruin your face.

177
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,350
I'm a born handsome guy. I'm not afraid of the sun's rays.

178
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,530
Besides, I'll have nothing to do after going back.

179
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,790
It's better to stay here with Holy Envoy.

180
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,620
If it weren't for you this time,

181
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,100
the well digging project wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

182
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,550
After this, I'll ask Liu Zhi to establish a monument for you

183
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,590
and praise you.

184
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,830
I've always done things according to my own will.

185
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,560
I don't care what others think.

186
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,850
So cool.

187
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,230
The pear blossoms here were so beautiful.

188
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,550
They were as white as snow in spring.

189
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,010
The petals scattered around,

190
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
releasing a delightful fragrance.

191
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,090
It's a pity

192
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,600
that I can't see them again.

193
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,770
Have you seen them before?

194
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,720
No.

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,160
I had a tree the same as this in my yard.

196
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,490
Okay.

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,060
I have to get up early tomorrow to oversee the project.

198
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,070
I'm going back first.

199
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,800
Rest early.

200
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,590
Lord Li,

201
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,090
why don't you just show up and speak frankly?

202
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,570
Mr. Qing Jian,

203
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm just curious

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
about your reason

205
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,340
of coming here.

206
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,550
Didn't I explain it before?

207
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,960
What?

208
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
You don't believe me?

209
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,870
Moon Pavilion has always been self-seeking

210
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,920
and obsequious.

211
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,040
Now, you've suddenly become kind.

212
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,850
If you were me, would you believe it?

213
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,840
Lord Li, you really know me well.

214
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,970
That's right.

215
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,950
I'm here for someone.

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
Holy Envoy?

217
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,330
Who do you think?

218
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,180
You're not going to say

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,480
you came here for me, right?

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,450
Since you know

221
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,330
she is Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect,

222
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,170
you should know

223
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,120
you don't

224
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,780
deserve her.

225
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,000
If I don't deserve her,

226
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,230
do you deserve her?

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,980
[Lisha Town]

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,080
As long as the project...

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,800
My Lords.

230
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Bad news!

231
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,560
We've reached the bottom.

232
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
Calm down. What's wrong?

233
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,920
The butterfly awl has dug down 26.64 meters underground.

234
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
If we keep digging,

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,690
we'll reach the bottom.

236
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,890
It's too dangerous to dig deeper.

237
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
It's just 26.64 meters.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,790
It's impossible to reach the bottom.

239
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,590
There must be a rock stuck there.

240
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,570
If there is a giant rock in the well,

241
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,370
it indeed will be too dangerous

242
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,490
to dig forcibly.

243
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,220
We can blow it up with gunpowder.

244
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,970
But how can we determine the amount of gunpowder?

245
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,870
If it's too little,

246
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,400
we can't blow up the giant rock.

247
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,330
If it's too much,

248
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,130
it will cause a landslide.

249
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,180
This indeed is a problem.

250
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,270
We have to study the amount of gunpowder.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,730
Is it another prophetic dream?

252
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,500
Why did Qing Jian appear in the dream?

253
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,280
Who is it?

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,760
It's me.

255
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Come in.

256
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,640
Why are you still up?

257
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,230
I'm studying the proportion of gunpowder.

258
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,400
There's no rush.

259
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,090
You can do it tomorrow.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
No.

261
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,610
If there is still no water coming out from the well,

262
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,020
everyone will continue to suffer.

263
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,560
Besides,

264
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,300
even Cool Guy came all the way here to help us.

265
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,950
We can't let him down.

266
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,750
It seems

267
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,120
you care a lot about what Qing Jian thinks.

268
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
Of course.

269
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,020
He's my friend.

270
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,680
Friend?

271
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,570
Just friend?

272
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,480
I think Qing Jian treats you differently.

273
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,720
You really don't

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,860
want to be more intimate with him?

275
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,970
More intimate?

276
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,940
Qing Jian and I are just friends.

277
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,500
There is nothing more. Don't think too much.

278
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
I need to get back to work.

279
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,470
If you have nothing to do, go back to sleep.

280
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,400
Don't ask weird questions here.

281
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,140
It's okay.

282
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,040
I'll stay here with you.

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,630
[Lisha Town]

284
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,590
I brought these from Peacock City.

285
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,200
You're our god, Cool Guy.

286
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,630
Mr. Qing Jian is so thoughtful

287
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,480
to Holy Envoy.

288
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,040
Because I have many friends.

289
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,090
Are you jealous?

290
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,940
Unfortunately,

291
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,460
you can't understand this kind of feeling.

292
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,250
Right,

293
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,550
Cool Guy.

294
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,320
This is the gunpowder I've tested these days.

295
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,760
Can you help me make some gunpowder

296
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,420
according to the proportion?

297
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,210
Thank you.

298
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,320
Since it's your order,

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,250
I'll get it done.

300
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,180
Thank you very much.

301
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,960
Th...

302
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,360
Mr. Qing Jian, after you make the gunpowder,

303
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,460
why don't you go back to the city first?

304
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,140
Don't worry about me, Lord Li.

305
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,200
I want to witness the success of getting water

306
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
and go back with Holy Envoy.

307
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,800
Holy Envoy, are you alright?

308
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,050
Thank you, Cool Guy.

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,810
Considering our relationship,

310
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,270
you don't need to thank me.

311
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,760
We finally did it.

312
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,950
There is water!

313
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,020
We did it!

314
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,010
-We did it!
-There's water!

315
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,599
We did it!

316
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,200
-We did it!
-Great. We did it!

317
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,890
Great!

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,260
We're indeed awesome.

319
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,050
Thank you, Lord Li.
