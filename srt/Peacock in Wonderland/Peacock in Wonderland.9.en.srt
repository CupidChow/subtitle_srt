00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,680
You're a member of Flowers Kill?

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,340
Now that you know my identity,

7
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,830
give me a reason not to kill you.

8
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,080
That's impossible.

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,289
There must be a misunderstanding.

10
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,479
How about

11
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,070

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,110
Let's have a talk.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,310
Let go of me!

14
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,280
What is this?

15
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
This is the mark of Flowers Kill.

16
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
As long as you have this mark,

17

you're a member of Flowers Kill.

From now on,

21
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,970
you have to come to me to get the antidote to the poison per month.

22
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,370
If you tell what happened today to any other person,

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,290
I won't give you the antidote and you'll be killed by the poison.

What I saw last night

28
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,430
was exactly what I had seen in those dreams.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,990
Why do things that happened in those strange dreams keep happening in real life?

30
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,650
Were those dreams the fabled prophetic dreams?

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,670
My Lord.

32
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,910
Holy Envoy now knows your identity.

33
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,990
What should we do

34
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,430
if she tells it to others?

35
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,230
How about we just kill her in case she

36
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,030
causes us trouble in the future?

37
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
She is the Holy Envoy.

38
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,210
If you kill her, what should you do

39
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,070
if others investigate her death?

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,260
Don't say anything stupid next time.

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,950
Didn't you also want to kill her the other day?

42
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,950
At that time, she was also the Holy Envoy.

43
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,240
I didn't expect that she would

44
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
know my identity in that way.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
What should we do now?

46
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,070
Was I being too rude to her last night?

47
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,810
Li Muyang is such a jerk.

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,380
Why would he leave a mark on me?

What are you doing here?

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,640
Don't worry, Holy Envoy.

51
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,120
I won't hurt you.

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
You won't hurt me?

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,410
You poisoned me with the mark!

The knife is sharp.

Be careful not to get yourself hurt, Holy Envoy.

I did it

61

because it was an emergency and I had no other choice.

62
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,190
Please rest assured, Holy Envoy.

63
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,920
I have no intention to hurt you.

64
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,430

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,430
because you overworked and worried too much.

190
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll prescribe you some medicine that'll relieve your anxiety.

191
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,870
You just need to take it every day.

192
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,650
But Doctor Wang

193
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,230
also prescribed some medicine to relieve my anxiety the other day.

194
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,090
It didn't work.

195
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,550
Well.

196
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,510
Actually, you are experiencing lovesickness.

197
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,390
When young people reach a certain age,

198
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,360
they will have such dreams.

199
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,690
It's perfectly normal.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll prescribe some medicine to reduce the heat inside you.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,100
Only a few prescription will be enough to benefit you.

202
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,690
My Lord.

203
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,010
Don't be too anxious

204
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,790
about the romantic relationship.

205
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,320
Let nature take its course.

206
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,110
Don't force something to happen.

207
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,800
Qiang.

208
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,520
Walk the doctor to the door.

209
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,270
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,370
Lovesickness?

211
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,240
Holy Envoy, you have been doing everything yourself lately.

212
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,320
You're really responsible.

213
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm happy about that.

214
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,390
You also need to work harder

215
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,670
to fulfill your duty as the Holy Envoy.

216
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,870
Yes, you're right.

217
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,990
Chief, don’t worry.

218
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,190
I will work hard.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,070
Chief.

220
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,240
Do you know

221
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,310
a mysterious organization called Flowers Kill?

222
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,230
Why do you want to know something about Flowers Kill?

223
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,400
I heard that...

224
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,320
I heard that

225
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,480
Flowers Kill was Peacock Sect's enemy

226
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,290
so I want to know some information about them.

227
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,800
Then if I meet someone from Flowers Kill in the future,

228
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
I can protect myself from being harmed by them.

229
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,950
Those from Flowers Kill are all cunning.

230
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,360
They are everywhere in the city.

231
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
They have been against us for years.

232
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,230
Ordinary people cannot even imagine

233
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,680
how horrendous what their tricks are.

234
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,390
Peacock Sect failed to destroy them?

235
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,150
Those from Flowers Kill

236
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,880
are like rats in the gutter.

237
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,420
There are too many of them.

238
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,920
They hide in every corner of Peacock City-State.

239
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,950
We are not able to kill them all for now.

240
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,820
By the way,

241
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,080
at the inauguration that day,

242
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,750
Flowers Kill came to cause trouble.

243
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,120
So I thought you and they knew each other.

244
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,510
They know me?

245
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,330
No, no, no.

246
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,020
I have nothing to do with them.

247
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,030
Chief, trust me.

248
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,290
I’m the Holy Envoy appointed by Peacock Sect.

249
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,320
How could I have anything to do with Flowers Kill?

250
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
Don’t be nervous.

251
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,620
I believe you

252
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,920
have nothing to do with Flowers Kill.

253
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,950
Otherwise...

254
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,540
I...

255
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,410
I really...

256
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,500
I really have nothing to do with them.

257
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,520
My Lord.

258
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,350
Mr. Worldly God is really good.

259
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,950
He's very famous in the city.

260
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,490
I'm sure he can explain why you had those dreams.

261
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,160
You've been following me for so many years.

262
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,560
You know I don't believe in gods and ghosts.

263
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,230
Since doctors couldn't help you explain your dreams,

264
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,640
let's try other ways.

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,790
It's here.

266
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,750
My Lord.

267
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,960
Please.

268
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,920
You often dreamed of that girl.

269
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,440
It means you two are bonded by love.

270
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,010
Have a seat.

271
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,880
Do you know the date of her birth shown in the eight characters of the horoscope?

272
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,760
Geng Zi, Wu Zi.

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
Yi Chou, Ji Mao.

274
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,950
My Lord.

275
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,630
When did you get to know

276
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,310
Holy Envoy's birth date shown in the eight characters of the horoscope?

277
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,990
I saw them in the engagement document

278
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,520
at the wedding in my dreams.

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,650
I don't know if they're true or not.

280
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,450
The girl in your dream will be the one you're destined to be with.

281
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,770
You two are destined to be together.

282
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,160
You don't have to do anything about it.

283
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
Just leave it to fate.

284
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,030
And good things will happen to you.

285
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,350
The girl you saw in the dream

286
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,750
is your love in the previous life

287
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,950
and also the girl you'll want to be with.

288
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,420
Since you met the girl for the first time,

289
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,230
the destined love between you two have existed.

290
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,390
The destined love?

291
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,110
Instead of listening to other's interpretations,

292
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,520
you'd better

293
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,230
find out about your destined love yourself.

294
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,070
You're very gifted.

295
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,560
If you can hold a Taoist belief,

296
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,670
you'll be able to discover the secrets of gods.

297
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,630
What a coincidence.

298
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,450
I have

299
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,960
some books about this.

300
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,520
[Psychiatric Brainwashing Techniques 2]

301
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,960
They only cost ten taels of silver.

302
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,520
Sir.

303
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
Think about it.

304
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,680
This...

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,360
So

306
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,720
you're just here to sell books.

307
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm just selling books.

308
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,200
Think about it.

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,970
Here you are.

310
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,730
Have a seat.

311
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,830
What you want is on the desk.

312
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,320
They're the records

313
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,780
[Crimes Committed by Flowers Kill 1, 2, 3]

314
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,550
of the crimes committed by Flowers Kill for the years.

315
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,770
Read them carefully, Holy Envoy.

316
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,480
In September,

317
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,080
there was an epidemic in the six towns in the south.

318
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,830
Peacock Sect brought Holy Water to save the people.

319
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,800
After investigation,

320
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,330
it was found that the water contained poison.

321
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,110
Flowers Kill poisoned the holy water.

322
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,750
To be honest,

323
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,430
even if the holy water wasn't poisoned,

324
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,840
it couldn't cure people with the disease.

325
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,770
Even drinking disinfectant won't cure the disease.

326
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,670
In Mount Yunyin, Peacock Sect

327
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,070
found a peacock which was enlightened by the gods.

328
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,680
It could speak and act like a human.

329
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,010
This news was shocking.

330
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,390
But three days later,

331
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,290
the peacock fell into the hands of Flowers Kill.

332
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,010
They claimed that

333
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,110
the Peacock Sect used ventriloquism to make people believe that the peacock was speaking.

334
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,670
The peacock was not a parrot.

335
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,130
How could a peacock speak?

336
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,430
On the night of the Ghost Festival,

337
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,470
there was will-o'-the-wisp cased by ghosts in the graveyard in the suburbs.

338
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,440
Peacock Sect went there to catch the ghosts.

339
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,710
But Flowers Kill came to stop Peacock Sect

340
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,270
and the will-o'-the-wisp was put out

341
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,340
and the ghosts escaped

342
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,540
and hurt ten disciples of Peacock Sect.

343
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,650
The phosphorus in corpses will burn

344
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,030
and then cause the will-o'-the-wisp.

345
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,310
There were no ghosts.

346
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,790
Peacock Sect made a fool of themselves all the time.

347
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,550
In a word,

348
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,079
Flowers Kill committed so many crimes

349
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,319
that Peacock City-State couldn't be peaceful.

350
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,680
If I can catch those villains,

351
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,400
I will kill them.
