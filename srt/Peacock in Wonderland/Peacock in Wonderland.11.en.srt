[Episode 11]

4
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,700
That snake

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,380
is so long.

6
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,729
By the way, Lord Li.

7
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,930
How many people are there in our organization?

8
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,660
How much is the monthly salary?

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,550
If I rejoin your organization,

10
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,950
what will be my position?

11
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,620
My Lord.

12
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,860
It's so late.

13
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,150
Why are you still up?

14
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm not sleepy.

15
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,020
Are you worried because of Holy Envoy?

16
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,580
My Lord, don't worry.

17
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,970
I'll keep an eye on her.

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,530
I won't let her tell our secrets to others.

Li Muyang.

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,370
Li Muyang.

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,210
Li Muyang.

26
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,470
Welcome to Flowers Kill.

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,420
It's said that Flowers Kill has many members.

28
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,670
And they're everywhere.

29
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,770
To my surprise, Flowers Kill only has four members.

30
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,100
And I know all of the members.

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,670
People who can join Flowers Kill are able people.

32
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,600
But none of our members are losers.

33
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,130
Now you have one.

34
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,970
Me.

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm the loser who you tricked into joining your organization.

36
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,910
I knew

37
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,970
Holy Envoy would join Flowers Kill sooner or later.

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,200
Life is hard.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,579
I'm now a member of Flowers Kill.

40
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,920
Remove the Flower Poison from my body.

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,780
Flower Poison?

42
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,190
Since when did we have the Flower Poison?

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,140
Li Muyang.

44
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,870
You lied to me.

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,470
Looks like Muyang used lots of methods

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,170
to get the Holy Envoy to join Flowers Kill.

47
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,630
You forced me

48
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,670
to join Flowers Kill.

49
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,040
And now

50
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,100
I know all the members of your organization.

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,800
If I quit Flowers Kill now,

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,329
you'll definitely kill me.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Holy Envoy.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,070
From now on,

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
you are a member of Flowers Kill.

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,900
Remember.

57
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,130
This is our base.

58
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,920
I asked Qiang to destroy all our other bases.

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,410
Someone tried to assassinate Yu that night.

60
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,070
And she followed the assassin

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,820
and found that base of ours.

62
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,430
The assassin that day was leading Yu to our base.

63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,110
There're some mysterious people in the city

64
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,279
who are plotting something.

65
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,019
They did things in the name of Flowers Kill.

66
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,459
And they know us well.

67
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,779
From now on,

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
we have to be very careful

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,060
when we take any action.

70
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,570
Who is it?

71
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,520
Please come in.

72
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,210
Young Master invites you to meet her

73
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,030
at the Peacock Pavilion at 7 p.m.

74
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,460
Young Master.

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,500
Hello, Muyang.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,840
Why did you

77
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,630
ask me to see you here tonight?

78
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,150
I told you before

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,460
that after you figured out your connections with Holy Envoy and Red-tailed Bug,

80
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,920
I would tell you something important to you.

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,300
This

82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,460
is for you.

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,370
Why are you giving it to me?

84
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,409
You are so smart.

85
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,140
How could you not know my feelings for you?

86
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,830
Muyang.

87
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,150
I have had a crush on you

88
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,280
for many years.

89
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,909
I should have given this jade pendant to you long ago.

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,400
But I've been too busy lately.

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,900
So I didn't give it to you.

92
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,820
No matter what,

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,470
I don't want to wait any longer.

94
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,650
Young Master.

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,470
This is too precious.

96
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,510
Sorry I can't accept it.

97
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,320
If you don't accept it,

98
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,420
no one else in this world deserves it.

99
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,460
Yu.

100
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,750
You're my good friend.

101
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,230
You're the young master of Peacock City-State I'll be loyal to for my entire life.

102
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,270
But I don't

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,240
have a crush on you.

104
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,409
You don't have a crush on me?

105
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,090
No.

106
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,460
You have no

107
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,530
feelings for me at all?

108
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,040
Qian'er, what's wrong?

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,350
I'm fine. I pricked my finger with the needle.

110
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,320
I wonder what Li Muyang and Rong Yu

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
are doing now.

112
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,600
Is it because of Moqian?

113
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,620
-Is it because Moqian and I-
-No.

114
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,220
It has nothing to do with him.

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,460
Young Master.

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,670
It's so late now.

117
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,900
Go to bed early.

118
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,040
If you don't accept it now,

119
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,700
it's fine.

120
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,940
I can wait.

121
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,460
But this jade pedant

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,130
will only belong to you.

123
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,670
Young Master, please respect yourself.

124
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,990
Flowers Kill!

125
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,860
I've been looking for you for a long time.

126
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,460
I can't believe you're here!

127

Yu.

128
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,610
Are you okay?!

129
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm fine.

130
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,210
My Lord.

131
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,710
Are you alright?

132
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,940
Qiang.

133
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,470
Don't chase him.

134
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,850
My Lord, are you alright?

135
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,420
I'm fine.

136
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,150
Moqian, are you okay?

137
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,780
Moqian, you're bleeding.

138
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,540
Does it hurt?

139
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,520
Moqian.

140
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,220

Ni'er.

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,860
I brought you something good.

145
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,020
Candied fruit?

146
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,040
Try it. It's delicious.

147
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,690
Thank you.

148
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,790
But I don't like sweets.

149

151
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm sorry about last night.

152
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,630
It happened suddenly.

153
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,950
I didn't mean to ignore you.

154
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,290
Don't be mad at me.

155
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
Okay.

156
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,290
Have a good rest.

157
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,010
I'll come visit you some other day.

158
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,210
How is it?

159
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,010
Flowers Kill is so evil.

160
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,380
They attacked me last night

161
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,510
because I destroyed their bases

162
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,940
and they wanted to revenge.

163
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,170
There are only a few members in Flowers Kill.

164
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,050
One of them got injured.

165
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,670
Maybe they weren't from Flowers Kill.

166
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,550
You can't assume they were

167
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,310
just because you saw the petal shower.

168
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,430
That's not a convincing evidence.

169
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,730
But since I came back from my study trip,

170
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,780
only those from Flowers Kill have been targeting me.

171
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,210
If they weren't from Flowers Kill,

172
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,010
who were they?

173
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,870
Yu.

174
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,980
How beautiful these paper flowers are!

175
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,170
In Peacock City-State, paper peach blossoms

176
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,830
symbolize safety and health.

177
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,720
Yu often got sick in her childhood.

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,520
So I often made paper peach blossoms for her,

179
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,990
hoping she could recover soon.

180
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,430
Qian'er.

181
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,280
Do you still blame her?

182
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,900
I'll never blame her.

183
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,190
I just feel sad

184
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,700
and that's not important.

185
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,000
When I recover from my injury,

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll be fine.

187
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,340
Young Master.

188
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,560
They smell so good.

189
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,320
By the way,

190
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,950
thank you for taking care of Moqian these days.

191
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,460
When he gets better,

192
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,990
Muyang and I will visit him.

193
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,570
Lord Li, what are you thinking?

194
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,060
Well.

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,490
The assassin panicked that night

196
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,820
and jumped onto the wall

197
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,630
with a Feitian leap.

198
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,790
Feitian leap?

199
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,420
What is Feitian leap?

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,180
The Feitian leap is a type of light-body skills.

201
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,380
By practicing a Feitian leap, one can use the wind

202
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,640
to help them jump straight to a very high place.

203
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,710
That's amazing.

204
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,290
Jump straight to a very high place.

205
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,350
The Feitian leap is not hard to learn.

206
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,010
But people who know how to practice this skill

207
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,360
should all be in Moon Pavilion.

208
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
The skill is not hard to learn

209
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
so there are many people who know how to practice it.

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,460
You can't just assume that the assassin is from Moon Pavilion

211
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,730
because many people there know how to practice the Feitian leap.

212
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,670
The skill is not difficult to learn,

213
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,380
but one must adopt a very special way to breathe from a very young age

214
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
if they want to learn this skill.

215
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,650
So not everyone

216
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,080
has the persistence to breathe in that special way.

217
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,250
Some young gentlemen in Moon Pavilion

218
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,970
have been learning lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting since childhood.

219
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,220
They would also learn some martial arts to protect themselves.

220
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,170
Many of them

221
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,100
can still practice those kinds of skills now.

222
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,060
Besides,

223
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,370
that night I knocked the knife out of the assassin's hand.

224
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,110
In a hurry,

225
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,390
he used a stationary knife as his weapon.

226
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,490
This stationary knife is made of bamboo and wood.

227
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,890
It's only used to cut paper.

228
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,810
What kind of assassin would take a stationary knife with them?

229
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,260
The use of the stationary and the Feitian leap

230
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,050
shows that the assassin was from Moon Pavilion.

231
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,050
That makes sense.

232
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,270
So,

233
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,430
Moon Pavilion is Flowers Kill's base.

234
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,370
What kind of place is Moon Pavilion?

235
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,370
-Moon Pavilion is...
-Moon Pavilion is

236
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,880
the most elegant tea house in the city.

237
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,540
Many young talents often gather there

238
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,140
and have parties where they appreciate poems.

239
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,250
So it's like a poetry conference.

240
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,100
Besides, there's a rule in Moon Pavilion.

241
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,260
Anyone who go to Moon Pavilion must wear a mask

242
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,520
to hide their identity

243
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,530
so that they can really have a good time.

244
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,330
Okay, enough.

245
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,250
Anyway,

246
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,180
we'll go to Moon Pavilion and try to find some information first.

247
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,090
I agree.

248
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,920
[Moon Pavilion]

249
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,670
Wait for me, Yu.

250
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,610
Nice to meet you. Welcome.

251
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm Zhao Ying, manager of Moon Pavilion.

252
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,500
What can I do for you?

253
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,770
Just tell me.

254
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,820
Get us a nice suite.

255
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,510
We have the mini suite,

256
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,460
the small suite, the medium suite,

257
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,370
and the luxe suite.

258
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,930
Different services will be given in different suites.

259
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,930
The prices for them are also different.

260
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,790
What suite would you like to have?

261
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,250
You two are well-dressed

262
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,610
and give generous tips.

263
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,540
I think you may want the best suite.

264
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,340
Of course.

265
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,460
How much is the best suite here?

266
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,340
Fifty taels of silver for a day.

267
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,250
So expensive?

268
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,290
Okay.

269
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
I may lack anything else.

270
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,950
But I'll never lack money.

271
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,020
Save your biggest suite for me.

272
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,220
I want the biggest one

273
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,730
which can accommodate the most people.

274
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,490
I'll get you the suite.

275
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,450
You'll be satisfied.

276
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:54,920
And

277
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,530
ask all the talented men here

278
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,530
to come to my suite.

279
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,930
Whether he is good at lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy or painting,

280
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,260
as long as he can please us,

281
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,520
I'll give him a reward.

282
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,850
Talented men?

283
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,089
What kind of talented men

284
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,210
would you like?

285
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,099
I like those who look distant and handsome.

286
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,359
I like those who are...

287
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,089
It doesn't matter how they look.

288
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,140
Whether he is tall, short, fat or thin,

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,790
as long as he's talented, he can come.

290
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,920
Please come in.

291
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,599
Please.

292
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,490
Hurry up.
