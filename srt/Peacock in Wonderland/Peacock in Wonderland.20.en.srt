00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,900
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,600
Don't you remember

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,200
what happened last night?

6
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,280
What on earth happened last night?

7
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,200
Let go of me!

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,479
Who is so vicious

9
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,140
and wants to make me lose my virginity?

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
After I saved you,

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,710
according to Qiang's investigation,

12
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,300
He Huan was the first one arriving there with his men.

13
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,100
Thus,

14
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,530
he should be the one who did it.

15
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,790
It really was He Huan.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,720
He's still as stupid and evil as always.

17
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,990
Lai, let's go.

18
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,780
Let's show him

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,590
what real righteousness is.

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,620
Holy Envoy, there is no need to go.

21
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,640
Chief summoned me back urgently, so I already left.

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,280
He Huan.

23
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,280
It's too coincidental.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,110
He left when we're just about to go to him.

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,750
I guess he's anxious to escape

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,880
since the plan didn't work last night.

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,480
Unless he can escape from this planet overnight.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,270
Otherwise,

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,350
I will hunt him down.

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
When I return to the city,

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll report to Master Rong and Ruan Jiushu immediately.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Ruan Jiushu?

33
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,500
He Huan is a sinner.

34
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,680
He came with us for disaster relief

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
because Ruan Jiushu helped him.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,730
If without her permission,

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
He Huan wouldn't have had the guts to do that.

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,280
But...

39
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,500
why would Ruan Jiushu do this to me?

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,080
Just because I won't listen to her?

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,030
You obstructed the sacrifice several times

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,150
and implemented new policies.

43
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,480
You have gained the people's strong support

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
and threatened her position in Peacock Sect.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
She holds a grudge against you.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,950
It's not surprising that she wants to use He Huan

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,350
to ruin your reputation.

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,720
She's so evil.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
We should go back now.

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,110
I want to confront her face to face.

51
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,390
Let's go now.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,670
Let's go now.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,340
What are you doing?

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,860
I bit you last night.

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,079
I want to see if your wound still hurts.

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,460
Don't worry, Your Excellency.

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm fine now.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
That's good.

59
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,579
Li Muyang,

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,079
can I ask you a question?

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,560
Why are you so nice to me?

62
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,720
You saved me again and again.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,750
You always showed up

64
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,320
when I was in danger.

65
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,660
You also...

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,630
Didn't I say

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,510
I would protect you?

68
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,720
Besides, the situation was critical.

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
I would do that even if it wasn't you.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,350
Really?

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,899
You would do that no matter who it was?

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,160
Qiang.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Is he shy or stubborn?

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,300
Holy Envoy, what's wrong?

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,930
Nothing.

76
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,850
Ignore him.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,500
Come on. Let's do what I taught you last time.

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,520
My Lord.

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,190
Why are you avoiding Holy Envoy?

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,250
Do you remember the dreams I told you about?

81
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,120
The dreams that would come true in reality?

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,780
I remember.

83
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,960
Actually, I saw

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,270
what happened a few days ago in my dream too.

85
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,270
That's why I had to be very cautious.

86
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,270
I even sent Qing Jian away.

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,080
But now it seems what happened in my dream can't be changed.

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
Even if it was not Qing Jian,

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,760
someone else would do it.

90
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,040
In that case,

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,860
you should protect Holy Envoy

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,640
instead of avoiding her.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,990
I'm not avoiding her on purpose.

94
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,680
I just...

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
I just don't know how to face her.

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,180
You didn't eat much today.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,500
Thank you, Holy Envoy.

98
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm not hungry.

99
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,590
You must be thirsty.

100
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,150
No.

101
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,330
Then you...

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,310
You should get in the carriage and rest early.

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,570
We're about to set out.

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,110
You are a coward who doesn't have the courage to face your own feelings.

105
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,820
Qiang.

106
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,770
You go sit in the carriage. I'll drive.

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,830
Aren't you going to accompany Holy Envoy?

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,030
Just get in the carriage. Stop talking.

109
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,360
Qiang, why are you here?

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,110
Maybe Lord Li wants to show off his driving skills.

111
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,830
Fine.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,310
Since he likes driving so much,

113
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,040
let him drive all the way back to the city.

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't come inside.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,060
Young Master, why are you so anxious?

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,440
I...

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm not.

118
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,070
Lord Li and Holy Envoy are on their way back from disaster relief.

119
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,400
This is very important.

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,380
Master Rong has always been diligent.

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,980
She should have come out early to welcome them.

122
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,800
Greetings, Young Master.

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,820
Greetings, Young Master.

124
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,220
Don't stand on ceremony.

125
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,360
You made contributions by addressing the drought.

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,600
Also, you just had a long journey.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
You must be tired.

128
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,360
It was all for the people.

129
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,290
We're not tired.

130
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,420
Holy Envoy helped the people

131
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
address the drought.

132
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,800
It's a great merit.

133
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,040
You really deserve the title of the Holy Envoy of Peacock Sect.

134
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,830
Why did you leave early without telling me?

135
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,440
I...

136
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,840
Right,

137
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,990
where is Master Rong?

138
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,470
I have something important to report to her.

139
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,310
Logically,

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,340
Mother should be in the court now.

141
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,140
Maybe she's delayed by something.

142
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
But for so many years,

143
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,240
she has never delayed the morning court.

144
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm going to find her.

145
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,470
Mother.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,600
Mother.

147
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,270
Holy Envoy is back from disaster relief. She wants to see you.

148
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,080
Mother?

149
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,710
Mother.

150
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,920
Mother.

151
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,840
Mother.

152
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,110
Mother.

153
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,850
Don't scare me.

154
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,160
Mother.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,710
Mother!

156
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,190
Mother.

157
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,710
Mother!

158
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,520
Mother!

159
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,520
Mother!

160
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,500
Guards!

161
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,070
Guards!

162
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,780
Mother!

163
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,910
Mother!

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,560
Mother!

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,920
Mother!

166
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,030
Mother.

167
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,840
Boss, what kind of flower is this?

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
This is peony.

169
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,830
It is bright-colored

170
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,030
and has big flowers.

171
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,950
When the flowers bloom next year,

172
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,880
they will be stunning absolutely.

173
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,740
Master Rong... passed away?

174
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,330
God is unfair.

175
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,550
Since Master Rong ascended the throne,

176
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,840
she had been diligent, thrifty, and people-oriented.

177
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,610
She had employed virtuous people and initiated reforms.

178
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,570
She was such a wise leader

179
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,260
but was killed.

180
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,750
Young Master,

181
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,480
I know you're heartbroken.

182
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,770
Master Rong suddenly passed away.

183
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,830
The people are also in panic.

184
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,630
Peacock City-State is in urgent need of a new leader.

185
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,310
Please pull yourself together

186
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,540
and ascend the throne as soon as possible.

187
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,870
Although I'm not competent,

188
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm willing to share your burdens.

189
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
Got it.

190
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,620
Thank you, Lord Chen.

191
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,870
I will pull myself together.

192
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,920
I'll take my leave.

193
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,020
Yu.

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Take a rest.

195
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,680
I'll keep watch.

196
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,420
I can't sleep

197
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,750
before I find out why my mother died.

198
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,650
If Master Rong is still alive,

199
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,180
she wouldn't want to see you ruin your health like this.

200
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,080
Mother was so kind.

201
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,240
She worked hard every day

202
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,700
and had never slacked off.

203
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,870
I respect her the most

204
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,810
in this world.

205
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,550
But...

206
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,760
Why is fate so unfair?

207
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,510
Flowers Kill.

208
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,650
It must be Flowers Kill.

209
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,810
I swear

210
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,670
if I can't find Flowers Kill

211
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,570
and avenge my mother,

212
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,520
I will never feel at ease for the rest of my life.

213
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,050
Flowers Kill is cunning, so it's not easy to find them.

214
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,710
The last time they left a trace

215
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,450
was during the sacrifice.

216
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,360
Sacrifice?

217
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,930
The climate is dry. Be careful with fire safety.

218
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,070
The climate is dry. Be careful with fire safety.

219
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,350
Be careful.

220
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,610
Don't destroy the scene.

221
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,230
Sorry.

222
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,480
I've never done anything like this before.

223
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
I told you it's dangerous here.

224
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
I told you not to come with me.

225
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,630
What are you talking about?

226
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,290
This is very important. Of course I should come.

227
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,990
Also,

228
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,800
I'm a member of Flowers Kill.

229
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,230
You can't just let me take the blame together

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,560
and hide things from me.

231
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,290
My Lord, the guards at the door have been taken care of.

232
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,250
It'll take at least four hours

233
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,410
for them to wake up.

234
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,740
Sorry.

235
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,530
Let me do it.

236
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,210
Be careful.

237
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,330
Don't leave any trace,

238
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,630
so that we can avoid being taken advantage of by those with ulterior motives.

239
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,830
Don't worry, My Lord.

240
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,470
Master Rong was fine before we left.

241
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,890
Why did she die suddenly?

242
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,750
Who killed her?

243
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,470
The relationships around Master Rong were complicated.

244
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,870
She held a high position.

245
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,180
It's not something we can speculate.

246
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,020
But the murderer is very cunning.

247
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,680
Every detail shows Flowers Kill is behind this.

248
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,400
He did this

249
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
to make us the scapegoat.

250
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,510
Really?

251
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,190
In order to deal with Flowers Kill,

252
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,390
he even had the guts to kill Master Rong.

253
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,500
There is no external injury on Master Rong's body.

254
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,180
But look.

255
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,750
When I pricked the tip of her tongue with a silver needle,

256
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,060
the blood is black.

257
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,040
Master Rong died because she was poisoned.

258
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,330
Poisoned?

259
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,130
That's not right.

260
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,390
Young Master Rong has investigated it.

261
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,280
She said everything Master Rong ate, wore, and used

262
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,340
was not poisonous.

263
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,240
Where did the poison come from?

264
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,370
Do you remember the flowers on the bed?

265
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,070
Now it seems

266
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,580
it was really weird.

267
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,200
I thought about it many times.

268
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,490
I just couldn't figure out how she was poisoned.

269
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,550
She was the master.

270
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,100
All her daily necessities

271
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,180
had to be recorded by specific people.

272
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,010
I even checked

273
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,500
all the records kept six months ago,

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,360
but I didn't find anything wrong.

275
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,630
So the poison

276
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,420
could only be put through the flowers.

277
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,770
Based on what I remember,

278
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,160
I drew all the flowers

279
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,380
on Master Rong's bed.

280
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,340
Then I really found something.

281
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,380
The trick lies in three kinds of flowers:

282
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,180
White Sakura,

283
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,220
Cangsuo,

284
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,540
and Yuekui.

285
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,580
They are not poisonous when they are put separately.

286
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,540
But if we put these three kinds of flowers together

287
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,140
in a sealed space for a night,

288
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,820
their mixed fragrance can be fatal.

289
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,060
Indeed,

290
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,620
the more beautiful it is, the more dangerous it is.

291
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,140
Qiang,

292
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,210
these three kinds of flowers are not very common.

293
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,770
Go to the flower shops in the city

294
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,720
to find out who bought them recently.

295
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,400
Also,

296
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,690
it's very likely that the murderer purchased them in batches.

297
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,220
So even if someone only bought one,

298
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,130
you can't let him go.

299
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,650
Got it.
