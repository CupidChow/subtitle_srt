Episode 27

4
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,150
Slow down.

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,670
Be careful.

6
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,830
Have a rest.

7
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,110
This way. Search here.

8
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:44,560
Yes.

9
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,120
-How is it? Does your wound still hurt?
-Anyone there?

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,880
This way.

11
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,400
Yes.

12
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,229
There's no one here, either.

13
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,560
Keep searching. Hurry.

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,430
-Yes!
-There's no one here, either.

15
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,240
Search over there.

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

17
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,000
Search! Hurry!

18
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,120
Muyang!

19
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,430
Muyang!

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,530
Muyang, wake up!

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,669
Muyang!

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,160
What should I do?

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,550
You're awake.

24
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,760
Are you okay?

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,760
Does it hurt?

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,790
You're fine.

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,910
That's great.

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,000
Why are you saying this now?

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,180
What shall we do about your wound?

30
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,210
What are you doing?

31
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,630
I don't have the strength.

32
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,630
Pull the arrow out for me.

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,790
I…

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,960
Pull the arrow out?

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,670
But...

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,670
I trust you.

37
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,110
But I don't know how.

38
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,310
What if it gets worse?

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
Give me your hand.

40
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,350
I'll count to three.

41
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,670
We'll pull together.

42
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,790
It may hurt a lot.

43
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,950
Hang in there.

44
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,710
One.

45
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,040
Two.

46
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,829
Three.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,590
Muyang!

48
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,329
You're bleeding a lot.

49
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,110
Stop the bleeding!

50
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,360
♫Flowers fall with the gentle kiss of the wind♫

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,210

♫I'll be willing to be trapped by love♫

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,470
Don't be afraid, Muyang.

59
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm here.

Muyang.

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,270
You're awake.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm awake.

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,270
What's wrong, Qingqing?

70
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,520
It's so cold.

♫Waiting for someone to turn around in Peacock City♫

76

My Lord!

77
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,680
Qiang.

78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,190
Where are you, My Lord!?

79
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,040
Qiang!

80
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,950
♫The past is like falling snow♫

81

Qiang!

83
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,110
Here.

84
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,180
Uncle Li.

85
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,650
How is it?

86
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,970
Aren't my eyes good at discovering able people?

87
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,420
The first time I saw you,

88
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,770
I've recognized you as my future daughter-in-law.

89
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't be shy, Holy Envoy.

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,020
My son Muyang met a good woman.

91
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,160
As his father,

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm relieved.

93
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,280
Holy Envoy.

94
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,980
Do you know Muyang is not my own child?

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,950
Muyang told me about this.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,380
Back then, I went to the mountain to pick flowers

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,060
and met him in the forest.

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,670
He passed out from hunger.

99
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,640
He was in a coma,

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,520
but he was still breathing.

101
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,420
I felt sorry for him,

102
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,790
so I brought him home to accompany me.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,150
At first,

104
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,830
Muyang was a loner.

105
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,960
And he was extremely vigilant.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,580
He was only willing to call me Uncle.

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,159
He suffered a lot when he was young.

108
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,490
And he wanted revenge.

109
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,690
It was too hard for him.

110
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,750
He was lonely inside.

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,500
He had not been as happy as he seemed,

112
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,510
until he met you.

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,480
Me?

114
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,390
Only in front of you

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,780
can he be relaxed.

116
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,710
But now,

117
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,780
Muyang is wanted by Master Rong.

118
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,350
I don't know when he will be rehabilitated.

119
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,420
Since I'm his father,

120
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,790
I can never leave him now.

121
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,090
But if you want to leave

122
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,310
after much consideration,

123
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,370
I won't force you.

124
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,870
Uncle Li.

125
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,290
I won't leave.

126
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,990
Wherever he goes,

127
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,600
I'll always be with him.

128
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,770
I'll always be by his side.

129
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,510
Yu.

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,510
Have some soup.

131
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,760
No.

132
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,610
I have no appetite.

133
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,330
Are you thinking about

134
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,850
Muyang?

135
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,770
I'm just thinking,

136
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,460
I've known him for years.

137
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,000
And I trust him in everything.

138
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,790
When I was investigating the Flowers Killing,

139
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,920
or when I was confessing my love to him,

140
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,630
how was he thinking of me?

141
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,870
Moqian.

142
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,000
I feel like a fool.

143
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,270
Don't say that.

144
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,350
Yu.

145
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,680
I've also known Muyang for many years.

146
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,080
I thought we were close,

147
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,030
but I never knew he was the leader of the Flowers Kill, either.

148
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,360
Let bygones be bygones.

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
From now on,

150
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,990
there are only the two of us.

151
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,920
We should cherish each other more.

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,490
I will always be by your side

153
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,060
and never betray you.

154
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:56,910
Really?

155
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,790
Yes.

156
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,850
My Lord, it's time to apply the medicine.

157
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,650
Leave it here. I can do it myself.

158
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,550
We are wanted everywhere.

159
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,190
Should we just do nothing

160
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,230
and await our doom here?

161
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,120
The Holy Envoy and I are both injured.

162
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,710
We have no choice but to wait here until we recover.

163
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,080
But you mustn't slack off during this period.

164
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,120
I need you to find out

165
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,670
the murderer behind the flower field case as soon as possible.

166
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,470
Master Rong has been bewitched.

167
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,440
She firmly believes we're the ones who killed the former master.

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,840
If we can't find any clues behind the flower field case,

169
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,670
we will never be able to clear our name.

170
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,280
Yes.

171
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,200
Qiang.

172
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,040
Let me do it.

173
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,150
Okay.

174
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,460
Qingqing.

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
You just recovered from a cold. You should rest.

176
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,430
Why did you come out?

177
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,790
I'm almost recovered.

178
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,550
Look.

179
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,550
I didn't lie to you, right?

180
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Let me do it.

181
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,330
I don't want you to tear your wound apart.

182
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,190
It must be because we didn't treat it in time last time.

183
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,830
Now it's inflamed and infected.

184
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,830
What should we do?

185
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,310
It's just that the arrow was poisoned.

186
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,750
The poison is not hard to detoxify.

187
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,510
We just need to get some Heshu powder from the city.

188
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,910
Then, it will get better soon.

189
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,670
When the security in the city is loosened a bit,

190
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,710
I can go back and get it myself.

191
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,950
How long will it take?

192
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,350
I'll go get it now.

193
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,870
Holy Envoy.

194
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,070
You can't go, either.

195
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,230
Most people in the city have seen your face.

196
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,230
If they recognize you,

197
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,750
the consequences will be unimaginable.

198
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,630
You're right.

199
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,990
How about I go?

200
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,690
I'm familiar with the pharmacies in the city.

201
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,640
You?

202
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,710
Do you know martial arts?

203
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,310
What if you run into bad guys?

204
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,610
All right then.

205
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,870
You two go together.

206
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,630
You can take care of each other on the way.

207
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,320
Remember,

208
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,560
if anything unexpected happens,

209
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,150
come back first.

210
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,680
We'll decide after a discusion.

211
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,740
Don't act in haste.

212
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,470
Go.

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,750
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

214
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,390
Let's go.

215
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,390
It's us.

216
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,860
Have you seen this person?

217
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,920
Have you seen this person?

218
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,560
No.

219
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,090
What about you? Have you seen him?

220
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
What should we do?

221
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,790
Have you seen this person?

222
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,320
Let's go.

223
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
No.

224
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,250
Have you seen this person?

225
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,050
Over there.

226
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,860
Let's go.

227
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,240
Wanted

228
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,280
Check over there. Let's go.

229
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,830
Yes.

230
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,600
Let's go.

231
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,310
Let's go.

232
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,600
Holy Envoy.

233
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,230
Lord Li.

234
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,990
We are back.

235
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,650
We're back.

236
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
The city is heavily guarded now.

237
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,230
Luckily, Qiang and I disguised ourselves

238
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,670
to avoid the investigation

239
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,400
and brought the medicine back.

240
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,970
Let's go boil the medicine.

241
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,370
We'll be back soon.

242
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,110
How is the situation in the city now?

243
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
It's still guarded.

244
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,390
There are wanted posts everywhere.

245
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,830
Luckily, the Holy Envoy didn't go.

246
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,490
It's still rather dangerous.

247
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,190
Lord Li, although you're injured,

248
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,600
your power hasn't weakened at all.

249
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,520
What are you doing here?

250
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,280
Lord Li and the Holy Envoy hid it so well

251
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,510
that I have been kept in the dark.

252
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,190
I didn't know you two were "Flowers Kill."

253
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,570
Please forgive me.

254
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,910
I heard that Flowers Kill was righteous

255
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,830
and repeatedly exposed the evil deeds of the Peacock Sect.

256
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,870
I've always been admiring you

257
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,200
and wanting to meet you.

258
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,990
Now that the Flowers Killer is in trouble,

259
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,670
I didn't know where you were

260
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,950
until I met them on the street today.

261
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,550
I followed them here.

262
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm sorry

263
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,950
for intruding.

264
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Since we're not related,

265
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,560
why are you doing this?

266
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,170
Lord Li, you are injured.

267
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,830
It's inconvenient for you to move around.

268
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,560
It's better to have one more helper than an enemy.

269
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,120
I have no other intentions.

270
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
Just accept my kindness.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,110
You scared me.

272
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,560
I thought you were here to report us.

273
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,350
You're worrying too much.

274
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,770
Why would I betray you?

275
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,510
But Holy Envoy,

276
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,390
why didn't you tell me when you were in trouble?

277
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,910
I'm really sad.

278
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,740
My son Muyang is lucky

279
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,950
to have a good friend like you,

280
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,360
Mr. Qing Jian.

281
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,570
How about this?

282
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,510
I've prepared some tea leaves.

283
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,000
If you don't mind,

284
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,200
let's have some tea first.

285
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,760
Muyang needs to rest.

286
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,640
Thank you, Uncle.

287
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,170
Here.

288
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,370
Uncle, please.

289
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,980
Please.

290
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,550
My Lord.

291
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,070
I didn't know he was following us.

292
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,240
He's highly skilled.

293
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,370
It's not your fault.

294
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,580
Follow him.

295
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,050
-Protect my father.
-Yes.

296
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,070
Muyang.

297
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,640
I don't think Cool Guy is a bad guy.

298
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,190
He won't hurt us, will he?

299
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,990
One who offers unsolicited hospitality

300
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,910
must be harboring evil intentions.

301
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,230
You overthink.

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,790
I hope so.

303
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,830
Lord Li is so lucky.

304
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,280
The Holy Envoy is boiling the medicine for him in person.

305
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,680
He got hurt because of me.

306
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,170
What I'm doing are just trivial matters.

307
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,220
Holy Envoy, you hid with Lord Li

308
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,280
and even became a fugitive.

309
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,510
Do you regret it?

310
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,860
No.

311
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,280
How could I regret it?

312
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,520
Holy Envoy, you're indeed different from others.

313
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,870
All that women in this world want

314
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,870
is just wealth

315
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,790
or a smooth life.

316
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,310
Only you act the opposite way.

317
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,340
You abandon everything you had,

318
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,070
ignore danger and anxiety,

319
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,740
and even bet everything

320
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,510
on an uncertain future.

321
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,810
No one knows

322
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,230
what will happen in the future.

323
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,640
I just followed my heart

324
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,680
and pursued what I really liked.

325
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,920
Have you really thought clearly about it?

326
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,040
Maybe

327
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,390
you have another way.

328
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,070
Cool Guy,

329
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,930
from beginning to end,

330
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,910
I've considered you

331
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,570
to be a very important friend.

332
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,510
Really.

333
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,790
I understand.

334
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,030
In the future,

335
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,710
you will meet someone who's a thousand times better

336
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,670
than me

337
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,920
and who only has you in her eyes.

338
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,540
Do you trust me?
