[Frost Pavilion]

5
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,450
Zhixue,

6
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
you know what?

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,360
I haven't slept well

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,850
for days.

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,259
I made tranquilizing soup for you.

10
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,120
It should be delivered here soon.

11
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,250
Drinking it won't help.

12
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,120
Take it away.

13
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,890
Why are you here?

14
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,770
Get out.

15
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
I said get out!

16
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
There seems to be something unusual in the city.

17
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
You must stay alert all the time.

18
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,250
Yes, Senior.

19
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,200
Right.

20
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,440
Go to the alchemy room

21
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,640
to see how it is going.

22
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,050
I made pills before

23
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,800
to find out Li Muyang's identity.

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
But why should we make pills now?

25
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,320
Fool.

26
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Giving a pill last time was a trick.

27
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,000
This time, we'll really give it to Master Rong.

28
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,740
Rong Yu is not like her mother.

29
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,650
She is impatient and impulsive.

30
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,540
So we have to make her pleased.

31
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,740
So we're going to... flatter her?

32
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,240
Peacock City-State and Peacock Sect are interdependent.

33
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,300
There can't be any misunderstanding

34
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,710
between the master of Peacock City-State and our sect.

35
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,080
Moqian.

36
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,580
I don't...

37
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,610
Why are you here?

38
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,950
The White Fungus and Lotus Seeds Soup.

39
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
This used to be his favorite.

40
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,170
[You don't like this soup]

41
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
Is there wine?

42
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,000
Little Mute.

43
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,970
Tell me.

44
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,790
Why are there so many unpredictable things in life?

45
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,840
I have lived a life of luxury

46
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,850
since childhood.

47
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
I grew up with my mother's care.

48
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,490
I had good friends by my side.

49
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,250
I was the happiest person in Peacock City-State.

50
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
I didn't expect it

51
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,490
to be like this now.

52
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
God is fair.

53
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,380
I was happy in the first half of my life.

54
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,050
I'm destined to be lonely

55
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
for the rest of my life.

56
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm really crazy.

57
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,600
I can't believe I'm talking about this with a mute.

58
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
The workload has been heavy lately.

59
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,610
Our sect is worried about your health.

60
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,440
So we're giving this Golden Pill to you specially.

61
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,650
This pill can also prolong your life

62
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,680
and strengthen your body.

63
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
Master, we're giving it to you

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,919
to show our sect's loyalty.

65
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
You gave me one before, right?

66
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,360
That was a bait to lure Flowers Kill out.

67
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,980
It was not a Golden Pill.

68
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,160
A Golden Pill is rare.

69
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
You should eat it as soon as possible

70
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
to enhance its efficacy.

71
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,080
Why are you doing this?

72
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Who are you?

73
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,760
How dare you be so rude!

74
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,570
Shu Ya,

75
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,650
leave.

76
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,800
Let go.

77
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
You humble servant!

78
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
How dare you offend Master!

79
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
Arrest him now!

80
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Wait.

81
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
Little Mute!

82
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,480
Little Mute.

83
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
What's going on?

84
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,450
Why did he spit blood

85
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,680
after eating the Golden Pill?

86
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
There's absolutely nothing wrong with the Golden Pill.

87
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,400
It must be him.

88
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,200
Guards!

89
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,200
Ruan Jiushu attempted to kill me.

90
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
It's a heinous crime.

91
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
Take her away.

92
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:41,800
I'll punish her later.

93
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,480
Yes.

94
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,050
Let me go!

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
Master,

96
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,970
please believe me.

97
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,840
Little Mute.

98
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,290
Let go of me!

99
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,200
The medicine just now

100
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
has forced the toxin out of his body.

101
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,620
Luckily, the toxicity is not strong.

102
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,400
He'll be fine if he takes the medicine on time

103
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,490
and rests well.

104
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,490
You've been wearing it the whole time.

105
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
Don't you think it's inconvenient?

106
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,450
What took you so long?

107
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,440
Master Rong is investigating it thoroughly.

108
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,110
I came in after bribing the guards.

109
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,570
What's the situation now?

110
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
I've investigated it.

111
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,530
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the Golden Pill.

112
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,000
But Master Rong doesn't believe it.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
We pled with her, but it didn't work.

114
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,770
Looks like she's determined to stand against us.

115
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,650
Now the sect's members are in panic.

116
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,040
The believers outside the sect are also wavering.

117
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,450
Rong Yu has wanted to get rid of me for a long time.

118
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,130
But she didn't have a chance.

119
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,890
Now she deliberately designed this.

120
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,730
She's too naive.

121
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,090
She's still not strong enough,

122
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,320
yet she wants to get rid of our century-old sect.

123
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,920
Senior,

124
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,750
what should I do next?

125
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,110
It's simple.

126
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,920
Peacock Sect has been innocent for generations.

127
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,400
Chief Ruan has devoted herself to the people.

128
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,850
But now she has been wronged and imprisoned.

129
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,980
It's really unfair.

130
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,080
Today,

131
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,300
the disciples of Peacock Sect are willing to kneel here.

132
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,290
We beg Peacock God to get rid of the evil and hail the virtuous.

133
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,320
Please grant us justice.

134
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,840
Peacock God, please appear.

135
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,610
[Announcement]

136
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,320
Since the announcement was released,

137
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,780
the city has been in chaos.

138
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,580
Some people said

139
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,560
Peacock Sect is impudent

140
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,600
because they tried to murder Master Rong.

141
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,070
Some people said Peacock Sect was framed

142
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,790
and Master Rong has forgotten her ancestors

143
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,380
and is treacherous

144
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,440
because she arrested Ruan Jiushu without finding out the truth.

145
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,080
They quarrel every day.

146
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,370
How are we supposed to do business like this?

147
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,230
Your Ladyship,

148
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,050
look.

149
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,800
They only quarrel in the city?

150
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,610
Didn't Peacock Sect take action?

151
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,970
Peacock Sect's men are on the clifftop now

152
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,340
to seek justice from Peacock God.

153
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,150
They're not begging Peacock God.

154
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
They're forcing Yu.

155
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,340
Your Ladyship,

156
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
even though we're not by Master Rong's side,

157
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,810
we can help her

158
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,070
as long as we want to.

159
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,330
I will find a way to help her.

160
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,530
Ni Hua, a domestic master of storytelling,

161
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,360
came to Peacock City today

162
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
to perform for free.

163
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,740
You won't

164
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,050
suffer any loss.

165
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,770
Come and listen.

166
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,050
During the 100 years since Peacock Sect's establishment,

167
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,340
it has been cunning and evil.

168
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,720
I bet there's one thing

169
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,040
you don't know.

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,440
What is it?

171
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,260
What is it?

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,880
What is it?

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,760
Just tell us.

174
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,370
Before Master Rong ascended the throne,

175
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,520
she was seriously ill.

176
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,570
Ruan Jiushu said solemnly

177
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
that Peacock Sect had a holy spring

178
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,290
that can cure all diseases.

179
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,040
As long as Master Rong bathed in it, she would recover completely.

180
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
Really?

181
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,800
The former master

182
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,540
loved her daughter so much.

183
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,550
She was so worried

184
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
that she believed her nonsense.

185
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
Isn't this murder?

186
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,700
Everyone, think about it.

187
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,440
It was in winter.

188
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,080
The water was so cold.

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,450
It was very cold.

190
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,930
But Peacock Sect

191
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,320
wanted to soak Master Rong in the pool.

192
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,600
Wasn't it inhumane?

193
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,570
It was inhumane.

194
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,630
Was it moral?

195
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,540
It was not moral at all.

196
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,510
Is it real?

197
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,610
But

198
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,350
fortunately, Flowers Kill showed up

199
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,890
and made their members fall into the so-called holy water.

200
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,690
Guess what happened?

201
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,550
What happened?

202
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,290
All of the sect's members

203
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,800
caught a cold.

204
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,520
What does it mean?

205
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,060
What?

206
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
It means

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,440
the statement that the holy water can cure all diseases

208
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
is nonsense.

209
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,460
It's a lie.

210
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,230
You're talking nonsense.

211
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,180
Peacock Sect did many good things.

212
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,320
It prayed for rain for the people

213
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,280
and established an academy.

214
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,030
We all know that, right?

215
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,120
That's right.

216
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,510
Everything it did has achieved notable results

217
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,520
and satisfied the people.

218
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,200
Don't try to fool us here.

219
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,880
That's right.

220
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,290
Those were done by the Holy Envoy.

221
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,560
What does it have to do with Peacock Sect?

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,430
She was Peacock Sect's Holy Envoy.

223
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,770
Of course it has something to do with Peacock Sect.

224
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,350
-That's right.
-Everyone, am I right?

225
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,120
Am I right?

226
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,570
You're right.

227
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,810
What should we do?

228
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,260
Do you know

229
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,770
why the Holy Envoy ascended?

230
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,120
Of course it was because she was summoned by Peacock God.

231
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,680
Wrong.

232
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,520
Wrong.

233
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,960
It was just an excuse.

234
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,150
The Holy Envoy found out the true colors of Peacock Sect.

235
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,240
She didn't want to side with nasty and evil people.

236
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,570
That's why she quitted.

237
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,390
Come.

238
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,220
Give them out.

239
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
Everyone, take a look.

240
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,920
Let me show you.

241
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,030
-What kind of lie is it?
-Look.

242
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,690
It's all a lie.

243
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,790
Pass them.

244
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Pass them and take a look.

245
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,330
I want to ask how much longer we have to kneel.

246
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,270
We haven't eaten anything...

247
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,310
for two days and two nights.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
That's right.

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,710
How much longer do we have to kneel?

250
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,250
When can Chief Ruan come back?

251
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,890
Shut up!

252
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,100
If we are so insincere,

253
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,290
Peacock God will never appear.

254
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,210
As long as Peacock God doesn't appear,

255
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,840
we can't stand up.

256
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,000
Master Rong has been

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,490
at Mr. Shu Ya's place these days.

258
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,920
She's been by his side the whole time.

259
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
Mr. Shu Ya risked his life to save Master Rong.

260
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,640
Because of this,

261
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,770
Master Rong won't treat him badly.

262
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,170
Maybe he'll gain Master Rong's favor soon.

263
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,410
That's right.

264
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,990
[Frost Pavilion]

265
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Is what they said

266
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,080
true?

267
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,360
Sir,

268
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,599
have some tea.

269
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,119
Mr. Shu Ya is playing the bamboo flute for Master Rong.

270
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,640
Something is wrong with the bamboo flute's sound.

271
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,010
Who is he?

272
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,410
Who let you out?

273
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,970
We haven't divorced yet.

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,740
I am your husband.

275
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,700
Guards, take him away.

276
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,270
Yes.

277
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,740
Yes.

278
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
Yu,

279
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,240
I know

280
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,640
you're doing this because you hate me, right?

281
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,100
You're blaming me, right?

282
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,980
Why should I hate you?

283
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,640
Take him away.

284
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,680
Yes.
