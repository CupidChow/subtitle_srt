[Episode 31]

4
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,789
I can't agree

5
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,360
to that.

6
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,240
My mother used to tell me

7
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,390
that the Master

8
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,289
also had many moments of frustration.

9
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,640
She couldn't do whatever she wanted.

10
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,640
I didn't understand back then,

11
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,960
and I always went against her.

12
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,410
But now that I am in this position myself,

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,200
I realized how hard it was for her.

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,230
Hua Ni.

15
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,430
Although I'm the Master,

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,990
the Peacock Sect has been making things difficult for me all the time.

17
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,520
Ruan Jiushu is very cunning

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,400
and is full of power.

19
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,760
I need a trustworthy person

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,230
to help me from inside the Peacock Sect.

21
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,230
I...

22
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,680
Hua Ni.

23
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,750
I have no one to rely on.

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,490
My mother has passed away,

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
and Moqian...

26
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,270
You are the person I trust

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
and my best friend.

28
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,790
I hope the next Chief of the Peacock Sect

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,670
is you.

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,560
How was it?

31
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,410
I knew she wouldn't agree so quickly.

32
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,600
I'll talk to her.

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,230
Muyang.

34
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,250
She has her own difficulties.

35
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,150
She just ascended the throne,

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,400
and her foundation is unstable.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,510
She needs our help.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,590
Her mother passed away,

39
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,990
and Moqian betrayed her.

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,200
This is the hardest time for her.

41
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,950
So,

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,310
I want to spend another year with her.

43
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,950
No.

44
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,670
Since we want to change the future,

45
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,980
we can't hesitate.

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,510
Muyang,

47
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,840
I know you're worried about me,

48
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,960
but…

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,230
if we were careful,

50
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,070
would it be okay?

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,880
Qingqing.

52
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,830
At this point,

53
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,880
you can't take any chances.

54
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,740
You must resign from the post of the Holy Envoy of the Peacock Sect.

55
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,149
But that means I'd abandon my friend.

56
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,040
Should I...

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,720
Should I leave Rong Yu alone?

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,890
I don't want it, either.

59
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,550
But now, there's still room to turn things around.

60
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,080
When everything is too late,

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,010
not only Rong Yu,

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,070
but the whole city

63
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,030
will also suffer.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Qingqing.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,230
Trust me.

66
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,970
I don't care anymore.

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,150
I just want you to be safe.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,750
Master, please allow Hua Ni

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,320
to resign the Holy Envoy from the Peacock Sect.

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,180
I have turned down the Holy Envoy.

71
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,830
Say no more.

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,900
We didn't mean to defy you.

73
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
We have our reasons.

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,740
At the wedding,

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,490
someone tried to kidnap Hua Ni.

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,690
They want to make use of her status as the Holy Envoy

77
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,020
to do evil deeds.

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
If Hua Ni

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,890
doesn't resign the Holy Envoy from the Peacock Sect now,

80
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,510
there will be a calamity in the future.

81
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,590
In the future…

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,870
Muyang.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,440
If you can really predict the future,

84
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,140
why couldn't you foresee my mother's tragic death?

85
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,960
I have agreed to your marriage.

86
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,150
As for other matters,

87
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,670
don't push your luck.

88
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,560
Please show mercy, Master.

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,570
Please grant our wish, Master.

90
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,909
Enough!

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Why are you all forcing me?

92
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,750
Why do you have to leave at this moment?

93
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,210
I just want to leave the Peacock Sect,

94
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,710
not to leave you.

95
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,600
No matter what happens to you,

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,260
we will always be by your side.

97
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,760
No need.

98
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,390
Leave if you want.

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,420
Don't be a nuisance here.

100
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,450
Thank you, Master.

101
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,870
We're finally here. I'm exhausted.

102
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,600
The countryside is quite nice.

103
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,850
I think so, too.

104
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,760
The scenery is beautiful.

105
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,360
There are trees everywhere.

106
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,720
Breathe.

107
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,020
Let me help you, Holy Envoy.

108
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,040
Thank you, Qiang.

109
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,920
Qiang.

110
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,270
You can't call her Holy Envoy anymore.

111
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,670
Master Rong has told the people

112
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,600
that the Holy Envoy has returned to the Heaven Realm.

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,240
What if someone hears it?

114
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,950
Then, what should I call you?

115
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,120
Although

116
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,480
some accident happened at the wedding

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,670
with your lord,

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,910
now we have a marriage certificate

119
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,310
and Master Rong's order.

120
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,530
What do you think you should call me?

121
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:24,920
Your Ladyship.

122
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
That's right.

123
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
You just became my wife,

124
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,010
and you have to move to this remote place.

125
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,620
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,520
Don't be.

127
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,520
As long as we are safe,

128
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,710
and we can be together,

129
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,309
I'll be happy whatever we do.

130
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
When this is all over,

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,490
whether you want to stay here

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,590
or travel around,

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,679
I'll be with you.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,039
Wherever Your Ladyship is,

135
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
I'll be there.

136
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll be wherever My Lord is.

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,910
Okay.

138
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,720
When everything is over,

139
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,210
the four of us

140
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,310
will travel all over the country,

141
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,160
taste every kind of delicious food,

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,020
and live a happy

143
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
and carefree life.

144
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,910
Master.

145
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,990
The Holy Envoy is both virtuous and competent.

146
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,990
Letting her leave

147
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,450
is the loss of the Peacock City-State.

148
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,920
There's no need to persuade someone who's determined to go.

149
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,120
Let's discuss who is to be the ambassador in Yunzhong City later.

150
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes.

151
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,830
Master.

152
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,120
I am the last one to know

153
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,550
that the Holy Envoy of our sect went back to the Heaven Realm.

154
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,470
Shouldn't you have discussed it with us?

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Do you have any objections

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
to my decision?

157
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,630
The Holy Envoy of our sect should either serve God for the rest of her life

158
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,550
or die.

159
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,040
There's no third way.

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,420
I gave her the third way.

161
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,200
I've ordered to let Hua Ni go.

162
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,880
The people in the city have accepted the fact

163
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,480
that the Holy Envoy had returned to the Heaven Realm to serve God.

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,070
From now on,

165
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,030
the Peacock City-State will no longer have a Holy Envoy.

166
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,290
Even the former master didn't interfere with our affairs.

167
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,990
How could you cross the line?

168
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,120
All the land belongs to me.

169
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,100
Where is the line of the Peacock Sect?

170
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,910
Listen.

171
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
My mother was kind and tolerant.

172
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,650
She didn't want to cause trouble.

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,830
But please remember

174
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,030
there are no two masters in the Peacock City-State.

175
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Chief,

176
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,040
you are the Chief of the Peacock Sect,

177
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,270
but you're also a subject of the Peacock City-State.

178
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,920
Please mind that your words and acts do not cross the line.

179
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,250
Senior.

180
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,830
She is getting tough.

181
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,480
Senior,

182
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,930
you don't have to come into conflict with the Master over Hua Ni.

183
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,570
Just let her go.

184
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,430
I believe there's a better candidate

185
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,090
for the position of Peacock Holy Envoy.

186
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,270
I know what you're thinking.

187
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,280
But now,

188
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,920
it's not the time yet.

189
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,180
I understand.

190
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,230
If Hua Ni uses the excuse of having gone back to the Heaven Realm to get away,

191
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,310
she can never show up in the Peacock City.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,850
Qiang, don't go.

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,630
It's so high.

194
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,630
-Let me do it.
-It's okay.

195
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,870
Come down.

196
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,560
-What are you nervous about?
-Come down.

197
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,200
It's not high.

198
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,890
It's not a problem for me.

199
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,800
You'd better come down.

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,130
It's not raining today.

201
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,230
It's useless to do this now.

202
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,230
It's almost done.

203
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,420
I was afraid you might get hurt.

204
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,260
Thank you.

205
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,440
Yang.

206
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,500
You've been tidying up all day. Thank you.

207
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,590
You too.

208
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,570
Why do you put the flower here?

209
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,630
This is the first gift you brought

210
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,840
after you came to the Peacock City-State.

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,710
Of course I'll display it

212
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,440
in the most conspicuous place.

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,990
Do you find

214
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,680
Qiang and Lai are a perfect match?

215
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,840
Why do you say so?

216
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,840
I think

217
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,800
Qiang may seem

218
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,190
carefree on the face of it,

219
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,050
but in fact,

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,470
she is very soft and kind inside.

221
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,350
I don't need to say much about Lai.

222
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,680
He's tall and handsome.

223
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,740
And he's good at washing and cooking.

224
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,270
He's definitely a good man.

225
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,180
Most importantly,

226
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,360
today, I saw that when Qiang almost fell,

227
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,000
Lai was very nervous.

228
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,120
There must be something going on between them.

229
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,180
Didn't you notice?

230
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,560
You've been with Qiang for so many years.

231
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,400
Do you know

232
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,890
what kind of man she likes?

233
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,520
Qiang

234
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,550
may seem carefree,

235
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,950
but she is

236
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,920
very stubborn.

237
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
I guess

238
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,510
she must like someone meticulous

239
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,790
and considerate.

240
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,110
Isn't that just Lai?

241
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,590
They have a chance.

242
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,470
Prophet.

243
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,630
Tell me.

244
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,680
In your dream,

245
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,790
what's the ending for Qiang and Lai?

246
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,750
Are they together?

247
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,190
Are they married?

248
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,410
Do they have a beautiful

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
and healthy baby?

250
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,960
Tell me.

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,280
Tell me.

252
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,450
Do you really want to know?

253
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,400
What's wrong?

254
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,390
Qingqing.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,510
I saw

256
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,210
Lai was badly injured to save you.

257
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,930
In order to save him,

258
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,580
Qiang died after him.

259
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,850
They had always loved each other,

260
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,530
but they never said it until they died.

261
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,710
How could that be?

262
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,320
Qingqing.

263
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,030
It's all in the past.

264
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,110
It won't happen anymore.

265
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,230
That's right.

266
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,970
We can change the future together.

267
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,470
Don't worry.

268
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,810
I won't let you have any regrets in this life.

269
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
In this life,

270
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,280
I won't let you have any regrets.

271
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,990
Your Ladyship, why are you still up so late?

272
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,750
Is anything wrong?

273
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Nothing is wrong.

274
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,090
I just want to chat with you.

275
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,240
Lai,

276
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,350
how old are you?

277
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm 22 years old.

278
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,080
Twenty-two?

279
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,920
Yes.

280
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,960
It's time for you to date.

281
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
Your Ladyship, stop joking.

282
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

283
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,950
Do you have someone you like?

284
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,630
No.

285
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,670
No?

286
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,000
I wonder who was so worried

287
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,440
when Qiang fell.

288
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,080
She just...

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,790
Just what?

290
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,400
Your body is more honest than your mouth.

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,530
Your Ladyship,

292
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,670
all my life,

293
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,130
I will only follow you.

294
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,800
Lai,

295
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,100
have you forgotten

296
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,130
what I told you

297
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
when we just met?

298
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,240
You're not someone's appendage.

299
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,160
Your life is yours.

300
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,230
If you like someone,

301
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,310
just go after her.

302
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,110
Do whatever you want.

303
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,510
I'll support you.

304
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,190
But...

305
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,990
I don't deserve it.

306
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,520
Who said that?

307
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,950
Besides,

308
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,070
who is to decide whether you deserve it or not?

309
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,730
As long as you love each other,

310
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,480
you two are a perfect match.

311
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,280
Look at me.

312
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,520
Lai,

313
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
there are many things

314
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,630
that once you miss, you'll miss them forever.

315
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,160
You can never get them back.

316
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,080
Don't leave any regrets.

317
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,920
Okay?

318
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,210
Your Ladyship.

319
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,280
Thank you.

320
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,700
For what?

321
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,510
I'm waiting to attend your wedding with Qiang.

322
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,360
Your Ladyship, are you making fun of me again?

323
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,040
Let bygones be bygones.

324
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,360
But from now on,

325
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,230
there are only the two of us left.

326
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,160
We should cherish each other more.

327
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,970
I will always be by your side

328
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
and never betray you.

329
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,770
[Frost Pavilion]
