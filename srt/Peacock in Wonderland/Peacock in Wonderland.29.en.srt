[Episode 29]

4
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,190
You have all her love.

5
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,670
How can you understand me?

6
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,410
I admired you.

7
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,680
I felt inferior

8
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
in front of you.

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,370
I also hated you.

10
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,170
But I always believed

11
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,970
as long as I could stay by Yu's side,

12
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,890
we could compete for her fairly.

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,450
But after so many years, I finally realized

14
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,860
there is no fairness in love, right?

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,970
So you can do whatever it takes to have her?

16
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,090
You don't love her.

17
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,500
Of course you think I'm unreasonable.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,410
If it were Hua Ni,

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,230
you would do the same.

20
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,220
If I can't wait for what I want

21
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,670
to come to me

22
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,350
and I can't have it by begging,

23
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,660
I can only compete for it myself.

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,230
On the night the Moon Epiphyllum bloomed,

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,600
what happened between Yu and me was not an accident.

26
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,500
The silk threads

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,720
on the cloak I gave her

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,260
were soaked in the aphrodisiac water.

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,530
When she wore it,

30
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,270
her body temperature would make the drug on the threads evaporate.

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,650
Yu, are you okay?

32
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,250
Then it would make her unable to control herself.

33
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,930
Yu.

34
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,910
I thought after that night,

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,579
she would treat me differently.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
But she would rather compensate me with money

37
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,040
than give me even just a little bit of her love.

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,210
The assassins who appeared on the night the Moon Epiphyllum bloomed

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,690
were your men.

40
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,800
Yu hates Flowers Kill very much.

41
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,610
If she finds out the person behind it

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,400
is the one she loves,

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,570
how would she feel?

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,579
You applied fluorescent powder on the darts

45
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,010
and sent someone to assassinate Yu

46
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,420
just to lure her to our base.

47
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,050
But I didn't expect you

48
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,820
to get away from it again

49
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,240
because of Hua Ni.

50
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,770
Now it looks like

51
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,070
those who appeared on the night Yu gave me

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,370
the mandarin duck jade pendant in Master's Mansion

53
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,450
were also your men.

54
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,450
Of course.

55
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,930
How could I just watch her

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,390
give you the jade pendant?

57
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,880
But I never thought

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,140
she still chose to save you without hesitation

59
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,470
at that critical moment of life and death.

60
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,070
I finally saw through her heart.

61
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,209
But even though she doesn't love me,

62
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,250
I still don't want to let her go.

63
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,870
But I don't understand

64
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,680
why everyone in this world

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,310
wants to separate me from Yu.

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,570
This time, Li Muyang made contributions by addressing the drought.

67
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,300
I want to take this opportunity

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
to bestow a marriage upon him and Yu.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,100
You've always been in charge

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,550
of Yu's clothes.

71
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,290
So I want you

72
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,700
to make a wedding dress for her.

73
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,090
I decided

74
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,930
to never allow anyone in this world

75
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,230
to separate us.

76
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,850
Master, Moqian wants to see you.

77
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,260
What's so urgent that you have to see me

78
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,720
in the middle of the night?

79
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,090
When I was making the wedding dress,

80
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,490
I found some details that I don't understand.

81
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,210
I'm worried it might delay the schedule,

82
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,670
so I came here at this hour.

83
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,730
Master,

84
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,030
please forgive me.

85
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,380
Come in.

86
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,830

It was my fault.

But it doesn't matter anymore.

94

know my identity

96
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,210

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,930
Indeed,

102
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,450
you are cautious and meticulous.

ultimately proved to be your undoing.

If I'm really meticulous,

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,050
After this,

191
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,040
I'd like to see

192
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,560
if you can still be so tough.

193
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,490
Hurry up.

194
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,720
Comfortable, right?

195
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,520
Enough!

196
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
Greetings, Master.

197
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,390
Although he is unforgivable,

198
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,750
he is still my husband.

199
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,030
Put him under house arrest in Frost Pavilion.

200
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,530
From now on,

201
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,250
he and I...

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,280
shall never meet again.

203
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,430
Be careful.

204
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,640
[Guanbuzhu]

205
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,540
Be gentle.

206
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,080
Move it inside.

207
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,130
-Hurry.
-Okay.

208
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,980
Uncle Li.

209
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,740
It hasn't been easy,

210
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,700
but finally, Guanbuzhu

211
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,130
has reopened.

212
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,930
Yes.

213
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,450
Muyang,

214
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,490
are you okay?

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,410
Now that the truth has come to light,

216
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,530
of course I'm okay.

217
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,700
The most painful thing in the world is being unable to get what we love.

218
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,230
Moqian has become like this

219
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,240
because he's too stubborn.

220
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,060
Don't think too much.

221
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,700
When did my Qingqing

222
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,540
learn to say

223
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,650
such philosophical words?

224
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,850
I learned it from you.

225
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,610
From today onwards,

226
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,590
I'm no longer the Minister of Rites.

227
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,470
I'm just a flower seller.

228
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,860
Will you dislike me?

229
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,000
Are you worried?

230
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,670
Of course I will.

231
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,190
So,

232
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,620
you must work hard.

233
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,600
Sell more flowers and save more money

234
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,190
to buy me delicious food.

235
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,850
Okay?

236
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,930
Okay.

237
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,290
You came back. Aren't you ashamed?

238
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,270
If it weren't for Master Rong,

239
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,330
even a dog wouldn't want to come here.

240
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,010
If you don't cut ties with Flowers Kill,

241
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,860
the sect will never accept you.

242
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,930
Now,

243
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,510
it doesn't matter if you'll accept me or not.

244
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,890
The point is I don't want to put up with you anymore.

245
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,090
I've wanted to quit being the Holy Envoy

246
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,570
for a long time.

247
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,810
In the past,

248
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,430
I had to be the Holy Envoy

249
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,150
to stay alive.

250
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,040
I even wanted to take advantage of this position

251
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
to benefit the people

252
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,750
and improve Peacock Sect on my own.

253
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,930
Now I've figured it out.

254
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,990
You can't put a crown on a clown

255
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,650
and expect a king.

256
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,570
I don't have to be the Holy Envoy

257
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,890
to benefit the people.

258
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,410
So,

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
from now on,

260
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,550
I'm no longer one of you.

261
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,240
Goodbye.

262
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,990
How dare you!

263
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,090
Holy Envoy is the sacred position of our sect.

264
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,550
You can't just come

265
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,770
and leave as you wish.

266
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,980
I forgot to tell you.

267
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,570
I'm here to inform you,

268
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,300
not to discuss with you.

269
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,330
Chief,

270
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,850
she has already turned disloyal.

271
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,980
What's the point of asking her to stay?

272
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,710
She's quite prestigious in the city now.

273
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,850
If we let her go so easily,

274
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,370
it will increase Flowers Kill's prestige.

275
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,970
She wants to get away.

276
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,580
It's not that easy.

277
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,500
Uncle Li.

278
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,250
Master, you're here.

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,770
Sorry for not welcoming you at the door.

280
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,080
Uncle Li, don't stand on ceremony.

281
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,090
Are you here for Muyang?

282
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,050
Uncle Li,

283
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm here to visit you.

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
I acted rashly before.

285
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,040
I wronged Muyang

286
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,610
and made you suffer with him.

287
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,220
No big deal.

288
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
I watched all of you

289
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,090
grow up.

290
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,410
All of you are good people

291
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,970
and pitiful people.

292
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,100
It's good as long as the misunderstanding

293
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,640
can be cleared up.

294
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,850
Uncle Li,

295
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,450
if you have any wish to fulfill,

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,570
just tell me.

297
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,480
I don't want anything now.

298
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,270
There's only one thing

299
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,099
I hope you can help me with.

300
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,930
Go ahead.

301
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,300
My son, Muyang, and Holy Envoy love each other.

302
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,140
They've shared weal and woe.

303
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,740
It hasn't been easy for them.

304
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,500
After what happened this time,

305
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,099
I just want to see my son get married soon.
