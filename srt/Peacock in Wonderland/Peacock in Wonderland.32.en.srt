[Cloud Villa]

5
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:44,970
Sir,

6
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,759
Hua Ni has resigned from the position of the Holy Envoy.

7
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,729
Flowers Kill is also investigating your whereabouts

8
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,930
in secret.

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,770
I didn't expect to be fooled by him

10
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,200
at the wedding.

11
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,630
The operation was exposed.

12
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,289
We failed to catch Holy Envoy.

13
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,230
Do you still want to continue to carry out your plan?

14
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,160
Sir, what do you think?

15
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,060
If this pawn is useless,

16
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,020
choose another one.

17
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,210
Qing Jian failed to kidnap you at the wedding.

18
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,690
He definitely will come up with another plan.

19
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,790
So I guess

20
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,720
Qing Jian will go find the Feisun Tally.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
The Feisun Tally?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,210
The Feisun Tally is owned by the masters.

23
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,640
It can mobilize a mysterious army outside the city.

24
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,710
The soldiers of this army are disguised as farmers

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,310
in the countryside when they are not summoned.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,590
But once they see this tally,

27
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,829
they can go to war immediately.

28
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,950
They are invincible.

29
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,640
Looks like

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,310
this is the secret weapon of the masters of Peacock City-State.

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,320
Shouldn't Yu have this tally?

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,540
The former master died suddenly.

33
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,570
She didn't have time to tell Rong Yu about it.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,150
As long as I get the Feisun Tally first,

35
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,350
I can command the army

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,040
to achieve our ambition.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,990
A tally can mobilize

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,800
thousands of soldiers?

39
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,950
I can't believe it.

40
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,790
Not just that.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,320
Whoever has the tally can command the army.

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,550
So I have to get it

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,600
before Qing Jian does.

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,910
When I get the Feisun Tally,

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,710
I will give it to Rong Yu immediately.

46
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,240
You and Qiang go back and wait for my good news.

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,640
If you don't want to die,

48
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,430
get out of my way!

49
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,300
Brother.

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,550
Zhiyang,

51
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,220
you finally recognized me.

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,610
It's been so many years.

53
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,770
I found you long ago.

54
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,200
I've been watching you.

55
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,210
Why didn't you show up earlier

56
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,640
and reunite with me?

57
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,210
There are too many people around you.

58
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,170
You don't need me anymore.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,480
I don't dare to bother you.

60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,430
Zhiyang,

61
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,790
you know what I want.

62
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,470
Impossible.

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,270
We finally reunited.

64
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,830
Why are you against me?

65
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,430
I don't want you to go astray.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Astray?

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
You have Flowers Kill.

68
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,800
Why can't I have Moon Pavilion?

69
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,980
You can eliminate Peacock Sect

70
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,830
to avenge our parents.

71
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,000
Why can't I?

72
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,130
We have the same goal.

73
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,909
How come my way is not acceptable?

74
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,920
We are different.

75
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,640
Flowers Kill never kills innocent people.

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,950
That's because you're indecisive

77
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,010
and soft-hearted.

78
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,210
Since you can't

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,720
avenge us,

80
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,710
let me do it.

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Give it to me.

82
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,200
I told you.

83
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,590
Impossible.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,620
I can't believe you're pointing your sword at me

85
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,090
for your enemy.

86
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,680
Your martial arts skills have improved.

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,630
I wonder

88
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,330
if you can defeat me this time.

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,920
Brother.

90
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,680
Brother!

91
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,549
Brother.

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,330
I know you hate them.

93
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,559
I hate them too.

94
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,780
But if you do this,

95
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,920
there will be more children like us.

96
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,070
There are other ways.

97
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,050
What else can we do except making them pay with their blood?

98
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,260
They deserve to die!

99
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,700
Brother!

100
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,690
Die!

101
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,040
Brother.

102
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,390
Come home with me.

103
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,660
Don't call me Brother.

104
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,330
I don't deserve it.

105
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,830
Brother,

106
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,830
I'll plead with Master Rong.

107
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,160
I'll make sure you'll be fine.

108
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,230
Come home with me.

109
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,770
I'm begging you.

110
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,470
Come back with me.

111
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,060
I was wrong.

112
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,990
I should have brought you back to me long ago

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,970
to prevent you from being blinded

114
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,130
and turned into a hypocrite by them.

115
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,490
You're hypocritical!

116
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,820
I was wrong.

117
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,590
Zhiyang,

118
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,770
if you don't want to compromise your righteousness

119
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
or be a hypocrite,

120
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,710
it's okay.

121
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,920
I'll open the way for you.

122
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,520
Let me be the one with a notorious reputation

123
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
and dirty hands.

124
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,270
No!

125
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,390
Li Zhiyun.

126
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,510
Stop it.

127
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,270
Come up first.

128
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,350
The current scene

129
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,390
is just like that day.

130
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,830
No.

131
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,590
You've grown up.

132
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,640
Brother.

133
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,700
No.

134
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,370
Zhiyang,

135
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,650
you must... live well.

136
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,870
Brother, no!

137
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,120
Brother!

138
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,920
Brother!

139
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,880
Brother!

140
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,270
Muyang, how are you?

141
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,190
I'm fine.

142
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,540
Where's Qing Jian?

143
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,250
He jumped off the cliff.

144
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,550
I just...

145
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
I just wanted to take him home.

146
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,110
My Lord.

147
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,350
He was a ringleader.

148
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
Now he's dead.

149
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,950
It's a good thing.

150
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
It's a good thing.

151
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,990
I have to find him.

152
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,960
I have to find him.

153
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,640
The flowers and plants in the greenhouse have been moved here.

154
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Lord Li is often away from home.

155
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,310
If no one takes care of them,

156
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm afraid they'll wither.

157
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,420
Your Ladyship,

158
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,560
are you thinking about Lord Li?

159
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,100
I remember when I first met him,

160
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,320
he pretended to be gentle.

161
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,870
He was like a harmless Timid Boy.

162
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,430
Then I found out

163
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,730
he is a man-eating flower.

164
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,490
But this man-eating flower doesn't eat humans.

165
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,760
He is firm in speech but soft in heart.

166
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
No matter what happens to me,

167
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,310
he would always be by my side.

168
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,110
Every time I was in danger,

169
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,560
he protected me well.

170
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,880
I always thought

171
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,990
he was an invincible

172
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,810
and all-round man.

173
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,080
But now I've realized

174
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,170
actually, he has been wounded all over his body.

175
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,290
He just hid it too well

176
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,120
and never let me know.

177
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,410
Your Ladyship,

178
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,350
you can cure him

179
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,410
by being his medicine.

180
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,930
I don't care what happened before.

181
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,710
I don't know what happened before either.

182
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,710
But in the future,

183
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760
if anyone dares to bully my husband,

184
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,220
I'll fight it out with him.

185
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,310
What's wrong?

186
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:49,920
Father.

187
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,340
You've been wronged?

188
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,870
Did Muyang bully you?

189
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,430
Where is he?

190
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,200
Well...

191
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,510
He wouldn't come home right after getting married?

192
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,670
No, Father.

193
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,550
Muyang has something important to do.

194
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,070
He asked us to wait for him at home.

195
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,930
What's more important than accompanying his wife?

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
If this continues...

197
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,480
If this continues...

198
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,900
Father, I...

199
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,510
When can I have a grandson?

200
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,380
This is really...

201
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,870
My Lord,

202
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,200
we've searched everywhere,

203
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,950
but we still couldn't find anyone.

204
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,950
Could it be that Qing Jian has wings and has flown away?

205
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,190
He's not dead.

206
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,330
It's the claw hook.

207
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,360
He tricked us.

208
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,590
No wonder he was so decisive when he jumped off the cliff.

209
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,950
It turns out he was well-prepared.

210
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,880
He's so cunning.

211
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,640
Looks like we were careless.

212
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,880
He should still be in the city.

213
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,940
Then we should go back to the city now.

214
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,390
Master.

215
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,280
Lord Chen, why did you come here

216
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,710
in the middle of the night?

217
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,910
Du Moqian is immoral.

218
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
He's not qualified to serve you.

219
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,720
But there has to be someone by your side.

220
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
I have a nephew

221
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,150
named Shu Ya.

222
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,050
He is willing to serve you.

223
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,990
Thank you, Lord Chen.

224
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,980
But this is not what I want.

225
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,550
Please think twice, Master.

226
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,180
My nephew is very sensible and obedient.

227
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,150
If you don't like him,

228
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,040
you can make him a servant.

229
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,070
Besides,

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,830
having an heir is important to the continuous prosperity of the city.

231
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,090
This can't be ignored.

232
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,990
Forget it.

233
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,800
Just send him here.

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Master, you are wise.

235
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,599
Master, this is Lord Chen's nephew,

236
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,640
Mr. Shu Ya.

237
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,069
How old are you?

238
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
Mr. Shu Ya was born a mute.

239
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,250
So he can't answer your question.

240
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,540
He's actually a mute.

241
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,780
Come here.

242
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,350
Sit.

243
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,110
Mr. Shu Ya's face is injured.

244
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,750
He is worried he might scare you.

245
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,950
So he is wearing a mask

246
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
to hide his face.

247
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,920
A mute

248
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,960
and ugly man.

249
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,830
This is the person Lord Chen picked.
