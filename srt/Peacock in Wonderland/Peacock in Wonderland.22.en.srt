00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,930
Peacock in Wonderland

3
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,730
Episode 22

4
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,560
It's really a good idea.

5
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,780
In my hometown,

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,759
this is easy.

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,800
If you want to learn,

8
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
I can teach you more.

9
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,259
So,

10
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,340
please teach me the etiquette related to the ceremony.

11
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,910
I won't go back on my word.

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,680
So many?

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
I have to memorize all these?

14
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,880
You just need to memorize

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,120
the procedures

16
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,750
and congratulatory words I marked for you.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,800
Deliver the Imperial Jade Seal. Hail.

18
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,950
What is this?

19
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,030
This is too hard for me.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,670
Although the congratulatory words are like a tongue twister,

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,690
the ceremony is quite simple.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,840
There is no music or banquet.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
I was thinking about holding a grand ceremony

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,540
for Young Master Rong.

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,240
You can't.

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,800
It's still the mourning period for Master Rong.

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
The succession ceremony of Young Master Rong

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,530
has to be simple.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Fine.

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,200
Just continue to recite them.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,230
If there is anything you don't understand,

32
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,630
I'll be right beside you.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Deliver the Imperial Jade Seal.

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,660
What is the first line of the succession ceremony?

35
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,420
Yanxia Shop

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Yu?

37
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,690
Why are you here?

38
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,700
What are you embroidering?

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,600
The embroidered phoenix on the wedding dress.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,510
It's only a few stitches away from completion.

41
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,640
I can speed it up.

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,320
Wedding dress?

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm not making this wedding dress

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,400
because of the last wish of Master Rong.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
She asked me to make it long ago.

46
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,070
I appreciate her care,

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,300
so I want to fulfill her last wish.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I don't want to force you.

49
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,440
Even you know

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,650
you should fulfill my mother's last wish.

51
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,040
But as her daughter,

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,150
I've been hesitating.

53
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,640
Yu,

54
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,360
what do you mean?

55
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,560
Nothing.

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,920
Yu,

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,040
do you have something to tell me?

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,670
Now I don't.

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,640
Well...

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
I have something to tell you.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,170
I've liked you

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
for many years.

63
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,720
I guess you've noticed it.

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,840
But I don't want to go against your will.

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,920
I know

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,159
you don't like me.

67
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,940
So, don't take the last wish

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,860
seriously.

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,970
We grew up together.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,260
We've known each other for so many years.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,250
Actually, even I don't understand

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
my feelings for you sometimes.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
How can you be sure

74
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,060
I didn't like you

75
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,440
and I wouldn't like you in the future?

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,840
I don't want to force you.

77
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,070
I know what to do.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,920
It's late.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Don't hurt your eyes.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,890
Embroider it tomorrow.

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,090
You're here.

82
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,310
Why did you ask me to come here?

83
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,030
I thought about it yesterday.

84
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,220
I think

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,920
we can incorporate some details into the ceremony.

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,380
The procedures are fixed.

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,540
We can't change them randomly.

88
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,770
But the ceremony is too cold.

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,330
It has no human touch at all.

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
So I'm thinking...

91
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,830
Young Master Rong just lost her mother.

92
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,970
If

93
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,680
we take some of Master Rong's things to the ceremony,

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
it can not only represent inheritance,

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,720
but also offer her some comfort.

96
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

97
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
You can only take one.

98
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,159
I'm relieved now.

99
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,130
Since

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,540
you've memorized

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,940
the ceremony's procedures,

102
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,400
according to our agreement,

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,600
you should teach me some new knowledge.

104
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,010
Okay.

105
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,670
People should achieve comprehensive development in morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics.

106
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,430
Today, I'm going to teach you something in physical fitness and aesthetics.

107
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,010
What does... that mean?

108
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,370
Despite my lack of coordination,

109
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,620
I was

110
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,320
my mom's square dancing partner.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,130
Trust me.

112
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,860
Ready, go.

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,020
Be gentle. Follow my lead.

114
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,520
One.

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Two.

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Three.

117
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes, relax.

118
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
One.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,120
Two.

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,220
♫Lost in reincarnation repeatedly♫

121
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,450
♫Waiting for someone to turn around in Peacock City♫

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
What happened in my dream came true again.

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,020
♫The past is like falling snow♫

124
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,130

♫We'll be fearless of separation♫

130
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,010
Gosh, what am I doing?

131
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,770
I almost kissed him.

132
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,210
Thank you, Holy Envoy.

133
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,610
You're welcome.

134
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,210
-Well…
-Well…

135
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,850
-I'll...
-I'll...

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,700
How's your learning, Holy Envoy?

137
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,480
Don't worry.

138
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,530
I've learned it.

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,890
Okay.

140
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,820
I'm going to give you a test.

141
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,400
Please show me

142
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,560
the ceremony's procedures.

143
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,620
The officials enter the hall.

144
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,280
The master sits on the throne.

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,550
Present the Imperial Jade Seal.

146
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,270
Kowtow four times.

147
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,600
Hail.

148
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Kowtow four times again.

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
Not bad.

150
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,520
How many steps should be taken to present the Imperial Jade Seal?

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,200
Well...

152
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
Six... steps?

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
You are really smart.

154
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,280
He Huan, you've taught her well.

155
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,320
I learned it myself.

156
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,950
It has nothing to do with him.

157
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

158
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
That's not nonsense.

159
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
You wanted to embarrass me, right?

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,570
Now you want to take the credit.

161
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,140
You...

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,800
Enough.

163
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
Holy Envoy, you should review the etiquette

164
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,780
and prepare for the ceremony.

165
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,440
Your Excellency, you deserve your reputation.

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,370
You're amazing.

167
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,290
You've learned it on your own.

168
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,130
Of course.

169
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,970
After all, I took the college entrance exam before.

170
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
But...

171
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,230
still, it was all thanks to my teacher.

172
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,950
If it weren't for him,

173
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,040
I couldn't have learned it

174
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
within just a few days.

175
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,640
I think Lord Li always cares about you.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,060
The prayers you recited every day

177
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
were written by Lord Li personally.

178
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,740
Could it be...

179
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,560
Lord Li

180
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,180
likes you?

181
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
No.

182
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,380
Don't mention it.

183
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,840
Stop thinking about it.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
I was mistaken a few days ago.

185
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
It was so awkward.

186
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,240
Bro,

187
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,410
in my opinion,

188
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,200
I shouldn't think too much.

189
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
Flattering myself is terrible.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,420
Otherwise, we can't even be friends.

191
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,660
What about you?

192
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,500
What are your feelings for Lord Li?

193
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,100
My feelings?

194
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,080
Forget it.

195
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,700
Since he has no feelings for me,

196
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
my feelings are not important.

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,180
You're holding the book upside down.

198
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,720
My Lord,

199
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,690
I've searched all the flower shops in the city.

200
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,290
Before Master Rong died,

201
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,940
none of the flower shops in the city sold these three kinds of flowers.

202
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,340
So the murderer didn't buy them in the city.

203
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,010
I knew it.

204
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,890
The murderer is meticulous

205
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,730
and knows a lot about flowers.

206
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
If the flowers were not bought from the flower shops,

207
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
he must have planted them somewhere without permission.

208
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,720
As long as we can find the place where the flowers are planted,

209
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,110
we can find the murderer.

210
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,590
But the planting area is so big.

211
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,710
Where can I find it?

212
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,000
Look.

213
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,110
The flowering period of this kind of flower is very short.

214
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,480
But it's still blooming after Master Rong's death.

215
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
That means

216
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,800
the place where it's planted is not very far from the city.

217
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
Considering the geology,

218
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,200
environment,

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,800
and privacy,

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,970
only these places

221
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
are suitable.

222
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,810
Go investigate now.

223
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,210
Yes, My Lord.

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,000
The succession ceremony

225
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,240
starts now.

226
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
Welcome the master.

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,740
Holy Envoy, please deliver the seal.

228
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,460
This dress belonged to my mother.

229
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,020
This is an important occasion.

230
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm sure she would want to be by your side.

231
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,470
Master Rong stepped down.

232
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,140
I've ascended the throne.

233
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,870
From now on,

234
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,800
I will fulfill the late master's wishes.

235
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,490
I will extend the majesty of all things

236
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,300
and the prosperity of the people.

237
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,380
Master, we swear we'll support you

238
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,860
and live up to the people's expectations.

239
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,760
You may rise.

240
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,620
According to the late master's last wish,

241
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,540
I will marry Du Moqian,

242
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,620
the boss of Yanxia Shop,

243
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,690
on an auspicious day.

244
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,810
Master, congratulations on your marriage.

245
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,630
Yanxia Shop

246
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,240
Master's edict has arrived.

247
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Mr. Du, please come out to accept it.

248
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,460
This is great news.

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,610
I wonder why Mr. Du wouldn't accept it.

250
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,160
It's inconvenient for him to accept it.

251
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,390
I'm sorry you had a wasted journey.

252
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,250
Please go back.

253
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,480
This is Master's order.

254
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,080
It'll be disobedience if he doesn't accept it.

255
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,520
What's wrong?

256
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,520
Master,

257
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,830
Du Moqian disobeyed your order.

258
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,000
He's disrespectful.

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
He should be punished severely.

260
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,520
Forget it.
