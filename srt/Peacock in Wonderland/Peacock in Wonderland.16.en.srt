[Episode 16]

4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,420
Today is the day of sacrifice.

5
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,640
I wonder where Muyang and Qiang have gone.

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
I haven't seen them for days.

7
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,060
If they were here,

8
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,630
they could help figure out a way

9
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,630
to save Tong.

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,440
Lai,

11
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,850
you've been serving the Holy Envoy every day.

12
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,020
Can you plead with the Holy Envoy?

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,229
I can't find the Holy Envoy now either.

14
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,020
Tong is such a well-behaved and sensible child.

15
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,820
I really can't bear to see him at such a young age...

16
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,419
No.

17
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,270
The sacrifice is about to begin.

18
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,890
I have to go and check.

19
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Uncle Li!

20
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,890
The dazzling feathers of the peacock

21
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,570
are shining upon us.

22
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,180
The dazzling feathers of the peacock

23
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,930
are shining upon us.

24
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,970
Here, we respectfully offer sacrifices to the Peacock God,

25
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,700
hoping to summon its presence.

26
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,740
Here, we respectfully offer sacrifices to the Peacock God,

27
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,470
hoping to summon its presence.

28
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,550
May the divine spirit descend

29
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,130
and bless the people.

30
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,240
May the divine spirit descend

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,980
and bless the people.

32
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,090
May rain fall

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,960
to water our fields.

34
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,620
May rain fall

35
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,610
to water our fields.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,810
It's the auspicious time. Offer the sacrifice!

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,680
Tong.

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,570
Yu.

39
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,330
Sacrificing for blessings has been a tradition for over 100 years.

40
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,190
For the stability of Peacock City-State,

41
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,500
I have no other choice.

42
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,970
In the future, when you sit in my position,

43
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,650
you will understand naturally.

44
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,579
If I must sacrifice innocent lives

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,930
to secure this throne,

46
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,220
I'd rather not sit on it.

47
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,180
Tong.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
Tong!

49
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,270
Uncle Li.

50
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,530
-Step back.
-Uncle Li.

51
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,130
Here are the boys,

52
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,500
whom we offer to the various gods!

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,960
It's the auspicious time.

54
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,090
Let the sacrifice begin!

55
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,690
Brother.

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,579
No!

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,100
Brother!

58
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,940
Who dares

59
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,810
to disrupt the sacrifice?

60
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,380
Look over there!

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,310
Look over there!

62
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,890
The true form of the Peacock God

63
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,220
has descended upon the mortal realm

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,500
to meet its congregation,

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,980
and bestow the divine radiance with blessing.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,909
The Peacock God?

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,280
Greetings, Peacock God!

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Greetings, Peacock God!

69
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,020
My protection and blessings

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,170
come from within.

71
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,810
Sacrificing innocent children

72
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,930
is too cruel.

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,500
It only adds sin

74
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,170
and brings no blessings.

75
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,570
You have repeatedly committed grave mistakes

76
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,659
and angered me.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,650
Peacock God, we will heed your teachings earnestly.

78
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,290
Please bestow your blessings upon us.

79
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,900
If you want my protection and blessings,

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,560
you must cease the senseless killing.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Good deeds and virtues will bring eternal blessings.

82
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,570
Protecting and loving your people will ensure enduring grace.

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,330
Should you err again, heaven will deliver punishment.

84
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,300
Peacock City-State will suffer depopulation

85
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,500
and never find peace.

86
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,970
We will heed your teachings, Peacock God, and keep them in our hearts!

87
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,600
Thank you for your great kindness and generosity!

88
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,980
Thank you for your great kindness and generosity!

89
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,050
Thank you for your great kindness and generosity!

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,540
Thank you for your great kindness and generosity!

91
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,450
Tong, it's okay now.

92
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,460
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

93
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,140
Don't be afraid.

94
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,060
It's all in the past now.

[Three days ago]

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,810
My Lord, why is no one here?

97
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,690
Qing Jian?

98
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,930
Where is she?

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,340
Stop!

100
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,530
He's one of us.

101
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,530
Although there was indeed a misunderstanding

102
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,060
during the rescue,

103
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,250
everyone was for the children.

104
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,930
Our intentions are all the same.

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,770
Right?

106
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,250
Right, Qiang?

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,409
So, was it you who wrote that letter?

108
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,350
The Peacock Sect sacrifices lives.

109
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,010
Those who do so must be killed.

110
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,270
We can't stand their actions,

111
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,150
so of course, we have to stop them.

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,260
Ruan Jiushu is ruthless.

113
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,650
After receiving the letter,

114
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,890
despite your safety,

115
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,690
she still insisted on the sacrifice.

116
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,320
It seems the Holy Envoy

117
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,770
doesn't hold much sway within the Peacock Sect.

118
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,010
I'm just a laborer.

119
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,450
I'm nothing special.

120
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,290
Why would Ruan Jiushu care about me?

121
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,190
So, you see,

122
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,610
kidnapping me is pointless.

123
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,330
We'll have to find another way.

124
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,190
So, Holy Envoy, do you have a plan?

125
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,570
Of course.

126
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,340
It's to use magic to defeat magic.

127
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,610
Creating magic requires this thing.

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,070
[Projection Mirror]

129
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,210
This Projection Mirror is crafted

130
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,170
based on the Sunlight Reflecting Mirror from the Western Han Dynasty.

131
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,140
This mirror is incredibly unique.

132
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,140
Not only can the mirror surface reflect normally,

133
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,830
but when sunlight or parallel light

134
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,659
shines onto the surface of the mirror,

135
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,850
the reflected projection

136
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,020
can perfectly display the patterns on the back of the mirror.

137
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,150
Is this mirror truly that miraculous?

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,180
But what sets it apart

139
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,580
from an ordinary mirror?

140
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,050
That's because behind the mirror,

141
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,330
the areas with patterns are thicker

142
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,760
while the areas without patterns are thinner.

143
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,730
This unevenness in thickness

144
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,690
creates casting stress

145
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,720
and elastic deformation

146
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,200
during mirror polishing.

147
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,330
Therefore, areas with thicker sections have smaller curvature,

148
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,940
while areas with thinner sections have larger curvature.

149
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,860
The difference in curvature corresponds to the patterns.

150
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,260
When light shines onto the mirror surface,

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,270
areas with larger curvature scatter light more,

152
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,220
resulting in darker projections;

153
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,690
while areas with smaller curvature concentrate light more,

154
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,750
resulting in brighter projections.

155
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,809
In this way,

156
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,490
the effect of reflecting the patterns

157
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,750
on the back onto the wall can be achieved.

158
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,810
This kind of feeling, where I feel like I understand every word,

159
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,650
but at the same time, I don't understand anything, has come over me again.

160
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,970
You haven't received nine-year compulsory education.

161
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,250
It's really hard for you

162
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,710
to understand right away.

163
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,650
So, it's extremely difficult to create this mirror.

164
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,580
Holy Envoy, do you have a solution?

165
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,970
The Sunlight Reflecting Mirror

166
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,570
was originally made of bronze.

167
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,340
Unfortunately, its casting method has been lost.

168
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,770
It's indeed almost impossible

169
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,970
to fully replicate it

170
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,670
with our current technology.

171
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,650
However,

172
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,860
if we utilize the same principle

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,740
to first create a glass mirror,

174
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,530
not only will it have better transparency,

175
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,530
but it will also be easier to handle.

176
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,650
Then, we can use the glass mirror

177
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,210
to project a peacock pattern onto the cliff

178
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,850
during the sacrifice ceremony

179
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,860
and then figure out a way to rescue Shen Tong,

180
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,720
creating an illusion of the Peacock God appearing.

181
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,620
Then we can claim that the true form of the Peacock God has descended

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,010
to persuade the people to abandon the sacrifice

183
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,050
and devote themselves to goodness.

184
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,690
Yes.

185
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,510
That's exactly what I mean.

186
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,030
What a "using magic to defeat magic"!

187
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,410
I admire

188
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,120
your ingenious thinking.

189
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,330
These are the powers of knowledge.

190
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,090
Anyway,

191
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,620
we need to divide tasks quickly now.

192
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,370
Hurry up.

193
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,590
Let's begin.

194
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,590
[Cloud Villa]

195
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,940
Lord Li, thank you for your effort.

196
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,510
Thank you, Holy Envoy.

197
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,450
How did you manage to find me this time?

198
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,370
Holy Envoy, do you remember

199
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,690
the necklace I gave you?

200
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,330
Of course.

201
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,020
I'm wearing it right now.

202
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,500
The pollen inside it is toxic to all plants.

203
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,370
Fortunately, you were abducted on a rainy day.

204
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,690
I followed the withered plants

205
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,620
all the way here.

206
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,170
Li Muyang!

207
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,990
You actually poisoned me!

208
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,500
Before, I didn't trust you.

209
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,200
I won't do it again.

210
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,860
Well,

211
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,510
what if

212
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,120
we haven't finished polishing the mirror

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
by the time of the sacrifice?

214
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,520
Don't worry, Holy Envoy.

215
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,630
You will make it.

216
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,060
It's late.

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,350
You don't need to stay with me.

218
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,340
Go rest early.

219
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,580
No.

220
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,520
Every time I think of Shen Tong and Ye

221
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,320
being taken away for sacrifice,

222
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,850
I just can't sleep at all,

223
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,450
and feel really anxious.

224
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,570
Before, when Shen Tong couldn't sleep,

225
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,700
you told him a story.

226
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Now, let me tell you a story, shall I?

227
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,740
I'm not a child.

228
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,220
Once upon a time,

229
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,120
in a distant border town,

230
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,980
lived a pair of brothers.

231
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,650
They lived together with their parents.

232
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,920
Though not wealthy,

233
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,360
they lived happily.

234
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
However, fate took an unexpected turn.

235
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,510
The two brothers were suddenly chosen by the Peacock Sect

236
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,590
to become Holy Sons

237
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,690
and were going to be sacrificed...

238
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,850
Back then,

239
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,910
if there had been someone like you,

240
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,930
would the destinies of we brothers

241
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,130
have been different?

242
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,620
[Cloud Villa]

243
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,450
Tong!

244
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,760
You really made it!

245
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,610
I tried the method you mentioned last night,

246
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,420
and unexpectedly, it worked out.

247
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,810
You're amazing, Li Muyang!

248
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,940
Shen Tong and the other kids will be saved!

249
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,200
They will all be saved!

250
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,320
You're amazing!

251
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,510
It's the auspicious time. Offer the sacrifice!

252
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Why isn't it here yet?

253
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,030
It's the auspicious time.

254
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,130
Let the sacrifice begin!

255
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,370
Who dares

256
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,300
to disrupt the sacrifice?

257
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,430
Look over there!

258
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,130
Look over there!

259
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,580
The true form of the Peacock God

260
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,900
has descended upon the mortal realm

261
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,250
to meet its congregation,

262
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,860
and bestow the divine radiance with blessing.

263
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,720
We will heed your teachings, Peacock God, and keep them in our hearts!

264
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,260
Did it work?

265
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,180
Thank you, Cool Guy.

266
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,620
This glass mirror is really exquisite.

267
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,290
Holy Envoy,

268
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,180
you truly possess quick wit

269
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,250
and know everything.

270
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,970
You are flattering me.

271
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,610
Holy Envoy, you're so capable,

272
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,410
so amazing!

273
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,530
I knew

274
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,490
you would surely find a way to save those children.

275
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,550
My Lord's contributions cannot be overlooked either.

276
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,570
Yes.

277
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,530
This time, Lord Li made a great contribution.

278
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,100
Otherwise, just having my idea would be useless

279
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,490
without anyone to implement them.

280
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,890
This time, the lack of news from your end

281
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,090
was really worrying.

282
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,740
Why didn't you send messages back earlier?

283
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,130
We were afraid that too many people knowing about it would lead to leaks,

284
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,300
and it might cause us trouble.

285
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,900
Yes.

286
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,420
This time, the Moon Pavilion got involved too.

287
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,570
It was indeed complicated with too many people involved.

288
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,500
It was not convenient for us to say.

289
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,490
It turns out that the faction behind the Moon Pavilion

290
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,700
isn't the Flowers Kill.

291
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,740
Of course not.

292
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm telling you,

293
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,140
Cool Guy and his people are really nice.

294
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,670
And they're very handsome.

295
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,860
So, who do you think

296
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,250
is behind the Flowers Kill?

297
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,260
It's...

298
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,460
Young Master, have some tea.

299
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,550
Young Master, have some tea.

300
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,260
We've resolved the sacrifice this time,

301
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,500
and now I have a new idea.

302
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,180
What is it?

303
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,600
That's to provide benefits to everyone.

304
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,810
What's the Peacock Foundation?

305
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,040
And what's the New Policy?

306
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,610
The foundation is easy to explain.

307
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,670
It's an organization to help establish the New Policy.

308
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,240
And as for the New Policy,

309
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,980
it will be implemented in three steps.

310
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,510
Firstly,

311
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,580
establishing schools to promote education.

312
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,020
Secondly, setting up hospitals to ensure health.

313
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,890
Thirdly, establishing a Young Master's Mailbox

314
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,000
to open up channels for expression.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,260
The New Policy mentioned by the Holy Envoy is excellent.

316
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,400
Schools for education

317
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,220
can help the people become literate;

318
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,380
Hospitals with prescriptions

319
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,920
can cure the citizens of the whole city;

320
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,940
Especially the aspect of opening up channels for expression,

321
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,120
which can make Master and Young Master understand public opinion.

322
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,980
In the long run,

323
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,510
the people of Peacock City-State will surely unite and harmonize.

324
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,770
This will lead to political harmony and social stability.

325
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,830
Is what the Holy Envoy said

326
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,830
truly a decree from the Peacock God?

327
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,410
Of course.

328
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,000
The Peacock God appeared on the day of sacrifice.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
You all saw it.

330
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Mother.

331
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm willing to use what I've learned

332
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,220
to assist the Holy Envoy.

333
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,620
I'm also willing to offer my assistance to Young Master Rong.

334
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,420
Master.

335
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,710
I believe

336
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,610
what the Holy Envoy said is extremely reasonable.

337
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,130
With homes, food,

338
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,480
and health care,

339
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,830
the state and the people can be stable.

340
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,100
The establishment of schools

341
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,500
is for nurturing talents

342
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,500
for the future of Peacock City-State;

343
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,930
The opening of channels for expression

344
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,390
is for the unity of the people and the Master.

345
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,420
Master, what do you think?

346
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,890
Alright!

347
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,710
Then let's proceed according to the Holy Envoy.

348
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,200
Lord Li,

349
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,830
[Good Weather for the Crops]

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Thank you so much this time.

351
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,080
If it weren't for you,

352
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,840
Master Rong wouldn't have agreed so easily.

353
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,930
I will always assist you

354
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,250
in seeking the well-being of the people.

355
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,290
Do you really trust me that much?

356
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,069
What I'm saying now

357
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,210
is unprecedented here.

358
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,950
Are you sure I'm right?

359
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,310
Your Excellency, you have an understanding of the natural laws,

360
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,700
and you have also made some achievements in this aspect,

361
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,030
which always amazes me.

362
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,250
What surprised me even more

363
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,380
is that you actually have a heart for the people

364
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,550
and can integrate knowledge with action.

365
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,950
So of course, I trust you.

366
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,350
Let me treat you to a meal.

367
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,550
Miss, which one do you want?

368
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,430
This one, this one, and this one.

369
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,020
Please bring me all of these dishes.

370
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,700
Yes, Miss.
