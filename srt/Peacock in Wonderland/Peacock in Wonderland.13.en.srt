00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,830
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,400
Holy Envoy, slowly.

5
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,160
Please be gentle.

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,520
-Slowly.
-Is this what I can hear?

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,210
Slowly.

8
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:42,840
This is Flowers Oil produced by Guanbuzhu.

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,800
Once applied,

10
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,900
it can unblock all the meridians.

11
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,210
I wouldn't just tell anyone about it.

12
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,030
I'm willing to try it.

13
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,640
Oh no, there's no scar.

14
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,840
This is...

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,900
my first time meeting you.

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,500
I got carried away.

17
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:22,970
I'm leaving.

18
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,280
Please wait a moment, Holy Envoy.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,940
I feel a strong connection with you upon our first meeting.

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,990
Please accept it.

21
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,560
If you ever wish to see me again,

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
just use this.

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,040
Okay.

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,050
As long as you come to me,

25
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll be there.

26
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,430
Greetings, sir.

27
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,650
Have you seen her?

28
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,740
Yes.

29
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,680
I know what are you thinking.

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
But remember,

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,480
don't let your feelings dictate your actions.

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,750
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,640
What a pity.

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,040
I've put in so much effort,

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,370
yet I haven't caught one single assassin.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,910
Weren't you quite enjoying it, Holy Envoy?

37
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,080
Why the pity?

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,640
I wasn't enjoying it.

39
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,720
It was only for investigating the case.

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,360
Exactly.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
It was only for investigating the case.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,100
Let me tell you.

43
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,960
I've already had people secretly observing the Moon Pavilion.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,840
If it's truly the headquarters of the Flowers Kill,

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
they'll definitely slip up.

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,090
Here comes the soup.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,210
Lai.

48
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,660
What soup is it?

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,200
White Fungus and Lotus Seed Soup.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,350
It's my favorite.

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,090
Here.

52
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,220
Serve me a bowl.

53
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,640
-Thank you.
-Here.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,970
Qiang, do you want some?

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,640
Moqian.

56
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,740
Holy Envoy,

57
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,329
didn't you just say you had a stomachache

58
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,430
and wanted to go back?

59
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,520
I didn't say that.

60
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,420
Your Excellency,

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,480
if you want to eat it...

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,470
Lord Li.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,360
Just sit down and have some food. There are so many dishes.

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,900
Come on.

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,130
Stop looking at them.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
Lord Li.

67
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,829
Your Excellency.

68
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,160
We have them all at home.

69
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,899
I haven't finished yet.

70
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,760
-Qiang.
-I haven’t finished yet.

71
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
-Lord Li.
-Bye, Rong Yu.

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,200
My Lord.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
Moqian.

74
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,940
It was my fault that day.

75
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,760
-I...
-Yu.

76
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,620
You don't need to explain.

77
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,540
It was an emergency,

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,600
whoever you chose to save, it was understandable.

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,840
I've long forgotten about

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,170
what happened that day.

81
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,030
You don't need to dwell on it either.

82
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,800
That's good to hear.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,440
I thought you were upset.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,840
Okay.

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,650
As long as it's okay between us.

86
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,210
Why did we leave so soon?

87
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,950
I haven't finished my meal yet.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,620
Your Excellency, couldn't you see

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,750
that they had something to talk about?

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Now that you mention it, it seems so.

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
Young Master Rong wanted to see Moqian several times

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,230
but couldn't.

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,110
She risked her life to save you.

94
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,440
Are you not moved at all?

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,510
Even without her help, I could have dodged that attack.

96
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,040
I didn't need her to save me.

97
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,500
Listen to yourself.

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,060
Do you have a conscience?

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Conscience?

100
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,560
Your Excellency, were you really just giving Qing Jian a massage

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,930
in that room?

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Not just that, of course.

103
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,140
Mr. Qing Jian is gentle and considerate.

104
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,180
We had a delightful conversation.

105
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,560
From being strangers at the beginning,

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,060
we ended up appreciating each other.

107
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,159
It was like we had known each other for ages.

108
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,320
Most importantly,

109
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,909
his

110
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,150
greatest virtue

111
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,590
is sincerity.

112
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,070
Unlike someone,

113
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,710
who lies in both big and small matters

114
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,570
and doesn't speak a word of truth.

115
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,480
Not only that,

116
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,160
he also highly praised my skill

117
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,510
and gave me a gift.

118
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,780
This is the key

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,390
that connects our souls.

120
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,720
What is it made of?

121
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,090
What are you doing?

122
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,120
This is a gift that someone else gave to me!

123
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,620
I'll keep it for you.

124
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,830
The Moon Pavilion is not a place to be taken lightly.

125
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,960
Without my company,

126
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,750
you'd better not go there often, Your Excellency.

127
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,430
The Peacock Sect is just ahead.

128
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,230
Your Excellency, you can go back on your own.

129
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,270
I'll stop here.

130
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,510
How arrogant.

131
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,000
Who do you think you are?

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,310
I must teach you a lesson.

133
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,470
Lai, go.

134
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,580
Maybe next time.

135
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,560
The weather is dry.

136
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,110
Be careful with candles.

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,580
-Grandpa, I’m hungry.
-The weather is dry.

138
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,440
You are hungry?

139
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,010
-Let me get something for you to eat.
-Be careful with candles.

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,560
Baby?

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,950
Baby!

142
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,830
Baby!

143
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,670
Master,

144
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,270
recently, several children in the city have gone missing one after another,

145
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,080
and we don't know if they are still alive.

146
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Bring them in.

147
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,140
Master!

148
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,620
Holy Envoy.

149
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,800
Please, administer justice for us!

150
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,770
Don't worry.

151
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,180
Take your time to explain.

152
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,550
Last night,

153
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,350
I saw my child fall asleep.

154
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,310
But when I woke up,

155
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,320
my child was gone.

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,240
There was only a blood-red flower left on the bed.

157
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,360
These villains.

158
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,670
How dare they!

159
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,100
How dare they kidnap children within Peacock City!

160
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,310
Rest assured.

161
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,230
We will thoroughly investigate this matter

162
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,490
and find the children.

163
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,160
Thank you, Master!

164
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,870
Thank you, Master!

165
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,990
Thank you, Master!

166
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,710
Thank you, Master!

167
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,470
Mother,

168
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,510
I'm afraid it's related to the Flowers Kill.

169
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,270
Rest assured.

170
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,230
Leave this matter to me.

171
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,230
Okay.

172
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,030
Holy Envoy, please investigate with Young Master Rong

173
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,789
and assist her.

174
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,590
Yes.

175
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,190
We haven't found the previous assassins,

176
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,190
and now there are children missing.

177
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Your Flowers Kill has become the scapegoat again.

178
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,470
It's "our" Flowers Kill.

179
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,310
Holy Envoy, you're also a member of the Flowers Kill now.

180
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,370
Don't forget that.

181
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,320
How could you say that?

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,830
Before I joined,

183
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,070
the Flowers Kill was a feared, cool

184
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,580
and mysterious organization.

185
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,320
Why did it become a scapegoat after I joined in?

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,920
Maybe we should rename it to "Scapegoat Kill".

187
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,630
The Flowers Kill has too many enemies.

188
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,430
I'd like to resign again.

189
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,000
If you don't say anything, Lord Li,

190
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,290
I'll take that as a yes.

191
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,190
Your Excellency, don't you know

192
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,050
that people who don't keep their word will have their tongues cut out?

193
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,950
Now you're also one of the scapegoats

194
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,080
in the Flowers Kill.

195
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,210
You can't run away.

196
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,310
Help!

197
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,150
Help me!

198
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,400
Help!

199
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,750
Help!

200
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,830
Somebody help me!

201
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,190
-Stop!
-Stop, Qiang!

202
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,900
What’s wrong?

203
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
-Wait for me in the car.
-Help! Help!

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,940
Help me.

205
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,310
There are bad guys over there chasing me.

206
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,910
Qiang,

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,710
go and see what happened.

208
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,310
Yes.

209
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,160
Don't be afraid.

210
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,830
Shen Tong?

211
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,550
[Li's Mansion]

212
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,700
Where are we?

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,550
This is Brother Li's home.

214
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,400
Don't worry.

215
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,270
There won't be any bad guys here.

216
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,110
Tong.

217
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,390
Have you clearly seen

218
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,990
what the villain looks like?

219
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,350
I don't remember.

220
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,120
When did you two have a child?

221
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,390
Father,

222
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,230
this child...

223
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,090
Since you already have a de facto marriage,

224
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,270
and your child is already this big,

225
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,000
why bother hiding it from me?

226
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,970
We didn't...

227
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,140
Holy Envoy,

228
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,700
although Muyang is your man now,

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
etiquette must be observed.

230
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,310
You still need to fulfill the marriage ceremony.

231
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,830
Uncle Li, don't worry.

232
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,670
I

233
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,950
will definitely marry Lord Li with the highest ceremony.

234
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,950
Lord Li, remember get on the bridal sedan obediently.

235
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,270
Your Excellency,

236
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,660
it concerns my virtue.

237
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,190
You can't...

238
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,920
I am doing this for your virtue.

239
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,350
Uncle Li, see?

240
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,280
Lord Li doesn't want to marry me.

241
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,580
Son, you are so foolish.

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,540
The Holy Envoy has agreed.

243
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,790
Why don't you say yes instantly?

244
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,420
This is...

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,720
It's not the time for you to be reserved.

246
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
He's not your grandson!

247
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,350
He's not your grandson.

248
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,230
Grandpa.

249
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,060
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

250
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,450
You are hungry?

251
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,200
Let me prepare you something to eat now.

252
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,960
Let's go.

253
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,770
He's so close to me when he calls me Grandpa.

254
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,530
But you don't even want to admit that he is your son.

255
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,170
Let's go.

256
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,910
Your Excellency.

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,930
Marriage is not a trifling matter.

258
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,590
It might be a joke to you, but to others, it may not.

259
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,910
If someone listened

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,220
and believed it...

261
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,160
Who would believe that?

262
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Do you believe it?

263
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,700
Of course, I don't believe it.

264
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,810
Don't worry.

265
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,190
I will never marry you,

266
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,670
Lord Li.

267
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,870
Chief,

268
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,250
what do you need me for?

269
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,190
Lately, you've been absent from the sect every day.

270
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,430
It's inappropriate.

271
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,400
I've been investigating

272
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
the trafficking case recently.

273
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,720
You are the Holy Envoy.

274
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,600
You have your own responsibilities.

275
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,400
How can you be busy investigating cases every day?

276
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,930
Though it's a task entrusted by Master Rong,

277
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,910
you can occasionally cooperate.

278
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,360
There's no need to take it seriously.

279
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,990
Tomorrow,

280
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,990
you go and tender your resignation to Young Master Rong.

281
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,520
Tendering my resignation?

282
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,190
I can't do that.

283
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,330
We haven't found the children yet.

284
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,710
Besides,

285
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,390
isn't it in our doctrine

286
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,510
that we should benefit the people?

287
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,880
Why are we turning a blind eye

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
and standing idly by now?

289
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,810
I'm not asking you to stand idly by.

290
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,190
But things need to be prioritized.

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,550
You are the Holy Envoy of our sect,

292
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,280
naturally, you have your own responsibilities.

293
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,230
Holy Envoy.

294
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,040
Come here.

295
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:32,970
Holy Envoy.

296
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,190
Although you've recently descended to this world,

297
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,770
you prayed for rain

298
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,260
and care about the people.

299
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,030
I highly praise that.

300
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,600
However, since you've been in the sect for a short time

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,250
and are not yet familiar with the affairs of the sect,

302
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,310
it's not appropriate for me to entrust you with heavy responsibilities.

303
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,060
In the future, as you become more experienced in handling matters,

304
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,950
you will have the ability to serve as the Deputy Chief.

305
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,470
When the time is ripe,

306
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,630
even the position of the Chief

307
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,830
will be yours.

308
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,060
Thank you for your appreciation, Chief.

309
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,230
Rest assured.

310
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
Once I find those children,

311
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,220
I will definitely strive to bring glory to our sect.

312
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,600
[Missing Person Notice]

313
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,880
These missing children all have several commonalities:

314
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,830
regardless of their wealth, they are all boys,

315
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,710
and similar in age to Shen Tong,

316
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
ranging from eight to ten years old.

317
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,870
Although they were born in different years,

318
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,790
their birthdays are all in this month.

319
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,230
Shen Tong mentioned before

320
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,790
that he entered the city to celebrate his birthday.

321
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,990
Now, with such tight security,

322
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,360
how dare these traffickers commit crimes?

323
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,470
Are they trying to meet some performance indicators?

324
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,130
They must have been selected.

325
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,210
It's definitely not as simple as human trafficking.

326
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,560
I sent people to investigate several times before,

327
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,270
but still haven't found any trace.

328
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,530
They are very cunning,

329
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,270
seemingly having realized that we would take action,

330
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,130
so suddenly there's no movement.

331
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,830
If this continues,

332
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,550
who knows how many more children will suffer.

333
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,750
Since we can't find them now,

334
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
let's make them come to us.

335
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,460
Let's play along with their trick

336
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,510
to lure them out, how about it?

337
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
Do you mean

338
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,000
using a child as bait

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,930
to lure them out?

340
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
This is too risky.

341
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,440
Where can we borrow a child?

342
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,270
And whose parents would be willing to lend one?

343
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,330
-Yeah.
-I can do it.

344
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,790
I can be the bait.

345
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,630
No.

346
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,860
You're so young.

347
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,410
How can we put you in danger?

348
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,730
Besides, your parents aren't around.

349
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,980
We can't make the decision for them.

350
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,940
I'm not young.

351
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,110
I'm already 8 years old.

352
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,440
And I'm smart.

353
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm sure I can help you catch those bad people.

354
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,140
Tong,

355
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,770
are you really not afraid?

356
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,010
I'm not afraid.

357
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,670
Brother Li is so capable.

358
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,750
If there's any danger, he will definitely protect me.

359
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,360
If I'm with him all the time,

360
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,950
it should be fine.

361
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,600
Well,

362
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,120
you two really look like father and son.

363
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,670
Right?

364
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,710
If so,

365
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,250
I'll be your father.

366
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,510
Okay.

367
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,880
I'll pretend to be your mom.

368
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,230
Young Master,

369
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,830
you should be in charge of the whole thing from behind the scenes.

370
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,110
It's not convenient for you to show up.

371
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,150
Why is that?

372
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,520
Who in this city doesn't know who you are?

373
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,920
That makes sense.

374
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,750
Well,

375
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,320
Sister Holy Envoy can be my mom.

376
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
