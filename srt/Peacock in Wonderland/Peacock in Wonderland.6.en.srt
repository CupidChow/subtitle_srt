[Episode 6]

4
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,820
It's inappropriate for men and women to touch each other.

5
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,930
We're close friends. Don't mind that.

6
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,190
Let me tie it up for you.

7
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,390
Young Master, it's okay.

8
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,050
Come on, let me tie it up for you.

9
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,110
I'm very ticklish.

10
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,520
-No need to be so polite with me.
-Young Master.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,320
Young Master.

12
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,460
Come on. It's okay.

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,759
-Let me help you.
-I'm ticklish, Young Master.

14
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,020
No need, Young Master.

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Don't touch his waist.

16
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,300
Young Master.

17
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,979
I'm ticklish.

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,700
What is this?

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,940
There are flowers.

20
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,949
If you make clothes with this, they will look good.

21
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,680
Look at this.

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,050
Send those things back to Li's Mansion.

23
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,050
Yes.

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,530
It's colorful.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,290
It suits you.

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,860
Look over there.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,320
When it gets dark,

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
let's go to Mingding Mountain.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,329
I've prepared good wine and dishes.

30
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,400
We can drink while looking at the moon.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Isn't that great?

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,120
I must go home at five o'clock.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,800
It's okay.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,290
I'll send someone to inform your mansion.

37
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,850
Young Master.

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,410
I have to go to the toilet.

39
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,160
Excuse me.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
Young Master,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
we...

43
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,850
What? Do you even go to the toilet together?

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,130
Is it convenient?

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,800
Wait for us.

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,300
There's no toilet over there.

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,810
Holy Envoy?

48
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,460
Muyang?

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,560
Didn't you need to use the bathroom?

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Hide first.

51
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,910
What are you doing?

52
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,260
Muyang.

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,920
Holy Envoy.

54
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,000
Where are they?

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,000
There's no toilet here.

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,170
Muyang.

57
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,350
I can strangle her

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
with a little force.

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Unfortunately, our lives are connected now.

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
I can't do it yet.

61
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,630
Why are you doing this?

62
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,920
Don't you want to go to Mingding Mountain at night?

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,810
It's been a long day.

64
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,880
Aren't you tired?

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm just a third wheel.

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,370
How could I be tired?

67
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,790
Besides,

68
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,720
I think today is quite fulfilling.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,980
I've gained a lot

70
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,000
and returned with loads.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,330
Holy Envoy, do you think it's a good thing?

72
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,170
Of course it is.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Young Master is noble

74
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,570
and very beautiful.

75
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,840
Most importantly, she's very generous to you.

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,010
If she were a man,

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
I'd marry her.

78
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,690
Young Master Rong and I are just friends.

79
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,560
Nothing else.

80
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,960
Let go of me!

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,190
Let go of me! Who are you?

82
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,450
Put me down!

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,810
How can it be the same as in my dream?

84
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,470
Dreams have become a reality.

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,740
Is this a coincidence,

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,409
or did someone do it on purpose?

87
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,490
He is highly skilled in martial arts

88
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,150
and killed him straight away.

89
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,020
Are you sure it was Li Muyang?

90
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,050
100 percent sure.

91
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,200
When the Red-tailed Bugs are planted in two people's bodies,

92
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,060
there will be a life and death link within 10 meters.

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,130
In this case,

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,400
they must have been planted a Red-tailed Bug each.

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,880
That's why she didn't die.

96
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,710
A carefully bedded flower may not blossom,

97
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,770
while a casually planted willow may grow into a big one.

98
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,200
Let's see how long you can be this swollen with arrogance.

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,760
There are more choices here.

101
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,640
Is there a big promotion at Guanbuzhu today?

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
There are so many people.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
The people in the city will come and buy bouquets of flowers

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
as a gift for each other.

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,840
It's to pray for good weather and prosperity next year.

106
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,470
-What do you need?
-This.

107
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,400
-This?
-Wrap it up for me.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,460
Okay, here you are.

109
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,280
Tonight,

110
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,530
not only can we enjoy lanterns, tour the Flower Fair,

111
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,530
and hang the prayer cards,

112
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,460
but there's also

113
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,930
a ceremony for choosing the Man of Harvest.

114
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,680
Really?

115
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,340
Muyang,

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,970
take the Holy Envoy there and have fun tonight.

117
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,250
Father,

118
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,850
you are really confused.

119
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,810
The Holy Envoy has an important task tonight.

120
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,360
She has no time to play with us.

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
What task? Why didn't I know?

122
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Your Excellency,

123
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,120
you must award the Man of Harvest tonight.

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,840
Chief asks you to go back and prepare for it.

125
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,700
Do I really need to work overtime?

126
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,840
One for Muyang and one for me.

127
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,400
Moqian!

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,810
Yu.

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Tonight's the harvest festival.

130
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,970
Would you like to go with me, Yu?

131
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,570
Good.

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,400
I was about to go with Muyang.

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,680
The three of us can celebrate the festival together.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,280
Yu.

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,290
The Holy Envoy must attend the ceremony

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,890
to reward the Man of Harvest.

137
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm afraid Muyang won't be available.

138
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,010
In that case,

139
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,430
we two will celebrate it together tonight.

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,370
Unfortunately,

141
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,290
Muyang is not here tonight.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,800
May Muyang and I get married

143
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,700
and grow old together.

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,250
Moqian, what did you write?

145
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,090
Let me see.

146
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,380
Once the wish is made public,

147
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,440
it won't come true.

148
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Fine.

149
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,970
Hurry up. The ceremony is about to begin.

150
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,540
Okay.

151
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,120
The ceremony is about to begin.

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
Let's hurry.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Okay.

154
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,100
[May Muyang and I get married and grow old together]

155
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,030
Moqian, come on.

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,850
The ceremony is about to begin.

157
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Your Excellency.

158
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,060
The ceremony is about to begin.

159
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,040
Your Excellency, the auspicious time is almost up.

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,230
Let's go.

161
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,850
-Hurry, Your Excellency. You'll be late if you keep delaying.
-Please hurry up, Your Excellency.

162
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,490
Your Excellency!

163
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,030
-Your Excellency, please remember…
-What's wrong?

164
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,610
After the competition,

165
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,850
you must give the chosen Man of Harvest

166
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,310
the colored glaze flower…

167
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,840
bowl…

168
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,680
We had a good harvest year.

169
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,210
Peacock God has blessed us.

170
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,310
To celebrate the harvest in our city-state,

171
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,300
we'll select the Man of Harvest at the ceremony

172
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,880
to receive the gift from the Holy Envoy.

173
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,640
How is the Man of Harvest selected?

174
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,900
The Man of Harvest has always been a male.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,440
The people of the city volunteered to perform on stage.

176
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,690
And the audience will select whoever they like by giving him the flowers.

177
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,040
The one who gets the most flowers

178
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,970
will be that year's Man of Harvest.

179
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,540
What should I give to the winner?

180
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,720
Your Excellency, please remember after the competition,

181
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
you must give the chosen Man of Harvest

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,260
the colored glaze flower…

183
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,540
The colored glaze flower…

184
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,210
Flower kiss?

185
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,650
Do I have to kiss him?

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,100
Greetings, Your Excellency.

187
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,150
My name is Hao Jun.

188
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,430
I'm here to run for the Man of Harvest.

189
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,430
You don't need to bow.

190
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,530
Please start your performance as soon as possible.

191
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,960
If a man can learn the martial arts so well,

192
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
he should be praised.

193
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,170
Yes.

194
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,490
Bravo!

195
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,440
Do you like it, Holy Envoy?

196
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,750
Your skill is indeed excellent.

197
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
It's just…

198
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,670
it doesn't seem practical.

199
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,040
You can't cut the wheat with that, can you?

200
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Well…

201
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,440
When I was young,

202
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,020
my parents passed away.

203
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,890
And my elder brother also passed away due to illness.

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,410
There was no one at home.

205
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,400
I lived on a few acres of land.

206
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,530
When I'm free,

207
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,470
I practiced this skill diligently

208
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,090
because I still have regrets in my life,

209
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,160
which are to become the Man of Harvest

210
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,940
and make our family proud.

211
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,910
Why is there also a sad-fishing part?

212
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,200
Please participate.

213
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,430
Don't be shy.

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,120
Is there anyone else?

215
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
If no one else cares about the competition,

216
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,080
then we'll count the flowers

217
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,940
and decide the Man of Harvest.

218
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,800
My goodness.

219
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,280
Is this how my first kiss ends?

220
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,540
Why are you so anxious, Holy Envoy?

221
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,120
Do you not want this man to be the Man of Harvest?

222
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Of course not.

223
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,930
As you wish, then.

224
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,400
Hao Jun is very skilled.

225
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,280
You look frail. Can you do it?

226
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,680
Don't worry, Holy Envoy.

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I am not talented,

228
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
but I also want to participate.

229
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,320
Lord Li wants to participate. Lord Li.

230
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,690
It's Lord Li.

231
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,820
Assistant Minister of Rites?

232
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,880
He finally begins to understand things.

233
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,860
He's been hiding his qin skills for so many years.

234
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
He's finally willing to show it.

235
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,690
Muyang is still the same.

236
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,100
He's bright and pure,

237
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,950
like the moon that rises every night.

238
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,080
Bravo!

239
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,050
Lord Li.

240
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,650
Give him flowers! Give him flowers!

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Give him flowers!

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,920
Give him flowers! Give him flowers!

243
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,620
This year's Man of Harvest

244
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
will be Minister Li Muyang.

245
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,600
Please give him the gift, Holy Envoy.

246
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,460
Great.

247
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,600
Lord Li. Lord Li. Lord Li.

248
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,960
Great!

249
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,420
Thank you, Holy Envoy, for your gift.

250
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,880
Now that he's Timid Boy,

251
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,360
I'll just give him my first kiss.

252
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm sorry for this.

253
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,120
But it's okay.

254
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,770
Just close your eyes

255
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
and bear with it. It'll be over soon.

256
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Holy Envoy, what are you going to do?

257
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,380
The Holy Envoy is so cute.

258
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,010
Holy Envoy, please give him the bowl.

259
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,780
Colored glaze flower… bowl?

260
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,760
You can die,

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,540
but social death is more horrible.

262
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,660
Hua Ni!

263
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,690
What kind of rubbish

264
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,170
is in your head?

265
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Your Excellency.

266
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,710
Walk more slowly,

267
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,570
or it will hurt.

268
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,770
Your Excellency.

269
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,170
Did you take tonight's incident to heart?

270
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,270
No.

271
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,500
I misheard it.

272
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,470
It's good that you don't care.

273
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,640
It's normal for people to mishear.
