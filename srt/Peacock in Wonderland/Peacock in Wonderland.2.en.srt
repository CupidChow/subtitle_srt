The butterflies flutter friskily, and the flowers sway gently.

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Their red and white colors make for a motley scene.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,520
Why don't we call this scent "Red and White"?

Red... Red and White?

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,630
This flower is so strange.

13
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,480
It has no root,

14
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,910
but it has no sign of withering whatsoever.

15
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,190
Isn't this the flower I gave the Master?

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,150
The Master left it with me

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,760
and asked me to cultivate it for her.

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,310
This is an immortal flower.

19

Well...

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,910
You don't need to water or fertilize it.

21
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,970
You can just leave it there. It will always be blooming.

22

Why not?

26
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,600
This is the magical flower I brought from the sky.

30

I don't know much about the laws of nature,

31
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,120

32

I think you're right, Lord Li.

People all say you are knowledgeable.

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,610
I didn't expect that you wanted to pursue science.

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,829
It's indeed praiseworthy.

39
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm just a minor florist.

Now that you mention it,

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,150
I really should start to prepare for it.

which cabinet is it?

189
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,960
Lord Li?

190
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,940
Lord Li.

191
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,000
I am a little night-blind.

192
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,700
I...

193
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,030
I can't see clearly.

194
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,560
Lord Li?

195
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,250
Where are you?

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Don't scare me.

197
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm night-blind. I can't see clearly.

198
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,450
She really doesn't know martial arts?

199
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,290
Lord Li.

200
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm here.

201
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,630
My Lord, did you find anything?

202
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
She doesn't know martial arts.

203
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,130
But you are so strange, My Lord.

204
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,400
You asked me to make a star lamp for her

205
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,950
and decorate her room.

206
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,540
Are you into her?

207
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,860
It's because this person has an unknown background.

208
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,390
We need to be more cautious.

209
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,800
We'll check again at midnight.

210
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,660
I can't sleep.

211
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,870
I miss my phone,

212
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,380
iPad,

213
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
and computer.

214
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,850
I can't sleep.

215
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,800
How can I live without you?

216
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,270
My Lord.

217
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,670
Smells so good.

218
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,950
Get down to business.

219
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,030
These are glasses.

220
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,740
Nothing else?

221
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,830
Make the bundle the way it was before.

222
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,180
My Lord,

223
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
why are you carving these on such a fine glass?

224
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,810
What's the meaning of these lines?

225
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,260
Maybe it's a kind of scale.

226
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,670
What does it have to do with rain-praying?

227
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
We don't know yet.

228
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,950
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.

229
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,430
If she can't pray for rain,

230
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,170
then she's deceived the Master

231
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,930
She'll be sentenced to death.

232
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,550
[Countdown to Rain-praying: One day]

233
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,660
Did you sleep well last night, Your Excellency?

234
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,420
Not bad.

235
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,820
I just have a stiff neck.

236
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,880
My neck hurts a bit.

237
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,160
My Lord.

238
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,570
My Lords!

239
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,110
My Lords!

240
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,840
Lai's here to greet you.

241
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,640
It's you. Why are you here?

242
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,600
My mother said

243
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,300
you have paid the betrothal money,

244
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,980
so I will be yours.

245
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,670
I should repay you

246
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,100
for saving my life with myself.

247
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,300
No.

248
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,730
You don't have to bow to me

249
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,190
or repay me with yourself.

250
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,870
I saved you just to give you freedom.

251
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,920
From now on,

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,120
you can go anywhere you want.

253
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,230
But…

254
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,180
even if I go home,

255
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,460
Mother will still marry me to someone else.

256
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,350
A drop of water should be repaid with a spring.

257
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,420
Please don't dislike me.

258
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,460
I can do anything.

259
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,970
It's up to you, Holy Envoy.

260
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,840
What? Let me decide?

261
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,880
Don't regret it later.

262
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,830
Did you bring money with you?

263
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,120
I don't have any money.

264
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,750
It's okay. Let's make money together.

265
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,350
Let's go.

266
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,810
Wait for us!

267
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,490
[On the day of rain-praying]

268
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,620
Those are just some dirty little tricks.

269
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
And she even wanted Chief to come here in person.

270
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,590
What a joke.

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,790
If it doesn't rain,

272
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,320
you will die today.

273
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,240
Holy Envoy,

274
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,390
why does the rain-praying ceremony

275
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,990
have to be in such a remote place?

276
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,780
After counting on my fingers,

277
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,790
I found Fengnian Village a good place,

278
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,600
and the Peacock God will bless it.

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,060
It will rain heavily here.

280
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,810
Rain-praying is an important ritual for the Peacock Sect.

281
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,610
Why didn't Chief show up?

282
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,380
Master,

283
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,440
Chief caught a cold last night

284
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
and didn't feel well,

285
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,460
so she can't make it here today.

286
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,500
In that case,

287
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,410
begin the ceremony now.

288
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,330
God bless the people.

289
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,010
We enshrine and worship the God.

290
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,170
Unfortunately, there is a drought.

291
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,640
The rains have been rare.

292
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,610
I pray to God today

293
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,890
for…

294
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,490
for wind and rain for us.

295
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,810
We'll repay your kindness

296
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,050
and never forget it.

297
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,490
Here we're offering sacrifices to show our respect.

298
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,150
Hope there will be a response.

299
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
I've never seen such a big scene.

300
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,930
Master,

301
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,010
this woman passed herself off as the Holy Envoy and played tricks.

302
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,170
She must be a villain sent by Flowers Kill.

303
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,370
She should be executed immediately.
