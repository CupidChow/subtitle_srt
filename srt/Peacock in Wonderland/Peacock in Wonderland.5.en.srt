[Patterns Made with Yanlan Silk]

6
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,700
I was inspired by the pattern of the sky lanterns.

7
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,979
I'm gonna use Yanlan Silk to make the lampshade

8
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,430
and tighten the bottom with strings

9
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,830
so that the flower pot can be put in it.

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,920
What is Yanlan Silk?

11
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,180
It's made from the silk cocoon.

12
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,340
It's a kind of cloth that is thin, strong,

13
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,600
and pervious to light.

14
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,380
You need to add some Frost Stone Powder

15
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,190
and mix them

16
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,150
when you're boiling the cocoons.

17
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,940
However,

18
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,430
I've read all the ancient books,

19
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,230
but I couldn't find out what Frost Stone Powder is.

20
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,390
Frost Stone Powder?

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,220
Isn't it just a thin film of silk?

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
If we want to make a thin film of silk,

23
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,490
we need to add soda ash.

24
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,860
What is soda ash?

25
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,930
And how to get it?

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,300
Isn't that just my specialty?

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,700
As long as we mix the plant ash with water

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,190
in a ratio of 3: 7

29
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,170
and leave it there for a whole night,

30
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,970
we can get the soda ash solution.

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,620
According to ancient records,

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,670
when making Yanlan Silk,

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,380
we need to put the cocoons in boiling water

34
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,980
and then stir it forcefully.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,740
It turns out the soda ash is the Frost Stone Powder!

36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,210
Yes.

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,990
By the way,

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,320
we need to mix it quickly.

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,700
Theoretically speaking,

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,900
we should use a centrifuge

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,700
to remove the solid impurities.

42
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,579
But there are no centrifuges now.

43
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,240
Let me do it.

44
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,860
Is this really the speed and strength that humans can reach?

45
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,770
Moqian has been doing this since he was young.

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,780
Naturally, his wrist strength is much stronger than others.

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,910
Don't be surprised.

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,829
It's done.

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,210
Now we just need to wait for it to dry in the shade.

50
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,940
All these years,

51
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,670
I've been thinking about how to make Yanlan Silk.

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,160
Thanks to the Holy Envoy, I finally got what I always wanted.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,950
No, no, no.

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,790
All I did was just talk.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,500
Your skills are

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,970
what made it come true.

57
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,690
Moqian is a cold person.

58
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,490
He rarely praises someone like that.

59
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,470
Now that I think about it,

60
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,560
the Holy Envoy really gets along with Moqian.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm honored to be friends

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,079
with some heavyweight like Mr. Du.

63
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,000
Great.

64
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,700
Mr. Du,

65
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,260
your craftsmanship is really amazing.

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,590

67
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,710
it will bloom soon.

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,570
I found that this Frost Stone Powder

69
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,300
can not only produce Yanlan Silk

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,290
but can also fix the color of the cloth.

71
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,620
It's really fantastic.

72
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,100
The soda ash can even make noodles.

73
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,830
Mr. Du, you can try it next time.

74
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,640
Holy Envoy, you've solved my problems for many years.

75
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,790

Mr. Du, you are so good at it.

78
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,220

and that she traveled around to find the solution to the drought in Peacock City-State.

It's not your fault.

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,940
It was too late last night.

177
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,380
I thought Mother must have gone to bed.

178
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,510
That's why I didn't come and bother you.

180
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,940
Of course.

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,460
My love for you is not in vain.

189
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,020
Mother,

190
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,440
I've brought you a gift

191
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,620
from my study trip.

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,740
Bring it here.

193
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,420
Is your gift

194
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,490
only an insignificant stone?

195
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,910
I heard

196
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,190
that you gave somebody Snow Lotus.

197
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,900
Mother,

198
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,260
this is not an ordinary stone.

199
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,540
It's actually a piece of good jade.

200
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Only if you like it

201
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,100
can it be called good jade.

202
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,070
What I'm truly happy about

203
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,810
is that you can return safely.

204
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,560
Promise me

205
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,890
that you won't leave again.

206
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,580
Stay here with me.

207
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,660
Even if you let me go,

208
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,700
I won't leave.

209
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,630
Mother,

210
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,270
are you investigating Flowers Kill?

211
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,570
Flowers Kill is rampant.

212
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,600
Not only did they ruin the ceremony of the Peacock Sect,

213
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,290
but also attempted to assassinate the Chief.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,240
The Peacock Sect urged me to investigate this case both publicly and secretly.

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,720
But I couldn't find anything.

216
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,120
Chief!

217
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,460
Now that you are back,

218
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
would you like to find them?

219
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,320
I will bring the outlaws to justice.

220
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Will she wake up?

221
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,560
The evening primrose beside her bed

222
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,360
plus the Cangqu in her necklace…

223
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,730
This is made from the pollen of Cangqu.

224
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,490
It's conducive to sleep and nerve-calming.

225
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,190
You're very thoughtful, Lord Li.

226
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,250
These two scents mixed together

227
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,680
will make people fall fast asleep.

228
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,160
It's enough for her to sleep for 10 hours.

229
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,070
Don't worry.

230
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,130
Now that you're connected by the Red-tailed Bugs,

231
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,600
not only can we not harm her,

232
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,660
but we also have to be on guard against her and avoid her.

233
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,120
My Lord,

234
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,960
she's hypnotized by evening primrose and Cangqu.

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,460
Will you be affected, too?

236
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
If I knew it would be so troublesome,

237
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,440
I should have killed her that day.

238
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Stop the operation of Flowers Kill.

239
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
As for this woman,

240
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,430
find out

241
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
who planted the Red-tailed Bug in her.

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,510
Yes.

243
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,100
Lord Li, you're awake.

244
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,290
What kind of dream did you have?

245
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,290
You're blushing.

246
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,320
Share it with me.

247
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,970
You're not friendly at all.

248
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,430
Get up.

249
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,680
Didn't we agree to go to Tianxiang Restaurant?

250
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,480
Look, I've already changed my clothes.

251
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,610
I'm waiting for you.

252
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,520
Get up.

253
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,360
Get up!

254
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,880
Get up.

255
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,880
Slow down. It hurts.

256
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,950
It hurts.

257
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,760
Muyang.

258
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,520
The weather is so nice today.

259
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,120
I...

260
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Muyang.

261
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,920
Look. Today I…

262
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,230
Young Master, sorry to keep you waiting.

263
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,630
Muyang, you're...

264
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,240
I'm really sorry.

265
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,430
I don't want to be the third wheel.

266
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,900
But you know about

267
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,000
the special situation between us.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
We really can't be apart for now.

269
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,400
It's okay.

270
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,280
Since you're here,

271
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
let's play together.

272
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,650
Holy Envoy, order whatever you want.

273
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,310
It's my treat today.

274
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:33,880
Really?

275
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,960
Can I really order anything?

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,310
I feel overwhelmed.

277
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,360
Boss.

278
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,080
Young Master,

279
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,800
we recently had a new batch coming in.

280
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,440
Please take a look.

281
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,840
Okay.

282
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,570
Muyang, take a look.

283
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Is there anything you like?

284
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,680
Young Master Rong, there really isn't.

285
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,340
Stop squandering your money.

286
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,070
Boss,

287
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,120
pack all the men's clothes in your shop.

288
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,880
Okay.

289
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
Young Master.

290
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
He said no.

291
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,820
He doesn't like any now,

292
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
but that doesn't mean he won't like them in the future.

293
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,960
Holy Envoy.

294
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,160
How much does it cost to buy

295
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,070
all the men's clothes in the store?

296
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,190
About 300 taels.

297
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,880
Alright.

298
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,440
You can put it on Guanbuzhu at the end of the street.

299
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,840
Okay.

300
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,560
Let me tell you.

301
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,800
Every time I brought Muyang to buy the clothes at this shop,

302
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,790
he said he didn't want them,

303
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,990
but he actually liked them very much.

304
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,190
All men are like that.

305
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,510
What do you think? Do you like anything?

306
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,720
I...

307
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,240
Boss,

308
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,830
pack all the women's clothes

309
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,760
in your shop.

310
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,910
-Okay.
-Young Master.

311
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,370
You are my dearest sister.

312
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
This, this, this.

313
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,330
Pack them all for me.

314
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,570
Is that okay?

315
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,590
Of course.

316
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,620
Then you come and choose one, too.

317
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,390
I think this suits you.

318
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,090
Me too.

319
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,250
The color is bright.

320
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,180
This one suits you.

321
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,420
I prefer light colors.

322
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,260
-Put it on Young Master instead.
-What about this one?

323
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,910
Okay.

324
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,850
Good.

325
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,680
We'll look good in red and green.

326
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Pretty.

327
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,380
Be careful.

328
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,960
Look at the lake.

329
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
The view is great.

330
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,990
Muyang,

331
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
Look how well this sword suits you.

332
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,540
It's a soft sword,

333
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,690
but it's very sharp.

334
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,390
Young Master, I'm not good at swordsmanship.

335
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,250
Thanks, but no.

336
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,030
I made this hairpin myself.

337
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,120
Try it on

338
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,600
and see if it's suitable.

339
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
Young Master.

340
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,110
I don't wear a hairpin.

341
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,400
Why don't you ask Moqian?

342
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,270
There's no need to be so polite between us.

343
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,600
A beautiful couple in a beautiful place with lakes and mountains.

344
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
It's so romantic.

345
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,400
Come to think of it,

346
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,140
they are really a perfect match.

347
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,380
They're so sweet.

348
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Muyang.

349
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,140
Don't catch a cold.

350
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Young Master,

351
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,910
I'm not cold.

352
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
It's windy by the lake.

353
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,220
Your hands are cold.

354
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,130
-How can you be not cold?
-Young Master.
