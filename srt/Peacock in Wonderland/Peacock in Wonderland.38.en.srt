Mr. Du,

188
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,560
Flowers Kill is mourning you with flowers.

189
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,910
May your path be filled with the fragrance of flowers.

190
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,230
Moqian,

191
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,430
I know

192
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,520
you are still accompanying me.

193
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,040
Sir,

194
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,030
I received news from the city.

195
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,890
Master Rong has regained her consciousness.

196
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,700
Du Moqian is dead.

197
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,110
He's affectionate.

198
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,920
Sir,

199
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,430
since Master Rong has regained her consciousness,

200
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm afraid she'll strike back.

201
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,370
The remaining poison has been cleared.

202
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,220
It's time for the show to begin.

203
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,230
Go get ready.

204
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,040
Yes.

205
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
[The formula of gunpowder: 75 taels of saltpetre, 10 taels of sulphur, and 15 taels of charcoal]

206
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,230
The wind is rising.

207
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,220
The wind is rising.

208
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,350
Chen Mo colluded with the enemy, betrayed the city-state,

209
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,750
and started a rebellion.

210
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,270
Hunt him immediately.

211
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,670
His accomplices

212
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,819
shall be punished too.

213
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,390
Yes, Master.

214
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,359
Regarding the Golden Pill, you were framed by the villains.

215
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,650
You can be set free.

216
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,310
Master, you are wise.

217
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,829
Our sect is devoted to serving God and is loyal to our master.

218
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,030
We have no ulterior motives.

219
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,829
He Huan used his power to do evil.

220
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,950
I failed to see his true colors.

221
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,150
I should be punished.

222
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,030
Indeed, Peacock Sect should reflect on itself.

223
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,330
The heart of serving God should be sacred and pure.

224
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,980
The desires in the capital are rampant.

225
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,330
It's easy to disturb your sacred heart.

226
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,070
In this case,

227
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
after the Lantern Festival,

228
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,630
you should move out of the capital

229
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,080
and establish your sect at Mount Yanque

230
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,680
in the southernmost part of Peacock City-State.

231
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,410
Master,

232
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,140
if so, who will be in charge of the affairs

233
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,200
and sacrificial ceremonies in the future?

234
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,360
The officials will take care of the affairs in the city.

235
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,030
The Ministry of Rites will be in charge of the sacrificial ceremonies.

236
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,440
Chief, don't worry.

237
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,010
Yes, Master.
