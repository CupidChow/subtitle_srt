[Li's Mansion]

5
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,590
With the evening primrose,

6
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,050
she should be fast asleep.

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,539
Muyang.

8
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,670
It's not your style to show off in public.

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,580
I don't know why.

10
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,880
Are you going to say

11
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,270
that you couldn't help it

12
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,729
or you had no choice again?

13
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,800
What do you mean?

14
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,630
Ever since she appeared,

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,150
she has been appearing in my dreams lately.

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,150
The strange thing is that those dreams

17
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,550
all came true in reality.

18
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,300
Maybe you've been overthinking

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,530
and blurred the lines between your dreams and reality?

20
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,230
Not only that.

21
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,280
Since this woman appeared,

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,940
I've often found that

23
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,390
my body was faster than my mind.

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,180
I often do some inexplicable things

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,860
that even make me surprised.

26
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,470
Do you like her?

27
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,550
Right? I think so, too.

28
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,370
How many times have I told you?

29
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,120
It's absolutely impossible.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,320
This woman has a suspicious identity and acts cunningly.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,460
If we weren't linked the Red-tailed Bugs,

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,790
I would have killed her.

33
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,380
You're right.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,750
As the saying goes, your dream at night is about what you think in the daytime.

35
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't be too sensitive.

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,460
Qiang,

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,540
how is the thing I asked you to investigate?

38
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,460
My Lord, I found out

39
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,830
the person who tried to assassinate the Holy Envoy

40
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,380
was He Huan from the Peacock Sect.

41
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,350
In that case,

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,510
she is not on the same side as the Peacock Sect.

43
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,920
Such a smart and knowledgeable person

44
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,610
might be able to help our sect of Flowers Kill.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,780
Muyang.

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,050
How has the Holy Envoy been recently?

47
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,329
Master, everything is fine with her.

48
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,110
It's just that the Holy Envoy is too playful

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,840
to follow the rules of the sect.

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,579
The Holy Envoy is pure and naive.

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,420
She is different from mortals.

52
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,340
She has received the order from the Peacock God.

53
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,650
It's a blessing for the people that she can bring blessings.

54
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,980
You don't need to be so harsh on her, Chief.

55
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,950
The Holy Envoy carries the weight of great responsibilities.

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,470
She's also in a high position in our sect.

57
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,790
How can she be as naive as a child?

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,590
Since she's chosen by the Peacock God,

59
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,360
she won't get used to the rules made by us mortals.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,330
Chief,

61
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,870
no need to be too strict with her.

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,990
Yes.

63
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,110

64
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,460
Yu.

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,550
I have something important to do in the sect.

66
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,899
I won't disturb you and Young Master.

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,529
I'll take my leave.

68
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,150
I'll leave as well.

69
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,440
Mother, I'm here today

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,830
to beg you for a favor.

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,380
Speak frankly. You don't need to beg me.

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,740
Since you were young,

73
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,000
I've granted all your wishes, haven't I?

74
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,070
Mother.

75
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,780
I'm not young anymore.

76
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,150
It's time for me to get married.

77
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,380
Yesterday you just said you wanted to accompany me.

78
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,220
And now,

79
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,830
you become so eager to get married?

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
From now on,

81
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,470
I can accompany you together with my husband.

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't try to coax me.

83
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,020
Everyone knows your feelings for Li Muyang.

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,910
But silly girl,

85
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,310
you are too straightforward.

86
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,480
You don't know how to court a man at all.

87
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,580
When dealing with men,

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,310
you need a little scheme

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,140
to attract their attention.

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,700
Playing hard-to-get is the only way to win his favor.

91
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,260
If you keep hanging around in front of them,

92
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,440
it might backfire,

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,840
and you'll be despised by him instead.

94
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,770
Mother,

95
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,970
I'm serious about Muyang.

96
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,580
I don't want to use

97
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
those manipulative methods on him.

98
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,510
Mother,

99
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,420
I'm here today to ask for a Master's Decree.

100
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,020
Mother, please grant a marriage for me and Muyang.

101
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,750
Get up.

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,310
Get up.

103
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,740
You have to propose before you're engaged.

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,620
You have to ask his opinion first.

105
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,340
How can you act so reckless?

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,630
Have you asked Muyang

107
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,620
if he is willing to marry you?

108
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,510
Well…

109
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm a master of love who has swept so many men off their feet.

110
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,910
How could I have such a silly daughter like you?

111
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,500
You should ask him first,

112
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,030
and then we'll talk.

113
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
That makes sense.

114
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,660
Mother,

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,990
please teach me some other things.

will no longer be troubled by the Red-tailed Bugs.

That'd be great.

121
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,780

Did I do anything wrong

124

to have tired you out?

125
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
No.

Lord Li,

203
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,580
You and Moqian both look vulnerable.

204
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,780
How come you're so good at martial arts?

205
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,200
I was frail when I was a kid,

206
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,170
so I had to learn martial arts.

207
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,080
Please don't overthink, Holy Envoy.

208
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,910
Then, why do you

209
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,870
pretend to be a weak scholar every day?

210
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,670
Is that your character setting?

211
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,230
I didn't mean to hide it.

212
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,420
Yu and Moqian both know about it.

213
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't you like martial arts practitioners?

214
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,850
If that's the case,

215
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,350
I will conceal it more

216
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,870
and won't show it in front of you again.

217
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,500
No, that's not what I meant.

218
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
It's great that you know martial arts.

219
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,630
You can also protect me, right?

220
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,510
I will protect you.

We searched all night.

225
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,140
The Holy Envoy was injured last night.

226
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,390
We had a rest at the shore.

227
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,720
Holy Envoy, are you injured?

228
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,350
Is it serious?

229
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm fine.

230
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,200
It's just a minor injury.

231
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,230
I just feel a little weak.

232
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,100
It's Lai's fault.

233
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,380
He's been dilly-dallying all along the way.

234
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,910
Otherwise, we would have found you long ago.

235
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,370
Then, the Holy Envoy didn't have to get hurt.

236
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,770
How could you say that?

237
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,340
Those bad guys hurt me.

238
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,140
It has nothing to do with Lai.

239
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,810
My Lord, take a rest.

240
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,290
I'll carry the Holy Envoy.

241
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,210
It's okay.

242
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,860

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,070
We will enter the city soon.

248
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,310
You can walk on your own from now on.

249
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,670
Let me carry you.

250
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,980
Wait for me.

251
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,720

It's okay.

262
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,060
Since it was just an accident,

263
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,790
just take it as a dream.
