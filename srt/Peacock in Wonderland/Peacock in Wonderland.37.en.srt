Father.

6
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,710
It's the middle of the night.

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,170
Why aren't you asleep yet?

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,660
Where's Hua Ni?

9
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,050
She's already asleep.

10
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,240
Father,

11
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,920
have you ever heard of a plant called Shanglu?

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,810
Yes, I have.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,130
The fruit of Shanglu can be used as dye.

14
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Girls like it.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,020
I remember ancient texts mentioning

16
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,789
that Shanglu can be used as medicine,

17
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,150
having the effect of clearing the mind and enhancing wisdom.

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,390
Have you heard of it?

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,180
Those rumors are unreliable.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,460
Shanglu is poisonous.

21
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,570
How could it be used as medicine?

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Muyang,

23
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,200
I know you have your own thoughts.

24
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,710
I won't stop you, nor will I inquire.

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
But now,

26
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,920
you're married.

27
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,930
You mustn't take risks anymore,

28
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,400
do you understand?

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,440
I only wish for you and Hua Ni to be safe and healthy,

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
having a happy marriage.

31
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,440
Your wish

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
is also my wish.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Don't worry.

34
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,800
Alright, go to sleep.

35
00:02:59,329 --> 00:02:59,930
Hurry.

36
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,530
What's wrong with you?

37
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,030
Why can't you even block two of my moves?

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
In terms of martial arts,

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,250
you've always been better than me, haven't you?

40
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,410
Give me your hand.

41
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,890
What are these?

42
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,770
I'm feeling tired today,

43
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,900
and got a rash.

44
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,520
You use Shanglu and Gansui powder, right?

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,890
Du Moqian, are you out of your mind?

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,620
Shanglu is highly toxic.

47
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,500
A slight mistake

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
could be fatal.

49
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,930
How could I let Yu take risks?

50
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,840
Don't worry.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,290
The dosage I gave her

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
can treat her illness

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,740
without harming her at all.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,940
So you tested the medicine on yourself?

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,740
Du Moqian,

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,790
are you trying to kill yourself?

57
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,230
She's my life.

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,000

59
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,750

It feels like

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
I had a big dream.

64
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,740
I can't remember many things.

65
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,159
I'm still a bit hazy until now.

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,970
Don't worry.

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
All of this is temporary.

-The Master has fully regained consciousness.
-You'll definitely get better.

It's just that the medicine was potent.

She'll recover with a few days of rest.

73
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,800
Thank you.

Imperial physician,

75
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,420
there's one thing I'm not clear about.

76
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,380
Let's discuss it on the way.

77
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,680
Do you want something to eat?

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,740
I have no appetite.

79
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,640
If there's someone who, compelled by circumstances,

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,170
has consumed a large amount

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,110
of Shanglu and Gansui powder to test the medicine on himself,

82
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,640
is there any way to save him?

83
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,390
It is highly toxic.

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,140
How many days has the person been taking it?

85
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,480
It's been more than ten days, I'm afraid.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,540
If that's the case,

87
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,390
it's probably beyond help,

88
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,650
beyond the reach of even the immortals.

89
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,550
What medicine did the imperial hospital prescribe?

90
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,750
It worked so quickly.

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,520
Yu will be fully recovered in a few days.

92
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,120
Muyang,

93
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,310
what's wrong?

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,650
Are you unhappy?

95
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,890
Sir, what's wrong?

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll go get the imperial physician right now.

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,960
Don't go.

98
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Du Moqian!

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,480
Are you out of your mind?

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
How could you come up with such a method?

101
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,330
Every day's delay

102
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,260
would have added

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,540
to Yu's danger and suffering.

104
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,340
Even so, you shouldn't have tested the medicine on yourself.

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,670
Then who could I turn to?

106
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,290
Who could I trust to test the medicine?

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
Yu has already abandoned me.

108
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,060
All I can do for her

109
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,060
is this.

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
Maybe if I die,

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,110
she'll remember me a bit more, right?

112
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,100
Qian, don't talk nonsense.

113
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll find a doctor for you.

114
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm sure that you'll be cured.

115
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,659
Wait for me.

116
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,030
Wait for me.

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,370
Let's go.

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,480
Let's go.

119
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,659
Stop crying, Ni.

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,150
It's useless.

121
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,409
How could you say that?

122
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,020
Don't give up, please!

123
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,360
Muyang, let's find a way to save him.

124
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,820
He's lost a lot of blood.

for everything I've done to you.

132
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,630
If one's heart and desires could be controlled,

133
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,510
I would also like to be a free and straightforward person.

134
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,860
Tell me.

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,210
Do you have any unfinished wishes?

136

139
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,720
the moonlight tonight is incredibly beautiful.

140
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,750
It has been so long

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,610
since I've seen the moon.

142
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,470
Master, you'll surely get better.

You're here.

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,100
I didn't expect

149
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,170
that there had already been people from the Moon Pavilion in the Court.

150
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,030
It was my fault.

151
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
My negligence

152
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,070
and misjudgment

153
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,740
led to being set up.

154
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,720
Master, don't blame yourself.

155
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
Your priority now is to recover.

156
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,890
Only then can you manage the overall situation.

157

You are not in good health now.

How could there be an eternal flower

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,160
in your era?

191
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,380
Your Ladyship, it was you who brought it here.

192
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
I brought it here?

193
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,370
Don't you remember?

194
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,700
Why don't I remember bringing it here?

195
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,780
Do you really not remember this flower?

196
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,440
I don't remember this flower.

197
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,090
Then do you remember

198
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,460
how you joined the Peacock Sect

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,920
and became the Holy Envoy?

200
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,680
It probably was because my rain prayer succeeded.

201
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,800
Do you remember

202
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
how you joined the Flowers Kill?

203
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,240
Flowers Kill?

204
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,860
Qingqing.

205
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,150
Do you remember

206
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,430
how we rescued Shen Tong?

207
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,950
Shen Tong?

208
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,880
Who is it?

209
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,020
Qing Jian's pill

210
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,020
was indeed not an ordinary one.

211
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,480
Don't overthink it.

212
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,840
I think maybe I've just been too tired lately.

213
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,770
So, I can't recall many things.

214
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Don't worry.

215
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,770
I'm sure I'll remember.

216
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,880
Really?

217
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,160
Stop worrying.

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,840
It's okay.

219
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,730
If you can't remember, then don't.

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,850
I'll accompany you to revisit.

221
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
I'll fill in

222
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,610
those memories for you, okay?

223
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
So, what is Flowers Kill?

224
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,010
The Flowers Kill

225
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,030
is a really powerful organization.

226
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,860
A powerful organization?

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Who's the leader of this organization?

228
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,530
It's you.

229
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,230
Me?

230
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,250
Am I that powerful?

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,720
Are you also in the Flowers Kill?

232
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,490
I am.

233
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,880
As long as I'm with you.

234
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,100
Do we get paid in the Flowers Kill?

235
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,200
Yes.

236
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,080
We get paid a lot.

237
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,690
[Frost Pavilion]

238
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,440
Are the lights still on inside?

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,660
The Lantern Festival is coming soon.

240
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I wonder

241
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,840
if he is still staying up late to embroider for me.

242
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,780
I wish I could embroider clothes for you for the rest of my life.

243
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
The eternal flower...

244
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,740
were brought with me when I traveled through time.

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,320
The measuring cup...

246
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,400
was used when I prayed for rain.

247
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,390
And then...

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,450
the thing that connected my life and Muyang's

249
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,790
is...

250
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,390
What is it?

251
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,910
The thing that connected my life and Muyang's...

252
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,690
It's the Red-tailed Bug.

253
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,750
Muyang?

254
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,870
Not only were our lives connected,

255
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,470
but we also couldn't be more than one Zhang apart from each other.

256
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
What is this bowl for?

257
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,560
Here.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Holy Envoy, thank you for your blessing.

259
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,640
Thank you for your blessing.

260
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,620
I don't need to remember an awkward past like this.

261
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
So, today,

262
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,670
are you still willing to grant me the Glass Flower Bowl?

263
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,430
Is today a special day?

264
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,840
Why are we making flower lanterns?

265
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,100
It's not a special day.

266
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,520
These flower lanterns

267
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,180
are used to help Her Ladyship regain her memory.

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,930
Qing Jian is really malicious.

269
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,410
Her Ladyship's memory

270
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,950
deteriorates day by day.

271
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,120
I don't know what to do.

272
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,200
It's okay.

273
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,290
Let's talk more in front of her.

274
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,720
Maybe over time,

275
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
she'll remember.

276
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,680
Anyway,

277
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,080
she can forget anything,

278
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
as long as she doesn't forget the Lord.

279
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,630
She can't forget us either.
