00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,470
When the time is right in the future,

192
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,680
I'll send him and his brother to hell.

193
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,960
As the formidable boss of the Flowers Kill

194
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,400
and a "hexagonal warrior" of the Peacock City,

195
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,130
why have you become prone to getting injured now?

196
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,940
Because I have a weak spot now.

197
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,120
Muyang,

198
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,760
I don't want to be your weak spot.

199
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,390
I want to be your armor.

200
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,820
I want to protect you.

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
You were already protecting me.

202
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,990
Just staying by my side

203
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,310
makes you my armor.

204
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,250
Whatever happens in the future,

205
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,250
you must never again use your own safety

206
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,120
as leverage.

207
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,950
Do you hear me?

208
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,870
I've already lost you once.

209
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,630
I can't bear to lose you again.

210
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,890
I won't.

211
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
But...

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,430
We left like that.

213
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,110
Will Qing Jian come after us?

214
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,130
You don't need to worry about him for now.

215
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,950
The flowers I gave him

216
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,760
weren't baby's breath flower,

217
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,600
they were Qiming herbs.

218
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,450
When we were seven,

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,730
my brother fell seriously ill,

220
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,320
struggling to breathe and coughing up blood every day.

221
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,070
It was during that illness that I discovered

222
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,070
that the Qiming herb is toxic to him.

223
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,380
But he doesn't know it.

224
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,660
So, when I was in the dungeon,

225
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,900
I provoked him, argued with him,

226
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,590
all to make him inhale the toxin.

227
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,550
While not fatal,

228
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
the toxin is enough to harm him a bit.

229
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,110
No news from Master Rong's side yet?

230
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
For some reason I don't know,

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,740
Master Rong has been absent from Court for several days.

232
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,790
No one can see her.

233
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,920
It's strange.

234
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,220
She doesn't seem like someone who would be so negligent.

235
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,360
Could it be that she's unwilling to release you

236
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,020
and intentionally delaying?

237
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
She wouldn't do that.

238
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,010
Wait for three more days.

239
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,150
If there's still no response after three days,

240
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,000
take this thing to the Master's Mansion.

241
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,620
Yes.

242
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,190
Not this one.

243
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,520
Master?

244
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,800
Not this one.

245
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,560
Master?

246
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,350
Not this one!

247
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,750
-Master.
-Change it!

248
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,460
Master!

249
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,740
-No!
-Change it!

250
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,520
Change it!

251
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,720
Go away!

252
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,930
Change it!

253
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,790
Play the delightful one!

254
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,780
Play it!

255
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,030
Please don't be angry, Master!

256
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,150
I really don't know which tune it is.

257
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,840
You don't know?

258
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,010
You don't know!

259
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,300
Why don't you know?

260
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,470
Why don't you know?

261
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,920
Change it.

262
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,400
I want that tune!

263
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Play it!

264
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
-Play the delightful one!
-I really don't know!

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Play it!

266
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,790
I really don't know!

267
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,020
Yu!

268
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,310
Yu!

269
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,640
All of you, get out!

270
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes!

271
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,550
Yu!

272
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,400
Yu!

273
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,820
Look at me, Yu!

274
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,810
Look at me.

275
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm Moqian. I'm Moqian.

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,640
Look at me. Look at me.

277
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,370
Yu.

278
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,480
Yu, It's me.

279
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,390
It's me.

280
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm Moqian.

281
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm Moqian.

282
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,040
Can you play the bamboo flute?

283
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,770
Play it.

284
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,760
Yu,

285
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,810
you can't listen to it anymore.

286
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,720
Get lost!

287
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,350
Yu.

288
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,380
As long as you don't hurt yourself.

289
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,170
Yu?

290
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,160
Yu!

291
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,180
Yu.

292
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm really fine.

293
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,590
I suspect it was just a candy.

294
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,790
Qing Jian was playing tricks on me.

295
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,910
Qing Jian is so bad.

296
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,080
If anything happens to you,

297
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,310
I won't live alone.

298
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,160
Bah!

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
How could you say that?

300
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Besides,

301
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,360
even if you won't think of yourself,

302
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,950
you should think of Qiang, right?

303
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,560
Are you willing to make her sad?

304
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,290
If anything were to happen to you,

305
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,620
I'd be devastated too.

306
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
Good Lai. I understand.

307
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,130
Don't worry.

308
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll be fine.

309
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Oh no!

310
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
Du Moqian sent a message

311
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,270
that Master Rong is in trouble!

312
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,470
Master is in trouble?

313
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,720
Yu.

314
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,630
Shu Ya is Qing Jian?

315
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,520
Yes.

316
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,700
He controlled Rong Yu with the bamboo flute.

317
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,780
How dare he?

318
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
Is there anything he doesn't dare to do?

319
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,100
I was watching him

320
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,550
hurting Yu right in front of me,

321
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,010
but unable to do anything.

322
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,100
Now the most important thing is to wake her up.

323
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,890
When the flute stopped playing,

324
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,140
her consciousness also faded away.

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,390
If she continues to sleep like this,

326
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,050
she might never wake up again.

327
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,680
Where are you going?

328
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,800
The people from the Moon Pavilion have planned meticulously

329
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,320
and have long since left the city.

330
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,430
You won't be able to find anyone.

331
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,490
Then what about Yu?

332
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,130
Is she going to be like this forever?

333
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,230
[Minghua Hall]

334
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,530
The Master remains unconscious,

335
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,850
and none of you have any idea how to save her.

336
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,880
Indeed, there is currently no reliable solution.

337
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,290
The Imperial Hospital is discussing countermeasures.

338
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,690
Are there any unreliable methods?

339
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,660
Well...

340
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,040
The Master is in danger. Don't you dare hide anything!

341
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,150
This method is perilous,

342
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,200
and it's only been rumored among the common folk.

343
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,790
Throughout history, no one has ever attempted it.

344
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,160
If there's even the slightest deviation,

345
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,620
her life will be in danger.

346
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,390
Just tell me.

347
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,570
I'll take responsibility for the consequences.

348
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,110
Don't worry, Lord Li.

349
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,870
We will take good care of the Master.

350
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,500
Thank you.

351
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,900
Don't worry too much.

352
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,400
Yu is blessed by God.

353
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,790
Don't worry.

354
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,160
She will be fine.

355
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
I hope so.

356
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,880
How do you know how to tie this knot?

357
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,880
You taught me.

358
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,000
Have you forgotten?

359
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,800
Probably because there's been too many things going on lately,

360
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,660
my brain isn't working properly.

361
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Let's talk about it when we get back.

362
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,400
You're here.

363
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
What are you giving her to drink?

364
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,390
It's a new prescription from the Imperial Physician.

365
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,140
Given the circumstances,

366
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,400
we can't use medication casually.

367
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Don't worry.

368
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,240
They know what they're doing.

369
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,830
She does seem to look a bit better.

370
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,530
Yu will wake up soon.
