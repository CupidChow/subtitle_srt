00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,430
What if you have a friend who is a member of Flowers Kill?

5
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,050
Friend?

6
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,100
As the young master of Peacock City-State,

7
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,620
I won't show mercy to any of my enemies.

8
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,729
Even if my friend is a member of Flowers Kill,

9
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,450
I will kill them

10
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,190
and tear their body into pieces.

11
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,370
Oh no.

12
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,660
If they know

13
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,450
I'm also a member of Flowers Kill,

14
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,740

No.

Oh, you've grown up.

20
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,010
Now you won't tell me what your trouble is.

21
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,160
Are you really not going to tell me about it?

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
Come on.

23
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,220
Dr. Sun, who treated you last time,

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,510
told me about your trouble

when he came to buy flowers at Guanbuzhu.

26
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,180
What did he tell you?

27
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,860
As the poem goes, "The youth yearns day and night.

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,300
For the maiden so fair.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,210
His yearning grows so strong.

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,710
You should never

Then...

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
Who was the girl in your dreams?

No wonder the Holy Envoy hasn't come to our home lately.

Turns out, you've fallen in love with another girl.

Well...

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
The best way to forget a girl

53
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,520
is to stay far away from her.

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,500
As far as possible.

Since you want to avoid Holy Envoy,

why not just let her quit?

you'll still see each other all the time.

There are many ways to let her keep your secrets.

You don't have to force her to stay in Flowers Kill.

I should let her go first.

Okay, now I allow you to quit.

168
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,470
Really? You won't go back on your word?

169
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,020
I never go back on my word.

170
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,300
Okay.

Let's sign an agreement.

172
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,820
What Flowers Kill did and will do has nothing to do with Hua Ni.

From now on,

Help me get rid of the Flower Poison.

191
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,620
It's white and chubby.

192
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,680
Just like a radish.

193
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
You'll recognize it when you see it.

194
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,090
Soak the white jade root

195
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,150
in water for a week.

196
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,780
And keep drinking the water for a few days.

197
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,580
Then the poison will be removed.

198
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,280
Alright.

199
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,960
Thank you for telling me this.

200
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,420
White jade root.

201
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,620
White jade root.

202
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,280
[Yanxia Shop]

203
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,820
I haven't come to Yanxia Shop for a long time.

204
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,900
I feel everything is still the same.

205
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,540
It's getting cold this autumn.

206
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,200
Let me make a warm coat for you.

207
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,740
Moqian.

208
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,220
Do you have something to tell me?

209
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,940
I...

210
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,840
Well...

211
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,540
Make the coat in my old size.

212
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,850
No need to measure me.

213
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,540
Okay.

214
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,940
Yu, are you worried because of what Flowers Kill did?

215
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,580
Flowers Kill has been causing trouble here for years.

216
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,740
It's not easy to completely destroy them.

217
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,650
Last time, you found where their base was.

218
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,100
Have you got any new information?

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,900
That night,

220
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,180
someone from Flowers Kill sneaked into my house

221
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,740
and tried to assassinate me.

222
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,000
I led my men to chase him

223
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,460
and found that base of Flower Kill's.

224
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,020
But since then,

225
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
I haven't found any of Flowers Kill.

226
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,690
I think

227
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,460
I alerted them.

228
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,360
It's okay.

229
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,950
There will be chances for you to catch them in the future.

230
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,540
Yu.

231
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,320
I remember

232
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,540
your father gave you this jade pendant.

233
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,370
Yes.

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,020
My father wanted me

235
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,650
to give it to the man I love.

236
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,920
I should have given it to him long ago.

237
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,640
But I have been too busy recently.

238
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,570
So I haven't got a chance to do it.

239
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,620
If it's not the right time to for you to do it now,

240
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,700
just keep waiting.

241
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,490
You have plenty of time.

242
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,950
You don't have to do it now.

243
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,730
But I've waited many years.

244
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,180
As long as I find the white jade root,

245
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,820
I'll be able to remove the Flower Poison from my body.

246
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,640
Then I'll be free again.

247
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,450
But Mount Yunyin is so big.

248
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,860
How can we find it?

249
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,420
Wait.

250
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,130
The mountain roads are not rough.

251
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,320
Let's split up.

252
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's meet at the foot of the mountain in an hour.

253
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,170
Okay.

254
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,020
White jade root.

255
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,930
Where can I find it?

256
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,740
White jade root.

257
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,060
Who is it?

258
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,600
Stop there!

259
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,320
What did you see?

260
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,470
I saw nothing.

261
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,080
You...

262
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,340
Did you see everything?

263
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,180
I...

264
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,990
If you dare to tell anyone that you saw me here,

265
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,460
I'll have your tongue cut off.

266
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,620
I won't tell anyone about it.

267
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,220
I won't tell anyone about it.

268
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,600
The white jade root is white and chubby just like a radish.

269
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,340
Does that kind of thing really exist?

270
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,390
White jade root.

271
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
White jade root.

272
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,130
White?

273
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,530
Is this the white jade root?

274
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,460
It's not difficult to find.

275
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,540
I found it so...

276
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,940
Who was so naughty

277
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,600
to cover the hole with leaves?

278
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,740
Where am I?

279
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,450
It didn't rain in Peacock City for a year.

280
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,420
How come it's raining now?

281
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,900
Lai.

282
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
Lai, where are you?

283
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,060
Who can come to rescue me?

284
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,300
Lord Li.

285
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,960
Lord Li, rescue me.

286
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,580
It's me!

287
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,150
Why should I rescue you?

288
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,860
We're good friends.

289
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,700
Friends?

290
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I remember

291
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,940
we signed an agreement yesterday.

292
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,620
It says

293
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,620
we'll go our separate ways.

294
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm not a kind person.

295
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,480
I can't think of any reason to save you.

296
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,730
Seriously, Li Muyang?

297
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,100
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

298
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,460
Look at me.

299
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,310
You just want to take this opportunity

300
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,770
to force me to go back to Flowers Kill, right?

301
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,910
Did you forget something?

302
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,770
Go to the mountain

303
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,300
and find the white jade root.

304
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,440
Soak it in water

305
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,540
for a week.

306
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,900
and keep drinking the water for a few day.

307
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,330
And the Flower Poison will be removed from your body.

308
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,370
I see.

309
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
Li Muyang, no way!

310
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,970
I, Hua Ni, would rather

311
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,540
die here than go back with you.

312
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,740
I'd rather starve to death, freeze to death, and not sleep

313
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,540
than beg you for your help.

314
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,859
Leave.

315
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,720
I don't need your help.

316
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,569
Good for you, Holy Envoy.

317
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,790
You're not afraid of death at all.

318
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,980
I admire you.

319
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,220
Bye.

320
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,819
Are you really leaving?

321
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,540
Li Muyang, help me.

322
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,030
I won't do it again.

323
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,090
I will always be a member of Flowers Kill

324
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,860
and never quit.

325
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,680
Please save me.

326
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,840
Flowers Kill is not where

327
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,520
you can come and go as you wish.

328
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,170
Holy Envoy, you'd better think carefully

329
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,640
before you make the decision.

330
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,030
I've thought it through.

331
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,740
Really.

332
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,720
Come down now.

333
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,930
There is snake trying to bite me.

334
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,490
Come down now.
