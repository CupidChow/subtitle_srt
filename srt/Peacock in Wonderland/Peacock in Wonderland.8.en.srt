00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,850
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,250
Holy Envoy,

5
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,450
what have you been busy with lately?

6
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,690
Master,

7
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,009
I've been investigating the conditions of the people

8
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,210
and helping them out in the city.

9
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,120
Really?

10
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,270
Then why did someone report

11
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,900
that you and Li Muyang, Minister of Rites, are having an illicit sexual relationship?

12
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,539
What?

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,300
What illicit?

14
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:55,680
What?

15
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,610
It's said that they slept together

16
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,039
and that they were inseparable.

17
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,700
They even used lecherous magic.

18
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,130
What lecherous magic?

19
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,720
Don't make false accusations.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,580
This concerns the reputation of the Peacock City-State.

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,440
It is a big deal.

22
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,830
Even if it was not the Holy Envoy

23
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,320
but an ordinary ordinary woman,

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,330
you can't just slander others.

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,190
You slander the Holy Envoy

26
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,240
without any evidence.

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,870
What's your agenda?

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,329
Of course I have evidence.

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,930
They are using the magic of Red-tailed Bugs.

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,490
As long as they plant the Red-tailed Bugs together,

31
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,480
they can feel the same thing at the same time.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,010
It's often used to enhance the pleasure between the sheets.

33
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,160
Once they plant the Red-tailed Bugs,

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,570
their lives will be connected.

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,770
Three meters away,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,260
they'll feel an intolerable heartache.

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,870
If the distance between them exceeds 10 meters,

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,150
they will drop dead.

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,410
If you claim you're wronged,

40
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,220
can you take a few steps forward?

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,120
You're just talking nonsense.

42
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,760
Why should I do that for you?

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,850
It concerns the reputation of our sect.

44
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,180
Please prove your innocence, Holy Envoy.

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,370
Master,

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,770
it's not a big deal that I'm humiliated.

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,600
But the Holy Envoy has a high status.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,930
She's respected by all.

49
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,570
If the Holy Envoy has to prove her innocence herself

50
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,930
for such a ridiculous rumor,

51
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,620
then, while there are so many rumors in the world,

52
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,670
does the Holy Envoy need

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,160
to clarify them one by one?

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,690
The Holy Envoy should be a model for everyone.

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,680
If she can't be perfect,

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,670
it means she's unqualified.

57
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,720
If you dare not take a few steps,

58
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,210
then you must be afraid of being found out.

59
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,990
Holy Envoy.

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,579
Master!

61
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,570
Minister Li.

62
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,000
Please.

63
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,050
Holy Envoy.

64
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,290
Please.

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,270
Why did she slap him?

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,290
No way.

67
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,560
Why not?

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,490
Not only can I walk a few steps,

69
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,370
I can sprint 100 meters.

70
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,730
Today,

71
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,130
The distance between Muyang and I

72
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,190
exceeded three meters several times,

73
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,650
but I didn't feel any pain.

74
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,890
Master,

75
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,250
I've been indeed having close contact with Lord Li lately.

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,010
But that is all because someone tried to kill me.

77
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,790
To save my life,

78
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,790
I had no choice but to be with Lord Li.

79
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,450
And the person who tried to hurt me

80
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,610
was from the Peacock Sect.

81
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,890
What evidence do you have?

82
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,850
-I have plenty of evidence.
-Master.

83
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,850
What the Holy Envoy said is all true.

84
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,330
I have found it all out.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,380
There is a way to identify

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,330
the real mastermind behind it.

87
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,210
On the day the Holy Envoy was assassinated,

88
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,010
I smeared the pollen of the Qinsha Flower

89
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,450
on the assassin's body.

90
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,850
In this way,

91
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,450
When the assassin went back to meet the person behind it,

92
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,090
he will surely pass the pollen on to that person.

93
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,630
The pollen is colorless and odorless,

94
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,040
but it's extremely hard to remove.

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,690
It can also attract the Qinsha Gnats, which always live with this flower.

96
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,960
If you need evidence,

97
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,560
why don't you ask a servant to catch a couple of the bugs

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,490
and have a try?

99
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,210
Approved.

100
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,550
It's really you.

101
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,560
He Huan.

102
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,800
What else can you say?

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,290
According to the law,

104
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,250
the person who hired an assassin is as guilty as the assassin.

105
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,200
He should be executed.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,840
Master.

107
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,420
He tried to murder the Holy Envoy

108
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
and deceived you.

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,020
It is such a heinous crime.

110
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,060
We can't let him off easily.

111
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,659
Master.

112
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
He Huan is a member of my sect.

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,930
He should be punished by our sect members.

114
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,050
I am incompetent to guide him.

115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,909
I will remove his duty as the Envoy

116
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,830
and put him in prison.

117
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,290
Do as Chief says.

118
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,030
Master!

119
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,380
I've made up my mind.

120
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,440
Say no more.

121
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,610
Master is wise.

122
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,820
-Master is wise!
-Master is wise!

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,930
Thank you for speaking up for us just now, Lord Chen.

124
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,060
It's all thanks to you, My Lord.

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Oh, right.

126
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,710
This is Lord Chen, Minister of Revenue.

127
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,470
I'm Chen Mo. Greetings, Holy Envoy.

128
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,710
Lord Chen, you're a high official.

129
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,800
I should bow to you.

130
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,280
Holy Envoy, you summoned the rain for the people.

131
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,450
Your benevolence knows no bounds.

132
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,050
You're well worthy of my bow.

133
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,820
Unfortunately,

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,110
Master Rong was restrained by the Peacock Sect,

135
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,130
and we failed to bring He Huan to justice.

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,370
Holy Envoy, you're wronged this time.

137
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,110
If you have any difficulties in the future,

138
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,820
come to me.

139
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,950
I will give my all to help you.

140
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,420
Goodbye.

141
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,409
Goodbye.

142
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,490
Give his all?

143
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,890
Lord Chen is quite nice.

144
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,540
Although Lord Chen is young,

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,080
he's a mainstay of our Peacock City-State.

146
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
He is upright and straightforward.

147
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,120
A gentleman.

148
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,850
Holy Envoy.

149
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,409
Lai.

150
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,280
Why did Master Rong summon you?

151
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,409
Did she give you a hard time?

152
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,500
You don't know.

153
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,430
Let me tell you.

154
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,450
He Huan set me and Li up,

155
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,420
but he could never think of the fact

156
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,350
that the connection between me and Lord Li

157
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,080
had been lifted at some moment.

158
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,980
I've battled with him face-to-face

159
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,860
and took him out easily.

160
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,820
Am I not amazing?

161
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,970
When have the Red-tailed Bugs been lifted?

162
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,030
Why didn't we know?

163
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,860
The previous dart.

164
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,990
The poison on that dart has the same origin as the Red-tailed Bugs.

165
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,600
They are also using poison to cultivate poison.

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,130
But they didn't expect that

167
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,960
that dart actually lured the Red-tailed Bugs out

168
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,190
from the wound.

169
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,600
We kind of profited from a misfortune.

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
It's just that the enemy was still behind the scenes,

171
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,809
so we didn't make it known.

172
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,940
What a coincidence.

173
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,520
Even Heaven is helping us.

174
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,789
Lord Li,

175
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,700
when did you put pollen on the assassin?

176
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,180
I didn't.

177
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,130
I just saw there was a sachet

178
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,230
that the Qinsha Gnat liked the most on He Huan,

179
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,110
so I bluffed.

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,200
I thought with his personality,

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,380
he'd surely give himself away if he was guilty.

182
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,140
As expected,

183
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,930
he gave away with a bluff.

184
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,910
Lord Li,

185
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
you are such a smarty-pants.

186
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,130
But this is too easy for He Huan.

187
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,450
Do we really let him off so easily?

188
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,290
Exactly.

189
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,650
Under the checks and balances between the Peacock Sect and Master Rong,

190
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,850
if Ruan Jiushu insists on protecting He Huan,

191
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,580
Master Rong has to compromise.

192
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,730
Luckily,

193
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,130
He Huan has been thrown into the dungeon.

194
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,190
Holy Envoy, you can rest assured now.

195
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,960
He'd better be.

196
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,430
Don't mess with me.

197
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,230
If he dares to mess with me,

198
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,140
I'll teach him a lesson.

199
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,270
-Chief.
-Chief.

200
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,210
Senior,

201
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,890
I've sent someone to check.

202
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,970
They were planted the Red-tailed Bugs.

203
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,310
They are indeed connected.

204
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,440
I didn't wrong them.

205
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,910
Did you plant the Red-tailed Bugs?

206
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,910
I asked you to keep an eye on Hua Ni,

207
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,820
but I didn't ask you to make trouble

208
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,420
with such despicable means.

209
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,610
Now you've angered Master Rong.

210
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,690
If I hadn't tried my best to protect you,

211
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,490
how many lives do you think you can afford to lose?

212
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,240
Senior,

213
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,610
I know I was wrong.

214
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,000
Senior,

215
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,650
I don't want to stay here.

216
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,770
Take me out.

217
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,950
It's useless to beg me.

218
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,660
Reflect on yourself.

219
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,210
Senior.

220
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,810
Senior.

221
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,170
[Minghua Hall]

222
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,920
Moqian.

223
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,560
I have to go back to the mansion.

224
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,220
You go on and send the clothes.

225
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,740
Moqian.

226
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,580
Why were you avoiding me?

227
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,000
I was not avoiding you.

228
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,250
You ran away the moment you saw me.

229
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,580
Isn't that avoiding me?

230
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,330
Yu. What is it?

231
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm here...

232
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,090
to apologize to you.

233
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,650
That night...

234
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,290
I offended you that night.

235
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,160
But I didn't mean it.

236
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,230
You didn't mean it?

237
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,970
Then what did you mean?

238
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,880
It's useless to talk so much.

239
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,410
I came to you,

240
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,370
hoping you could give me a chance

241
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,720
to make it up to you.

242
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,460
No matter what you want,

243
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,210
I'll give it to you

244
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,240
as long as I have it.

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Is that all?

246
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,260
What else do you want?

247
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,630
Forget it.

248
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,410
That night was just an accident.

249
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,280
I have

250
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,880
a well-located shop.

251
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,380
Didn't you always want to open a branch?

252
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,340
Or what about the rare fabric from the Western Regions?

253
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,050
I'll send it all to your Yanxia Shop.

254
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,510
Take it!

255
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,080
Yu.

256
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,170
You can't give me what I want.

257
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,790
I know you have someone in your heart.

258
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,390
And I don't want to force you.

259
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,380
Just think of that night as a dream.

260
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,260
Just forget it.

261
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,210
Moqian.

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Let's go.

263
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,210
Why is it so dark?

264
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,070
Young Master, look at the darts on the wall.

265
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,020
Are they...

266
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,920
There's fluorescent powder on these darts.

267
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
They can only be seen when it's dark.

268
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,090
They were from the assassin that day.

269
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,770
The darts are so fancy.

270
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,900
Maybe the assassination that day

271
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,990
was not done by the Peacock Sect.

272
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,570
You mean...

273
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm afraid it's Flowers Kill.

274
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,930
The Flowers Kill has always used petal showers as their signature.

275
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,170
The darts were shooting around like a petal shower.

276
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,120
And there are patterns of petals on the darts.

277
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,050
Isn't that a special petal shower?

278
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,430
The assassination that night

279
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
must have been done by Flowers Kill.

280
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,410
What organization is the Flowers Kill?

281
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,860
When I just came here,

282
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,290
Ruan Jiushu insisted

283
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,910
that I was from Flowers Kill.

284
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,790
I don't understand it.

285
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,250
The Flowers Kill is the No. 1 enemy of the Peacock Sect.

286
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,110
They've been against the Peacock Sect these years.

287
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,200
Rumor has it

288
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,130
that members of Flowers Kill kill people ruthlessly,

289
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,990
act treacherously,

290
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,380
and commit all kinds of evil,

291
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,890
especially the head of Flowers Killer.

292
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,450
He's really terrifying.

293
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,770
Anyone who goes against the Flowers Kill

294
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,650
will die.

295
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,890
That's not right.

296
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,970
He Huan tried to kill me

297
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,610
because I took his position as the Holy Envoy.

298
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,170
Now the Flowers Kill wanted to murder me.

299
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,130
Why is that?

300
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,150
You are the Holy Envoy of the Peacock Sect.

301
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,850
And The Flowers Killing has always been against the Peacock Sect.

302
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,590
The Holy Envoy is naturally their most hated person.

303
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,480
Ever since I became this stupid Holy Envoy,

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,940
I didn't get any benefits.

305
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,210
Now, He Huan has left,

306
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,700
but the Flowers Killing is in his wake.

307
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,200
They don't even give me a chance to breathe.

308
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,870
I might as well die.

309
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,390
Are you too tired, Holy Envoy?

310
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,520
Why don't we go out for a trip?

311
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,570
There seems to be a Spring Villa nearby,

312
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,970
which is favored by high-ranking officials.

313
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,450
Are you interested?

314
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,610
Spring?

315
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,250
Does that mean we can take a hot spring bath?

316
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,760
Yes.

317
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,690
Sure we can.

318
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,610
Today is the day, then.

319
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,650
Let's set off tonight.

320
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,210
Go.

321
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,620
I'll pack up.

322
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,720
-We'll set off immediately.
-Come on.

323
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,440
Let's go.

324
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,310
Who?

325
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,050
Flowers Kill!

326
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,560
Guards!

327
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,870
Catch the assassin!

328
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,510
How bold!

329
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,050
How dare they do violence in the Master's Mansion!

330
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,710
Chase them!

331
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,480
Yes!

332
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,720
[Yuquan Pavilion]

333
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,610
The darts were painted with the pattern of petals.

334
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,740
Obviously, someone did it on purpose.

335
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,020
Besides, judging from the fight that day,

336
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,400
that person was highly skilled in martial arts and good at using hidden weapons.

337
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,370
He's definitely not some ordinary man working for He Huan.

338
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,570
Who is so shameless

339
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,230
to act in our name?

340
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,850
Over the past few years, Flowers Kill has been in the limelight.

341
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,050
We have many enemies.

342
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,130
There's no way to find out who's framing us.

343
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,870
Chase!

344
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,760
Villains of Flowers Kill,

345
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,010
you are surrounded.

346
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,750
Surrender now!

347
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,080
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

348
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,090
Let's split up.

349
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,170
I'll retreat from the front. You guys go from the back.

350
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,560
Come on. Let's have fun.

351
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,670
We have plenty of time anyway.

352
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,400
Come on.

353
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,370
Love!

354
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,790
Bathing centers are the best.

355
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,180
What's going on?

356
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,040
Search inside.

357
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,640
Yes.

358
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,810
Get out!

359
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,450
Young Master.

360
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,260
Holy Envoy, why are you here?

361
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,850
I'm taking a bath here.

362
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,340
Young Master, are you here to take a bath, too?

363
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,510
I'm here to hunt down the traitor of Flowers Kill.

364
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,140
Did you see anyone suspicious?

365
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,740
I...

366
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,550
Flowers Kill?

367
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,610
That's horrible.

368
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,370
But

369
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,170
I'm here

370
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,090
alone.

371
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
There's no one else.

372
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,630
Are you unwell?

373
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,200
No.

374
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,329
The water is too cold, right?

375
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,490
It'll be cold soon.

376
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,619
Ask them to add some water for you.

377
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,470
We let them run away again.

378
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,550
Look around.

379
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,089
Don't miss any trace.

380
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,010
-Yes.
-Yes.

381
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,590
Young Master.

382
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,770
Holy Envoy.

383
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,560
The villains of Flowers Kill are right nearby.

384
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,050
How about I leave some people to protect you?

385
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,970
That's…

386
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,260
No need.

387
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,220
Business should come first.

388
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,170
Get back to your work.

389
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,010
Okay, I'll get back to work.

390
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,770
Take care.

391
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,730
Young Master,

392
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,210
don't leave anyone to protect me.

393
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,410
Don't leave even one person.

394
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,530
Young Master!
