English subtitles are available

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,960
Peacock in Wonderland

3
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,810
Episode 28

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,630
The autumn wind is soughing.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,610
Lord Li, are you still outside?

6
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,630
Your injury might get worse.

7
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm curious.

8
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,120
You're so highly skilled in martial arts.

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Who could have hurt you?

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,050
Take the medicine.

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,670
Have some tea, Mr. Qing Jian.

12
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,190
Thank you.

13
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Thank you.

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,440
Please.

15
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,270
Please.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,920
Qing Jian has tried to be friendly to me frequently.

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,579
He even knows the Song of Yarn.

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,930
Is he really my big brother?

19
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,430
My big brother has the same flower-shaped birthmark as me.

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,430
Let me have a look.

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,180
Since you're here, Mr. Qing Jian,

22
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,630
I have a request.

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,110
No problem.

24
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,640
Since I got hurt,

25
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,950
I haven't had a bath for a long time.

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,640
There are many women at home.

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,200
Is it convenient for you?

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,550
Why not?

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,660
Thank you, Mr. Qing Jian.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,579
How is the water temperature?

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,510
I was careless.

32
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,650
Did I make your clothes wet?

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,750
It's fine.

34
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,630
I'll just get changed.

35
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,540
You don't have to take me as a stranger.

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Why don't you get your wet clothes changed right here?

37
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,350
What do you mean by this, Lord Li?

38
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,140
You have been hostile to me

39
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,800
because of the Holy Envoy.

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,870
But you don't have to target me on everything.

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,270
A gentleman doesn't steal what others love.

42
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,000
I will stay away from the Holy Envoy in the future.

43
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,230
This matter will end

44
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,150
today.

45
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,310
What I'm going to introduce to you today

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,279
is a dish

47
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,370
that is very popular in our hometown.

48
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,200
Hotpot.

49
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,550
Repeat after me.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,750
Hotpot.

51
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,230
Hotpot.

52
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,160
We only eat this

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,370
when our families and friends

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,790
are all together,

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,270
and we feel very happy.

56
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,590
We'll eat it together.

57
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,200
But the meat is so unconventional.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,720
This is to make it

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,000
look more delicious.

60
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,750
Just like our love—

61
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,320
terribly sweet.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,070
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,750
Holy Envoy.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,330
I've shredded the spring onions and garlic.

65
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,940
Look.

66
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,710
Not bad, Lai.

67
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,510
Well,

68
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,600
Lord Li,

69
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,409
I have two more dishes in the kitchen.

70
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,710
Can you get them for me?

71
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,920
Go, Yang.

72
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,630
Go

73
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,670
Okay.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,950
Come back soon.

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,950
Come here.

76
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,440
Do you think Li would like this?

77
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,420
I think both of them will like it.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
I just had a bite.

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,910
It tastes good.

80
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,740
Right?

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,740
You took a bite?

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,440
It does look good.

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,230
So, in the end, it all comes down to the smart, beautiful, lovely, charming,

84
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,070
sexy, and pretty Hua Ni.

85
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,550
It has to be our Holy Envoy.

86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,260
These two plates, right?

87
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,460
We can finally have a reunion dinner.

88
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,110
Qiang, come here.

89
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,350
My Lord, I found it.

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,230
It indeed is the white cherry blossom.

91
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,530
-There's also Cangshuo in the field.
-What is that?

92
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,659
I can't be mistaken.

93
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,720
Did you disturb anyone on the way?

94
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,230
No.

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's go and find out the truth now.

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,110
Yes.

97
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,390
Qingqing.

98
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,190
You eat first.

99
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,370
We'll be back soon.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's go.

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,850
We'll wait for you.

102
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,120
Don't move.

103
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,450
Say it.

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Who sent you here?

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,970
I don't know.

106
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,760
No one sent us here.

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,620
You don't know?

108
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,080
All five of you can die here

109
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,070
or leave alive.

110
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,990
I'll ask you one last time.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,920
Who sent you here?

112
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,370
Taining Hall

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,870
Yu.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,640
What is this character?

115
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,410
This is "Qian,"

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,990
as in the word we use to describe a gentleman.

117
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,860
Yu

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,810
is the smartest.

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,110
Today, I'll teach you how to write this character.

120
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,680
Why is the character "Qian" in the will

121
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,840
completely different from what my mother wrote?

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,100
You're back, Muyang.

123
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,270
Are you mad at me?

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,150
I promised to wait for you,

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
but I couldn't help it.

127
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
What's wrong?

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,140
Did you find anything?

129
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,650
My Lord.

130
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,790
The hidden weapons of the mastermind are needles.

131
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,430
This...

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,750
It's Moqian!

133
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,720
Moqian!

134
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,789
Yu.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
I heard from the maid that you were here.

136
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,440
Why are you here?

137
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
I've been away from Yanxia Shop for a while.

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,180
I want to come back and have a look.

139
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,560
I grew up

140
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,430
here.

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,980
It was also here

142
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,410
where I met Muyang.

143
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,860
By the way,

144
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,140
Muyang and I...

145
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,870
used this vat

146
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,600
to dye a piece of new clothes for you.

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,860
Do you still remember?

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
I remember.

149
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
That piece of clothes

150
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,290
was given by you and Muyang together.

151
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,560
Moqian.

152
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,330
I want to ask you something.

153
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,510
When Mother asked you to sew the wedding gown,

154
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,590
did she mention who I was to marry?

155
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,160
The former master just asked me to make the wedding gown.

156
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,070
She didn't mention who it was.

157
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,990
But if you didn't know who the groom was,

158
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,760
how could you know the size of the wedding gown,

159
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,160
and how could you make it?

160
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
The groom's wedding gown is always loose.

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,840
Unless the groom has an unusual figure,

162
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,700
the gowns all have similar sizes.

163
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,110
The former master said

164
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,970
she wanted to give you a surprise.

165
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,350
Really?

166
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,160
Okay.

167
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,320
I was overthinking.

168
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,350
It's late.

169
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Let's go home.

170
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,310
Muyang,

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,430
you must have known the truth.

172
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,990
I'll wait for you

173
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,020
outside the hall tomorrow.

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,920
Tell me, who sent you here?

175
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,960
I don't know.

176
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,120
No one sent us here.

177
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,570
You don't know?

178
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,970
I'll ask you one last time.

179
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,660
Who sent you here?

180
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,160
It's…

181
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,120
I know

182
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
you will come.

183
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,870
Why?

184
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,410
You must be surprised.

185
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,550
Li Muyang.

186
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,530
I met you that year

187
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,110
and took you to see Yu.

188
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,880
That's what I regret the most in my life.

189
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,000
Yanxia Shop

190
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,130
Let's go!

191
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Yu's birthday is around the corner,

192
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,590
but I can't even dye a piece of fabric with a color gradient,

193
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,230
let alone making a pretty gown

194
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,310
for her.

195
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,790
Your method is wrong.

196
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,790
The cloth will never be dyed into a color gradient.

197
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,910
If you want the color to be a gradient,

198
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,120
you can use the radix asparagus to bleach.

199
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,720
We did it!

200
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,230
Yu.

201
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,310
Happy birthday!

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,610
Thank you, Moqian.

203
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,180
I like it very much.

204
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,330
I didn't make

205
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,670
this gift alone.

206
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,400
Thanks to him,

207
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,370
I can dye this dress to the effect of a color gradient.

208
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,690
What's your name?

209
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,230
I'm Li Muyang.

210
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,670
Greetings, Young Master.

211
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,550
Since you're Moqian's friend,

212
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,320
then you're also my friend.

213
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,600
Run faster!

214
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,920
Moqian! Muyang!

215
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,030
Run faster!

216
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Muyang! Moqian!

217
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,280
Wait for me!

218
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,660
-Yu.
-Hurry!

219
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,590
It's so hard!

220
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,320
Moqian.

221
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,270
Help me!

222
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,870
Sorry, Yu.

223
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,200
I only know how to draw needles.

224
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,530
I'm not good at archery.

225
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,200
Awesome.

226
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,910
The snow

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,170
has made me lie on the bed for a month.

228
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,350
When can I recover?

229
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,650
I want to go riding and hunting.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Don't worry.

231
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,910
You can go out after you recover.

232
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,040
It's boring

233
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,170
to stay in the boudoir all day long.

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,440
I wonder

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,920
when winter will pass.

236
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,330
I want to see the peach blossom in the courtyard.

237
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,590
Woyue Pavilion

238
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,050
Look how cold you are.

239
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,730
Why bother?

240
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,890
When the spring comes,

241
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,990
Yu's wish will naturally come true.

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,630
It's Yu's wish,

243
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,840
so I'll do my best to fulfill it.

244
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,980
It's dawn.

245
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll check if her medicine is ready.

246
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,380
Zhixue.

247
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,610
Actually, that day,

248
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,460
when I saw Muyang sticking peach blossoms on the tree branches for me,

249
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,780
I thought I'd already recovered.

250
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,550
Yu!

251
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,870
Yu! What's wrong?

252
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,880
Help! Help!

253
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,790
Yu!

254
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,150
I'll get the imperial physician.

255
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,750
Yu.

256
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,420
Yu!

257
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,690
Go get the imperial physician.

258
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,480
Yes.

259
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,680
Young Master is possessed by evil spirits.

260
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,010
It's useless to get an imperial physician.

261
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,720
Chief, you mean…

262
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
There is holy water in our Holy Pool,

263
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,270
which contains the supreme power of the Peacock God.

264
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,510
It can remove evil spirits.

265
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,650
May I ask the Peacock God

266
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,510
to give the holy water to save my daughter?

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,190
Peacock God, please grant us the blessings.

268
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,830
Young Master is possessed by evil spirits.

269
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,200
I, Ruan Jiushu,

270
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,910
beg the Peacock God to heal Young Master.

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,780
Now that Chief caught a cold,

272
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,580
the lie that she claimed holy water could cure the disease doesn't hold water anymore.

273
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,400
Now, Master Rong has invited a hermit doctor

274
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,240
to treat Yu.

275
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,190
I'm sure she'll get better soon.

276
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,710
Yu's wish will come true soon

277
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,520
and she can ride and shoot arrows again.

278
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,680
Thanks to your intelligence,

279
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,079
their fraud was exposed.

280
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,410
The Peacock Sect's demons

281
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,869
fool people.

282
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,310
They must be eliminated.

283
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,630
Have you had an idea?

284
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,970
Since then,

285
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,260
you founded the Flowers Kill,

286
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,970
and I followed you

287
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,750
to become a member of the Flowers Killer.

288
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,490
But now,

289
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,800
I can't tell

290
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,420
if I joined the Flowers Killing

291
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,910
to eliminate the Peacock Sect

292
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,790
and protect Yu

293
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,990
or to be more like you?

294
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,530
More like me?

295
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
Since we met,

296
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,860
I couldn't help but follow you.

297
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,360
Your generosity

298
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,720
and your righteousness

299
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,860
were what I didn't have.

300
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,200
I always thought

301
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
if I could be more like you,

302
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,820
Yu would pay more attention to me.
