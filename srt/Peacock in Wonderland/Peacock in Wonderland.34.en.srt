[Episode 34]

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Take him away.

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,120
Yes!

6
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Yu.

7
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
What's wrong, Yu?

8
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,830
Look at me.

9
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,150
Look at me.

10
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,000
I'd rather you hate me.

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
I'd rather you resent me.

12
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,080
I just don't want you like this.

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,039
I'm your husband.

14
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,760
Get lost!

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,920
Go!

16
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,710
You're back.

17
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,530
You scared me.

18
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,800
What's with this disguise?

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,950
A storyteller.

20
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,280
Now that Yu has started to rectify the Peacock Sect,

21
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Ruan Jiushu has begun a propaganda war in retaliation.

22
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,200
How can I let Yu be bullied?

23
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm now the head of the Peacock Sect's anti-fan club,

24
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,880
also serving as the unofficial spokesperson for the Flowers Kill.

25
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,630
But now the city is in such chaos,

26
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,440
you shouldn't be out there showing your face.

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,390
Don't worry.

28
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,790
Lai's makeup skills are excellent.

29
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,720
Even my mom wouldn't recognize me.

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,440
By the way,

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
have you found Qing Jian?

32
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,720
Since he faked his death by jumping off the cliff,

33
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,710
it has been difficult for me

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,310
to track him down in the city.

35
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,980
I wonder

36
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,500
where he is now in the city,

37
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,079
and what he's planning.

38
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,960
He doesn't deserve to die for his crimes.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,890
I'm just worried

40
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,590
that if he can't let go of those obsessions,

41
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
the two of us brothers, sooner or later,

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,350
will have to face each other in a battle.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,390
It's okay.

44
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,480
I'll be with you.

45
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,990
Okay,

46
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,220
sir.

47
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,320
Senior,

48
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,710
we've been kneeling here for so long,

49
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,000
Master Rong has shown no response.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
At this point,

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
we have been gradually losing the support of the people.

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
What should we do now?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Junior,

54
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,480
at this critical moment,

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,840
are you willing to become the Holy Envoy of our sect,

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,990
and serve our sect?

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,870
I accept the appointment in this time of crisis,

58
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,909
and I'm willing to do whatever it takes for the Peacock Sect,

59
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,110
without hesitation.

60
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,360
He Huan, listen.

61
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,750
From now on,

62
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,970
you are the new Holy Envoy of our sect.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,520
You must help our sect through this crisis.

64
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,630
Tomorrow,

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,550
you will perform the Dance of Flying at the Holy Cliff

66
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,760
of the Peacock Sect.

67
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,890
At that time,

68
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,350
you will jump off the cliff,

69
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,720
praying for the Peacock God to show her power

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,180
and clear our sect's name.

71
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,370
And proclaim to the world

72
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,170
your identity as the Holy Envoy.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,920
I...

74
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,310
have to jump off the cliff?

75
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,310
Don't worry.

76
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,400
There will be a rope to pull you.

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,600
At the halfway down the cliff, there will be our followers to assist you.

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,190
Yes.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,710
At this time,

80
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,740
they're still playing this game.

81
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,430
If they had recognized reality earlier,

82
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,090
it wouldn't have come to this.

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,480
I, your disciple, Ruan Jiushu,

84
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,909
am born to serve you in flesh

85
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,670
and guard you in spirit.

86
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll do everything in my power,

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,270
exhaust all efforts,

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,360
dedicate everything to you, the divine,

89
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,560
serve you for life,

90
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,120
and never betray you.

91
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,560
...and never betray you.

92
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,680
Serve you for life,

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,630
and never betray you.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,600
Today,

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
I danced in the name of the Peacock Holy Envoy

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,050
to pray for blessings for our sect.

97
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,910
May the Peacock God show her power

98
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,240
and vindicate our sect!

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,000
Peacock Holy Envoy,

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,790
bestow blessings,

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,670
and protect our sect!

102
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,670
Peacock Holy Envoy,

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,460
bestow blessings,

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,190
and protect our sect!

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,110
Peacock Holy Envoy,

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,870
bestow blessings,

107
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,520
and protect our sect!

108
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,260
Peacock Holy Envoy,

109
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
bestow blessings...

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,520
I've performed the Dance of Flying countless times.

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,440
But this time,

112
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm finally the Peacock Holy Envoy.

113
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,710
...and protect our sect!

114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
Peacock Holy Envoy,

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,590
bestow blessings,

116
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,050
and protect our sect!

117
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,000
He jumped off the cliff!

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,080
Holy Envoy! Holy Envoy! Holy Envoy!

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,010
Is he crazy?

120
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,030
Holy Envoy! Holy Envoy! Holy Envoy!

121
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,950
What...

122
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,400
What happened?

123
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,830
Serve you for life,

124
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,310
and never betray you.

125
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,230
Serve you for life,

126
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,750
and never betray you!

127
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,780
Where are they?

128
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,110
Where are they?

129
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,400
Junior.

130
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,200
To die for our sect

131
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,930
is your honor.

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
He Huan deceived everyone,

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,030
and committed numerous crimes

134
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,560
in the name of the Peacock Sect.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,710
His sins are unforgivable.

136
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,230
Today, the Peacock Sect has eradicated the ringleader

137
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,490
to uphold the righteousness of our sect.

138
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,590
What?

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,150
Chief,

140
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,670
He Huan has atoned for his sins with his death.

141
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,870
Junior,

142
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,100
please don't blame me.

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,280
All of this was for the Peacock Sect.

144
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,200
It is an honor for you to sacrifice yourself

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,350
for the sect.

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,710
Chief,

147
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,160
what should we do next?

148
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,400
Tell everyone to go back,

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,550
do their duties, and avoid causing trouble.

150
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,470
He Huan is dead.

151
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,450
Our sect has given a resolution to Master Rong and the people.

152
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,850
I believe Master Rong will make a judgment.

153
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,510
Yes.

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,640
He Huan always wanted to become the Holy Envoy.

155
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,240
Now he has got his wish,

156
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,850
but at the cost of his life.

157
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
I originally thought

158
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,150
Ruan Jiushu had some affection for He Huan.

159
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,270
But what does this affection count for

160
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,800
in front of the interests of the Peacock Sect?

161
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,710
They consider human lives worthless

162
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,160
and have gone mad.

163
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,990
If we had acted at that time,

164
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
would He Huan still be alive?

165
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Qingqing,

166
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,010
you must not think like this.

167
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,070
Since Ruan Jiushu

168
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,530
had decided to use He Huan,

169
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,310
no one could have changed it.

170
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,710
Moreover,

171
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,370
given He Huan's personality,

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,310
even if you had told him in advance

173
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,640
that he was being used by the Peacock Sect,

174
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,650
he would not have believed it

175
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,910
until the last moment,

176
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,470
let alone appreciated your kindness.

177
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,160
I know.

178
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,670
Before,

179
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,540
he always plotted against me.

180
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,190
But now that I see his end,

181
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,470
I feel

182
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,120
he is just a pitiful person.

183
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,020
Alright. Don't dwell on it anymore,

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,670
okay?

185
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,040
However, since the Peacock Sect

186
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,170
has shifted all the blame onto He Huan,

187
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Yu has new choices

188
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,700
to make now.

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,900
I need to go back to the palace.

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,150
I need to hand the Feisun Tally to Yu.

191
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,590
Well,

192
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,240
do you need me to go with you?

193
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,550
No need.

194
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll go alone.

195
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,470
Master,

196
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,960
everything is clear now.

197
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,020
He Huan was the mastermind.

198
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,480
You should release the Chief

199
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,400
to soothe the people's hearts.

200
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,550
What does He Huan's death

201
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,110
have to do with whether Ruan Jiushu should be released or not?

202
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,280
Everything was done by He Huan alone.

203
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,150
The Chief is innocent.

204
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,830
It's...

205
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,550
Get lost.

206
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:58,990
You...

207
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,330
Master, the Chief is innocent!

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,070
Master!

209
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
Master.

210
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,800
-I'm here to...
-Muyang?

211
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,910
You're here.

212
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,590
Perfect timing.

213
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,220
I was just thinking of having a drink with you.

214
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,480
Come.

215
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,710
Have a drink with me.

216
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,380
I came to inform you of an important matter.

217
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,070
An important matter?

218
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,940
Everyone who comes to me has important matters.

219
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,560
Today, Muyang also came.

220
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,630
Let me think.

221
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,090
What kind of important matter could it be?

222
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,080
I see.

223
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,350
You must be here

224
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,230
to find someone, right?

225
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,910
Are you looking for

226
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,770
the owner of this bamboo flute?

227
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,150
Zhiyang,

228
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,830
we meet again.

229
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
It's really you.

230
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,920
I thought you no longer cared about my life.

231
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,460
I didn't expect that you looked for me for a long time

232
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,990
at the foot of the mountain.

233
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,030
Indeed,

234
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,850
you still care about your older brother.

235
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,620
How is it?

236
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,420
Do you like the room

237
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,500
I arranged for you?

238
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,900
What did you do to Rong Yu?

239
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,010
I didn't do anything.

240
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,820
I just

241
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,720
played the bamboo flute

242
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,470
to make her happy.

243
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,810
That was not the sound of just an ordinary bamboo flute.

244
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,440
You've controlled her.

245
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,140
My Zhiyang

246
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,320
is still as bright as in childhood.

247
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,890
The tragic deaths of our parents,

248
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,880
the separation of us two brothers.

249
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,070
I remember

250
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,230
every scene vividly.

251
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,320
But now...

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,430
Now is the perfect time for our revenge!

253
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,200
When you saw those fools from the Peacock Sect

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,760
kneeling at the cliff where we had our accident,

255
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,730
didn't you feel any satisfaction?

256
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,790
But it was the Peacock Sect that caused

257
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,400
the destruction of our family.

258
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,320
What does this have to do with the former master and Rong Yu?

259
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,400
By acting like this, indiscriminately killing,

260
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,810
how are you any different

261
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,930
from the Peacock Sect's past actions?

262
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,290
Hypocritical.

263
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,290
All you are talking about is righteousness and morality.

264
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,200
Zhiyang,

265
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,840
you've been deceived by those hypocrites.

266
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,350
I don't blame you.

267
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,630
But I will prove it to you.

268
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,990
What's the use

269
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,040
of keeping an disobedient dog?

270
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,100
Don't you think so?

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,640
Sir,

272
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,610
are we really going to spare Li Muyang's life?

273
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,360
Li Muyang has the Feisun Tally in his hand.

274
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,320
I cannot spare him.

275
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,710
But he is Mr. Qing Jian's younger brother.

276
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,490
I'm afraid...

277
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,750
What are you afraid of?

278
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,800
Qing Jian is just a chess piece

279
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,220
in this game.

280
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
My Lord.

281
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
There's a kid over there.

282
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,680
Bring him here.

283
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,750
Yes.

284
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,680
As long as you come to me,

285
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,870
I'll be there.

286
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,570
Greetings, sir.

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,670
I know what are you thinking.

288
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,550
But remember,

289
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,750
don't let your feelings dictate your actions.

290
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,870
No one can shake my game.

292
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,430
When Qing Jian seizes the throne

293
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,850
and takes the position of the Master,

294
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,800
I can rightfully kill the traitor Qing Jian.

295
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,750
In this way,

296
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,820
this chess piece can be considered as fulfilling its mission.

297
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,550
Muyang, how was your rest?

298
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,950
Last time we played a tune together.

299
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm still missing it.

300
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,370
Today the weather is good.

301
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,890
Shall we play another tune together?

302
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,110
What do you intend

303
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,720
by trapping me here?

304
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,980
It's rare for us brothers to reunite.

305
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,760
Don't you want to be together with me in the same room?

306
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,790
Just tell me what you want to do.

307
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,230
I don't have time to play mind games with you.

308
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,830
What can I do?

309
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,960
I just want to listen to my little brother play the zither.

310
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,329
You don't want to play the zither.

311
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,589
You want to appreciate flowers?

312
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,030
Here all is withered branches and fallen leaves.

313
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,630
What is there to appreciate?

314
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,079
That's easy.

315
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,030
Whatever flowers you want to appreciate,

316
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,359
I will find them for you.

317
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Yuehong flowers.

318
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,390
Qiming herbs.

319
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,319
Baby's breath flowers.

320
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,990
First Frost flowers and roses.

321
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,350
Okay.
