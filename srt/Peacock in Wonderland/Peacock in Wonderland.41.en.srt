[Taining Hall]

5
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,610
Yes.

6
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,310
So beautiful.

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,950
Master.

8
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,640
You're so cruel.

9
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,180
You treated him like that.

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,550
Don't you care about him?

11
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,110
Who is he?

12
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,080
Why should I care about him?

13
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,390
He is your husband.

14
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,160
He was the one who was with you all the time.

15
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't remember

16
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,900
what happened in the past.

17
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,270
If I still love him,

18
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,030
why would I come to you?

19
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,380
Trust me.

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,310
You're the only one in my heart.

21
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,590
Fine.

22
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
I trust you.

23
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,890
Kid,

24
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,070
I know

25
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,560
all your hardships and difficulties.

26
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,750
You've already done a great job.

27
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,110
Father.

28
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,310
Have you ever regretted

29
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,350
adopting me?

30
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,870
At that time,

31
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,350
people around me all told me,

32
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,590
"Are you stupid?

33
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,430
He's covered in wounds. He won't survive."

34
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,310
But I just didn't believe it,

35
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,110
because I saw a seed of perseverance

36
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,270
in your eyes.

37
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,440
As expected,

38
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,870
you didn't bring shame on me.

39
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,730
Son,

40
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,630
I can be your father

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,310
in this life.

42
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
I don't regret it.

43
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,519
I'm content.

44
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,070
But I always feel

45
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,350
that I implicate

46
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,860
all those who love me.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,960
I can't protect anyone, Father.

48
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Muyang,

49
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,070
no matter what happens to you or

50
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,950
what difficulties you run into in the future,

51
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,230
whether I'm by your side or not,

52
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,870
you can't abandon the seed in your heart.

53
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,590
As long as you water

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,990
and fertilize it diligently,

55
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,450
and put it in the sunshine,

56
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,700
the seed will eventually sprout

57
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,600
and bloom.

58
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,310
I believe in Hua Ni's love for you.

59
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,760
She is not a betrayer.

60
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,870
I've never doubted her love for me.

61
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,670
Then get up.

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,330
Drink the medicine.

63
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,990
Come on.

64
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,500
The happy event is coming.

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,030
Miss, why aren't you happy?

66
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
What happy event?

67
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,790
Don't you know?

68
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,000
Master is going to marry you.

69
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,580
You'll be the Mistress.

70
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
What did you say?

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,150
Master has issued the order for you two to get married.

72
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,680
They are to choose a lucky day for the wedding.

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,030
Even after many, many times of reincarnation,

74
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,900
remember my eyes.

75
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,260
I will come to you.

76
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,040
Now the Feisun Army is in place;

77
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,550
as long as we give the order,

78
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,750
we can break into the Master's Mansion.

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,670
However...

80
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Hua Ni is under Qing Jian's control.

81
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,270
In this case,

82
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,990
we can't act rashly.

83
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,150
Right now,

84
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,080
we need to wait for an opportunity.

85
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,909
Bad news.

86
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,500
What's wrong?

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,820
There's a notice in the city.

88
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,480
Her Ladyship and Qing Jian are getting married.

89
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,630
My Lord.

90
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Her Ladyship must have been forced.

91
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,070
Muyang,

92
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,860
our priority is to calm down.

93
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,100
We can't act rashly.

94
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,230
The opportunity we've been waiting for

95
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,110
is here.

96
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,390
You may leave.

97
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,490
What's wrong?

98
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,170
To celebrate our upcoming wedding,

99
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,270
I made this wine myself.

100
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,230
Try it.

101
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,590
Not bad.

102
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,390
Are you happy for real?

103
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,660
Of course.

104
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,940
I thought

105
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,030
you would mind that I've been married once.

106
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,290
Since we're in such a good mood today,

107
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,530
how about

108
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,390
we play a game?

109
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,590
What game?

110
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,750
This game

111
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,290
is called "Blind Touch."

112
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,559
If you can guess everything correctly,

113
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
you'll get a reward.

114
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,070
What reward?

115
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,909
Take a guess.

116
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,350
A glass.

117
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,040
Smart.

118
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,250
Well,

119
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,510
what about this?

120
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,790
Hairpin?

121
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,980
You're so smart.

122
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,140
Guess one last time.

123
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,780
What is this?

124
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,020
It's a bit difficult this time.

125
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,180
I need to think for a while.

126
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,340
Think about it.

127
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,100
If you get it right,

128
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,370
you'll be rewarded.

129
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,350
I got it right this time, too.

130
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,070
Hua Ni.

131
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,970
Where is my reward?

132
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,070
Reward?

133
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,490
Drop dead!

134
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,740
Do you really want me to die?

135
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,850
I can't believe Qing Jian is marrying Hua Ni.

136
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,420
My daughter-in-law is really popular.

137
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,270
Uncle Li, you scared me.

138
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,910
You must trust Her Ladyship.

139
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,040
She must have been forced by Qing Jian.

140
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,430
Her Ladyship

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,810
must still love Lord Li.

142
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,430
Of course I know she had no choice.

143
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,470
Lord Li and Master Rong went to do something big.

144
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,560
But they will definitely

145
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,840
save Her Ladyship.

146
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,910
Uncle Li, don't worry.

147
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,910
Rest assured.

148
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,750
Fine.

149
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,350
For the sake of my son,

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,780
even if I have to risk my life,

151
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,290
I'll fight to get my daughter-in-law back!

152
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,020
Get her back!

153
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,570
Moqian,

154
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,140
it snowed again in Peacock City two days ago.

155
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,310
The last time it snowed,

156
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,830
we were still young.

157
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,590
But now,

158
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,730
you're no longer by my side.

159
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,900
Moqian.

160
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,010
Do you know?

161
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,710
We're having a baby.

162
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,790
Unfortunately,

163
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,580
you don't get to see him.

164
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,070
But don't worry.

165
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,820
I will take good care of him.

166
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,190
I thought

167
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,750
I had lost all my loved ones,

168
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,390
but you gave me another loved one.

169
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,500
I thought

170
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,980
I was alone and helpless,

171
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
but my mother gave me strength.

172
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,050
Muyang and Hua Ni

173
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,580
have always been by my side, too.

174
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,510
They've supported me

175
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,620
and helped me.

176
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,150
Hope will never die.

177
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I only hope the world is harmonious.

178
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,080
Let's call our child

179
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,800
Xihe.

180
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,990
Okay?

181
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,630
It's an auspicious date and time.

182
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,090
Good luck and prosperity.

183
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,470
Heaven and earth will be the witness

184
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,910
of this marriage.

185
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,510
Master and Mistress,

186
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,280
please go to the Tower of Sacrifice to Heaven

187
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
to tour the Peacock City

188
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,100
and pray for the people.

189
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,570
How do you feel

190
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,070
now that you're wearing the wedding gown again?

191
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,550
How disgusting!

192
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,270
No matter what you do,

193
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,290
my husband

194
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,230
will always be Li Muyang.

195
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm the one you're marrying tomorrow.

196
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,190
Why are you thinking about those disgusting memories?

197
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,190
Unlike you,

198
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,400
my wedding with Muyang

199
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,350
was blessed by the whole world.

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
Unfortunately,

201
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,240
we couldn't get on the hot air balloon

202
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,900
and tour the entire Peacock City in the air.

203
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,410
Hot air balloon?

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,100
It's not a big deal.

205
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,950
Are you satisfied?

206
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,220
I wish for Master and Mistress

207
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,830
to be of one heart and one mind

208
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,890
and to prosper for five generations.

209
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,420
Look over there.

210
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,220
What is that?

211
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,540
I've never seen that thing before.

212
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,140
Kneel.

213
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,060
Ready to accept Master's gift.

214
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,070
Look.

215
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,510
As long as I want to,

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
everything in this world

217
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,950
will crawl under my feet.

218
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,230
Do you think the power,

219
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,730
status,

220
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,460
and admiration from the people that you have now

221
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,440
are all true?

222
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,310
Who in the world cares about you?

223
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,540
Do you think I care?

224
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,730
It doesn't matter if it's true love or not.

225
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,990
It is never important.

226
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,090
What I want

227
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,510
has always been the result.

228
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,430
Just like you.

229
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,270
Even if you're so unwilling to,

230
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,520
you are still standing here

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,040
and marrying me.

232
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,610
What do you care about?

233
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,610
Do you care about Muyang?

234
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,080
Did you do all this

235
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,530
for revenge

236
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,170
or just to prove to Muyang

237
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,490
that you are right.

238
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,450
Unfortunately,

239
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,450
you can never go back.

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,990
So what?

241
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,810
It doesn't matter.

242
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,670
As long as all of you who have bewitched him

243
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,460
betray him and hurt him,

244
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,200
he will understand

245
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,260
that in this world,

246
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,720
there is no true love or genuine friendship.

247
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,800
Everything is a lie.

248
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,490
I'm the only one

249
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,950
he can rely on.

250
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,790
Qing Jian.

251
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,520
No.

252
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,580
I should call you

253
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,150
Li Zhiyun.

254
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,930
You've been hurt,

255
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,350
so you don't believe in love.

256
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,880
You've been testing humanity,

257
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,250
but the test result

258
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,070
doesn't match your expectations.

259
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,630
So, you refuse to accept it

260
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,850
or admit it,

261
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,300
and you want to ruin all the good things.

262
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,870
Aren't our genuine feelings

263
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,510
love?

264
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,920
I forgot.

265
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,230
You've never been loved by anyone, have you?

266
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,200
You don't know how to love, either, right?

267
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,710
Poor thing.

268
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,050
Do you want to die?

269
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,670
How dare you not accept Master's gift?

270
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,430
Li Zhiyun!

271
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,940
Stop!

272
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,350
They deserve to die.
