[Episode 21]

4
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,870
I thought about it many times.

5
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,370
Could it be Peacock Sect?

6
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,190
We don't know that yet.

7
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,740
Let's just wait for the result to come out.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,000
Peacock Sect

00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,810
might not have the guts.

10
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,910
Greetings, Young Master.

11
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,170
Why did you summon me here?

12
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,130
Young Master, what does this mean?

13
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,090
Ruan Jiushu.

14
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,570
Is Peacock Sect

15
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,450
behind Flowers Kill?

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Young Master.

17
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,079
Flowers Kill has been preventing my sect from doing the right things

18
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,680
and worshiping the true God.

19
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,840
My sect considers it

20
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,920
as a pain in the ass.

21
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
I want to eliminate it very much.

22
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,410
What a good explanation!

23
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,250
Let me ask you.

24
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,890
When the child went missing,

25
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,370
why was there Flowers Kill's mark at the scene?

26
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,550
Do you suspect Flowers Kill has colluded with my sect?

27
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,900
How do you explain this?

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,090
Nonsense.

29
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,450
No need to explain.

30
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,450
You just lost your mother.

31
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,050
You're heartbroken.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,980
I also understand how you feel.

33
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,130
But Young Master, think carefully.

34
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,060
It's a century-old tradition to offer a sacrifice and worship the God.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,600
There has never been a flower mark before.

36
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,160
Why would we make an unnecessary move this time?

37
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,650
My sect disdains to work with Flowers Kill,

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,340
let alone framing it.

39
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,290
Young Master,

40
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,329
for a century, Peacock City and Peacock Sect

41
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,810
have balanced

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,579
and protected each other.

43
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,620
They are in the same boat

44
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,480
and share the same fate.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,860
Now that Master Rong passed away,

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,520
you should ascend the throne as soon as possible

47
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,530
to appease the people.

48
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,810
Young Master, you will rule the city-state.

49
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,170
Peacock Sect will help you.

50
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,050
You care about the people.

51
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,510
I'm sure you don't want to spoil the harmony between us.

52
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,210
Young Master,

53
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,090
if there's nothing else,

54
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,130
I'll take my leave.

55
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,130
Young Master,

56
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,410
don't believe her.

57
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,769
Look.

58
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,330
This is the evidence of He Huan's plot against me.

59
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,440
He Huan and I haven't got along well.

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,730
But he was released not long ago.

61
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't think he has the guts to cause any trouble.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,700
Ruan Jiushu must have instigated him.

63
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,090
Peacock Sect has committed many crimes.

64
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,640
You should be wary of them.

65
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm afraid the master's death

66
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,020
also has something to do with them.

67
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,610
Young Master.

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,130
I know you were wronged.

69
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,770
But now,

70
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,310
it's not the time to seek justice.

71
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,780
My mother just passed away.

72
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,660
The public sentiment is unstable.

73
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,640
I need the help of Peacock Sect

74
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,530
to become the new master.

75
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,570
Right now,

76
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,530
the most important thing is to appease the people.

77
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,170
Hua Ni,

78
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,150
I will seek justice for you in the future.

79
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,010
But...

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,820
Young Master is right.

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,250
The priority now

82
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,480
is to have a new master

83
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,510
to take charge of the overall situation.

84
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,570
The Ministry of Rites

85

and Peacock Sect

86
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,070
should hold the succession ceremony together.

87

93
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,970
When I was little, I heard

people who died

95
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,090
will be reincarnated with burdens.

96
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,130
If he carries too many tears from the mortal world,

97
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,970
he will walk too slowly

98
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,230
and can't find the way to reincarnation.

99
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,660
If Master Rong sees you crying so sadly,

100
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,620
she wouldn't rest in peace.

101
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,310
This teardrop hasn't fallen.

102

Now

106
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,909
is not the time to be sad.

107

no matter what happens,

109
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,030

I've asked Sanqing Tower to practice divination.

It'll be an auspicious day in seven days.

114

I'm here to tell you

119

that you don't have to take Master Rong's last wish seriously.

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,690
Last wish? What last wish?

121

my mother wrote it when she was alive.

125

But before she had time to announce it,

126

she...

127
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,970
What?

128
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,730
Master Rong bestowed a marriage to Moqian and Young Master Rong?

129
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,660
Mother has never mentioned this to me.

130
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,170
Young Master, you don't need to force yourself.

whether it's true or not,

133
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,770
it's not as important as your own feelings.

Muyang, let me ask you.

145
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,010
Do you want me to marry Moqian?

146
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,410
Why are you asking me?

147
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,450
You should ask your own heart.

148
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,160
My heart?

We grew up together.

There is no secret between us.

All these years,

156
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,970
liking you has become a habit of mine.

157
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,630
But within just a few days,

158
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,970
my mother left me.

159
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,330
Even we

160
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,380
will have nothing to do with each other in the future.

161
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,610
Why does fate treat me like this?

162
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,520
As your friend and subordinate,

163
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,130
in the future,

164
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,830
I will still be by your side

165
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,420
and do my best to assist you.

166
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,450
But that's all I can do.

167
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,610

168
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,770
For yourself

169
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,810
and the people,

170
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,310
you should look ahead.

171
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,540
Don't be troubled by the past.

172
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,610
You're not even willing to tell me a lie.

173
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,530
You should be in charge

174
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,730
of Young Master's succession ceremony.

175
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,370
You have to do your best.

176
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,210
Don't make any mistake.

177
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,550
Do you understand?

178
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,550
I can do that.

179
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,890
But I...

180
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,050
I know you don't know the etiquette.

181
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,720
So I asked He Huan

182
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,180
to teach you the rules about the ceremony.

183
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,690
Can you ask someone else to teach me, Chief?

184
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,450
I cultivated He Huan myself.

185
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,090
He knows all kinds of rules the best.

186
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,880
He's the most suitable person to teach you.

187
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,540
Chief,

188
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,810
I will complete the task.

189
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,410
You?

190
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,490
Teach me?

191
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,530
What's wrong? Of course I'll teach you.

192
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,850
Since you are the Holy Envoy of our sect,

193
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,890
you should

194
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,490
keep personal grudges separate from this important matter.

195
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,210
Also,

196
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,960
there are many grudges between He Huan and you.

197
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,850
You should take this opportunity to clear up the misunderstandings

198
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,010
and improve the relationship between you.

199
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,050
In the future, you two should

200
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,490
work together

201
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,270
to handle the sect's affairs.

202
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,810
-Yes.
-Yes.

203
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,610
Is this what you want to teach me?

204
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,210
Of course.

205
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,970
The succession ceremony will attract much public attention.

206
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,090
You're always careless

207
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,130
and ill-mannered.

208
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,920
If you lose your manners at the ceremony,

209
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,980
it will be a disgrace to Peacock Sect.

210
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,090
If you don't want to listen to me,

211
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,890
you can report it to Chief.

212
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,450
You...

213
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,570
Stand still for four hours.

214
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,170
Don't move.

215
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,770
I won't stand still with a bowl on my head

216
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,050
for four hours.

217
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,150
You don't want to teach me.

218
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,380
Someone is willing to teach me.

219
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,660
-Where is Lord Li?
-Your Excellency.

220
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,860
Lord Li is over there.

221
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,250
Shouldn't you be learning

222
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,570
the etiquette in Peacock Sect?

223
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,130
What?

224
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,370
Are you slacking off again?

225
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,690
Who is slacking off?

226
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,090
I want to learn earnestly.

227
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,610
But he doesn't want to teach me.

228
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,690
You know what?

229
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,910
Ruan Jiushu asked He Huan to teach me.

230
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,650
What can He Huan teach me?

231
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,800
He just asked me to balance a bowl on my head.

232
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,770
He didn't teach me anything.

233
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,410
He just doesn't want to teach me.

234
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,120
So,

235
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,860
you want me to teach you?

236
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,000
Lord Li,

237
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,240
you are so smart.

238
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,730
You can tell what I'm thinking immediately.

239
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,420
Lord Li, you are knowledgeable.

240
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,170
Can you teach me?

241
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,930
It's not difficult to teach you.

242
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,720
But

243
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,430
you should teach me something in return.

244
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,230
Holy Envoy, why don't you

245
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,810
think about what you can teach me?

246
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,540
Then I will solve your problem.

247
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,640
That's easy.

248
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,710
You've been calculating the items

249
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,930
for the ceremony these days,

250
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,450
right?

251
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,160
You must be deeply troubled.

252
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,250
I have a good idea

253
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,810
that can easily help you calculate

254
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,340
the amount of items needed.

255
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,740
Take this as an example.

256
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,770
If you want to know how many long and short tables

257
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,960
are needed for the officials,

258
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,850
one equation is enough to solve the problem.

259
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,920
We already know

260
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,560
there will be 224 officials.

261
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,210
We need to customize 50 tables in total.

262
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,370
A long table can accommodate six people, and a short table can accommodate four people.

263
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,500
So let's make the number of long tables

264
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,140
A

265
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,330
and the number of short tables B.

266
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,010
So A plus B equals 50.

267
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,650
50 minus A equals B.

268
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,670
So 6A plus 4B

269
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,660
equals 224.

270
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,250
Then let's do reverse deduction.

271
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,040
We can find out that A is 12

272
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,370
and B is 38.

273
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,750
So we know

274
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,370
12 long tables

275
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,450
and 38 short tables are needed.
