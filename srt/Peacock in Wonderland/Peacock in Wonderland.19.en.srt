00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,860
-We did it!
-Great. We did it!

5
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,539
Great!

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,820
We are indeed awesome.

7
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,740
Thank you, Lord Li.

8
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,729
Right,

9
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,250
this is the drawing of the waterwheel and water channel.

10
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,890
As long as you build them according to this drawing,

11
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,020
within half of a day,

12
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,440
everyone in the town will have water to use.

13
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,580
Thank you.

14
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,130
Lord Li, your plan is very careful this time.

15
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,500
The design is quite exquisite.

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,259
I don't think it can be drawn within just one or two days.

17
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,220
When did you draw it?

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,080
I had this drawing many years ago.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
It finally comes in handy today.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,400
Lord Li deserves his reputation.

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,090
Great!

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,699
Everyone can have water to use now.

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,100
We have water!

24
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,410
We have water!

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,150
-We have water!
-Holy Envoy is amazing.

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,100
If possible,

27
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,270
I really want to stay here with you.

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,140
But something happened to Moon Pavilion.

29
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,620
I need to deal with it myself.

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,470
I understand.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,410
Thank you for your help this time.

32
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,910
When I return to Peacock City,

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll find a way to repay you.

34
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,460
Do you really want to repay me?

35
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,540
I

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,870
always repay other people's kindness.

37
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,620
This is what I want.

38
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,020
This is not enough.

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,200
When I return to Peacock City,

40
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,550
I'll treat you to delicious food.

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,810
I'll keep that in mind.

42
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,510
My Lord.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,720
Qing Jian did his best to help us.

44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,290
Why are you guarding against him?

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,820
He didn't come here just for disaster relief.

46
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,940
These days,

47
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,110
keep an eye on Holy Envoy.

48
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,710
Holy Envoy has found the water source

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,970
and addressed the drought in Lisha Town.

50
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,190
She really is the mascot

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,430
bestowed by the Peacock God to Peacock City-State.

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,420
The stream well idea of Holy Envoy and Lord Li

53
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,620
is really wonderful.

54
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,790
With this method,

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,190
the three towns in the north won't be troubled by drought anymore.

56
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,329
With such a talent,

57
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,950
Master, you'll surely prosper the city-state.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,680
It's a blessing for the people.

59
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,220
Good.

Mother.

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,030
Muyang and Holy Envoy made great contributions.

62
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,220
You should reward them generously.

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,220
Of course.

64
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,070
When Holy Envoy comes back,

65
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,579
I will reward her generously.

66
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,310
Mother,

67
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,100
don't forget to reward Muyang.

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,910
Don't worry.

69
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,110
Your Muyang won't suffer any loss.

70
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,750
I know what he should be rewarded with.

71
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,030
[Senior, since Hua Ni went for disaster relief, everything has been going well. They have addressed the drought by opening a well to find the source of water.]

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,030
[I, Junior He Huan, wish you all the best.]

73
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,510
She addressed the drought.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
She's more popular now.

75
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,630
Now everyone praises her for saving the country and the people.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,560
Who still remembers Peacock Sect?

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,000
Tell He Huan

78
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,740
to take action immediately.

79
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,350
Yes.

82
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,900
Bye. Come again.

83
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,590

84
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,290
I'm thirsty.

85
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,580
Give me a cup of water.

86
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,990
Thank you.

87
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
Lai?

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,390
Lai?

89
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,250
Lord Li.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,540
Why are you here?

91
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,260
Lai needs to keep an eye on He Huan these days.

92
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,190
So I

93
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,100
will take care of your daily life.

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,020
Thank you, Lord Li.

95
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,390
Your Excellency, please.

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,540
Lord Li.

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,570
I want to tie a bow.

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
A bow?

99
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,620
This is called a bow.

100
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,880
Can you do it?

101
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,270
It's easy.

102
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,659
Your Excellency, are you satisfied?

103
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,940
Lord Li, you're really a fast learner.

104
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,860
In that case, let's go.

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,270
Sir, Master Rong is here.

106
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,200
Greetings, Master.

107
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,260
Don't stand on ceremony.

108
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,720
Thank you, Master.

109
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,630
Today, I came here privately

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,440
for something important.

111
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,270
What can I do for you, Master?

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,430
It's about Yu.

113
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,000
Young Master Rong?

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,950
What's wrong with her?

115
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,110
Li Muyang went for disaster relief and made contributions.

116
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,840
I want to take this opportunity

117
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
to bestow a marriage upon them.

118
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,540
You've been in charge of

119
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,060
Yu's clothes.

120
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,810
So I want you

121
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,220
to make a wedding dress for her.

122
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,050
Yes, Master.

123
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,020
I want to give Yu a surprise.

124
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,230
So,

125
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,910
don't tell anyone about it.

126
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,110
I understand.

127
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,420
I will keep my mouth shut.

128
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,500
The longan is so sweet.

129
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,110
Lord Li,

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,980
why did you bring me here?

131
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,280
What happened to this family?

132
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,070
There are seals on the door.

133
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,860
This is where

134
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,460
Peacock Sect

135
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,620
killed my parents 20 years ago.

136
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,660
You bastards!

137
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,420
No!

138
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,980
No!

139
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,790
The kid is long gone.

140
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,960
Don't ever expect to find him.

141
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,430
No wonder you hate Peacock Sect so much.

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,030
It turns out

143
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,610
you were hurt by the sacrifice.

144
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,020
Fortunately,

145
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,970
the ritual of sacrifice has been abolished.

146
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,700
Your tragedy won't happen again.

147
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,060
In the past, when the tree's flowers bloomed,

148
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,390
the fragrance was everywhere in the yard.

149
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
But now it's like this.

150
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,660
What's wrong?

151
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,980
There's incense burning.

152
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,460
Except you,

153
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120

Thank you, Your Excellency.

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,750
Thank you, Lord Li.

157
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,610
Thank you for saving the people of Lisha Town.

please accept my bow.

Don't.

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,520
if Lisha Town is in trouble again,

164

just report to Peacock City.

Have a safe journey.

169
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,250
Take care, Lord Liu.

170

Have a safe journey.

173
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,690
Have a safe journey.

-Thank you, My Lords.

Have a safe journey.

182
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,260
It was so bumpy.

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,070
Just tell her it was prepared by Lai.

191
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,580
Don't tell her it was prepared by me.

192
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,190
Okay.

193
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,460
Holy Envoy.

194
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you asleep, Holy Envoy?

195
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,520
My Lord, Holy Envoy is not here.

196
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,830
Cool Guy.

197
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,230
Where are you?

198
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,530
This is strange. There must be something wrong.

199
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,580
I'd better leave.

200
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,080
Don't come over.

201
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,470
What do you want?

202
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,390
What do you want?

203
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,880
You look pretty.

204
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,640
-Let me take a good look.
-Let go of me!

205
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,520
Let go of me!

206
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,950
Li Muyang!

207
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,970
It's okay. I'm here.

208
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,760
No one can hurt you.

217

229

There is an aphrodisiac in the incense burner.

230
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
She has to soak her body in hot water.

231
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,180
She can recover after the poison comes out with her sweat.

Holy Envoy, you're awake.

263
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,839
How are you feeling now?

264
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,020
Now, I...

265
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,599
It was thanks to Lord Li last night.

266
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,869
Otherwise, you would have been hurt.

267
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,310
Hurt?

268
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,020
Where is Lord Li?

269
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,450
Holy Envoy, how are you feeling now?

270
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,680
Now I'm...

271
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,660
fine.

272
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,420
I'm very energetic.

273
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,860
I can run and jump.

274
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,070
Why did you go out alone last night?

275
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,740
Actually, I received a message

276
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,900
from Qing Jian yesterday.

277
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,720
That's why I went out last night.

278
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,930
Now it seems

279
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,260
I... fell into a trap.

280
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,860
I've asked Qiang to investigate it thoroughly.

281
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
The man last night

282
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,510
was an orphan with no home, job, or parents.

283
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,280
Qiang found a bag of silver

284
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,380
in his house.

285
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,820
Looks like

286
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,100
someone lured him with money

287
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,060
to hurt you.

288
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,070
What man?

289
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,430
Don't you remember

290
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,100
what happened last night?
