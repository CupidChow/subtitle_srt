00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,690
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,160
The atmosphere here

5
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,460
make me want to write my test papers.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,340
Ladies.

7
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm the author of the Qingjiang Collections.

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,150
I'm known as the God of Poetry in Peacock City-State.

9
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,940
We are honored by your presence here.

10
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,300
I would like to write a poem for you.

11
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,870
Good.

12
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,180
The first time I played the Chinese lute.

13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,990
Its music touched the fairies in the sky.

14
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,350
You two came from afar.

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,650
I'm so happy to see you here.

16
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,130
I'd like to play the guqin

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,740
to please you.

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,030
Ladies, you look like elegant girls who are talented

19
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,160
and well-educated.

20
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,540
I'd like to draw a portrait of you.

21
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,510
Good.

22
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,600
I know something about painting.

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,540
There is a wound on the assassin's collarbone.

24
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,670
Pay attention to it.

25
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,829
It's said you're all very talented.

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,329
I admire you very much.

27
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,410
I'd like to

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,390
propose a toast to all of you.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,700
-We need to drink?
-We'll drink?

30
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,350
My master appreciates your talents.

31
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,700
Don't be nervous.

32
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,260
You just need to drink three cups of wine

33
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,860
to show your politeness.

34
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,870
-Three cups?
-Three cups?

35
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,140
That's too much wine.

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,140
I don't drink.

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,180
Come on.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,900
Miss, I really don't drink.

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,579
Sorry I don't drink.

40
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,710
Come on, drink some.

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,600
Sir, have a cup.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,420
Let me pour wine myself.

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,820
Let me propose a toast to you, talented men.

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,030
-Sir, let me pour wine for you.
-Miss.

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,090
Let me do it myself.

46
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,470
Let me propose another toast to you.

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,030
Let's continue.

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,360
Miss, are you alright?

49
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,900
My Lady, you're still recovering from your illness.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,770
You can't drink.

51
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,420
This...

52
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,340
It's okay.

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,860
It's my pleasure

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
to drink with the gentlemen.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,260
You don't look well.

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,790
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

57
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,240
Hurry.

58
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,329
Close the windows.

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,750
Get some charcoal here and burn it.

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,630
-Hurry.
-Okay.

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,650
My Lady.

62
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,760
Is she okay?

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,590
Are you okay?

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,480
How come none of them have a wound on their collarbones?

65
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,440
I don't know.

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,230
The assassin isn't here?

67
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,420
Let's keep waiting.

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,520
Moon Pavilion is really special.

69
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,630
It's just a tea house but there are so many guards here.

70
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,380
It's heavily guarded here.

71
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,500
We shouldn't barge in.

72
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,980
We need to be more careful.

73
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,159
What should we do next?

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,740
We've been here for so long but haven't found any clues yet.

75
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,260
Maybe the assassin's not here.

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,820
Muyang.

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,620
Young Master.

78
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,310
Holy Envoy, how is your investigation going?

79
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,340
Your tricks are smart.

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,710
Let's go.

81
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,020
Let's go downstairs.

82
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,790
Let's go.

83
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,750
The Contest of Intelligence

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,660
now begins.

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Why is the painting being hung here?

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,450
Moon Pavilion

87
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,060
holds a Contest of Intelligence here every month.

88
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,500
Participants can have matches of lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,470
The work of the winner

90
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,470
will be hung in the lobby for a month.

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,790
You two came on the right day.

92
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,650
Today, we're holding the Contest of Intelligence.

93
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,550
This is the battle of the best brains.

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,270
I need to find a good seat.

95
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,190
Mr. Qing Jian comes.

96
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,390
Mr. Qing Jian is here.

97
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,330
That is a Feitian leap.

98
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,600
Moon Pavilion is really a special place.

99
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Who is Mr. Qing Jian?

100
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,480
So many people know him.

101
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,950
Mr. Qing Jian is the most talented man in Moon Pavilion.

102
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,390
He's also the owner of Moon Pavilion.

103
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,670
He's very talented

104
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,820
and elegant.

105
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,230
Many dignitaries in the city

106
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,260
spent much money on him but still didn't get to see his face.

107
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,940
If you can win the Contest of Intelligence,

108
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,510
you'll win Mr. Qing Jian's recognition

109
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,580
and get to see his face.

110
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,660
This is another example of hunger marketing.

111
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,140
Many celebrities tend to use this strategy.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,420
The Contest of Intelligence now begins.

113
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,110
Who would like to have a try?

114
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,950
Me.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,040
It's a child.

116
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,760
He's not tall,

117
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,870
but he's brave.

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,740
That's right.

119
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,340
Kid.

120
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,120
What would you like to show us?

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,630
My name is Shen Tong.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,940
I heard there were many talents here.

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,480
I'd like to compete with you.

124
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,659
He's brave.

125
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,790
This painting is a good one that shows childlike innocence.

126
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,140
This kid is really interesting.

127
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,910
The kid must have impressed Mr. Qing Jian.

128
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,460
You're really a wonder boy.

129
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,140
But you're too young.

130
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,020
You need to improve your skills.

131
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,950
Keep practicing

132
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
and you'll see Mr. Qing Jian one day.

133
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,760
Anyone else

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,940
wants to have a try?

135
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,150
I major in science

136
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,340
and didn't learn any arts.

137
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,020
I can talk about something about the governance of a country.

138
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm not good at

139
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,280
lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy or painting at all.

140
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,030
Okay.

141
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,700
Since no one wants to have a try,

142
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,500
I announce tonight's Contest of Intelligence...

143
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,340
Miss.

144
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,860
What are you doing?

145
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,820
Do you...

146
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm raising my hand for him.

147
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,170
What are you doing?

148
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,030
Do it for Flowers Kill.

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,830
Lord Li is an artist.

150
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,590
Apart from you,

151
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,540
no one can get to him to take off his mask.

152
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,260
Go and show your talent.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,140
Don't be afraid, My Lord.

154
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,770
Go!

155
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,550
Muyang.

156
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,150
You can do it.

157
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,830
You can do it.

158
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,560
You can do it.

159
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,880
Come on, Lord Li.

160
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,590
Please.

161
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,220
I trust you, Lord Li.

162
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,590
Lord Li, please.

163
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,340
Come on.

164
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,620
Have a try, Lord Li.

165
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,330
[Clear and Clean]

166
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,630
Sir.

167
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,600
Please lend me your sword.

168
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,030
Muyang is so amazing.

169
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,120
He can always impress people.

170
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
My Lord is amazing.

171
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,090
No one can beat him.

172
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,000
This work is really exquisite.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,100
It's fantastic.

174
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,820
Your swordsmanship is excellent.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,220
Although it's a good work,

176
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,420
this peacock is still a wooden peacock.

177
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,280
It doesn't have vitality.

178
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,410
What?

179
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,710
This work is so excellent.

180
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,310
You're still not satisfied?

181
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,340
How come?

182
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,840
Don't move.

183
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,590
Very good.

184
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,580
You are indeed extraordinary.

185
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,190
You made me want to compete with you.

186
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,580
I got the first line of an incomplete couplet the other day.

187
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,550
It bothers me that I couldn't think of a line to match it.

188
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,070
If you can come up with a line to match it,

189
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,590
I'll invite you to my room.

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,550
What is the line?

191
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,980
The line is,

192
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,190
I held a flagon when visiting the West Lake

193
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,710
and the flagon dropped into the West Lake;

194
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,850
what a pity.

195
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,670
Why are you raising your hand again?

196
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,470
I haven't come up with a line yet.

197
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,590
I learned physics

198
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,410
when walking in the fog

199
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,560
and the physics explains the fog;

200
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,990
why not ignore physics?

201
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,870
What does it mean?

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
I have no idea.

203
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,460
What a clever line.

204
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,110
But I don't know what physics is.

205
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,790
What is physics?

206
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,950
Physics

207
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,310
is the study

208
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,700
of the laws and principles that govern everything.

209
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
The rise and fall of the sun and the moon,

210
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,990
the movement of stars,

211
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,940
and the climate that favors the crops,

212
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,120
can all be explained by physics.

213
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,030
Cheer.

214
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,070
Oh, I see.

215
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,940
Since physics is so important and magical,

216
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,380
why don't you study it?

217
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,660
Why should we ignore it?

218
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,050
Because it's too complicated.

219
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,580
It's hard to understand and hard to learn.

220
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,340
You don't have to force yourself to understand it.

221
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,020
Good.

222
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,020
Good.

223
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,060
That's a good line.

224
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,260
Good! Good!

225
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,930
Very good.

226
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,910
You're so interesting.

227
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,790
If you would like to,

228
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,120
please go upstairs and have a talk with me.

229
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,350
Great!

230
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,270
Miss, please.

231
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,030
You only have thirty minutes.

232
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,880
That's too short.

233
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes.

234
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,120
This is the rule of Moon Pavilion.

235
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,310
Mr. Qing Jian hardly sees people.

236
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,710
If you can win his favor,

237
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,660
you'll have more chances to stay with him.

238
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,110
Okay.

239
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,920
Wait, Miss.

240
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,670
What now?

241
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,100
Miss, as you can see, every day,

242
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,380
there are so many people

243
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,860
who want to see Mr. Qing Jian.

244
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,420
If you want to make a deep impression on him

245
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,060
and get him to remember you,

246
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,300
you'll need something to help you.

247
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,310
What is that?

248
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,750
Look.

249
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,710
Mr. Qing Jian's favorite color is green.

250
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,850
If you wear this green hairpin,

251
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,030
you'll get Mr. Qing Jian's attention.

252
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,860
If you don't like the hairpin,

253
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,460
I also have

254
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,910
the Yunfu sandalwood that Mr. Qing Jian likes very much.

255
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,750
If you don't like the Yunfu sandalwood,

256
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,710
I also have this pair of pear-blossom earrings.

257
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,190
Mr. Qing Jian likes pear blossoms very much.

258
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,080
If you wear these earrings,

259
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,640
Mr. Qing Jian will treat you as his confidant.

260
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,820
Stop trying to sell these things to me.

261
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,070
Now I know

262
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,830
why Moon Pavilion is thriving.

263
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,220
You all have contributed a lot.

264
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,980
I need to make money to support my family.

265
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,850
Miss.

266
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,690
[Qing Jian, Owner of Moon Pavilion]

267
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,270
No wonder your name is Qing Jian.

268
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,750
You're a handsome young man.

269
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,100
You are so interesting.

270
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,100
Thank you.

271
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,860
It's hot in here.

272
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,320
You can take off your mask.

273
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,070
Take off my mask?

274
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,050
I don't think it's a good idea.

275
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,890
Why not?

276
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,710
I'm showing my face to you.

277
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,640
What are you worried about?

278
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,310
Oh, you're Holy Envoy.

279
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,850
Nice to meet you.

280
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm so famous?

281
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,460
You prayed for rains and blessings for Peacock City-State.

282
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,760
I've been admiring you for a long time.

283
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,910
Of course I can recognize you.

284
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,190
If I had known you were Holy Envoy,

285
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,470
I wouldn't have let you answer the question.

286
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,390
Actually,

287
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,830
I've long heard about you.

288
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,420
So I came to see you today.

289
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,070
Have a seat, Holy Envoy.

290
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,590
It's said you bathed in fire and came

291
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,190
and are the Peacock God's maid.

292
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,070
Is that true?

293
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,620
Of course.

294
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,710
You must have an important mission

295
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,460
and need to work hard for Peacock City-State.

296
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,940
Aren't you tired?

297
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,740
Yes.

298
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,240
But it doesn't matter.

299
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,380
Everyone has their own mission.

300
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,360
Maybe

301
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,260
I was born to be a person who has to work all the time.

302
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,860
Holy Envoy, you are not only righteous,

303
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,460
but also knowledgeable.

304
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,340
That incomplete couplet bothered me for a long time.

305
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,140
I spent much time thinking of a line to make it complete but in vain.

306
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,640
I didn't expect that you would think of a perfect line in such a short time.

307
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,040
I was impressed.

308
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,770
Let me propose a toast to you with the tea.

309
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,420
I came up with that line by luck.

310
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,590
You're really talented.

311
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,140
Here.

312
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,340
A toast to you.

313
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I was so careless.

314
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,950
If you hadn't been quick enough,

315
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,430
I would have made your clothes dirty.

316
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,490
It doesn't matter.

317
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,030
Cool Guy.

318
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,349
I think the outfit you're wearing is pretty.

319
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,030
Can I borrow it?

320
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,750
This outfit is an old one.

321
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,510
How can I give it to you?

322
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,310
If you like it,

323
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,790
I have a new one.

324
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,020
I can give that to you.

325
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,940
Well.

326
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,900
Thank you.

327
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,300
Looks like I have to try my last method.

328
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,870
You sit a lot to read.

329
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,700
You must have a sore waist, right?

330
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,700
Kind of.

331
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,220
Well.

332
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,830
That's a symptom of lumbar muscle degeneration.

333
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,030
Come, sit over there.

334
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,790
Let me show you what I'm good at.

335
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,380
Let me give you a shoulder and neck massage.
