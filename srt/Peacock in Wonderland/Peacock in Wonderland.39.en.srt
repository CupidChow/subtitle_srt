00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,670
Welcome, Chief.

5
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,360
Chief.

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Are we really leaving Peacock City?

7
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,830
That announcement has been made.

8
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,910
The reputation of Peacock Sect will be all ruined.

9
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,680
How can Peacock Sect continue to exist in the world?

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,800
The Peacock Sect has existed for over a century.

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,130
We have never suffered such humiliation.

12
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,950
So many bad things have happened to us.

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,160
Our reputation has also been seriously damaged.

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,560
That's why I had to make that announcement.

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,360
Chief, please lead the disciples

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
to regain our reputation.

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,700
We'll regain our reputation!

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,270
Since the founding of the Peacock Sect,

19
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,590
the Peacock Sect and Peacock City-State have been interconnected.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,070
The Peacock Sect is blessed by gods.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,440
Without the Peacock Sect,

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,920
Peacock City-State wouldn't have existed.

Have you forgotten

103
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,730
that we used to set fireworks together when we were kids?

104
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,010
Today's explosions

105
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,130
are not as splendid as the fireworks we saw back then.

106
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,930
Are you crazy?

107
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,460
They are all living people.

for making gunpowder to make bombs to dig wells,

111
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,290
I wouldn't have been able to make explosions in the city.

112
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,420
It's all thanks to you.

113
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,960
This is the gunpowder I've been testing these days.

114
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,260
Can you help me make more gunpowder

115
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,520
according to formula?

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,850
Thank you.

117
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,930
Sure.

118
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,150
I'll help you do it.

This is a blessing

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,880
They must accept it.

122
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,030
It's so much gunpowder.

123
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,220
How did you transport it into the city?

124
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,290
Good question.

125
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,659
It's because Peacock Sect helped me a lot.

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,700
The Peacock Sect who claims to work for the country and the people

127
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,170
helped me transport the gunpowder.

Chief, bad news!

129
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,900
What happened?

130
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,470
Bombs were exploding all around the city.

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,400
Those from Moon Pavilion invaded Master's Mansion.

132
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,260
Got it. You may leave.

133
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,000
To collaborate with me

134
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,580
is the last chance

135
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,140
for Peacock Sect to rise.

136
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,540
The Peacock won't commit such a sin.

137
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,220
Chief, you must be joking.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,870
You want to do good deeds,

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
but no one appreciates what you did.

140
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,460
Are you really going to

How could you collude with Peacock Sect?

My wish will come true even if you don't want it to happen.

160

Open your eyes and look carefully.

161

Look.

-We can't stay here any longer!
-Let go of me!

As the master of Peacock City-State，

even if I die here,

171

I can't let him harm the people!

173

Run! Hurry!

Hurry!

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,130
Run!

181
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,140
Watch out!

182
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,140
Get out first.

183
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,380
Hurry up. Be careful.

184
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,220
Hurry up!

185
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,890
What a jerk.

186
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,570
How dare you lie to me!

187
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,080
I've imagined this

188
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,340
countless times.

189
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,010
Finally, it's happening.

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,400
You said I lied to you.

191
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,810
I just said

192
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,980
without Peacock Sect, Peacock City-State shouldn't continue to exist.

193
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,090
I never said

194
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,170
Peacock Sect should continue to exist.

195
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,210
The Peacock Sect and Moon Pavilion are not enemies.

196
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,330
Why are you doing this?

197
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,130
Shut up!

198
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,050
We are not enemies?

199
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,700
Twenty years ago,

200
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,420
at the Lisha Town...

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,110
Lisha Town?

202
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,100
You jerks!

203
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,810
No!

204
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,670
You were a child who escaped from Lisha Town?

205
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,080
You didn't die?

206
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,050
Maybe it was because the Peacock Gods didn't like me.

207
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,960
I used to like a bug in a peacock's mouth

208
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,020
and the peacock could kill me easily.

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,930
But now the bug is biting off

210
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,460
the peacock's neck bit by bit.

211
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,890
Isn't it interesting?

212
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,470
Let me ask you.

213
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,490
Now you end up like this.

214
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,270
Do you regret what you did to me?

215
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,450
Do you regret it?

216
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,700
Peacock Gods are my gods.

217
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
Their spirit will never disappear.

218
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,340
I uphold truths for them.

219
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,170
I'll never regret it.

220
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,940
Fine.

221
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,310
Then die!

222
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,330
I was born as a servant for Peacock Gods.

223
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,040
After I die, my soul will guard them.

224
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,190
I do my best,

225
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,610
work tirelessly,

226
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,690
and sacrifice everything for my gods.

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
I devote my whole life to my gods.

228
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,730
I'll never betray my gods.

229
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,860
Never!

230
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,410
Yu.

231
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,390
Kill him!

232
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,790
Kill him!

233
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,500
Yu.

234
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,600
Yu.

235
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,870
-Kill him!
-Yu.

236
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,400
Yu.

237
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,490
It's okay.

238
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,890
It's me!

239
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,460
Yu.

240
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,940
Why did you take me away?

241
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,620
I'd rather die

242
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,410
than see my people suffer.

243
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,250
He has become the new ruler of the city...

244
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,700
This not your fault.

245
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,780
Yu, Yu.

246
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,180
-Let go of me!
-Yu.

247
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,410
I know you're anxious.

248
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,580
But Qing Jian has controlled the Peacock City.

249
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,640
You'll only get yourself killed if you go confront him.

250
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,370
Mother once taught me

251
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,800
the master of the Peacock City-State

252
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,980
must protect the people.

253
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,110
As the master of Peacock City-State,

254
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,020
how can I run away like a deserter?

255
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,500
But he has gunpowder.

256
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,650
If you provoke him,

257
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,660
he may bomb the city again and injure more people.

258
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,120
Have you thought about it?

259
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,130
Gunpowder?

260
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,790
You taught him how to make gunpowder.

261
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,960
You taught him how to make gunpowder.

262
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,530
If you hadn't,

263
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,960
the people of Peacock City wouldn't have suffered.

264
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,780
Step aside!

265
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,970
Rong Yu.

266
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,260
Hua Nie made gunpowder to dig the well to get water

267
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,460
to save the people.

268
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,910
You know that better than anyone.

269
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,130
Qing Jian is the one who bombed the city.

270
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,820
Even without gunpowder,

271
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,880
he would have thousands of other ways to hurt people.

272
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,940
We saved you.

273
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,720
It doesn't mean we would let you abandon the people.

274
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
We cannot let you

275
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,840
die for the city easily.

276
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,890
It's easy to die.

277
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,540
Anyone can do it.

278
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,020
But you're not a nobody.

279
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,770
You are the master of Peacock City-State.

280
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,390
Your life is not only yours.

281
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,660
but all the people's.

282
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,220
Only if you live

283
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,190
can the people in the city will have hope.

284
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,690
Only if you live

285
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,040
can we have chances to fight back.

286
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,079
Do you understand?

287
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,770
Fight back?

288
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,640
This is the gunpowder I've been testing these days.

289
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,020
Can you help me make more gunpowder

290
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,280
according to formula?

291
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,500
Thank you.

292
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,650
Sure. I'll help you do it.

293
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,580
Without your formula

294
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,270
for making gunpowder to make bombs to dig wells,

295
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,220
I wouldn't have been able to cause explosions in Peacock City.

296
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,550
You taught him how to make gunpowder.

297
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,180
If you hadn't,

298
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,590
the people of Peacock City wouldn't have suffered.

299
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,430
What are you thinking?

300
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,580
Muyang.

301
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,210
Why did Qing Jian

302
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,210
succeed in becoming the master?

303
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,720
Is it that no matter what we do,

304
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,150
we still won't be able to change what will happen in the end?

305
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,980
You're still with me.

306
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,570
This is a change.

307
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,810
But

308
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,050
nothing else has changed

309
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,660
except this.

310
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,370
Qingqing.

311
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,560
Do you trust me?

312
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,700
I trust you.

313
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,300
But...

314
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,270
If you trust me,

315
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,770
don't be too worried.

316
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,650
Just stay with me, okay?
