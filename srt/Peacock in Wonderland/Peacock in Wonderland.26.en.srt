Peacock in Wonderland

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,820
Episode 26

4
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,990
Moon Pavilion

5
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,990
Cool Guy, we're here to bring you the flowers.

6
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,250
You rarely come here.

7
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,740
It's such a great honor for me to have the flowers

8
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,420
I ordered delivered to Moon Pavilion by Lord Li in person.

9
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,509
Mr. Qing Jian,

10
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,300
thank you for buying Guanbuzhu's flowers.

11
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,420
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,530
Well.

13
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,039
I've got new tea at Moon Pavilion.

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,300
Would you like to try?

15
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,860
Sure.

16
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,090
When did you become so friendly to each other?

17
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,820
Mr. Qing Jian and I have always been good friends.

18
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,000
I also see Lord Li as a bosom friend of mine.

19
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,050
Please.

20
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,380
Please.

21
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,560
You play this. Try this one first.

22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,450
Look.

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,420
It's said that you are good at music.

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,650
The Song of Yarn you played in the bamboo grove was melodious.

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,250
You deserve the reputation.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,320
May I ask

27
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,730
where did you learn to play that song?

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
I happened to hear a musician

29
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,310
at Moon Pavilion play that song.

30
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,570
I liked it.

31
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,270
So I learned to play it.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,370
I didn't expect

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,790
that you also knew how to play the song.

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,590
Is there a story about the song and you?

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,820
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
It's said

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,110
very few people know the Song of Yarn.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,450
It was so serendipitous

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,810
that we could play that together that day.

40
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,740
Serendipitous?

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,000
The word just came out of my mouth.

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,140
Thank you.

43
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,340
You're welcome.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,450
Holy Envoy, the outfit you're wearing is quite unique.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,980
In which shop did you buy it?

46
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,170
There's no any other shop that can make a outfit

47
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,930
as good as this one but Yanxia Shop.

48
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,660
Okay.

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Then I'll have a outfit made the same as yours some day.

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,140
The same as this one? I don't think it's a good idea.

51
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,620
Why not?

52
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,780
Because this outfit is custom-made for...

53
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,210
Why is it so hot here?

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,210
It's nearly winter.

55
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,750
How come you feel hot?

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,980
Perhaps it's because your tea is so good

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,670
that it makes me feel warm after I drank it.

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,140
So you're wearing it.

59
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,840
You gave me the outfit.

60
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,970
Of course I would wear it.

61
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,300
I knew you would wear it.

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,730
Let me see.

63
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,290
The best clothes

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,700
are those that fit.

65
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,260
If you really need a new outfit,

66
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,070
I can give you the one in my hand.

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,790
But I only like this one.

68
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,590
You can have

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,750
any other outfit in the world.

70
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,090
But you can't

71
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,940
take this one.

72
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,870
Bye.

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,560
Let's go.

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,610
Bye.

75
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:55,970
Your coat.

76
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,840
Let him have it.

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,780
Muyang.

78
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,140
Muyang.

79
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,140
Muyang.

80
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,050
Muyang.

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,180
Dancing together in the moonlight. Meeting at Yuquan Pavilion. Being secretly attacked by He Huan. Hua Ni hit by an arrow.

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,710
What had happened in the four dreams I had before

83
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,170
all happened in real life.

84
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,620
Will what happened in the dream I had just now...

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,940
Yesterday I went on a date.

86
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,660
Today I have to overwork.

87
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,870
Staying with my boyfriend too much is not good for me.

88
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,980
This is so important that you have to do it well.

89
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,640
I've made three Golden Pills.

90
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,240
Let Master take them tomorrow night.

91
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,500
Yes.

92
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Golden Pills?

93
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,570
I'd better tell Li Muyang about this right now.

94
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,930
Lords, please wait here.

95
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,180
Let me tell Master you've come first.

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,530
It's about Master's health.

97
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,130
Please.

98
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,440
What are those Golden Pills for?

99
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,410
Those from Peacock Sect often make some pills for Master.

100
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,100
They said the pills could prolong a person's life

101
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,190
and make a person young forever.

102
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,580
The stupid Golden Pills can prolong one's life?

103
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,740
If the pills were that magical,

104
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,870
the former master wouldn't have died.

105
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,850
The thing that can

106
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,930
make people live forever and young forever doesn't exist.

107
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,770
If one says it exists, they're lying.

108
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,090
And those pills

109
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,150
contain much sulphur and mercury

110
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,380
and are very harmful to a human's body.

111
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,900
I don't know what they're thinking.

112
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,500
I know the pills are harmful.

113
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,710
So we can't let Master take the pills.

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,570
Lords, please go back.

115
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,980
Master is discussing something important with her guest.

116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,130
It's inconvenient for her to meet you now.

117
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,820
But...

118
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,140
Qian'er.

119
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,300
I made some tonic soup

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,020
for Master.

121
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,159
Master said

122
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,380
no one could see her

123
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,950
before the meeting is over.

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,100
Why is it so hard to see Master now?

125
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,460
Yu has just acceded to the throne.

126
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,120
He's been very busy recently.

127
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,660
Ruan Jiushu is going to give Yu the Golden Pills tonight.

128
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
What should we do?

129
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Master is so smart.

130
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,050
She should be able to tell that Ruan Jiushu has bad intentions.

131
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,330
I guess she won't take the pills.

132
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,650
If Ruan Jiushu colludes with the officials to ask Yu to take the pills,

133
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,050
Yu will have to take them.

134
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,030
Then what should we do?

135
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,510
It's time for Flowers Kill to take action.

136
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,590
But Master hates Flowers Kill very much.

137
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,180
If we take action now,

138
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,790
people will suspect us.

139
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,220
But are we going to just let Yu take the poisonous pills

140
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,820
and do nothing about it?

141
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,650
Calm down.

142
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,460
We'll find a way to deal with it.

143
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,090
It's inconvenient for Flowers Kill to take action.

144
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,090
I'll do it myself.

145
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,260
I won't let anything bad happen to Yu.

146
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,980
Moqian.

147
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,020
Your identity is too special.

148
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,640
You're surrounded by Master's subordinates.

149
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,330
How are you going to stop Ruan Jiushu?

150
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,590
I have no other choice.

151
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,420
Fine.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,980
We just need take away the pills from Ruan Jiushu.

153
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,770
It's not convenient for you to stop her.

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,610
We'll do it.

155
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,290
Okay.

156
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,700
Be careful.

157
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,680
Protect the Golden Pills!

158
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,870
My boyfriend has done a good job.

159
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,840
He's so amazing.

160
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,770
We've fallen into her trap.

161
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,290
Oh no.

162
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,990
How come Master and she...

163
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,170
I can't believe it's you.

164
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,850
Master.

165
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,100
The chief of Flowers Kill is Li Muyang.

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,220
I suspect that

167
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,880
the chief of Flowers Kill

168
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,290
is a person close to you, Li Muyang.

169
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,100
Nonsense.

170
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,750
Muyang is one of my best friends.

171
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,540
I know him well.

172
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,410
Flowers Kill has committed many crimes.

173
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,490
How could he be the chief of Flowers Kill?

174
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,490
Because of the ritual of sacrifices

175
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,680
Li Muyang lost all his families.

176
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,700
The former master

177
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,260
agreed to hold the ritual of sacrifices.

178
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,380
So Li Muyang hates Peacock Sect and the former master.

179
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,970
It's understandable

180
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,280
that he wanted to kill the former master.

181
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,070
This is just your speculation.

182
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,190
You've got no solid evidence to prove that.

183
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,670
If you need evidence,

184
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,780
we can try to find some evidence.

185
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,970
Now,

186
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,180
do you have anything to say to defend yourself?

187
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,420
Lord Li.

188
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,970
If you have a reason to do so,

189
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,210
just tell us.

190
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,290
Master.

191
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,660
This is all a misunderstanding.

192
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,650
You betrayed Peacock Sect.

193
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,570
Kneel down and get arrested.

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,460
What are you doing here?

195
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,400
I want to help you.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,910
Master.

197
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,620
The members of Flowers Kill are here.

198
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,150
Master, please uphold justice for the people

199
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,310
and kill Li Muyang and his followers.

200
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,850
I did everything on my own.

201
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,640
Holy Envoy was forced by me to help me.

202
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,040
I am the chief of Flowers Kill.

203
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,220
I was the child who was sacrificed.

204
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,220
You hate Peacock Sect.

205
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,020
Why did you kill my mother?

206
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,210
I didn't

207
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,410
kill the former master.

208
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,880
How can I trust you?

209
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,540
Don't believe what he said.

210
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,890
Arrest them all

211
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,120
and avenge the former master.

212
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,970
This...

213
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,790
Seal the whole city.

214
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,090
Arrest them!

215
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,370
-Yes.
-Yes.

216
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,920
This way.

217
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,810
Okay.

218
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,590
Two over there.

219
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,170
Okay.

220
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,780
Not there.

221
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,410
What about you?

222
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,010
No there.

223
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,280
They have escaped.

224
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,470
Li's Mansion is empty.

225
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,600
The fugitives are nowhere to be found.

226
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,960
I'll report this to Master first.

227
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,540
Uncle Li.

228
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,560
Lai.

229
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,970
Tell me the truth.

230
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,000
What did we do?

231
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,900
Why are we running away in such a hurry?

232
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,660
Uncle Li.

233
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
I can't explain to you.

234
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,910
Father, do you know Flowers Kill?

235
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,850
Isn't Flowers Kill the organization

236
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,730
that always goes against Peacock Sect

237
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,330
and kills people cruelly?

238
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,220
Lai, hold my father.

239
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,180
Father.

240
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,030
I am the chief of Flower Killing.

241
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,640
Uncle Li.

242
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,040
Actually,

243
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,680
I am also a member of Flowers Kill.

244
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,530
Uncle Li.

245
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,390
Me too.

246
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,050
Well...

247
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,480
Wherever the Holy Envoy goes,

248
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I'll follow her.

249
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,220
Well...

250
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,300
Should I

251
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,390
join Flowers Kill now?

252
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,220
Father.

253
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,140
Yu knows my identity now.

254
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,300
That's why she sent people to catch us.

255
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,240
Father, I'm sorry,

256
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,920
In the following days,

257
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,090
you have to run away with us.

258
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,460
Now,

259
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,210
I can only run away with you.

260
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,810
By the way,

261
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,290
is Mount Cuifeng nearby?

262
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,530
Mount Cuifeng?

263
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,400
That is Mount Cuifeng.

264
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,980
When I was young, I came to Mount Cuifeng

265
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,990
to find the rare Wind-breaking Lotus.

266
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,510
So I built a hut in the mountain.

267
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,930
No one knows about it.

268
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,840
We can hide in that small hut for the time being.

269
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,920
Let's go.

270
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,190
Be careful.

271
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,150
Uncle Li, hurry!

272
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:15,890
Get them!

273
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,690
Yes.

274
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,640
Qiang, take them away.

275
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,820
Muyang.

276
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,210
Muyang.

277
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,380
-Muyang!
-My Lord!

278
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,410
Don't let them get away!

279
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,120
-Catch them! Hurry!
-Uncle Li.

280
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,880
You go first.

281
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,850
Let's go.

282
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,290
Keep chasing. Don't let them escape.

283
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:01,890
Yes.

284
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,450
Over there. Hurry.

285
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,740
Does it hurt?

286
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm fine.

287
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,100
This way.

288
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,860
Master.

289
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,090
What Peacock Sect said may not be true.

290
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,540
There is something suspicious about Flowers Kill's case.

291
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,130
Master, please investigate it fully.

292
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,370
Right now,

293
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,190
what's suspicious about the case?

294
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,260
I've made up my mind.

295
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,090
Don't mention it again.

296
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,650
Okay.

297
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,380
Master.

298
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,010
Guanbuzhu and Li's Mansion are now empty.

299
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,060
Li Muyang, Hua Ni and others

300
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,530
have escaped.

301
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,050
Please seal all the borders

302
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,260
and get more people to find them

303
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,320
so that we can catch those criminals.

304
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,170
Approved.

305
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,670
Master, please change your mind.

306
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,060
Master.

307
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,579
Muyang has always been loyal to you and kind to the people.

308
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,109
He can never be a bad person.

309
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,050
There must be

310
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,540
a misunderstanding.

311
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,510
He admitted to me

312
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,599
that he was the chief of Flowers Kill.

313
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,329
There's no misunderstanding.

314
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,550
We three grew up together.

315
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,099
I know you two are close friends.

316
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,740
But you

317
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,680
must stay out of this.

318
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,010
Yu.

319
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,670
Enough!

320
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,930
Because I trusted him so much,

321
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,810
he could have committed so many crimes.

322
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,140
No one is allowed

323
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,930
to discuss this with me again.
