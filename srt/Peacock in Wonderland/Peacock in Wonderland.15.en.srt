[Episode 15]

4
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,270
Li Muyang.

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
Li Muyang!

6
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,000
Those children were all captured by the Peacock Sect.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,050
Ruan Jiushu even said they would be sacrificed.

8
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,039
I used to think the Peacock Sect was just unreliable.

9
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,970
I never thought they could be so...

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,910
so ignorant.

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,479
The Peacock Sect has been like this for nearly a century.

12
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,380
That's why I established the Flowers Kill,

13
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,490
to uphold justice.

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,660
Don't worry.

15
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,720
I won't let them sacrifice children.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,130
What are your plans?

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,220
This matter is very complicated.

18
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,680
Let's not discuss it here.

19
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,500
Holy Envoy, you are the Peacock Sect's Holy Envoy.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,820
They won't harm you.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,720
Just stay with Ruan Jiushu

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,210
and wait for my message.

23
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,520
Leave the rest to us.

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,560
No.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,090
I am the Peacock Holy Envoy.

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,960
I have the responsibility to lead the Peacock Sect onto the right path.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
But the minds of the people and the followers

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,450
have been manipulated by them for a long time.

29
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,250
It's not something that can be changed overnight.

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,630
Moreover, have you ever considered

31
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,400
that if they find out

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
you're not fully aligned with them,

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,130
what will they do to you?

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,500
And how can you ensure your safety?

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,240
That's exactly

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,100
why we need to change it, isn't it?

37
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,600
They only worship the Peacock God,

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
not Ruan Jiushu.

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,780
If...

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,750
I portray the Peacock God

41
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,910
as a righteous deity,

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,120
they can be led onto the right path, right?

43
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,720
There's nothing difficult in the world

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,120
if you're willing to try.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,370
How do we know we can if we don't try?

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,130
I'm confident with it.

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,590
Really.

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,150
Chief.

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,180
Chief.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,300
I want to discuss the matter of sacrifice with you.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,990
I've thought about it seriously.

52
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,030
Sacrifice...

53
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,220
Sacrifice is just for solidifying the reputation

54
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,100
of our Peacock Sect, right?

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,670
To achieve this goal,

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,550
we don't necessarily need to use live people.

57
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,780
I've thought of many ways.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,390
Look.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,400
We can come up with some slogans,

60
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,730
using brainwashing slogans to attract the people.

61
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,910
If we have enough funds,

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,320
we can even build a Peacock Hall.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,910
Every week,

64
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,230
you can go to the hall

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,470
to teach the doctrine to the believers,

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,800
listen to their voices,

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,070
counsel them, and so on.

68
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,070
What do you think?

69
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,270
If you think these aren't good,

70
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,010
I can think of more.

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,200
If you truly want to contribute to the sacrifice,

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,280
you should accompany me to select the children,

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,740
preparing for the ritual.

74
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,560
Chief.

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,400
Holy Envoy, please.

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,820
Pick the children.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Step forward.

78
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,440
This one is wearing the same color as the Peacock God.

79
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,170
The Peacock God won't like him.

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,640
You.

81
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,480
This one is too thin.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,970
The Peacock God won't like him either.

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,089
He's been coughing.

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,430
The Peacock God will find him annoying for sure.

85
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,670
This one looks quiet.

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,700
The Peacock God will feel bored.

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,730
The Peacock God doesn't like children wearing hats.

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,000
This one looks unintelligent.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
The Peacock God definitely won't like him.

90
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,760
This one is too pale.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,810
The Peacock God won't like him either.

92
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,390
Chief, I don't think any of these children will do.

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,390
Perhaps we should consider my plan.

94
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,710
In that case,

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,450
go catch some more.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,560
We'll continue until we find suitable ones.

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Chief!

98
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,150
Take them away.

99
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,000
Stop!

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
If you have to sacrifice someone, sacrifice me.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,440
After all, I'm the Holy Envoy.

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,500
Sacrificing me will make the Peacock God even happier.

103
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,320
Mom!

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,510
My patience has its limits.

105
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,040
Don't think I dare not harm you.

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,700
I'm willing to be sacrificed!

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,710
Tong.

108
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
This kid is smart.

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,870
Since you're willing,

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
then it'll be you.

111
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,700
But we still need one more.

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,150
I want to be with Brother Shen Tong!

113
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,030
Okay.

114
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,040
It seems this is the guidance of the Peacock God

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,630
in the depths of fate.

116
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
So, it's settled.

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,050
Send the other kids to the Doctrine Hall tomorrow.

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,270
Nurture them well

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,070
to become disciples of our sect

120
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,450
and serve our sect in the future.

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,110
Yes.

122
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,430
You have already chosen two kids for sacrifice.

123
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,000
Why not release the others?

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,190
Their families are waiting for them to come home.

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,870
Home?

126
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,520
After joining our sect,

127
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,150
the Peacock Sect

128
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,750
will be their home.

129
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,990
We will be their family.

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,190
Master.

131
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,750
In recent years, Peacock City-State has suffered frequent droughts,

132
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,790
causing hardship for the people.

133
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,630
I believe

134
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,160
that only by reducing the corvée burdens and taxes

135
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
can the people have a chance to recuperate and thrive,

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,980
which is the key to long-term stability.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,970
This suggestion is reasonable.

138
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,420
I'll leave this matter to you, Lord Chen.

139
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,190
Yes.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,310
Mother!

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,990
Mother.

142
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,390
Why are you in such a panic?

143
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,990
That doesn't make you look like a Young Master.

144
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,030
Mother.

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,950
I have already solved the case

146
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,790
of the missing children.

147
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,910
Who did it?

148
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
The Peacock Sect.

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't talk nonsense.

150
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,760
What does this have to do with the Peacock Sect?

151
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,720
Mother,

152
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,750
those children are now locked up

153
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,510
in the Peacock Sect's dungeon.

154
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,710
If you don't believe me,

155
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,030
you can immediately send troops to search.

156
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,470
Ruan Jiushu has been deceiving the Emperor.

157
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,950
The Peacock Sect is running rampant.

158
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,760
They even committed such a despicable act.

159
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,270
Mother,

160
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,180
you must punish them severely.

161
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Master,

162
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
if Young Master Rong has such suspicions,

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
it's likely not groundless.

164
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm willing to accompany Young Master Rong

165
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,080
to the Peacock Sect's dungeon

166
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,480
to uncover the truth.

167
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,630
I will

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
handle this matter appropriately.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,730
You shouldn't interfere anymore.

170
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,120
Why?

171
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,950
Those children are now on the brink of death.

172
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,680
Mother, we can't delay any longer.

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,190
You should immediately hold Ruan Jiushu accountable

174
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,720
and demand that she release the children.

175
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,590
That's enough.

176
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,630
Don't mention it again.

177
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,030
Mother, what do you mean?

178
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
Are you going to turn a blind eye to this?

179
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,030
Young Master, are you defying my order?

180
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,680
I will take my leave.

181
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,050
The recent disappearance of children in the city

182
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,030
was done by the Peacock Sect?

183
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,940
You must have already known the answer.

184
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,190
Are you here today to hold me accountable?

185
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,700
The audacity of the Peacock Sect is growing.

186
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,980
Without the protection of the Peacock God,

187
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,520
would Peacock City-State be as prosperous as it is today?

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,550
If sacrifices were to cease without reason,

189
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,010
angering the Peacock God,

190
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,800
then divine blessings might not be bestowed,

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
and the hearts of the people would be even more difficult to settle.

192
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,360
Master, have you forgotten the sacrifice

193
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,350
made ten years ago when you ascended to your position?

194
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,560
Our sect kept its promise and helped you ascend.

195
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
Please honor your commitment

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,750
and refrain from interfering in our affairs.

197
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,800
The matter of sacrifice is mine to decide.

198
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,059
You don't need to worry about it, Master.

199
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,630
Young Master Rong has reported it,

200
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,240
but Master Rong turned a blind eye to this.

201
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm afraid that the Peacock Sect will intensify their actions.

202
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,280
I've heard that the Peacock Sect has already chosen the children for sacrifice.

203
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,070
The ritual will take place in 5 days.

204
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,730
We must rescue the children as soon as possible.

205
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,000
Li Muyang.

206
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
What should we do?

207
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,330
Tong...

208
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Tong has been chosen.

209
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
The other children are still in captivity.

210
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,380
Ruan Jiushu said they would brainwash them all into becoming disciples.

211
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,710
What should we do?

212
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,950
I've tried everything.

213
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,090
She just won't give up the sacrifice.

214
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
What should we do about the children?

215
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,440
It's okay.

216
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,540
There's Flowers Kill.

217
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,110
Flowers Kill?

218
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,470
Yes.

219
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,960
There's Flowers Kill.

220
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,440
Flowers Kill

221
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,430
will take action tonight.

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,650
Greetings, Holy Envoy.

223
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,580
I'm taking these children to the Holy Land.

224
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,380
Open the door.

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,830
Before the sacrifice,

226
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm taking these children to the Peacock God statue

227
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,750
for prayers and baptism,

228
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,080
purifying their souls.

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
Why don't I know about

230
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,310
this rule?

231
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,430
This is a new rule set by the Holy Envoy.

232
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,890
You didn't know it before,

233
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,640
but you should know it now, right?

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,720
Chief has commanded

235
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
that no one can take the children away

236
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,240
before the sacrifice.

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,070
I am the Holy Envoy appointed by the Peacock God.

238
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,310
My orders are the will of the Peacock God.

239
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,140
Dare you defy the divine command?

240
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,940
Open the door!

241
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,040
Please don't be angry. I'll open the door right now.

242
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,950
Come. Quickly.

243
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,690
Follow me.

244
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,210
Go. Go.

245
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,350
Go.

246
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,950
Inform Chief immediately.

247
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,470
Yes.

248
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,280
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Hurry!

249
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,660
-Hurry up!
-Hurry.

250
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,820
Get in the carriage!

251
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,070
Watch out!

252
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,270
Be careful!

253
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,260
Lai, hurry!

254
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,450
Be careful!

255
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Lai, take over the children!

256
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,430
Who are you?

257
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,060
Take the kids and go!

258
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,740
Okay.

259
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,760
Good kung fu.

260
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,550
Unfortunately, you used it in the wrong place.

261
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,510
-Help me!
-Let me go!

262
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,890
Help me!

263
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,970
The children are more important!

264
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,830
Let's go first!

265
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,780
Who is it?

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,010
Send the letter along with the hairpin.

267
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes.

268
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:46,870
Who are you?

269
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,380
It's you!

270
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,120
If you want the Holy Envoy to live,

271
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,920
the sacrifice must be canceled.

272
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,770
This indeed is the Holy Envoy's hairpin.

273
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,590
It seems like

274
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,790
their target is the Peacock Sect.

275
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,870
We should stop the sacrifice.

276
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,960
No.

277
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,910
The sacrifice has been a tradition in Peacock City-State for over 100 years.

278
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,040
How can we cancel it?

279
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,320
That villain abducted the Holy Envoy

280
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,310
and threatened us openly

281
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,440
just to shame Master Rong and the Peacock Sect.

282
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,310
If we give in to their demand

283
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,770
and cancel the sacrifice,

284
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,710
Master and the Peacock Sect will lose their dignity.

285
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,960
Chief, do you think

286
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,810
dignity is more important than lives?

287
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,640
The Holy Envoy is in imminent danger.

288
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,150
As the Chief of the Peacock Sect,

289
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,800
are you going to disregard her safety?

290
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,600
Since the Holy Envoy came to the Peacock Sect,

291
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,630
she has been always caring for the people,

292
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,560
bringing great renown to the sect.

293
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Now that the Holy Envoy is in danger,

294
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,270
you are actually disregarding her safety.

295
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,270
If you do this,

296
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,400
who will dare to take the Holy Envoy's position in the future?

297
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,280
How can the people of this city trust Master Rong?

298
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,280
It is against heavenly principles for the Peacock Sect

299
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,830
to abduct children for sacrifice.

300
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,090
It should be canceled.

301
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,910
Master!

302
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,280
Please reconsider!

303
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Silence!

304
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,150
Sacrifice.

305
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,430
The sacrifice is crucial to the prosperity of Peacock City-State.

306
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,690
It cannot be canceled.

307
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,830
Mother.

308
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,550
Didn't you teach me

309
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,030
that as the ruler of the city,

310
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,300
we should always put the people first

311
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,050
and prioritize their welfare?

312
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,580
Aren't the Holy Envoy and the children to be sacrificed

313
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,840
citizens of Peacock City-State?

314
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,400
Are the lives of the citizens of Peacock City-State

315
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,240
not more important than these regulations

316
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,930
and meaningless doctrines?

317
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,680
Outrageous!

318
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,080
Mother.

319
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,660
If you act this way,

320
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,440
you're letting my respect for you down

321
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
and disappoint the people's expectations!

322
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,520
Shut up!

323
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,360
Guards!

324
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,550
Take Young Master away.

325
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,210
-Yes.
-Yes.

326
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
-Mother.
-Go!

327
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,250
Mother!

328
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,920
Let go of me!

329
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,010
Don't be angry, Master Rong.

330
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,430
Young Master is young and inexperienced.

331
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,700
She will soon come to understand.

332
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,170
Please rest assured, Master.

333
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,690
The sacrifice will proceed as planned.

334
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,760
My Lord.

335
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,580
The South Mountain is vast.

336
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,180
Where should we look for her?

337
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,670
Do you remember the Cangqu necklace

338
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,000
I gave to the Holy Envoy?

339
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,270
Although Cangqu is beneficial to humans,

340
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,000
it is toxic to all other plants.

341
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,390
When she was abducted,

342
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,520
the necklace broke,

343
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,270
and the pollen scattered.

344
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,530
Look at this plant.

345
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,610
This is...

346
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,890
It should be here.

347
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, all the plants along this path

348
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
show signs of being corroded.

349
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,470
The person who abducted Hua Ni that night

350
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,470
must have passed through this path.

351
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,570
Some people are there.

352
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,390
I knew it.

353
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,270
Follow up.

354
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,750
This is the place.

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,970
[Cloud Villa]

356
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,859
My Lord, why is no one here?

357
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,870
Something's wrong.
