[Episode 40]

4
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,020
Qing Jian,

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,229
you have unjustly occupied Peacock City,

6
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,070
defied the law of nature, and hurt the innocent.

7
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,350
Today, by God's will,

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,630
I'm going to get rid of the rebels.

9
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,670
Sir, I guess you have been waiting for this moment

10
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,390
for a long time.

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,030
Stop talking nonsense.

12
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,789
Everyone can kill

13
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,390
rebels and traitors.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,950
Qing Jian,

15
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,910
today, you are going to die.

16
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,550
What are you waiting for?

17
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,190
Sir, don't you think you are too arrogant?

18
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,590
All of you were promoted by me.

19
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,870
I can't believe you've chosen to betray me with him today.

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,350
Sir,

21
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,350
you just

22
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,030
treat us

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,950
as a bunch of obedient dogs.

24
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,670
To you,

25
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,290
we are just pawns

26
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,430
that can be sacrificed anytime.

27
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,710
Now you're talking about goodwill

28
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,390
and betrayal.

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,270
Isn't it ridiculous?

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,030
Li Zhiyun,

31
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,390
when did you get rid of my men?

32
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,550
When you decided to kill me.

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,310
I taught you to be literate

34
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,070
and grateful.

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,010
Now the best skill you've learned

36
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,610
is being ungrateful.

37
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,710
That's why

38
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,829
you are my good teacher.

39
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,990
No one can take what I want

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,910
away from me.

41
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,230
Sir,

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,940
the throne is right here.

43
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,670
Please.

44
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,630
You've been pursuing this position

45
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,350
for your whole life.

46
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,909
Now that your wish has come true,

47
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,710
how do you feel?

48
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,220
This...

49
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,340
belongs to me.

50
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,590
It is a worthy death.

51
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,070
It is a worthy death!

52
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,180
You shouldn't have touched him.

53
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,460
Sir,

54
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,590
I made your wish come true

55
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,570
and fulfilled my promise.

56
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,940
I let you sit on the throne.

57
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,390
Rest in peace.

58
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,110
Mother.

59
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,909
Master.

60
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,909
Master, what's wrong?

61
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,100
Congratulations.

62
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,750
You are pregnant.

63
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,390
But the pulse is unstable.

64
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,680
I'll prescribe some medicine for miscarriage prevention.

65
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,870
You'll be fine if you take the medicine on time.

66
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,940
Am I really pregnant?

67
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,710
Yes.

68
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,250
I excel

69
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,230

70
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,590
pregnancy.

71
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,610
Make sure she is happy

72
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,660
and don't let her be tired.

73
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,830
Also, she should increase her nutrient intake.

74
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,510
Goodbye.

75
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,950
Thank you.

76
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,830
Please.

77
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,510
Great.

78
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,510
Congratulations, Master.

79
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,310
We'll have a little master soon.

80
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,970
I didn't expect

81
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,990
the child to come so soon.

82
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,230
Hua Ni.

83
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,500

84
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,810
Congratulations.

85
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,510
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,020
I split hairs

87
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,240
and said those harsh words to hurt you.

88
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,470
Don't be mad at me, okay?

89
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,070
No.

90
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,309
I am the one who should say sorry.

92
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,289
as long as I'm here,

93
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,710
there is hope for Peacock City-State.

94
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,580
But actually,

95
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,150
not just me,

96
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,250
you should be here too.

97
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,670
Everyone should be here,

98
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,510
so that there will be hope for Peacock City-State.

99
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,900
Yu,

100
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,390
I should have given you something long ago.

101
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,190
This is...

102
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,230
my mother's Feisun Tally.

103
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,980
Yes.

104
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,980
We still stand a chance of winning.

105
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,950
What do you think?

106
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,910
Master.

107
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,550
Yes.

108
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,860
We still have hope.

109
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,860
This concerns the fate of Peacock City.

110
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,480
Everyone, don't worry.

111
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,510
I will bring back the Feisun Army

112
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,490
to take back Peacock City.

113
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,340
Get lost.

114
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,600
All of you, get lost!

115
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,310
This position

116
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,020
is boring.

117
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,580
Boring.

118
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,150
So much for the throne.

119
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,670
It's snowing.

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,370
It's so beautiful.

121
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,920
Peacock City rarely snows.

122
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,350
The last time it snowed was eight years ago.

123
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,600

Let go of me!

192
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,930
Let go of me!

193
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,910
Put me down!

194
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,300
Put me down!

195
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,670
Put me down!

196
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,230
Qingqing.

197
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,140
Qingqing.

198
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,970
Let go of me!

199
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,829
Who are you?

200
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,230
I don't even know you.

201
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,140
Are you going to let go or not?

202
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,390
Qingqing.

203
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,540
Master.

204
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,720
[Taining Hall]

205
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,590
Love in this world is the most deceptive.

206
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,380
A woman can change her heart easily.

207
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,750
In the past, you risked your life for her.

208
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,590
Do you regret it?

209
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,020
Regret?

210
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,350
I only regret

211
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,910
I didn't kill you earlier.

212
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,750
There is muscle softening powder on the hairpin.

213
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,550
Save your strength.

214
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,300
My Lord.

215
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,510
Hua Ni.

216
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,310
Muyang.

217
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,520
This is getting more interesting.

218
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,040
Let's go back first.

219
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,430
We'll discuss it after we go back.

220
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,060
My Lord,

221
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,430
let's go back and heal your wound first.

222
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,420
Let's go.

223
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,590
Zhiyang,

224
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,350
I'll be waiting for you to come back.
