23

Weiwei.

28
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,470
Be more natural. You look so nervous; people are going to be suspicious.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,340
When can we stop sneaking around like this?

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,150
When can we announce that we've been dating for three years?

31
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,630
And that we're looking to buy a house and then getting married?

32
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,130
It’s not like you don’t know that the boss doesn’t like office relationships.

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,130
So when we get married, we don't have to invite any guests and go public?

34
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,120
Of course, we do. It's just...

35
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,830
We need to plan it out.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,600
- I know you're good at planning.<br>- Shh.

37
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,690
Then, when do you plan on going public?

38
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,290
Let's wait until we've bought a house and are preparing to get married.

39
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,420
If you tell the boss now, he'll turn against you right away.

40
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,210
I'm also scared that the boss is going to turn against us. That's why we need to plan ahead.

41
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,670
Okay. I know.

42
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,090
I already talked to the landlord. He will have someone take care of the floor problem.

43
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,370
You're really going to buy that tilted house?

44
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,980
You're so weird. You're the one who told me to ask the landlord to fix the problem with the floor.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,530
Unless... you ask your classmate Gao Ziyuan about their house.

46
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,410
I don't want to. I'm going to a meeting.

47
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,400
Hey...

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,900
Boss, even if you're trying to punish me for my mistakes earlier,

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,390
you can't just delete all my messages with Kefei. That's really cruel.

50
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,600
I did it for your own good. You've put enough cost and effort into this investment.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,060
It's clearly unable to be saved. If you continue on, I guarantee things will become too complicated.

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,770
How can love be an investment target?

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm so serious about her. I'll give it my all.

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,870
Who taught you that love has no costs?

55
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,170
Did you know that in the end, it will be imbalanced? The ending will be tragic?

56
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,570
The point is, you want me to stop before I even start? I don't care. You have to make it up to me.

57
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,450
I need to make it up to you?

58
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,200
Just help me think of a way to chase Kefei.

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,770
If I go now, I'll get shot down for sure.

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,540
Fine.

61
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,680
If I go, you won't get a turn.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,370
Boss, just help me think of a way. Just help me. You must help me.

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm begging you.

64
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,440
<i>(Are you working overtime?)</i>

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,930
<i>(It's raining heavily, did you bring an umbrella?)</i>

66
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,700
<i>(I brought an umbrella and I'm on my way home.)<br>(I'll talk to you when I get home.)</i>

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,070
Zhou Weiwei! Zhou Weiwei!

68
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,620
What are you doing?

69
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,100
Are you all right? I just saw you run in the rain to the corner store and I thought you would buy an umbrella or a raincoat.

70
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,030
You just took a piece of cardboard and ran out. Are you crazy?

71
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,010
You're the crazy one! I already have an umbrella at home. Why should I buy another one?

72
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,070
Also, one umbrella costs NT$105. That's enough for two meals!

73
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,870
All right. Then where's 321? <br>(N.B. 321 or "San Er Yi" sounds like the last character of Li Haoyi's name)

74
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,640
His name is Li Haoyi. If he bikes here to pick me up, he will get rained on, too. Without him knowing, I'd rather just get rained on alone.

75
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,060
Does he know you have to work overtime? If he knew, why didn't he just stay and wait?

76
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,540
Why do you care so much?

77
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,860
Because if it were me, I wouldn't let you get soaked.

78
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,330
I've told you before, don't try to get close to me.

79
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,350
I've already deleted you.

80
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,230
Sorry.

81
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,120
That day when you came to look at my house, I was overboard.

82
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,740
That's why I wanted to wait for you here today so that I could properly apologize to you.

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,700
So, you've been waiting here since you got off work?

84
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,830
I wanted to gamble to see if I could run into you. Who would have thought...

85
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,240
I would have run into an idiot who used a cardboard box to run in the rain.

86
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,200
Is this your attitude for apologizing?

87
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
Sorry.

88
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,490
Whatever.

89
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,830
Let me take you home.

90
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,860
No need. I can go by myself.

91
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,410
Then I’ll give you an umbrella.

92
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,480
Won't Ziyuan look for you if you go home so late?

93
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,790
Zhou Weiwei, Ziyuan is only a family member.

94
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,070
Okay.

95
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,030
Do you have time later?

96
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,330
Since I bought you an umbrella, will you listen to a song with me?

97
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,860
<i>♫ Turn on the radio ♫</i>

108

Who's the romantic guy?

109
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,480
Gifting flowers? How outdated.

110
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,350
- You don't want them? Then give them to me!<br> - Hey!

111
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,150
Get your hands away. So rude. It's time for work.

112
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,140
Are you here to watch a drama or play? Get to work.

113
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,350
What time is it?

114
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,590
What?

115
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,350
Does receiving those flowers make you emotional?

116
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,480
Hello? Who am I? I'm Han Kefei.

117
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,390
I'm not that irrational, okay?

118
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,670
<i>(I have a secret hidden in the flowers. Can you taste it?)</i>

119
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,670
Sister Ziyuan, why did you send me another present?

120
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,450
Thank you, Sister Ziyuan.

121
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,520
Okay, I understand.

122
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,830
Okay. Bye-bye.

123
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,850
- When did this happen? <br>- Just now.

124
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,620
What did she say to you?

125
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,250
She said it's all ready. It's all arranged for me to go with you to venture capital funds.

126
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,840
She even has to butt into your business?

127
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,830
She means well. Besides, wherever you go, that's where I should be.

128
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,880
I already wanted to go anyway. Just think of it as a shortcut.

129
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,670
<i>(Chocola BB)</i>

130
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,200
You’re back. Go rest for a bit. I’ll go pour a cup of water for you.

131
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,290
You bought stuff again?

132
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,970
Yup. I just bought some daily use stuff.

133
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,030
Drink some water first.

134
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,230
There were two people who came to see the house today.

135
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,870
But they seem to have a budget problem.

136
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,540
Today, I went to look at the house on the paper in your hands.

137
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,980
The inside is about 198 square meters. Plus, all the public facilities, it’s almost 330 square meters.

138
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,720
- That’s enough.<br>- It’s just I—

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,990
You’re right 198 square meters is enough.

140
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,100
It's just, I wanted to find something bigger.

141
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,570
You know that I’m not talking about that.

142
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,770
Oh right. Within these are some presents to give to your new coworkers.

143
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,720
Later, I'll make a list of whose present is whose. That way you won't get them mixed up.

144
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,480
Are you done?

145
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,050
Can you not meddle in my life or my work?

146
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,440
Whether you want to swipe my no-limit credit card to buy presents, sell or buy a house,

147
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,500
or buy even more gifts for my coworkers, I'm fine if you do any of that.

148
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,930
But you even butt into Baiyang's business.

149
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,970
All these years, he's been with you and working so hard.

150
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,230
Is it wrong of me to want him to also find a better opportunity for advancement?

151
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,030
Kehuan, everything that I do

152
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,620
is all for your sake.

153
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,510
Stop saying that everything you do is for me.

154
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,620
And please stop saying that everything you do is for our future.

155
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,290
You know, that by doing this, you're creating a bigger distance between us.

156
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,520
That's why I'm trying to change.

157
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,810
The reason I want to sell this place and buy a new one is so that I can change our current situation.

158
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,170
It can't be changed.

159
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,690
Kehuan,

160
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,990
you promised my mom that

161
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,160
you would take good care of Ziting and me.

162
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,740
I can do what I promised your mom. But not with your methods!

163
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,510
Then, tell me what kind of method do you plan on using?

164
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,500
As long as I can always be with you,

165
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
I am willing to do whatever it takes as long as I can stay by your side to love you.

166
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,300
Just use your methods. I don't care.

167
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,280
Kehuan!

168
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
I said just use your methods!

169
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,080
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

170

172

173
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,490
<i>I've noticed that you've been able to do what you promised my mom before she passed away.</i>

174
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,510
<i>She told you to take care of me and Ziting,</i>

175
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,210
<i>and then buy a bigger apartment before we get married. You're doing that right now, aren't you?</i>

176
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,920
<i>Kehuan, everything I do is for you.</i>

177
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,720
<i>As long as I can always be with you,</i>

<i>I am willing to do whatever it takes as long as I can stay by your side to love you.</i>

180
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,100
<i> Please try again later. Thank you.</i>

181
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,940
Zhou Weiwei.

182
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,200
Wow.

183
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,930
Sorry. It's you?

184
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,190
How did I end up liking someone as rough and dresses as messy as you?

185
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,280
How else should I dress when taking out the trash? Formal attire?

186
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,630
Not bad. You can even talk back now.

187
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,330
Looks like our relationship has become closer.

188
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,040
Yeah, right. How did you know I lived here?

189
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,900
As long as I, Chu Kehuan, want to find someone, I will find them.

190
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,460
Are you a perverted stalker?

191
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,530
This pervert has something to tell you.

192
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,980
If it's too perverted, I don't want to hear it.

193
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,520
You can save NT$8,000,000 on this pervert's house.

194
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,730
But, of course, perverts have conditions, too.

195
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,190
If you want to save NT$8,000,000, you must spend a night with me.

196
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,940
You pervert! Are you crazy? Why should I spend the night with you?

197
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,610
Who do you think you are? Have you no shame? Who wants to sleep with you?

198
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,720
What are you saying? What do you take me for?

199
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
Do you agree?

200
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,810
Who said I agreed? Are you crazy?

201
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,030
You shouted it for the whole world to hear. See, even they heard.

202
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,270
Isn't that considered agreeing?

203
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,870
Chu Kehuan, I can pretend that what you just said was a joke.

204
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,400
But if you say

205
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,490
- anything related to— <br> -Do you want to consider

206
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,150
the NT$8,000,000 again? This way the NT$32,000,000 will become NT$24,000,000.

207
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,720
It's a big difference.

208
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,460
Chu Kehuan... get lost!

209
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,430
Zhou Weiwei.

210
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,740
You and Chu Kehuan are really...?

211
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,600
Yeah, right! You guys are all crazy!

212
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,420
Zhou Weiwei, I'll wait for your answer.

213
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,920
Go die! You pervert!

214
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,450
Not only are you rough, but you're violent.

215
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,590
Stop pretending.

216
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,430
Helping me wax? Two-faced.

217
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,160
Hypocrite.

218
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,160
Does Chu Kehuan want to go out with you?

219
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,260
No.

220
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,780
Look into my eyes and tell me the truth.

221
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,730
No. He’s just a crazy person.

222
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,800
I also want to believe you.

223
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,590
How can someone like Chu Kehuan want to be with someone...

224
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,080
...who dresses like you?

225
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,890
What’s wrong with me? Is there anyone who wears formal attire to take out the trash?

226
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,420
If he doesn’t want to go out with you and you don’t want to go out with him,

227
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,810
then can I have him then?

228
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,130
How many times have I told you already?

229
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,670
He is my university classmate’s boyfriend. You can't just eat him. You'll get diarrhea.

230
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,980
But...

231
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,660
But nothing. You can't have Chu Kehuan.

232
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,900
Why can’t I? With someone like Chu Kehuan,

233
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,430
I’d pay to spend the night with him.

234
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,690
You’d pay to be with him?

235
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,240
Yes.

236
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,790
If he would pay me, that would be better.

237
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,340
Is there a difference between this and prostitution?

238
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,560
Of course, there’s a difference.

239
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:09,440
Because I get to choose him, and it’s not him choosing me.

240
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,350
Let me make this clear, I get to choose him.

241
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,760
It's not him picking me, and he'll also be willing to pay me.

242
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,780
Everyone gets what they want. What’s wrong with that?

243
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,640
<i>You can save NT$8,000,000 on this pervert's house.</i>

244
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,930
<i>But, of course, perverts have conditions, too.</i>

245
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,580
<i>If you want to save NT$8,000,000, you must spend a night with me.</i>

246
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,450
To be honest.

247
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,710
If he did choose me, that means he has the need.

248
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,830
I’m happy and he’s satisfied. No one died and there’s no fire, so what’s wrong with that?

249
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,830
Zhou Weiwei, do you have fantasies about Chu Kehuan? Or have you guys already—

250
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,540
We haven’t. How many times did I tell you? I really haven’t.

251
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,080
I was just asking. Why are you getting all worked up?

252
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,040
But don’t forget. You have to share good things with good friends.

253
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,480
Do these things need to be shared?

254
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,430
Why not?

255
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,970
Do you expect me to look for Yan Baiyang every time and spoil the fun?

256
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,600
<i>Kefei, are you happy?</i>

257
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,790
<i>Not bad.</i>

258
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,630
<i>So can I?</i>

259
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,720
<i>Yeah, you can.</i>

260
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,260
<i>Can you what?</i>

261
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,740
<i>You accepted my flowers and asked me to come out.</i>

262
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,760
<i>So, you’re willing to go out with me?</i>

263
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,030
<i>- What are you saying? <br>- What did I say wrong?</i>

264
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,940
<i>You always ruin the mood.</i>

265
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,950
I just finished.

266
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,780
We just finished and he said, "Be my girlfriend."

267
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,110
Who am I? I’m Han Kefei.

268
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:17,010
How could I give up a whole forest for just one tree? I’m not an idiot.

269
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
Next time, could you buy a better one? This one hurts so much.

270
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,070
Everyone uses beeswax nowadays.

271
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,250
Remember, good things need to be shared with good friends.

272
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:59,530
<i>♫ The sky turns dark, the lights turn on, the day is over ♫</i>

274
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,080

Kehuan, Ziting is back.

281
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,840
- Long time no see, Brother Kehuan.<br>- Long time no see.

282
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,080
Why are you back already? Didn’t you say you were coming back next week?

283
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,290
Right? She didn’t tell me until she landed in Taiwan. I almost didn’t make it to pick her up.

284
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,470
I didn’t ask for you to pick me up. I wanted to take the airplane subway but you didn’t allow me.

285
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,170
- How are you?<br> - I’m pretty good.

286
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,970
So you’re staying here for good now?

287
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,640
Yup. But I already arranged everything before I left New York.

288
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,820
They will send me my recommendation letter in the next two days.

289
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,430
Don’t worry. I’m just living here for a little while.

290
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,060
I’ll move out once I find a place. I won’t be a bother to you guys for too long.

291
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,180
You better hurry. We’re selling the apartment soon.

292
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,290
You’re selling the apartment?

293
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,540
You guys are going to move to a new house when you guys get married?

294
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,090
You must be tired. Go rest and I’ll treat you to a meal later.

295
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,910
Ziting, you stayed in America for so long and you only have these two suitcases?

296
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,570
There’s more. The rest are being shipped here.

297
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,140
Kehuan, since Ziting is back,

298
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,070
do you want to come back to our bedroom and not sleep in the guest room?

299
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Gao Ziyuan, I want to drink coffee.

300
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,370
Okay.

301
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,750
Are you and Brother Kehuan okay?

302
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,120
Yeah. We’re okay.

303
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,830
You haven't had my coffee in a long time. Do you miss it a lot?

304
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,710
What are you boasting about. It’s not even super good.

305
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,990
You can't buy it anywhere else. It's a Gao Ziyuan special.

306
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,040
Keep the change.

307
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,920
Weiwei!

308
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,470
- Dad! Over here. <br> - Uncle.

309
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,000
Long time no see. Why do you look skinnier since the last time?

310
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,090
No, I haven’t. I’m still the same.

311
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,090
Sorry for troubling you to come all the way from Kaohsiung to look at houses here.

312
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,560
It's no problem at all. Buying a house is a big deal.

313
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,850
Once you guys are settled and married, I’ll be happy, too.

314
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,400
Where's the house?

315
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,960
- It’s in that alley.<br> - In there?

316
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,570
Let’s go. I’ll show you.

317
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,720
How come you’re looking at a house in an alleyway?

318
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,030
- It’s quiet in there.<br> - Quiet?

319
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,670
Right. It’s so loud on the main street.

320
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,480
Are you sure this is right? From the first floor all the way up, the walls are filled with mold.

321
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,010
The dampness is so strong. Right now is not a problem, but if you live here for a long time, who knows what kind of problems will happen.

322
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,160
Dad, we can’t do anything about it either.

323
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,140
What do you mean?

324
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,440
Let’s say you guys do move in here. It’s going to be so much trouble to have to patch the holes and make things waterproof.

325
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,080
NT$18,000,000 for this place? Are you kidding me?

326
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,710
The market price is going to be like this in Taipei. This apartment is within our budget.

327
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,970
It looks like you don’t even know how to make the calculations.

328
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,960
In the south, NT$18,000,000 can buy a terraced house.

329
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,360
You’re spending so much money and it doesn’t even have an elevator?

330
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,280
In the future, if Weiwei gets pregnant, you want her to climb the stairs with her big belly?

331
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,740
You’re willing to, but I’m not.

332
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,610
I’m not satisfied with this apartment.

333
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,830
No wonder I felt dizzy when I was taking the stairs up here.

334
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,870
This house is very special. It's tilted, huh?

335
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,880
Weiwei, don’t marry this kind of man. Don’t marry him.

336
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,470
Dad, how could you say that?

337
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,610
Did I say something wrong? A man should take care of his wife and child.

338
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,690
Don’t let your wife have worries. When your mom was still here, I treated her like a queen.

339
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,280
And you? You even dare to buy a tilted house?

340
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,260
But you can’t attack me like this. According to our budget,

341
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,470
this is the best apartment we could find.

342
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,710
Who are you trying to lie to? How could there be no decent apartment in all of Taipei?

343
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,960
It’s not like there isn’t. It’s just the one we like is NT$32,000,000.

344
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,890
I’ll show you.

345
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,380
Here.

346
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,650
Is there no room for negotiation?

347
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,930
The owner is Weiwei’s classmate’s boyfriend.

348
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,390
Weiwei, why don’t you personally talk to her?

349
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,960
- I... <br>- Actually, they are willing to reduce the price.

350
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,970
But Weiwei didn’t want to owe them anything.

351
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,760
So, in the end, we didn’t discuss it.

352
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,360
Weiwei was right to think that way.

353
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,870
How about this? If you guys really like it, I can take out my savings to help you guys with the down payment.

354
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,710
You can’t. Uncle, you worked hard your whole life to make that money.

355
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,560
It’s bad enough Haoyi doesn’t give you an allowance.

356
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,590
It’s okay. If I’m full, the whole family is full. As long as you guys are happy, I’m happy.

357
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,150
Weiwei, don’t forget to leave a room for me in the new apartment.

358
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,560
Uncle, don’t say that.

359
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,140
Actually, I've thought about this already. We can rent a place first.

360
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,580
We can slowly look for a house to buy.

361
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,960
Weiwei, Haoyi doesn’t have many achievements and has troubled you.

362
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,900
But I can understand why he wants to buy an apartment so badly.

363
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,200
Haoyi's mom passed away when he was in the fourth grade.

364
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,930
As a single man, I wasn’t able to take good care of him.

365
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,510
Plus, my work made it so that we had to transfer everywhere.

366
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,700
We would have to move at least every two years.

367
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,090
We never had a safe and comforting place to live. So he was unable to make intimate friends.

368
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,420
Although Haoyi never complained,

369
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,930
I was sad to see his disappointed face every time we moved.

370
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,810
Moving schools and saying goodbye to friends.

371
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,460
Then getting used to a new environment is very hard.

372
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,490
Dad.

373
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,030
Weiwei, Haoyi just wants a place that’s his own.

374
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,110
He doesn’t want to have to keep moving and wants to feel a sense of security. I can understand this.

375
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,080
I hope you can understand his persistence to want to buy an apartment.

376
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,370
- Sorry. <br> - Uncle, don’t say that.

377
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,950
Okay, Dad, it’s okay.

378
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,840
We can keep discussing this; we’re not in a rush to buy.

379
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,390
What is there to discuss? Let’s up our budget by NT$2,000,000.

380
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,680
There’s no more need for discussion. You just need to find a place that Weiwei is satisfied with.

381
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,970
Okay.

382
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,570
I didn’t know the reason you wanted to buy an apartment was so complicated.

383
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,810
My dad was being too dramatic.

384
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,800
Besides, I’m not overly sensitive.

385
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,910
Saying these things in front of you is like looking for sympathy. It’s so girly.

386
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,320
But if you don’t say it, how can I help take some of your burden?

387
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,090
I don’t want you to take some of the burden.

388
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,740
These past three years you’ve been willing to buy a place with me.

389
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,340
I made you scrimp and save, and sacrifice your quality of life.

390
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,300
It's been hard on you.

391
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,170
I've thought about it for the last couple of days.

392
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,970
Actually, you are my home.

393
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,380
So I'm okay with renting a house.

394
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:24,210
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

395
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,150
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

396
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,310
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

397
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,260
I thought you guys were going to take me to a night market or a Chinese restaurant.

398
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,150
I've been craving soup dumplings and sour and spicy soup.

399
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,920
Gao Ziting, you're so difficult.

400
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,410
You want soup instead of this high-grade steak?

401
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,360
No wonder you gave up such a well paying job in the US. I don't know what you're thinking.

402
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,550
I missed you.

403
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,200
Besides, I never intended to stay in the US forever.

404
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,850
After finishing graduate school,

405
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,980
I only worked the extra two years to save money to repay Brother Kehuan.

406
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,520
Kehuan, thank you.

407
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,360
I calculated I probably spent NT$2,000,000 the last couple of years. I'm now repaying you.

408
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,710
Do you still have money if you're giving this back?

409
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,690
Relax, I can take care of myelf.

410
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,140
I'm not like you, so lucky to have someone pampering you.

411
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,860
Hey. What do you mean by that?

412
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,070
Nothing.

413
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,750
This is the way you guys live. I don't have an opinion, but I have my own principles.

414
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,530
Brother Kehuan, if you don't take this Bank of America check,

415
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,650
I'll get upset.

416
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,420
Okay, I'll accept it.

417
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,910
I wish you success in your future.

418
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,170
Thanks. That really lessens my burdens.

419
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,560
Even though Mom told you to look after us before she died,

420
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,870
you don't have to worry about me. I can be independent.

421
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,880
But Mom said...

422
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,150
That's her wishful thinking.

423
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,180
Kehuan, I've already organized your evening plans for your first day on the job.

424
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,290
I organized some bankers and investors to have dinner together.

425
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,160
You can network and ask them for help in the future.

426
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,350
You're even controlling Kehuan's networking obligations. Isn't that crossing a line?

427
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,140
I'm helping him share the load.

428
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,910
This way he doesn't have to worry about anything and just focus on work.

429
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,000
Am I wrong?

430
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,020
<i> Haoyi just wants a house of his own.</i>

431
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,090
<i> So, he doesn't have to keep moving house without a sense of security. I get it.</i>

432
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,940
<i> And I hope you can understand why he wants to buy a house so desperately.</i>

433
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:42,320
<i> Actually, you are my home.</i>

434
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:51,580
<i>NT$8,000,000. There's a big difference between NT$32,000,000 and NT$24,000,000.</i>

435
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,950
<i>If you want to save NT$8,000,000, you must spend a night with me.</i>

436
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,990
<i> If one day, we're faced with some difficulty,</i>

437
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:23,270
<i> and one of us had to sacrifice something...</i>

438
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,990
<i> Of course, I should be the one to sacrifice. How could I let you go?</i>

439
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,940
<i> As long as it's not murder or arson and doesn't harm another person,</i>

440
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,760
<i> I'm willing to do anything.</i>

441
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,330
Good morning.

442
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,620
Zhou Weiwei.

443
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,390
Do you need anything?

444
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,830
Of course, that's why I came looking for you.

445
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,870
What do you need?

446
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,000
I accept.

447
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,760
Accept what?

448
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,200
Your conditions for the NT$8,000,000 discount.

449
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,960
Okay. I'll pick the location. You pick the time.

450
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,760
Let's do Saturday.

451
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,020
<i>(Did you leave yet? Do you need me to take you to the bus stop?)</i>

456
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,350
Hello?

457
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,080
Hold on. I’ll be down once I change my clothes.

458
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
No need to rush. Take your time.

459
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,100
I’ll give you 30 more mins. Take your time to fix yourself up.

460
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,420
Wear something pretty. Don’t wear what you wore when you were throwing away trash.

461
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,170
Considering I’m paying NT$8,000,000.

462
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,490
I only have those kinds of clothes.

463
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:24,430
From what I understand, every girl has at least one set of pretty clothes in their closet

464
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,450
but doesn’t usually wear them. Just wear that one.

465
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,250
What are you doing?

466
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,410
I’m not doing anything.

467
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,000
You’re not doing anything, yet you’re dressed so pretty. Did you get a boyfriend?

468
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,140
No, I didn’t.

469
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,670
No? I’m a lie detector. Don’t lie to me.

470
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,740
I want to go back to Yilan to visit my mother.

471
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,090
I haven’t seen Auntie in a long time. I miss her, I’ll go with you!

472
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,250
Hey. Why would you go?

473
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,080
Fine, I'm going back home to go on a blind date.

474
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,110
That makes more sense.

475
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,500
Zhou Weiwei, you’re going on a blind date.

476
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,320
You didn't even wear false eyelashes or apply any blush. Which shoes are you planning to wear?

477
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,730
I've matched it (with my outfit).

478
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,590
I wish you happiness.

479
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,300
Good luck.

480
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,720
Can you stop looking at me like that? It’s making me uncomfortable.

481
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,040
You’re really beautiful.

482
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,950
Someone said that eight million dollar merchandise must be packaged to be valuable. This is my most valuable outfit.

483
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,990
Even if you’re not satisfied, I can’t do anything about it.

484
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,500
I’m satisfied.

485
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,950
Please get in.

486
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,230
Can you concentrate on driving?

487
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,070
I’m very concentrated.

488
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,150
<i>Where are you?</i>

489
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:24,070
<i>I’m on my way. There’s still some time before I arrive.</i>

490
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,570
<i>Mwah.</i>

491
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,010
You’re about to spend the night with another man.

492
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,160
You are still sending a "kissing" sticker to your boyfriend. Like this, it isn't really good? Right?

493
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,270
Are you lying to me, him or yourself?

494
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,850
You’re not going to say anything? Are you embarrassed or shy?

495
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,380
Where exactly are we going?

496
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,500
It's the countryside. Can't you make it out? I like nature.

497
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,650
Oh, that's right! That "321" is your colleague.

498
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,500
I heard your boss doesn’t like office relationships.

499
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,620
And since you guys are still working there, that means no one has discovered you two.

500
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,750
You’re very good at keeping a secret.

501
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,250
Do you like it?

502
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,740
I reserved the whole place.

503
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,800
So today, we’re here for a BBQ?

504
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,520
What? You’re not satisfied with my arrangements?

505
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,340
In that case, we can also immediately go and find a hotel to stay in.

506
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,660
That’s not what I meant. I just think it’s kind of weird.

507
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,520
There’s someone to help us cook the meat, the tent is already set up, there are plenty to serve us food and drinks. Is this good?

508
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,140
That’s why I think it’s weird.

509
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,730
I want to buy cola.

510
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,200
I need to buy cola.

511
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,770
I want to buy cola.

512
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,840
I really want to buy cola.

513
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,220
I. want. to. buy...

514
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,840
Cola.

515
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,540
<i>(I want to buy cola.)</i>

516
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,170
This is embarrassing.

517
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,370
<i>(Are you sure you want to delete this post?) <br>(delete)</i>

518
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,950
<i>(You have a new friend notification)</i>

519
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,340
"One single root."

520
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,500
"I also want to buy cola."

521
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,740
- You are "a single root"? <br> - Yes

522
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,200
I also have another nickname.

523
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,780
You’re amazing.

524
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,190
It’s nothing. I’m just cooking skewers.

525
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,530
It’s almost done.

526
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,120
I’m not in a rush.

527
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,620
Thank you.

528
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,340
Take your time.

529
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:19,350
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

530
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,090
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears ♫</i>

531

<i>♫ don’t lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

532
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,520
I really don't understand you rich people.

533
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,710
Camping is only fun when you do things yourself.

534
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,520
Who camps with help?

535
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,350
Why wouldn't you just go stay at a hotel and eat at a restaurant?

536
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,220
You look so serious grilling the meat.

537
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,450
And now you're eating so happily.

538
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,150
You seem to have forgotten the reason you're here.

539
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,580
I haven't. I was just looking for something to do. To take my mind off it.

540
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,730
I almost forgot. Today is just a transaction.

541
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,120
It's a bit awkward.

542
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,180
Have some wine. It'll dissolve the tension.

543
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,670
How are you?

544
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,190
Honestly. Really good.

545
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,350
You are the first one to understand what "Buy cola" means.

546
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:14,190
It's not difficult. "Make love" <br> (N.B. To buy cola in Chinese "Mai Ke Le" phonetically sounds like "make love.")

547
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:24,430
Kefei, even though I keep telling myself not to make any more mistakes.

548
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,440
- But I have to honestly face my... <br> - No.

549
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,790
Don't say anything.

550
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,370
Kefei. Kefei, don't ignore me.

551
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,590
Kefei, listen to me.

552
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,460
You listen to me.

553
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,930
You've already released all your tension.

554
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,990
Your lust has come to an end. None of your feelings were real.

555
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,340
Now walk out the door. Once you're out, you'll forget.

556
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,750
Or you can go have a shower.

557
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,700
When the cold water rains over you, you'll forget everything.

558
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:00,260
Yan Baiyang, don't say things that make me angry anymore.

559
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,690
Kefei,

560
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,530
I want to take you home.

561
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,690
Say goodnight to you downstairs.

562
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,090
And watch as you head inside.

563
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,780
Kefei, let's date.

564
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,580
Hello? Please get me an ambulance.

565
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,800
Because there's a psycho kneeling in front of me saying he wants to date.

566
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,750
Please send a few people

567
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,610
to capture him, shackle him, lock him up.

568
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:39,150
Don't let this psycho appear in front of me. Understand?

569
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,500
Here.

570
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,060
Take it.

571
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,790
What about it?

572
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,760
Cherish this apple.

573
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,160
What do you mean?

574
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,600
This is a Japanese import. Sun Fuji apple.

575
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,910
Sun Fuji apple?

576
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,250
I've seen this online. It costs more than NT$10,000 per apple.

577
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:33,880
That's enough to feed me for 3 months. You're going to eat this?

578
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,610
Of course. That's why I said cherish it.

579
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,800
Here. I'll go wash it.

580
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,730
Wait.

581
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,540
It's very expensive.

582
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,380
Why? I bought it to eat it.

583
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,670
No.

584
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,060
- I'm going to wash it <br> - That's such a waste!

585
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,500
- What do you mean "a waste"? Let me wash it. <br> - No! Don't waste it.

586
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,750
- No it's fine. <br> - No!

587
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,550
Zhou Weiwei!

588
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,250
Zhou Weiwei, what are you doing? Zhou Weiwei!

589
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,930
I found it.

590
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,330
I've got it.

591
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,990
Zhou Weiwei, you are the dumbest and most serious girl I've ever seen.

592
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,570
You shouldn't waste it.

593
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,610
No. Let me go!

594
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,580
I won't let go.

595
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,980
If I can be your man,

596
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,940
I will cherish you forever.

597
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,340
Can you turn the light off?

598
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,010
Are you nervous?

599
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,620
Tell me.

600
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,970
Why did you agree to spend the night with me?

601
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,940
I just wanted to make Haoyi happy.

602
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,290
Then, does 321 know you were coming? <br>(N.B. He's talking about Li Haoyi)

603
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,640
Of course, he doesn't know.

604
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,710
I just thought that if we could save NT$8,000,000 on the house,

605
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,410
we would be able to fulfill our dreams.

606
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:32,600
So, that's why I'm here.

607
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,000
Is it your dream? Or his dream?

608
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,830
You made such a huge decision. You're here to spend the night with me behind his back.

609
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,940
You say you're trying to realize your dream.

610
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,730
What are you thinking?

611
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,110
Do you think he'll love you more?

612
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,160
Or do you think you'll love him more?

613
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,130
Do you think you're really great?

614
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,930
I'm not that great. I'm just...

615
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,980
I'm just doing this for our future.

616
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,140
I'm willing to sacrifice myself. Isn't that okay?

617
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,140
Sacrifice?

618
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,920
Do you think 321 will be grateful to you?

619
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,520
Do you even think he'll love you once he finds out you spent the night with me?

620
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:37,850
Idiot! You women are all the same.

621
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:42,610
You think your sacrifices are so great. It's actually abduction and blackmail.

622
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:46,420
Do you know how much pressure your sacrifices put on us?

623
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,310
You're like this. Gao Ziyuan is like this, too.

624
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:54,960
Don't you know your sacrifices drain the love between two people until nothing is left?

625
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,550
How dare you?

626
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,600
How dare you use your sacrifices to control someone else's future.

627
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:14,630
The deal is off. I'm not selling the house anymore.

628

631
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,520
You must be so busy buying all this stuff, huh?

632
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,600
You didn't have any time to answer my call. I'm super hungry.

633
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,300
I'm sorry.

634
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,150
I was thinking that Kehuan is taking office as the CEO soon,

635
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:24,510
so I'd better make use of this time and buy some stuff to get everything in order for him.

636
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,750
That way, he can live up to his reputation.

637
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,520
It looks like you've bought a lot in just the few days that I've been back.

638
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,980
Brother Kehuan doesn't have a problem with it?

639
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:41,520
He spoils me. He knows I'm doing it for his own good.

640
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,500
He loves me.

641
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,760
In the few days I've been back, I'm getting a vibe that you and Brother Kehuan have become

642
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,520
very polite. It feels like there's a distance between you two.

643
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,330
He's just busy.

644
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:07,860
We've been together for ten years already. Even the most passionate of romances will fizzle out into familial affection.

645
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:13,870
It's like being family, so I'm able to accept that distance you speak of.

646
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:18,970
I can understand everything Kehuan does.

647
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,650
In the future, don't call him Brother Kehuan. Call him your brother-in-law.

648
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:29,690
You guys aren't even married yet.

649
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,690
We will get married.

650
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:36,490
It's so late now. Brother Kehuan isn't home yet.

651
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:39,430
Don't you need to call him and ask what he's up to?

652
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,540
He'll come home when it's time.

653
01:05:51,710 --> 01:06:04,950
<i>(Baiyang)</i>

654
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,770
Weiwei, you're home?

655
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,500
I'm home.

656
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,630
You look terrible. Did your blind date go badly?

657
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,030
Hello, is anyone home?

658
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:30,770
Did you fall into the water? Why aren't you talking?

659
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,300
Boss, I really don't understand.

660
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:39,410
Are these living things called women that difficult to understand? I feel like I'm giving her my heart and soul,

661
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:44,280
yet she hits me, yells at me, and tells me not to meet with her again. Why is that?

662
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,640
Just because I told you not to confess to her before the act doesn't mean you can confess right after.

663
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,090
I know, but I couldn't resist. I couldn't do it.

664
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,870
So what now? You failed, so you're trying to save the relationship?

665
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:01,330
That's right. I'm thinking about giving her one pearl every month.

666
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:07,120
After some time, it can be strung into a necklace. If she doesn't accept it, I'll just consider it a regular investment.

667
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,150
Okay, then go take a look. If you need help, just call me.

668
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,030
You're not going to look with me?

669
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,340
Are you dating her or am I?

670
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,750
Okay.

671
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,960
<i>I want to buy an engagement ring.</i>

672
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,190
<i>No problem. Do you want to prefer to see our .50-carat or 1-carat rings?</i>

673
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,070
Let me think.

674
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,460
I prepared these for you. Please take a look.

675
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:49,220
I really don't know too much about this. May I ask which kind you girls prefer?

676
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,970
Of course, the larger the better.

677
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,580
The larger the better.

678
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,840
If it were me, I wouldn't pick these.

679
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,220
Mr. Chu, what a coincidence!

680
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,950
Diamonds increase in value as they increase in size.

681
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,830
It's not based on how much area is covered by all the melee diamonds.

682
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,890
It looks like you have a lot of experience in this field.

683
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,400
Are you saying that I'm a womanizer?

684
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,400
No, I didn't mean that, Mr. Chu. I meant, uh—

685
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,290
Don't get anxious. I'm just kidding.

686
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:30,080
So, you're getting ready to propose to Weiwei?

687
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,400
That's right.

688
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:41,160
I thought it over. We keep having issues buying a house, but I can't keep delaying this with Weiwei.

689
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,510
We'll talk about buying a house later.

690
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:49,530
I set aside some of the budget for our house to buy a ring and propose to her.

691
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,930
But in order to keep it a secret, I can't discuss it with Weiwei either.

692
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,850
I had to do my own research online.

693
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:59,960
And then you showed up here with such useful advice!

694
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,810
So, you need me to give you recommendations?

695
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,830
I need it badly.

696
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,510
- Weiwei is probably a very earnest person, right?<br>- Yes.

697
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,910
So, she wouldn't like anything too flamboyant, right?

698
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,410
No, she wouldn't.

699
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,250
Then, we can choose a few that are simple and natural.

700
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,460
Miss, can you help us pick out a few that have a simple design?

701
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,430
- We want a single diamond without any melee diamonds.<br>- Okay.

702
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,400
- Thank you.<br>- Thank you.

703
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:44,990
I can only help you up to this point. The rest is up to you.

704
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:47,430
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

705
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,440
Good luck.
