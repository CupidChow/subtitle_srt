<i>Do you think 321 will be grateful to you?</i>

<i>Do you even think he'll love you once he finds out you spent the night with me?</i>

16
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,670
<i>It's actually abduction and blackmail.</i>

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,010
<i>Do you know how much pressure your sacrifices put on us?</i>

18

<i>The deal is off. I'm not selling the house anymore.</i>

19
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,600
So was the guy not handsome?

20
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,540
Handsome.

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,120
Not tall?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,340
Tall.

23
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,970
He must be a poor guy.

24
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,860
Compared to us, he is very rich.

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,130
Tall, handsome, and rich.

26
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,960
Then he must have personality flaws.

27
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,110
Just bear with it. Why would you reject him?

28
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,120
<i> Do you think your sacrifice is great? Your sacrifice is a form of manipulation and a ransom.</i>

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,390
<i> Do you know how much pressure it puts on us?</i>

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,930
<i> The deal is canceled.</i>

31
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,900
<i>I’m not selling the house anymore.</i>

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
It’s me who got rejected.

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
What?

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,530
Mister Li.

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,810
Mister Chu? Why are you still here?

36
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,890
You bought it?

37
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,220
Yeah. Thanks to you.

38
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,760
I was about to leave. But my colleague keeps shopping and can't make up his mind. It's so annoying.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,920
So I was waiting here for him, yet I ran into you.

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,790
What an affinity we have.

41
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,300
Then, if you are willing to sell your house to me,

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,260
that'll be even more of an affinity.

43
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,590
You really want my house?

44
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,760
I’m just kidding. I can’t afford it.

45
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,790
What is your life plan?

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,920
This must be your first house, right?

47
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,980
Yes.

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,990
Weiwei and I plan to retire by the time we're 65.

49
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,560
What if something disrupts your plans?

50
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,030
Even if there is,

51
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,130
Weiwei and I would have to change our plans.

52
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,710
You look like you really love her.

53
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,000
<i> I thought</i>

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,340
<i> our dreams would come true if we could get a NT$8,000,000 discount for the house.</i>

55
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,150
<i> I'm not great.</i>

56
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,640
<i> I'm just willing to make a sacrifice</i>

57
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,740
<i> for Haoyi's and my future.</i>

58
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
What's your budget?

59
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,810
It's only NT$20,000,000.

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
How about this?

61
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,780
I'll give you an NT$8,000,000 discount and sell it to you for NT$24,000,000.

62
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm sorry. It's not within your budget.

63
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,310
So, you have to keep working hard.

64
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,610
Mister Chu, I...

65
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,580
You don't need to be doubtful.

66
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,960
Ziyuan is Weiwei's friend from university.

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,160
I want everyone to be happy.

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,010
Other than thank you, I don't know what to say.

69
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,220
Keep fighting.

70
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,030
As long as you promise after you've bought the house,

71
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,000
you'll be happy. That'll be enough.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,590
I'll get the escrow agent in contact with you as soon as possible. I'm going now.

73
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,090
Right. Don't let Weiwei get caught in the rain again.

74
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,180
She was caught in the rain? When?

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,570
Mister Chu, how did you know?

76
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,210
I'm just talking hypothetically.

77
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,160
Oh.

78
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,560
Bye-bye.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,610
Huh?

80
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,280
Did you fart? Or pick your nose in front of him?

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,840
You're quite pretty and have a good figure.

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,690
Yet you were rejected?

83
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,560
How handsome, tall or rich is the other guy?

84
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,070
I don't know what happened either.

85
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm not sure if I should be glad or sad.

86
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,550
Oh.

87
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,660
Message.

88
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,750

91
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,750
<i> Hurry. Tell your mom we bought a house!</i>

92
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,260
Let me tell you. I just ran into Mr. Chu.

93
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,160
He's willing to give us an NT$8,000,000 discount for his house.

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,110
NT$8,000,000! <i>He's going to sell it to us.</i>

95
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,320
<i> I'm so happy right now. Are you happy?</i>

96
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,770
Weiwei? Why are you not talking?

97
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,370
I'm shocked. Let me calm down.

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,390
What are you doing? Got struck by lightening?

99
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,600
I need to make a call.

The guy who rejected me.

104
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,250
What in the world? Have some self-respect, okay?

105
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,520
He rejected you! Why would you call him?

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,620
Why didn’t you pick up the phone?

125
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,770
How did you know I was here?

126
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,100
Why are you giving us a discount?

127
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,940
Why did you tell Haoyi and not me?

128
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,930
What are you thinking?

129
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,380
Is it important about what I’m thinking?

130
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,690
Then, can you at least explain

131
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,230
why you were so angry yesterday;

132
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,410
yet, changed your mind today.

133
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,820
Didn’t you say

134
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,830
you weren't selling the house. The deal was off?

135
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,610
Because I want you to be happy.

136
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,810
I'm selling the house to you, not to 321.

137
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,160
Do you remember what I said to you last night?

138
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,150
I said you're the most genuine woman I've met.

139
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,980
I meant it.

140
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,280
I've never seen a woman

141
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,010
chase an NT$105 receipt so earnestly.

142
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,260
I've also never seen a woman

143
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,990
chase so earnestly after an apple that fell into the lake.

144
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,190
And who would, for the sake of her boyfriend's dream,

145
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,800
sacrifice herself and spend the night with me.

146
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,320
Barbecuing so sincerely,

147
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,730
preparing a dinner

148
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,760
that might be fraught with danger.

149
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,990
You're the first I've seen

150
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,530
who could be so sincere in the face of danger.

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,400
I also believe you're the last.

152
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,950
I don't know if I'll have the chance or the courage to say this to you in the future.

153
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,370
But at this moment, you are the only

154
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,200
one who could find me.

155
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,350
What a shame. It's such a shame.

156
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,770
I met you too late.

157
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,370
So, I decided to give you my blessing. To stop messing with your life.

158
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,010
So you can continue with your life plans.

159
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,750
Because you deserve to have

160
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,590
the most simple happiness.

161
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,790
Thank you.

162
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,370
I'm the one who should say thank you.

163
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Thank you for allowing me to see myself.

164
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,020
I'm really happy.

165
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,790
I'm happy I liked

166
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,030
and pursued you.

Zhou Weiwei,

177
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,150
do you know why I sold the house to you?

178
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,820
Because it contains our shared memories.

179
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going now.

186
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,070
You sold the house to Weiwei?

187
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,160
How much did you sell it for?

188
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,950
A reasonable price.

189
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,380
A reasonable price? How much is that?

190
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,670
Kehuan, don't sell the house carelessly just because Weiwei and I went to school together.

191
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,730
And you never discussed it with me.

192
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,460
The house is mine. How much I sell it for is my problem.

193
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,170
Besides, didn't you want to sell it as soon as possible?

194
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,580
Okay. If you've already made the decision, it's fine.

195
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,030
Come. I want to show you something.

196
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,660
Look. I looked at these houses this afternoon.

197
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,460
I think these two are pretty good.

198
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,800
- Size-wise, they're big enough, too. <br> - This one is fine.

199
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,520
I'll leave it to you then.

200
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,160
That way, we can quickly move out and give this house to them.

201
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,570
Ziting,

202
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,110
if you can't find a place in time, you're welcome to move in with us.

203
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,690
All right.

204
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,550
I'm going to sleep.

205
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,820
He said to buy this one

206
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,960
and move in right away?

207
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,670
Yes. That's what he said.

208
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,510
Is he at a supermarket?

209
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,270
He doesn't want to see the house he's going to buy?

210
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,960
He said I can handle it.

211
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,450
I've seen this house.

212
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,840
It's a good size and has plenty of light.

213
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,330
It fits our criteria.

214
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,340
And look, I've even planned the decor already.

215
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,570
Wait a minute. I think there's something wrong with the both of you.

216
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,850
One doesn't want to see a house before buying it. The other lives in her own little world.

217
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,650
You have no warmth in your interactions.

218
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,170
Don't you need to communicate about something as important as buying a house?

219
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,290
Gao Ziting, what are you trying to say?

220
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,460
There's something wrong with your relationship.

221
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,250
What's wrong with it?

222
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,380
Kehuan trusts me. He's letting me take care of it. What's wrong with that?

223
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,410
You don't think it's a problem?

224
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,260
I think you guys have given up on communicating completely.

225
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,680
The bigger the house, the larger the distance between the two of you.

226
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,780
I've already told you. We've been together for ten years.

227
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,560
We're familiar with each other.

228
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,210
We naturally know what the other is thinking.

229
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,720
Besides, if your Brother Kehuan really has given up,

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,520
why would he spend tens of millions to buy this house?

231
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,280
All right. I'm thinking too much. I'm overstepping.

232
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,620
I'll immediately find a place and move out.

233
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,110
I don't want to witness a tragedy here.

234
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,030
You are thinking too much!

258
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,620
I'm making tea.

259
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,770
Add some sugar. It'll taste better.

260
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,960
We're about to move house. Why are you sighing?

261
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm not.

262
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,550
It's just that there's a lot to think about when buying a house.

263
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
Are you worried about the decor costs?

264
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,130
Relax. The house is in great shape.

265
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,340
We just need a few pieces of furniture.

266
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,830
Besides, I've already discussed it with the bank.

267
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,820
Mr. Chu's house is so cheap.

268
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,080
It means we can take out a 100% loan.

269
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,110
Another piece of good news. I have a friend who's an interior designer.

270
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,130
I've known him since we were in the first year of university.

271
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,990
He said if we get him to do it, he'll give us a discount on the design and the renovations.

272
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,080
I think the kitchen and the bathroom are the most important.

273
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,920
<i>If we improve the kitchen,</i>

274
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,050
<i>we will be able to make dinner every night after work.</i>

275
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,780
<i> That way, we can save more in living expenses.</i>

276
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,400
Yan Baiyang! E39872 B70146 H50132. Quickly.

277
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,840
Amy!

278
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,900
Brother Kehuan, Amy's on leave today.

279
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,350
Come and help Baiyang. Give me your quota.

280
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,720
Hurry up.

281
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,110
What's wrong with him today?

282
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,330
How would I know?

283
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,230
Hey, do you still have time to chat? B33902.

284
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,710
G74091.

285
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,860
Yes!

286
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,840
Chu Kehuan, have you eaten the wrong pill?

287
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,020
Do you need to try so hard?

288
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,880
You're placing such a large order for someone who is about to become the CEO in a couple of days.

289
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,920
Don't you want to leave everyone else a bite to eat?

290
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,210
Can you stop bothering me?

291
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,660
I need to earn back my NT$8 million.

292
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,630
Boss, have something to eat.

293
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,320
Thanks.

294
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,770
Aren't you going home?

295
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm waiting for the American market.

296
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,530
You don't have to try so hard. You're not short of money.

297
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,150
And you're doing so much overtime. Don't you have to go home?

298
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,760
I sold the house.

299
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,300
You sold the house?

300
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,490
You sold the house— Then, where are you moving to?

301
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,840
I don’t know.

302
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,410
You don't know? You sold your house and you don't know where you're going to live?

303
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,150
But...

304
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,070
Don’t worry. I heard that my new house is really big.

305
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,200
I'm sure your Sister Ziyuan will invite you to our housewarming.

306
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,290
Boss, you know I'm always on your side,

307
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,600
not Sister Ziyuan's.

308
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
Whatever.

309
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,660
Do you need something?

310
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,820
No. I just think we do a lot of overtime.

311
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,850
You might be able to handle working around the clock.

312
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,080
I really can't take it anymore, Boss.

313
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,620
Can you let me buy coke today?

314
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,140
Buy coke?

315
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,340
Sure. Help me buy two bottles of beer, too.

316
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,560
Boss, what I mean “buy coke” means...

317
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,740
Boss,

318
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,230
Kefei asked me out today. It's very important.

319
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,200
It's Kefei. Let me go, please!

320
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,150
Buy coke.

321
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,710
Buy coke.

322
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,790
Please.

323
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,880
Go ahead.

324
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes! Yes! Thank you, Boss.

325
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,820
Boss is the best.

326
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,220
Boss, is everything okay with Sister Ziyuan?

327
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,210
Yan Baiyang, do you want to turn on your computer

328
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,420
and do the Nasdaq report again?

329
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,950
All right, I'll pretend I didn't say anything. I'll see you tomorrow!

330
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,960
See you tomorrow! Bye-bye!

331
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,380
Buy coke

332
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,160
Take it back.

333
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,730
So, the reason you asked me out today was to return the gift? I assumed...

334
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,150
Don't make assumptions.

335
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,040
Hello. Whiskey, on the rocks.

336
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,400
Thank you.

337
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,450
But I want to continue a relationship with you.

338
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,070
Don't stop. Keep going.

339
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,840
So, you gave me this in order to restrict me

340
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,490
and make me only belong to you?

341
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,490
Let me make it clear. We're just in a mutually beneficial arrangement.

342
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,880
Originally, I was truly enjoying

343
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,060
the simple pleasures.

344
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,850
But you're a real downer.

345
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,500
Always talking about wanting a relationship.

346
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
And now you're giving me gifts to shackle me.

347
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,110
What are you trying to do? Be my sugar daddy?

348
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,960
Why not just give me cash? Are you treating me like an escort?

349
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
- No. How would I dare?<br>- Forget it.

350
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,380
What you think is not important.

351
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,950
But can you help me with something?

352
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,620
Next week,

353
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
get your Boss out for a matchmaking party.

354
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,000
Han Kefei, you're being rude.

355
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,760
How so?

356
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,600
Just forget about pursuing my boss. He already has a girlfriend.

357
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,020
I wasn't going to do anything. Even if I was...

358
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,480
You can't do anything with him.

359
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,870
Just don't think about that anymore.

360
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,040
He's been doing so much overtime lately and refuses to go home.

361
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,260
So, he's got problems with his girlfriend?

362
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,850
How would I know?

363
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,760
He's working so hard. I'm overworked, too.

364
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,820
Aren't you his bro? Why didn't you ask him?

365
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,380
What a coincidence.

366
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,950
I had a meeting nearby. I happened to stop by for something.

367
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,000
Chu Kehuan!

368
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,370
You don't have to avoid me on purpose.

369
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,230
I’m not. You’re thinking too much.

370
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,120
How are you recently?

371
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,520
Getting ready to move to the new house.

372
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Congratulations.

373
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,120
Thank you.

374
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,810
I still have a meeting. I’ll leave first.

375
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,960
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

376
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

377
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,000
Look, Kehuan. I think this chandelier suits our living room.

378
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,260
I saw another one that would suit the study.

379
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,340
This one.

380
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,820
Brother Kehuan, my sister is talking to you.

381
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,980
I heard her.

382
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,960
I think they're all good. You can decide.

383
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,980
I don't have an appetite. I'll go settle the bill.

384
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,320
I think Brother Kehuan isn't very interested in the new house.

385
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,580
Do you think he still has you in his heart?

386
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,830
He's just a bit busy with work lately.

387
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,480
He doesn't have the energy to care about these trivial things.

388
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,930
I can understand.

389
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,130
Don't think too much.

390
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,770
All right. If you want to keep lying to yourself, there's nothing I can do.

391
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,210
You guys can live together in this sham. I can't do it.

392
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,720
I'm going to stay at a classmate's place tonight. I don't have an appetite either.

393
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,170
Not bad, not bad.

394
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,670
This house is great! This television...

395
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,820
The owner left this for us. Most of the furniture is his, too.

396
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,660
This is beyond my expectations.

397
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,720
Haoyi, you got really lucky

398
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,430
to be able to be with Weiwei.

399
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,620
If it wasn't for her relationship with her classmate,

400
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,740
how could they sell this to you so cheaply?

401
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,720
And what a beautiful balcony.

402
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,370
This balcony alone is worth it.

403
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,760
<i>Zhou Weiwei, do you know why I sold the house to you?</i>

404
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,540
<i> Because it contains our shared memories.</i>

405
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,340
Weiwei.

406
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,560
Now you have a house. Everything can be settled.

407
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,020
You two have to help each other in the future.

408
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,460
If Haoyi is immature in any way, please be understanding.

409
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,580
Dad, what are you talking about? I'll be the one to take care of Weiwei.

410
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,600
Scoundrel, you finally said something right.

411
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,330
You are moving?! How bad am I to you?

412
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm paying two-thirds of the rent.

413
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,870
I use more water and electricity, so paying two-thirds for utilities is fine.

414
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm even paying the building management fees for you. What else do you want?

415
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,010
Kefei, don't get angry. Listen to me.

416
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,740
There are three months left on the lease. I will still split the rent with you until then.

417
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,900
It's not a money problem! Why are you moving?

418
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,900
You have three months to find a housemate.

419
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,350
Why are you moving?

420
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,090
I-I have a boyfriend.

421
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,400
Your mom...<br><i>(T/N: It sounds like Kefei is cursing at Weiwei.)</i>

422
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,470
Does she know?

423
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,600
Why don’t I know?

424
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,190
What kind of friend are you?

425
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,560
You eat, sleep and live here.

426
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,770
I even pay for your taxis to work.

427
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,430
Hey, I don't take the taxi to work with you.

428
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,580
Do you have any right to talk back?

429
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,620
No.

430
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,750
Tell me. Who's your boyfriend? Have I met him before?

431
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,710
You've seen him before.

432
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,600
Chu Kehuan?

433
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,940
Why are you thinking of him? It's not him!

434
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,730
We've been together for three years.

435
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,790
You and Chu Kehuan have been together for three years?

436
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,500
What are you talking about?

437
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,150
I only bought his house. I'm getting married soon.

438
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,530
Chu Kehuan bought a house and is marrying you?

439
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,760
It’s not Chu Kehuan!

440
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,620
It's someone in the R&amp;D department at work.

441
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,540
R&amp;D department?

442
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,930
Miss, you can stomach someone like David?

443
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:53,600
It's not David. It's the one who sits next to David, Li Haoyi.

444
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,760
Li Haoyi?

445
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,410
What 321? Who is he?

446
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,100
Li Haoyi. An engineer in the R&amp;D department.

447
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,800
We have been together for 3 years.

448
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,770
Li Haoyi? Who the heck is he?

449
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,840
So Chu Kehuan sold his house

450
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,040
to you and that something Yi.

451
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,780
And then he and his girlfriend moved to a bigger house?

452
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,140
You finally got it.

453
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,930
If I were you, I would choose Chu Kehuan.

454
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,360
He's someone else's, not mine.

455
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,730
I don't understand you.

456
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,740
You've dated that 321 for three years,

457
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
yet no one knows about it?

458
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,940
Are you sure you want to be with someone so nonexistent?

459
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,480
Why are you saying that about Haoyi?

460
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,870
He's a good person.

461
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,010
He's very dependable and honest.

462
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,460
Most importantly, he doesn't play tricks.

463
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,810
You should look for that kind of person for a husband.

464
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,020
Then tell me. Are you satisfied?

465
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,920
What are you talking about?

466
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,070
Isn’t it like this? Life is like this.

467
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,560
Why not with Chu Kehuan?

468
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,940
Why aren't you with him? Wasn't he pursuing you?

469
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,580
Didn’t I say it a lot of times?

470
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,300
He's my university classmate's boyfriend.

471
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm thinking... Hey, I'm thinking,

472
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,120
you're about to get married anyway.

473
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,360
It's one last hurrah... with Chu Kehuan.

474
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,830
What?

475
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,990
What are you talking about? Idiot.

476
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,500
What are you doing?

477
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,160
I won't bother with you anymore. I'm going to bed.

478
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,760
What? I only said three words to you

479
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,250
and you reacted like this. That's fine. Just leave me on my own.

480
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,370
The whole world is leaving me on my own! Who cares?

481
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm so pitiful.

482
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,700
Ignore me. It's fine. Just ignore me forever.

483
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,620
- What are you doing?<br>- I love you, too!

484
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,690
- I'm so pitiful. <br> - Stop crying.

485
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,880
I'm fake crying. Ignore me.

486
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,130
Stop crying.

487
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,860
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

488
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,470
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

489
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,630
Be careful of the doorway. Careful.

490
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,530
Wait a second. Wait for me to close the door.

491
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,580
One more step.

492
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,790
Okay, go ahead.

493
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,100
How is it? Do you like it?

494
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,400
We're starting our new lives together here.

495
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,570
New lives. New starts.

496
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,560
It's all like a dream.

497
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,630
It's not a dream. This is the reality.

498
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,910
We can buy such a good house thanks to Mr. Chu.

499
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,350
I think we should pick a day to invite Mr. Chu and Miss Gao

500
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,930
over for dinner. What do you think?

501
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,650
Okay.

502
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,920
Okay. When?

503
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,830
I'll definitely be there.

504
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,540
I'll bring Kehuan, too. It's a date! Bye.

505
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,610
Can you stop organizing dinner meetings for me?

506
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,860
It's not a dinner meeting. It's Weiwei's boyfriend. He wants to invite us over for dinner.

507
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,760
Actually, it's our previous house.

508
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,420
Kehuan, how much of a discount did you give them?

509
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,280
They're so happy.

510
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,010
Hey!

511
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,230
What's wrong?

512
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,650
I don't feel good.

513
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,020
It sucks being dumped.

514
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,770
Dumped? Who dumped you?

515
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,560
Didn't you say you don't have boyfriends? Who is he?

516
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,830
What are you getting angry for? Psycho.

517
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,280
We've been together for three years.

518
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,630
She had a partner and didn't even tell me.

519
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,750
It wasn't until she was moving house

520
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,130
that she actually told me.

521
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,620
What am I to her?

522
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,590
She left me here all by myself.

523
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,910
And ran off to live in Chu Kehuan's giant house.

524
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,920
You're talking about Zhou Weiwei. You're sisters. Not a couple.

525
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,100
It's not that big a deal, okay?

526
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,290
What do you know?

527
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,420
There's definitely something fishy going on!

528
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,400
Stop speaking nonsense.

529
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,010
How am I speaking nonsense?

530
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,420
If there's nothing going on between them, I'll lose to you.

531
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,280
If Ziyuan heard this, she'd be so mad.

532
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,090
That's not my problem. I don't know her.

533
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,070
<i>Weiwei, I'm going to get some drinks.</i>

534
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,300
<i>They'll be here in an hour. Hurry up.</i>

535
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,790
Okay.

536
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,650
Coming!

537
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,170
Hello. Welcome.

538
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,720
Wow. What a spread!

539
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,020
This. These flowers are for you guys.

540
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,320
And this. This is for Weiwei.

541
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,460
Collagen. For women.

542
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,130
A bit of collagen never hurts.

543
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,020
Oh, how thoughtful.

544
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,080
Thank you. Please, come in.

545
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,640
Thank you.

546
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,970
You've changed this place so much.

547
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,310
So cozy.

548
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,320
It's nothing compared to your decor.

549
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,960
I'll just be a minute.

550
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,390
Weiwei, Mr. Chu and Ziyuan are here.

551
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,930
Have some water.

552
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,790
Thank you.

553
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,940
Weiwei, you're so pretty today.

554
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,420
Thank you.

555
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,350
Guests are coming. Of course, she'd dress prettily.

556
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,530
Oh right. How long has it been since you moved in?

557
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,940
You don't know the guards and managers here, right?

558
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,300
No, we don't.

559
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,370
I'll introduce you. So they can look after you in the future.

560
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,210
Great. If you won't mind.

561
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,630
Mr. Li, I'll take you.

562
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,510
Kehuan.

563
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,330
Do you know the manager? What's his name?

564
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,160
Kehuan's like this.

565
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,610
He's lived here for years and doesn't know anyone.

566
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,070
- Male owner. Come with me.<br> - Okay.

567
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,800
Mr. Chu, have a seat.

568
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,290
Weiwei, can you pour the wine? I'll be right back.

569
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,310
You're so beautiful.

570
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,410
Did you wear this dress today to tell me

571
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,530
you haven't forgotten our camping trip?

572
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,780
No. You're thinking too much.

573
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,980
The kitchen doesn't seem to have changed much.

574
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,350
Yeah. We didn't really have any renovation plans.

575
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,000
Did you pick the wine?

576
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,360
No. Haoyi chose it.

577
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,550
It's the same wine we had on our trip.

578
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,190
Because the production year... is your birth year.

579
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,000
Looks like Mr. Li has grand plans tonight.

580
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,240
It's probably just a coincidence.

581
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,850
Haoyi is usually quite frugal.

582
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,270
Maybe it's because you guys were coming, he wanted to thank you

583
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,760
and just happened to buy this wine.

584
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,450
I miss you so much.

585
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,500
I really miss you.

586
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,550
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise.

587
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,590
I thought I had enough self-control to stop thinking about you.

588
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,190
But after seeing you just now, I gave up.

589
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,020
It's because I discovered I can't control my feelings for you.

590
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,860
Weiwei.

591
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,190
We have two choices right now.

592
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,080
Stay here and wait for them to come back.

593
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,800
We can pretend that nothing happened.

594
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,330
Or...

595
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,360
Leave with me.

596
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,780
Right now.

597
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,850
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

598
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,590
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

599
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,400
Leave with me.

600
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,730
Right now.

601
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,340
Weiwei, Ziyuan is so kind.

602
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,140
She introduced the committee chairman, vice chairman,

603
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,220
and all the administrators to me.

604
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,180
Ziyuan, thank you.

605
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,010
Why are you so formal with me?

606
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,320
We came to have a meal together. We can't just not do anything, right?

607
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,460
I'm already so hungry.

608
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,930
All right, then we–

609
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,810
Hey, wait.

610
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,270
Wait just a bit longer, okay? Wait.

611
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,890
You come.

612
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,930
What?

613
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,360
Sit first. Sit.

614
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,890
Wait for me. Close your eyes first.

615
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,180
Believe me. Close your eyes. Quick.

616
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,980
Wait for me for a second. Don’t peek. Wait for me for a second!

617
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,750
What is Haoyi doing?

618
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,960
Weiwei, you can open your eyes now.

619
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,470
I know I'm a very plain person.

620
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,460
But since the day we started dating,

621
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,800
I've been anticipating the day I marry you.

622
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,650
Zhou Weiwei, marry me.

623
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,140
<i>Right now, we have two choices.</i>

624
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,470
<i>Stay here, and wait for them to come back.</i>

625
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,170
<i>We pretend nothing happened.</i>

626
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,030
<i>Or... leave with me.</i>

627
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,940
Do you want me to help you wear it?

628
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,800
I’m willing.

629
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,610
Haoyi, hurry and marry me.

630
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,800
Kehuan, this was the most unique proposal I've seen.

631
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,950
Did you see Weiwei put on the ring herself just now?

632
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,290
It's so cute, isn't it?

633
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,080
I'm so envious Weiwei has a boyfriend that loves her this much.

634
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:59,240
That's not right, they should be each other's fiance now.

635
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,930
Kehuan, when will we also–

636
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,600
Ziyuan,

637
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,630
let's break up.

638
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,810
What did you say?

639
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,900
I said let's break up.

640
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,120
I can't go on any longer.

641
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,950
I'll leave the new house for you and Ziting.

642
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:37,380
I'll move out tomorrow. That's it.

643
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,210
She's the one that begged me to marry her and put on the ring with no hesitation.

644
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,830
Wait up. It's my dad. He wants to say thank you.

645
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,420
No need.

646
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,900
Dad, she's embarrassed. Sorry.

647
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,530
All right, I understand.

648
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,850
I'll prepare for the wedding soon. I won't let you down.

649
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:22,390
All right. That's it for now. Bye-bye.

650
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,720
God is really treating us well.

651
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,180
Everything is going according to plan.

652
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,110
Although the mortgage is a bit high,

653
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,290
I believe we will get through it together.

654
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,830
That's right! Regarding the wedding preparations,

655
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,750
I know a friend who is a professional photographer.

656
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,640
He's done it for many years. I want to ask if he can help us take a few sets of engagement photos.

657
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,090
I think two sets will be enough.

658
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,950
<i>Because I realized I can't stop myself from caring about you.</i>

659
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,970
<i>Leave with me. Right now.</i>

660
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,400
As for the wedding dress, we can hang it in our apartment.

661
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,390
Taking so many pictures is also...

662
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,330
Weiwei?

663
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,850
Weiwei!

664
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,730
No problem.

665
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,560
What's no problem?

666
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,020
I'm saying that it's up to you.

667
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,780
It's up to me?

668
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,520
Then regarding the wedding preparations, you don't have any opinions?

669
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,620
What about the cake, invitations, dress, and venue?

670
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,740
I'm okay with anything as long as it fits within our budget.

671
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,550
Where did I go to find such a great wife?

672
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,460
You know a lot of my friends told me,

673
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,410
when they were preparing for their wedding,

674
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,500
the girls would have so many opinions.

675
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,210
In the end, they'd be unhappy with all the arguing, some didn't even go through with the wedding!

676
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,910
I won't do that.

677
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,730
Do you want coffee?

678
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,100
Okay.

679
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
I'll go make some.

684
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,480
Boss, this is today's trade summary.

685
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,220
Thank you.

686
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,120
Which ones are we doing today?

687
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,670
Didn't I tell you yesterday when the market closed?

688
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,340
A15880.

689
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,260
But this one–

690
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,870
There are no "buts," we do whatever he says.

00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,960
Boss! The A15880 price is limit down!<br><i>(T/N: Lock limits are in place at all times and are applied to both upside and downside moves. If the price has dropped, trading will not take place below the lock limit. Called "limit down.")</i>

701
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,660
What happened? Didn't you set up a stop-loss point?

702
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,810
It's already locked in. We can't sell it anymore.

703
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,370
This should be the biggest loss you've had in seven years, right?

704
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:33,010
Chu Kehuan, lately your mental state has been abnormally unstable.

705
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,760
Everyone knows that these past few days, this stock has been going up and down erratically.

706
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,980
Even someone without brains would know not to touch this stock.

707
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,360
You even made such a large order.

708
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,730
How are you going to become CEO with those numbers?

709
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:55,910
Don't worry. I will take responsibility for today's loss.

710
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:04,550
Let's get to work. Don't be so unlucky as to run into this stock.

711
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,920
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

713
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,340
Please give me this month's sale's information.

714
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,790
- Okay, no problem. <br> - Thank you.

715
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,980
Hello. Could I help you with anything?

716
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,810
What new technology does this phone have?

717
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,880
There's a lot.

718
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,880
This new phone charges quickly and has high endurance.

719
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,730
Isn't it popular to take selfies nowadays?

720
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,770
It has Leica's dual lens.

721
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,720
With its AI recognition technology, you can take pictures that stand out from the masses.

722
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,710
Thank you.

723
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,980
Thank you.

724
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,520
Please come to us if you want to change phones.

725
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,470
You're so amazing.

726
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,740
Come on, who am I? I'm Han Kefei.

727
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,150
- Thank you.<br> - No problem. Thank you.

728
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,960
- Bye-bye.<br>- Bye-bye.

729
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,350
Let me take a look.

730
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,400
- Thank you. <br> - Bye-bye.

731
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:15,530
It looks like we weren't really affected by the market price reduction competition this time.

732
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,080
I just took a look at their sales report,

733
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,160
and everything looked good.

734
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:22,990
What's wrong?

735
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,560
Nothing. Let's go.

736
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,500
- Okay. <br> - Let's go.

737
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,750
- What are you doing? <br> - Come here.

738
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,180
What is this? A wedding ring?

739
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,990
Yes, Haoyi proposed to me.

740
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,210
You should put this away first.

741
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,970
You still haven't told people at work yet.

742
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,230
What if that retail salesman had seen it?

743
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,980
I wouldn't care if he spreads it to everyone.

744
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,560
Hold on. You're acting weird.

745
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,570
What?

746
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,770
Logically, when a girl gets proposed to,

747
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,980
she should be happy and jumping with joy.

748
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,610
You didn't react when I pulled off your ring.

749
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:18,250
When I told you to put it away, you listened.

750
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,350
You should have at least struggled a little in the process.

751
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,690
But you didn't at all.

752
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:28,320
Since this morning, we've been together for at least 4 hours.

753
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,820
You didn't even tell me that 321 proposed to you.

754
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,300
And then look at your face, you don't look happy at all.

755
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,890
What are you trying to say?

756
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:39,810
Ms. Zhou Weiwei, do you not want to get married?

757
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,610
When did I say that?

758
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:48,360
Getting married has always been in Haoyi's and my plan for 3 years.

759
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,330
Also, strictly speaking,

760
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:54,030
he didn't propose to me, I asked him to marry me.

761
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,620
What?

762
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,950
What were you just talking about?

763
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,090
You begged 321 to marry you?

764
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,210
Is your market price really that bad?

765
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,560
Or do you really love him that much?

766
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:11,620
I'm just being honest. Let me tell you. You still have time to back out.

767
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,170
Or are you going to wait until your child is born?

768
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,000
If you want to back out, then you'd have to push the baby back in.

769
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,040
Just now, the Executive Assistant—

770
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,780
It's okay. He just came to check in. We've already talked.

771
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,300
Are you sure it's okay?

772
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,960
- This isn't a typical—<br>- I am aware of my own matter.

773
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,490
- Boss.<br>- What about what I asked you to do?

774
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,730
This is the daily rental suite key. I'll give you the address later.

775
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,020
As for Sister Ziyuan—

776
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,330
I already told you not to ask.

777
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,930
Boss, I remember when I first started working with you,

778
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,580
you would always remind me that in this industry,

779
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:11,530
it's taboo to have mood swings, as it would affect our judgment.

780
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,190
So?

781
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,200
So, right now due to your own personal feelings, you have caused such a big loss.

782
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,900
A high-level executive in the bank holding company already came to check in. What happens if you can't become CEO?

783
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,560
I don't care.

784
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,230
I'm already prepared to not be the CEO.

785
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:27,090
How can you not be the CEO?

786
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,870
Oh, such a rare visitor!

787
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:51,570
Why is the big manager of the PR department coming to the R&amp;D department? What is your business here?

788
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,350
Go away.

789
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,000
321, come out with me.

790
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,470
Are you calling me?

791
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,900
Yes, I have something to talk to you about.

792
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,760
Oh.

793
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,340
Changing your preference?

794
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,790
You can even eat engineers?

795
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,370
You're such a potty mouth.

796
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,860
When are you leaving?

797
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,410
Leave? To where?

798
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,430
Leaving this company.

799
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,390
Me? Leave?

800
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:41,070
Aren't you and Zhou Weiwei getting married?

801
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,010
So you already know we're getting married.

802
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,110
Don't worry. As for the bridesmaid—

803
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,350
That's not the point.

804
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,810
The point is that the company is against office romances.

805
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:58,630
When married couples become coworkers, it's a conflict of interest that should be avoided at all cost. Don't you know that?

806
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,580
Of course, I know. That's why I—

807
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,020
That's why...

808
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,450
if you resign and then Weiwei announces that you guys will be getting married,

809
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:08,590
then the problem will be resolved.

810
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:09,550
But I—

811
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,870
What are you so hesitant about?

812
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,910
Weiwei is merely a project manager without any specialty.

813
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,240
You want her to resign? How much better of a job can she find out there?

814
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,810
You're an R&amp;D engineer. You can go anywhere you want.

815
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,960
Who knows, maybe your future salary could be higher than yours now.

816
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,360
Of course, it should be you who resigns and Weiwei who stays.

817
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,900
Are you even listening to me?

818
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,650
If you really love Weiwei and want to marry her,

819
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,800
hurry up and resign.

820
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,430
I am Li Haoyi.

821
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,920
Sister Maizi?

822
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,000
Don't worry, I took care of everything.

823
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,130
You took care of what?

824
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,380
What are you guys talking about?

825
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,170
Gossip? I also want to hear about it.

826
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,160
Is the office a place to gossip? Did you finish writing your proposal?

827
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,600
I am writing it now.

828
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,240
Then, hurry up.

829
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,140
Okay.

830
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,600
- Let me tell you.<br>- Hold on.

831
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,330
<i>Weiwei, I have a dinner tonight, so I will be coming home later.</i>

832
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,830
<i>Eat first. Don't wait for me.</i>

833
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,370
<i>Okay.</i>

834
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,170
Coming.

835
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,200
Hi.

836
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,390
Excuse me.

837
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,990
This place is big.

838
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,950
It's even two-story.

839
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,520
Isn't this too big for one person?

840
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,100
Oh, right. I bought you some stuff.

841
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,190
I helped you buy milk and microwave meals.

842
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,840
If you are hungry at night,

843
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,140
you can get up and microwave it as a nighttime snack or eat it for breakfast.

844
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,560
Ziyuan, you really don't have to do this.

845
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,350
It's okay.

846
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:36,120
I have to shop every day and I'm using your money.

847
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:43,110
I also sent your clothes to the cleaners.

848
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:46,930
I also specifically told the cleaners to wash and iron them well.

849
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,980
I will bring them to you in two days.

850
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,730
The view here is beautiful.

851
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:21,620
Ziyuan, we already broke up, so you really don't have to do this.

852
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:28,550
You said you want to break up, Kehuan.

853
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,210
I know we were together for too long.

854
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,340
We never got married or had the commitment of a wedding.

855
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,220
Perhaps you've forgotten that when two people are together,

856
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,940
there is a responsibility between a man and a woman.

857
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:44,180
I don't blame you. I've spoiled you too much.

858
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,100
That's why I understand that you want to come out on your own

859
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,270
and experience a new life and environment.

860
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,120
That is very normal.

861
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,190
But Kehuan,

862
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,910
I can accept our temporary separation to give you time to cool down.

863
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:08,190
However, taking a break is not the same as a breakup.

864
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,770
I won't say anything anymore, so you won't feel pressured.

865
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,710
Or should I clean up the second floor?

866
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,510
I said you really don't need to.

867
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,710
Gao Ziyuan, I want you to listen carefully.

868
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,750
- We already- <br>- I know.

869
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,760
Temporarily separated.

870
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:37,130
But I just said that being temporarily separated does not mean we are breaking up.

871
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:42,170
I’ll leave first. Bye-bye.

872
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:05,000
<i></i>

873
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,530
<i>I hate you so much.</i>

874
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:14,970
<i>I hate you so much for making me doubt...</i>

875
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,220
<i>doubt my own love.</i>

876
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,390
<i> Zhou Weiwei! </i>

877
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,540
<i> Zhou Weiwei, I like you! </i>

878
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,090
<i>Before you become Mrs. Li, can I ask you to</i>

879
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:28,790
<i>face yourself clearly and look at me once more?</i>

880
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:37,130
<i>♫ Closing the door, returning to real life ♫</i>

881
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:44,190
<i>♫ Shedding this skin, lazing around ♫</i>

882
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,580
<i>♫ Living freely ♫</i>

<i>♫ Neither bad nor good, it's just one person hanging on ♫</i>

884

<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

885
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:10,140
<i>♫ I miss you more than before ♫</i>

886
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,800
<i>♫ I've been forcing a smile all these years ♫</i>

887
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,190
<i>♫ Trying hard to live and be a better person ♫</i>

888
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:24,200
<i>♫ Believing that time will always take something away ♫</i>

01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:30,850

890
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:36,880

01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,450
