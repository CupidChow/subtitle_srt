<i> Chu Kehuan! </i>

<i> How did you know? </i>

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,120
- Good morning! <br> - Good morning!

23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,260
You finally made your appearance!

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,200
You have no loyalty. I didn't see anyone when I woke up this morning and you didn't wake me up either.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,470
You made me have to take the taxi again!

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,610
Normally, even when you don't drink, you still take the taxi.

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,180
Don't blame it on me.

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,460
And earlier if you hadn't have come in the office within ten minutes, I was going to take the day off for you.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,290
Please, who am I? Han Kefei!

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,530
Even if I drink until the morning, I'll still come to work.

31
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,350
It's not cute to be tired!

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,860
Last night I really drank too much, I'm such a pig.

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,670
Thank you.

34
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,570
After I left yesterday, what good thing happened to you?

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,620
What good thing could possibly happen? Meeting that Chu Kehuan could only

36
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
bring about a series of misfortune.

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,300
Chu Kehuan? What does anything have to do with him?

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't want to talk about it.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,650
I'm so sorry!

40
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,900
I know you're really infatuated with him.

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,070
So when he left with me, you were being angry-gry?

42
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,210
He left with you?

43
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,990
Yeah! Last night...

44
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,200
<i> I vow that tonight, I will eat you up! </i>

45
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,980
<i>Do you want to come up and have a coffee, or do you want to exercise to sober up?</i>

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,660
If he left with you, then who handcuffed me in the room?

47
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,060
Handcuffs?

48
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,760
<i> Hey, Chu Kehuan! Get me out of here, or I'll call the police! </i>

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,910
<i> I'll put the key here. </i>

50
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,390
Handcuffs?

51
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,090
Please put your lustful expression away.

52
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,860
Nothing happened between us.

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,080
After he handcuffed me, he left!

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,240
But after half an hour, he came and unlocked my handcuffs and let me go home.

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,850
He handcuffed you and he didn't do anything to you?

56
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,730
If he dared do anything to me, then that would be sexual assault!

57
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,220
That's right. Because he was dealing with you, he didn't dare do anything to you.

58
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,400
What does that mean?

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,120
What! You didn't wear a full set of underclothing!

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,810
Hey, there's something wrong with your tendency to criticize the victim.

61
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,200
What you said is reasonable. You're the victim since Chu Kehuan didn't eat you up.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,980
At some sort of level, we are considered very similar.

63
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,590
Who is similar to you?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,020
But I don't really understand. You clearly left earlier than me, then when did he leave with you?

65
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,130
Could it be that after he let me go,

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,200
he went to drink with you and sent you home?

67
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,150
That still sounds like the timing is off.

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,980
Aiyo, this isn't important.

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,260
What's important is that this person is very frightening.

70
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,730
If you can stay farther away, then stay farther away. This guy is just a pervert.

71
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,570
It needs to be perverted in order to be exciting.

72
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,170
I vow to eat him up!

73
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,950
This is my new life goal. I'm going to take another one.

74
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,410
It's time to work!

75
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,180
Boss, Brother Kehuan is going to the venture capital two weeks from now.

76
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,030
That means that in the future, you won't have a rival. Will you be lonely?

77
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,800
If you don't say anything, no one will think you're a mute.

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,000
Boss isn't paying any attention to me. It's all because of him.

79
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,460
Boss, Sister Ziyuan called me again.

80
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,300
This is already her third call. If I continue to ignore her calls, I won't be able to explain it to her.

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,430
If she's calling during intraday trading hours, she's not trying to talk to me.

82
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,930
I understand. Of course, she will ask what you are up to.

83
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,890
Did you do anything terrible recently?

84
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,480
Say whatever you want to her. I have no issues.

85
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,540
However, if you stop paying attention to your trades, I guarantee that your face will turn as green as your losses.

86
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,160
Boss, she texted me!

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,050
If you dare come here, I'll break your legs.

88
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,990
Don't you know that it's trading time?

89
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,930
- I understand, but- <br> - I don't want to know what message Ziyuan sent you, thank you.

90
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,890
It's not Sister Ziyuan. It's her!

91
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,410
<i>I want to learn about financial investments.</i>

92
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,230
<i>Master, when will you open up a class?</i>

93
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,970
It's good. Try it.

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,170
It is very fattening!

95
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,560
It's not! There's little sugar in it!

96
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,970
Boba is very fattening.

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,230
What do you think?

98
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,500
"The Hunk"? Chu Kehuan?

99
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,540
I really don't understand. You clearly have so many partners and you can change them daily,

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,480
Why do you have to get a rise out of Chu Kehuan?

101
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,980
My dear, Weiwei, try to remember.

102
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,400
If there's a catch, then eat him. If there's fresh meat, then bite him.

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,670
My principle is not to let anyone go to waste.

104
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,390
Okay.

105
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,800
Look, look.

106
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,620
<i>(I don't take in just anyone as my student.)</i>

107
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,060
<i> (But if it's you,)</i>

108
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,670
<i>(I can make an exception and have a one-on-one session.)</i>

109
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,350
One-on-one session.

110
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,130
Ah, sending it like this is too straightforward. That shouldn't be good.

111
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,180
Do you think that she's sending messages to you to ask you about how to invest?

112
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,630
But--

113
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,950
<i> (3W1H) </i>

114
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,280
3W1H?

115
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,130
Where, when, what, how? She's asking you the details for a date.

116
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,250
So she's going on a date with me?

117
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,970
Then I will ask what she wants to eat and pick a restaurant that way.

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,290
Yan Baiyang, are you doing a survey?

119
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,030
Then, do you want to go downstairs and ask all our female coworkers what they like?

120
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,800
Can you be more of a man? Take out your confidence and decisiveness.

121
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,030
When you like a girl, don't treat her like a goddess.

122
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,380
Goddesses are for worshipping, not for pursuing.

123
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh.

124
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,520
<i> (I'm here, where are you?)</i>

125
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,190
<i> (I am here, too.) </i>

126
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,720
<i> (I am in your heart.) </i>

127
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,840
How is it you?

128
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,320
It's always been me.

129
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,410
<i> I vow that tonight, I will definitely eat you up! </i>

130
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,440
Let's leave it here today. Such a wonderful thing,

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,800
I want to wait for both of us to be sober to start it.

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,220
So hard.

133
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,180
Places that should be hard are all hard.

134
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,080
<i> Hold on. </i>

135
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,140
What are you waiting for? I'm not going to ask you to take responsibility.

136
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,050
I am willing to take responsibility.

137
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,970
Let's date.

138
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,900
Are you crazy?!

139
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,060
I only date online, not in real life!<br><i>(T/N: Playing on words with wǎngjiāo (online dating) vs. jiāowǎng (being in a relationship).)</i>

140
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,880
So you confessed to her?

141
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,230
Yeah. Isn't it the responsible thing to confess your love before sleeping with someone?

142
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,340
I just wanted to show her a man's sense of responsibility.

143
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,600
Yan Baiyang, haven't I told you before? Making a promise is like a stock trade. Timing is very important!

144
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,560
Saying that at that time isn't romantic. It's dampening the mood!

145
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,450
Okay, I understand that I said the wrong thing.

146
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,140
Master, do I still have the chance to meet up with Golden Cross?

147
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,860
Golden Cross? You have already scared her off!

148
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,620
Send me Kefei's phone number.

149
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,460
What do you want Kefei's phone number for?

150
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,570
If you don't want to give it to me, that's fine, too.

151
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
All right.

152
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,540
- One cup of hot latte. <br> - Okay.

153
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,120
Where's my stamp card?

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,580
Twenty cups of hot lattes. Nineteen cups to go, and one for this lady.

155
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,130
And this, count this on me, too.

156
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,090
Are you a stalker? How did you know I was here?

157
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,220
Because your coworker told me you always come here for lattes.

158
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
Who is that into gossiping?

159
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,850
Take this. Keep the change.

160
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,290
- Here's your coffee. <br> - Thank you.

161
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,110
Your coffee.

162
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,300
Am I close to you?

163
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,990
You want to calculate it that clearly?

164
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,190
Okay. Then that night's private room in the restaurant and the hotel room, let's settle it all now.

165
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,080
Okay! Then let's calculate it now. How much is it?

166
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,590
134.5.

167
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,870
NT$1.3 million?!

168
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,420
This is your company's closing price today. You work yourself to the bone for your company, but you don't pay attention to your share prices.

169
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,420
Once you retire and find out that your allotted shares have gone to waste, that would be a real tragedy.

170
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,190
How are these two things related? What's your problem?

171
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,290
You fuss over every penny when it comes to what you eat every day, yet you don't pay attention to your assets.

172
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,760
You're putting the cart before the horse, so I recommend that you closely reexamine your life.

173
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,330
For example, your retirement plan with your boyfriend simply does not suit you.

174
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,970
Not only are there problems, but there's also not even anything that prevents risk.

175
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,240
What do you have against my boyfriend?

176
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,160
I don't know your boyfriend. I have nothing against him.

177
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,190
I just have an interest in you.

178
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,540
You have a problem! I don't know what's wrong with your girlfriend.

179
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,240
You should go fix the problems between the two of you instead of bothering me!

180
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,360
- Hey, your coffee! <br> - I don't want it.

181
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,230
When are you going to return my jacket that I used to cover up your humiliation?

182
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,150
I'll send a package to your office. Is that okay?

It's so late. You're still working overtime?

188
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:15,020
Isn't it because of your team's Dawei? He left after correcting his own materials. I need to stay here and organize them.

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,130
Next time, I'll find the opportunity to give him a lesson!

190
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,280
Stop with that. You're just saying that. He's your college senior. You won't actually do anything to him.

191
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,100
Okay, then I'll wait for you to finish work and take you home.

192
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,230
That sounds about right.

193
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,920
Manager, I'm here looking for my phone.

194
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,230
I found it! Thank goodness.

195
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,810
Then, I must trouble you with that matter. Brother Dawei wants to see it on Monday.

196
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,260
Okay.

197
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,350
Manager, are you working overtime together?

198
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,530
He's in a different department than me. How can we be working overtime together?

199
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,870
He's briefing me in place of Brother Dawei.

200
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,590
Okay, then I'll leave first!

What? Do you want to meet up?

207
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,580
Do you have a problem?

Brother Shuming, have you had any yet?

not having a girlfriend is too surprising.

308
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,130
Thank you.

309
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,280
The salary is fixed for the first three years at the venture capital, right?

310
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,910
Actually, I was thinking you can negotiate for a bonus!

311
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,840
You even know about my contract terms?

312
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,200
That's how I'll be able to help you.

313
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,940
- Hey, do you want me to-- <br> - No need.

314
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,650
Really no need.

315
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,190
You've already done enough. At the venture capital fund,

316
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,590
I just want to rest for a bit. I don't care about anything else.

317
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,880
Oh, right. My little sister said she's coming back from America next week.

318
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,080
She quit her job.

319
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,150
Hasn't Ziting been doing well in her career in America? Why is she suddenly coming back?

320
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,960
I don't know either. Let's ask when she gets back.

321
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,670
Thank you.

322
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,010
Kehuan, don't you think this meat is a bit cold?

323
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,170
I was thinking of having this restaurant take care of food for our outdoor wedding,

324
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,100
but it looks like its better to find a different restaurant.

325
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,190
Outdoor wedding? For who?

326
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,120
Of course, it's ours!

327
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,000
Today, even Wu Shuming asked when we were getting married.

328
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,740
I wanted to say that now that your working hours are more stable,

329
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,940
and you've just become the CEO, isn't this the best timing?

330
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,420
Actually, not only have I looked into the restaurant,

331
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,730
I even did my homework on the wedding dress and ring!

332
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,410
Why do I feel like I've been deceived?

333
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,690
Are you angry?

334
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,770
No, it's just that I'm not ready yet.

335
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,590
After all, I haven't proposed yet.

336
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,750
So,

337
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,430
I'm already prepared for you to give me a surprise.

338
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,570
Sir, Miss, let me tell you. In this alley,

339
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:44,160
the homes are in the second row from the main road. Therefore, in this lane, this first row is much quieter.

340
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,440
This house feels quite nice.

341
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,250
Yes, that's right! Out of all the houses we've seen so far, this one suits you the most!

342
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,060
The house is twenty-five years old?

343
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,530
That's right, twenty-five years!

344
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,200
Then, how much is the area?

345
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,990
31.73 pings (104.89 square meters).

346
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,170
Then the price?

347
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:22,330
The base price is NT$18 million. It's really cheap.

348
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,800
Weiwei, if we look at the principle of wind, fire, water, electricity, and light,

349
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:34,040
there's ventilation, daylight, circuits, water pressure, and a gas line. I don't think there's an issue.

350
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,220
And think about it, there are two bathrooms.

351
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,740
When we get ready for work in the morning we won't need to fight over the bathroom. Same for when we want to shower at night!

352
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,360
It's just, about the housing price, is there any space for negotiation?

353
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,600
Mr. Li, just to let you know, the conditions of this house is really good. It's very highly contested.

354
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Right now, other buyers are looking into the house, too.

355
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,780
I recommend that if you guys really like the house, you should put down a negotiation fee, and I'll discuss with the homeowner.

356
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,200
Put down a negotiation fee?

357
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
What do you think?

358
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,460
I think...

359
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,310
I think that when I came up here earlier, I was dizzy.

360
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,260
This house is slanted, right?

361
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,410
Ah, it seems like it is just a little bit.

362
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,580
We've already been looking into houses for a few months,

363
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,190
why won't this NT$18 million house work?

364
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:56,690
Weiwei, this is really the best house that we've seen so far.

365
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,200
The flooring is slanted.

366
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,920
That isn't a huge problem.

367
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,770
Think about it. It's hard to find a house in the city and the price is within our budget;

368
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,370
the quality is also within your expectations.

369
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,740
We have to spend our life savings on this house.

370
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,410
We can't even put an egg on the table. How is that not a big problem?

371
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,890
We can put the egg in a plate!

372
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,130
That's not the point. The house is slanted!

373
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,440
Okay, then let's give it up.

374
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,370
But think about it, within our budget, it's impossible to buy a house we want.

375
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,080
Unless we raise our budget

376
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,000
and give up on our current plan.

377
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,200
Give up our current plan. Is your point that

378
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,690
we need to move back our retirement to seventy-five years old?

379
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,920
Well, we don't actually need to postpone our retirement.

380
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,780
I was thinking that as long as we reduce our monthly spending by just--

381
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,960
Spend even less?

382
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,170
I only spend $150 NTD for three meals in a day.

383
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,630
<i> $150 NTD for three meals? </i>

384
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,490
<i> You can do that? </i>

385
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,810
Someone even questioned if I can actually do that and I loudly responded back, I can.

386
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,630
But right now, I'm telling you!

387
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,040
If we continue this any longer, I really won't be able to do this anymore.

388
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,820
Who is that someone else?

389
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,130
Kefei!

390
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,410
Isn't she caring too much?

391
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,590
She's doing this for my own good.

392
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,400
And let me ask you.

393
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,630
We cut back on our spending so much just to buy a house,

394
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,100
but what if I died right now?

395
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,420
<i> But your life will always have accidents, right? What if you don't live until you are sixty-five?</i>

396
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,680
Why would you think like that?

397
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,000
Life always has accidents. If I died right now,

398
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,430
I saved so much money for what reason?

399
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,460
This type of situation won't happen, so you don't need to think that much okay?

400
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,050
I am asking you what-if?

401
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,200
<i>Then your plan would change! </i>

402
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,260
Okay, Weiwei, hold up.

403
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,810
What is wrong with you today. You are so angry. That came?

404
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,420
This and that coming is not related!

405
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,260
I am asking you about our retirement plan.

406
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,870
Our retirement plan is very perfect. Didn't we discuss it before?

407
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,810
Have you discussed it with me before?

408
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,570
Is this your plan or our plan?

409
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,730
<i> Is it your life or your boyfriend's life? </i>

410
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,590
I just asked you if I died first, what would happen?

411
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,360
You can't even answer that question.

412
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,750
Then you can set a Plan B.

413
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,310
If I'm about to die, what Plan B is there?

414
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,910
Even if there is a Plan B,

415
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,560
then it would be your Plan B, not my Plan B.

416
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,510
Okay, don't be angry right now.

417
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,690
How about this? Let's go look at the last house on Sunday.

418
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,760
If it really isn't okay,

419
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,430
then we'll look into renting a house next month, okay?

420
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,190
I already have plans with my friend, I'll leave first.

421
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,950
Weiwei, are you splitting the bill

422
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,970
and will you be having an expensive meal?

423
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,540
Okay then.

424
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,620
<i>♫ Love runs too deep, I miss you more than before ♫</i>

425
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,540
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

426
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,110
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

427
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,700
You're treating me today to such a fancy meal in

428
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,780
a place that is filled with alcohol,

429
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,590
and you have an expression of wanting to get met drunk.

430
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,160
But it's still quite romantic.

431
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,350
Treating you today is completely to fulfill your request.

432
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,770
The restaurant was picked out by you, you picked the wine,

433
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,490
and you drank a huge bottle, and I've only had one glass.

434
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,420
How can it be said that I want to get you drunk?

435
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,330
Don't kid with me. With one bottle of Lafite, I'll tell you about her lifestyle;

436
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,940
and with one feast, I'll let you know where Weiwei usually goes to eat.

437
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,210
If it's not Weiwei who is too important,

438
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,720
then it's that you have other thoughts.

439
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,740
Let me first say that I have a bottom line, too.

440
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,070
Some things I refuse to share with my sisters.

441
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,330
Especially...

442
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,080
My apologies. I've really let you misunderstand.

443
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,180
I have no interest in you at all.

444
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,480
You better explain yourself.

445
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,810
Treating you to dinner is just to thank you.

446
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,590
To Zhou Weiwei, I like to bother her and prank her

447
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,260
because I like to see her reactions. Because I don't have someone as entertaining as her around me.

448
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,240
So you've been bothering her and not letting her go only because she's interesting?

449
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,160
Actually, I'm quite interesting, too.

450
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,600
Yeah, I admit that you're really interesting, too.

451
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,840
But you know when a guy gets close to two girls, the other is for cover?

452
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,810
So, Weiwei is just for cover?

453
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,000
Weiwei!

454
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,720
Jia'en, you're here!

455
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,700
Look who I brought?

456
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,210
Gao Ziyuan?

457
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,470
Zhou Weiwei!

458
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,980
Long time no see!

459
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,760
Long time no see!

460
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,410
Long time no see. Here, take a seat!

461
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,980
Why are you here?

462
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,100
This afternoon I was with Jia'en trying on wedding dresses. Then, I found out you two secretly planned to meet up.

463
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,490
So I decided to come out and scare you!

464
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,790
Why are you saying that? I didn't know the two of you were still in touch. It's really been a long time since we've met.

465
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,590
Wow, it's really been a long time! When was the last time we met?

466
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,380
Was it our junior year in college?

467
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,430
What class was that?

468
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,500
Industrial Economics and Multiculturalism.

469
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,020
Zhou Weiwei, how are you still the same? Your memory is still so good.

470
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,200
No, not at all! Let's order!

471
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,550
Look, these pictures are so pretty!

472
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,260
One, two, three!

473
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,960
Goddess, come here for a photo. Goddess.

474
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,440
One, two, three.

475
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,520
Jia'en, I can't make it to your wedding.

476
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,320
This is a token of my regard. Congratulations.

477
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,210
Why can't you make it?

478
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:45,620
That day, my company happens to have an event and I need to be there. So sorry!

479
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,500
I heard from Jia'en that you're at Hualai right now?

480
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,590
That's really good! It's a publicly listed company.

481
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,260
It's okay. What about you? Have you studied abroad after graduating?

482
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,530
No.

483
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,250
Looks like you both really are not close. Take out your phones and add each other on Facebook.

484
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,910
Okay, okay! Hurry.

485
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,690
Look for me. Gao Ziyuan.

486
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,010
Eh? How do I look you up?

487
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,680
- Zhou Weiwei. <br> - Zhou Weiwei! Okay.

488
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,590
It's there!

489
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,870
Eh?

490
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,960
You're Jia'en's bridesmaid?

491
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,650
Yeah! Did you know?

492
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,520
After Jia'en gets married, she's going to live a great life.

493
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,740
Her husband told her she doesn't need to work.

494
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,310
She was told to stay at home, wash her hands, and cook broth. I'm so envious!

495
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,370
What is there to be jealous of? You don't need to marry and can still live a good life.

496
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,410
Weiwei, why don't you ask her where she's working?

497
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,520
Ziyuan, where are you working now?

498
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,130
I don't need to work.

499
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,210
You see. She doesn't need to work and she can live a life comparable to a lady. And she can pay with her boyfriend's credit card.

500
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,230
This is the real life winner's group.

501
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,300
How long have you and your boyfriend been together?

502
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,060
They've already been together for a long time. Ten years!

503
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,450
- Ten years! <br> - Ten years... Ten years!

504
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,560
From the time we've met each other. Ten years is so long!

505
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,970
Jia'en! Haven't you said enough? The spotlight isn't on me today!

506
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,590
Weiwei, talk about yourself. Do you have a boyfriend?

507
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,500
I... I... right now...

508
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,240
Excuse me, here's the bill.

509
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,950
Okay, thank you.

510
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,710
Let me take a look.

511
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,420
Why are we still looking to split the bill?

512
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,910
- My boyfriend will come over later and pay the bill. <br> - That shouldn't be good.

513
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,180
That won't be bad. Her boyfriend moves his fingers and makes six figures!

514
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,320
Let me tell you. You really don't need to be polite with her.

515
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,030
Aren't you being too over the top! Anyway, neither of you can try to pay the bill today.

516
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,450
Just take it as our meet up from a long time! I'll pay!

517
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,520
Thank you!

518
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,950
Let me see.

519
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,740
Hello! You arrived?

520
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,090
Okay, let me go outside and find you.

521
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,980
Ziyuan, that's not good. We've only met in a long time. Us letting you pay is really impolite.

522
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,050
No, it won't be. Why are you so polite?

523
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,370
Sorry to bother you.

524
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,270
It's you?

525
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,760
You two have met?

526
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,220
<i> I sincerely beg you, please don't appear in front of me ever again!</i>

527
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,770
<i> If I could press a delete button, I would press it without hesitation.</i>

528
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,690
We don't know each other.

529
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,850
Who says we don't know each other.

530
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,210
I am Chu Kehuan.

531
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,730
She is Zhou Weiwei, my college friend.

532
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,720
Now, don't we know each other now?

533
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,090
Hello, nice to meet you.

534
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,630
Hello.

535
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,040
Let me get the bill.

536
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,770
Ziyuan, where does your friend live? Should we take her home?

537
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,070
Do you want us to take you home?

538
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,170
No, it's okay!

539
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,150
- You sure? <br> - Yeah!

540
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,460
It's really been too long since we met!

541
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,670
So, we really don't need to send you home?

542
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,910
No, I have a car!

543
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,400
Okay, I'll leave first.

544
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,380
It's a shame I can't be there. I wish you happiness.

545
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,850
Okay, let's hang out at a different time.

546
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,270
- I'm going. <br> - Bye, I'll see you then.

547
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,910
Take care.

548
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,340
Bye!

549
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,350
Weiwei, you sure we don't need to send you home?

550
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,010
No, my boyfriend will come and pick me up later!

551
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,950
Aw, I knew it! Let's walk and talk!

552
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,800
Bye!

553
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,340
Bye!

554
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,070
Bye!

555
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,320
Weiwei!

556
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,700
You came!

557
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,230
Is that car your friend's?

558
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,220
My friend's boyfriend's car.

559
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,020
Her boyfriend... That car is expensive! What does he do?

560
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,770
Her boyfriend? How would I know? Why are you asking so much?

561
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,500
If you know what they do then you can find out how they make so much money to buy such a nice car.

562
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,540
You boys are so strange. When you see a good car, you are all like that.

563
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,720
All boys are the same! Let's go!

564
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:02,730
<i>♫ Love runs too deep, I miss you more than before ♫</i>

565
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,420
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

566
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,780
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

567
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,630
Kehuan, earlier when I was on Facebook, I noticed

568
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,860
Jia'en still picked that fishtail dress at the end of the day.

569
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,110
But I think that her puffy dress was nicer. What a shame.

570
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,820
I have no interest in other people's brides.

571
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:39,040
Oh, that's right. How come I never heard you talk about that other friend of yours.

572
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,620
Oh, you mean Weiwei?

573
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,340
Actually, we aren't that close.

574
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,920
After we graduated, we stopped keeping in touch. Did you know?

575
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,400
I remember that back in school, she didn't like to dress up.

576
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,140
Now she is a bit better,

577
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,980
but what she was wearing earlier, I was thinking-

578
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,270
One person's value isn't based on how much money they spend,

579
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,460
- but it's based on- <br> - It's based on how much money is made.

580
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,070
You said this many times before,

581
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,290
but this world has a lot of girls like Weiwei and me.

582
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,150
Even if we work hard for our whole lives, we won't make as much as you.

583
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,710
I know that about marriage,

584
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,950
I didn't get your approval and you probably aren't mentally prepared.

585
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,250
So I decided to take the initiative.

586
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,690
If we had a change of environment, you'd know what to do then.

587
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,570
Change of environment? What does that mean?

588
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,170
I contacted a realtor today. I want to sell the house and buy a bigger one.

589
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,310
You want to sell my house?

590
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,630
You're going to be the CEO. You're only going to have more social events.

591
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,780
I was thinking that changing to a bigger house,

592
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,650
so that when guests come, people would think it was bigger and it would also make you look better.

593
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,780
I'm doing it for your own good.

594
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,500
I'm really doing it for your own good.

595
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,090
I am going to work.

596
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,000
Then I'll leave you to it.

597
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:10,090
He turned out to be Ziyuan's boyfriend?

598
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,140
Yan Baiyang? You still have the guts to send me a text?

599
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,400
This spoilsport.

600
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,950
Huh, he must be a virgin.

601
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,710
Who's a virgin?

602
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,540
It's not important, but it's not Chu Kehuan.

603
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,450
Why are you talking about Chu Kehuan again?

604
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,030
Didn't I tell you, forget it. Take a look yourself.

605
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:50,250
Look at his eyes. They're so dreamy.

606
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,600
I told you to look here. Where are you looking! The main point is this girl.

607
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,710
This is his girlfriend and she's my college friend.

608
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,440
They've been dating for ten years already. Don't do anything to him.

609
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,460
Is this girl your good friend?

610
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,560
We aren't that close, but they are already getting married!

611
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,070
Then, that's okay! I want to let Chu Kehuan before his marriage

612
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,440
to have the best memory.

613
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,910
Han Kefei! I'm seriously trying to tell you,

614
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,000
you can't do anything to him.

615
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,380
If you do anything to him, then from now on, let's not be friends.

616
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,430
You're the worst, using my own words to threaten me.

617
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,990
What? How does it feel?

618
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,450
Tell me. Have you also fallen for Chu Kehuan?

619
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,410
Who has fallen for him? You're crazy.

620
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,080
<i> (Li Haoyi and Zhou Weiwei's 65-year-old retirement plan)</i>

621
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,450
<i> Our retirement plan is perfect! Didn't we discuss this together already? </i>

622
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,000
<i> Is this your plan or our plan? </i>

623
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,800
<i> Is this your life or your boyfriend's life? </i>

624
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,940
<i> It's our life. </i>

625
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,340
Welcome. Please come in. Miss Gao is stuck in traffic.

626
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,710
She let me open the door for you guys so you can take a look first. She'll be here shortly.

627
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,150
Can I take some pictures?

628
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,590
Yes, feel free.

629
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,080
Thank you.

630
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,740
Haoyi.

631
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,120
How is it? This is more like it, right?

632
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,410
It looks exactly like the pictures!

633
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,040
That's not it. Why would you look for houses in such an upscale neighborhood?

634
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,290
We shouldn't be able to afford this place. It looks quite expensive.

635
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:09,280
I think we should leave before the owners come back; otherwise, it'd be awkward.

636
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,440
Don't worry. The owner already said the price is negotiable

637
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,890
and it's not every day we get to see such an upscale house.

638
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,450
Don't be anxious. Let's take a look at the rooms.

639
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,290
Their house is quite nice.

640
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,960
Yeah.

641
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,610
How can it be such a coincidence?

642
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,320
Weiwei, the rooms in there are so big.

643
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,150
- Wow! What do they do for a living? They have three monitors.<br>- Hey.

644
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,910
Huh?

645
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,250
I want to go home.

646
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,420
What? We just got here.

647
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,820
<i>I'm sorry, we just got home.</i>

648
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,380
<i>Are they looking at the house?</i>

649
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,440
<i>Are there any issues? They like it, right?</i>

650
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,570
<i>No problem, you may go back to work. I'll handle the rest.</i>

651
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,960
I'm sorry for making you guys wait.

652
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,880
How is it you?

653
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,850
Weiwei, what a coincidence!

654
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:43,990
So, the person who wants to buy the house is your boyfriend?

655
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,160
You guys know each other?

656
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,610
She's my classmate from university, Gao Ziyuan.

657
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,110
Nice to meet you.

658
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,250
May I ask what's going on right now?

659
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,810
Didn't we talk about selling the house?

660
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,450
Ms. Chen, thank you for your help today. You may go back now.

661
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,710
Weiwei, you guys can have a seat.

662
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,640
Have some water.

663
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,710
Thank you.

664
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,900
Kehuan, have a seat.

665
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,880
I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Chu Kehuan.

666
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,820
Li Haoyi and Zhou Weiwei.

667
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,810
Mr. Chu, you were the one who picked up Ziyuan in that luxury car the other day, right?

668
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,720
There are only a few of those in Taiwan.

669
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,770
I see you really like cars, too. So, right now you drive a...?

670
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:46,340
I ride a motorcycle. Right now, we're saving up for a house, so we don't have a budget for a car.

671
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,280
Mr. Chu, may I ask what you do for a living

672
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,980
to have to use three computer monitors?

673
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,690
Those three monitors?

674
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,950
Kehuan is an ace trader in the stock industry.

675
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,150
Oh, no wonder you have the ability to maintain this house so well.

676
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,700
I really couldn't tell that it was a twenty-year-old secondhand home.

677
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,560
We renovated recently.

678
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,610
Is that so?

679
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,870
Renovated recently?

680
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,050
Then, the price probably isn't low, is it?

681
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:25,050
Haoyi, I think that this might be too much of a burden on us, isn't it?

682
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,140
The price is negotiable.

683
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,130
Also, aren't you guys university classmates?

684
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,890
Serendipity is something to pay attention to in business transactions, isn't it?

685
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,420
That's right, Weiwei. We really have a shared destiny.

686
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,250
I couldn't have foreseen that you two would come and look at our house.

687
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:48,340
Mr. Li, so you two are buying a house in preparation for marriage?

688
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:53,920
That's right. Even though Weiwei thinks that there isn't a need, I'm a bit more traditional.

689
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,290
I feel like we should buy a house before starting a family. It's more stable that way.

690
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,560
Then, how long have you been dating?

691
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,870
How long we've been dating has nothing to do with buying a house, right?

692
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,870
We've been together for three years.

693
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,310
You're getting married after dating for three years? Isn't that too fast?

694
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,160
I don't think so. Weiwei and I began our relationship knowing that we would get married eventually.

695
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,520
Oh, right. When you guys were coming up, did you see the community's public facilities?

696
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,590
- No, not yet.<br>- Not yet.

697
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,330
I'm the deputy chair in this community. I can take you guys to see everything.

698
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,450
- Okay.<br>- Okay.

699
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,410
May I ask? Have you finished looking at the house?

700
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,530
Does either of you want to stay back and take a closer look?

701
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,760
I looked at everything already.

702
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,710
If it's not too much of a hassle, Ziyuan, can you take me to look at the public facilities downstairs?

703
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,060
Mr. Chu, you can show Weiwei around the house. Is that okay?

704
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,420
Okay.

705
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,490
Sure.

706
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,310
Let's go.

707
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:54,900
Kehuan, don't bully my classmate. Okay? Treat her well.

708
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:18,050
Zhou Weiwei, it's just the two of us now.

709
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,190
So what? We already made an agreement the other day.

710
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,980
In the future, we won't have any relationship whatsoever. Have you forgotten?

711
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:30,410
The view from our house is great. Do you want to take a look?

712
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,060
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

713
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,620
Zhou Weiwei, what are you being so fierce for? You took the initiative to look for me today!

714
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,120
Who took the initiative to find you? How was I supposed to know that this was your house?

715
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,480
Also, weren't you overstepping just now? What gives you the right to ask about my relationship with Haoyi?

716
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,790
What I asked was very reasonable. This is the process of getting to know each other between seller and buyer.

717
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,160
You don't need to be so frantic.

718
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,530
How am I being frantic?

719
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:59,230
You're not frantic? Okay, let's go back to the sofa and get to know each other.

720
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,590
You pervert!

721
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:04,350
Pervert? You've never seen what a real pervert is like, have you?

722
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,930
Ah!

723
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,870
Let go of me!

724
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,520
Exactly what are you doing?

725
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,270
Why don't you yell more loudly? Let that lover of yours hear your voice.

726
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,220
What are you doing exactly? If they see us, there will be a misunderstanding!

727
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,770
Is there anything between us that could arise into a misunderstanding?

728
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:58,030
Or is there something between us that is worth discussing?

729
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,690
No, of course not.

730
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,460
That's good then. Please control your emotions.

731
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,980
Why were you so agitated when you saw me earlier? Now, you're being frantic.

732
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,810
Weren't you going to thoroughly delete me from your memory?

733
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,130
Why am I only seeing myself in your eyes?

734
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,470
You didn't delete me completely, did you?

735
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,720
If I didn't see you today, I would've forgotten about you long ago!

736
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,140
I better help you recover your memory then,

737
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,150
because I've discovered that I still have strong feelings for you.

738
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:35,210
Are you nuts? Let me in.

739
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,070
What do you want to do exactly?

740
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,100
Kiss me.

741
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,040
Are you crazy?

742
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,130
A little bit.

743
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,590
Are you nuts?

744
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,930
Do you want to consider becoming friends with me?

745
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,900
I don't want to be friends with you!

746
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,510
We don't have to be friends. Instead, we can be—

747
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,190
I don't want to be lovers with you either!

748
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:40,840
Being lovers isn't too bad either, but I swear,

749
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,500
this word had never even popped into my mind.

750
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,460
Do you want to buy my house?

751
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,790
Who wants to buy your house?

752
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:01,550
I will lower the price.

753
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,920
I'll lower it to a number you wouldn't even be able to fathom.

754
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,750
Even if I died—

755
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,090
We're back.

756
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:20,020
How was it? Do you like the rooms?

757
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,400
Weiwei, what do you think? Do you like the house?

758
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,900
To be honest, I think it's not bad at all.

759
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,370
I won't buy it though.

760
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,130
Weiwei.

761
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,730
We can't take advantage of them just because Ziyuan is my university classmate.

762
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:42,030
Ziyuan, we weren't able to afford the houses in this area to begin with.

763
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:46,100
It's purely an accident that we came to look at this house today.

764
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,690
- But I really like—<br>- I'm sorry. We have plans and will be leaving now.

765
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,900
Hey.

766
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,690
Miss Zhou, if you really like the house, the price is very much negotiable.

767
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,350
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

768
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:04,190
I'm sorry. Let's stay in touch. Thanks.

769
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,630
What's going on?

770
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,320
Please, we're not even pointing a gun at them and forcing them to sell it to us.

771
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,440
Zhou Weiwei, listen to me. Hold on.

772
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,840
If there's an opportunity, let's negotiate. If you don't even want to negotiate, isn't that weird?

773
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,800
Do you really want to buy a house?

774
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,630
Isn't that our plan? Our dream?

775
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:28,400
Okay. If you really have to buy a house, then I'd rather buy that slanted house.

776
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,490
Call the realtor now. Ask the homeowner to level out the floor and lower the price. Then I'll consider it.

777
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,810
- But—<br>- If you don't want to, then forget it. Let's rent a place right away.

778
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:40,050
Decide now whether you want to rent or buy.

779
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,120
Okay, I'll call the realtor.

780
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,150
Are you in a bad mood today?

781
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,530
I want to stay at your place today.

782
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,430
Today is Sunday.

783
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,990
Can our lives not have to follow the plan all the time?

784
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,770
Okay, you can stay at my place tonight,

785
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,820
but we can only eat self-serve meals. Okay?

786
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:31,710
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

789
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,710
I thought it over.

790
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,310
If we sell the house, then we can start over.

791
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,310
I'm willing to take a loss on the house.

792
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,670
Ziyuan, there's something I want to talk to you about.

793
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,360
Can you lift your head and look at me for a bit?

794
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,380
- Haven't you realized that these past few years we've been—<br>- I've realized it.

795
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,830
I realize that you've done everything my mom asked you to do before she passed.

796
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,480
She said that you have to take good care of Ziting and me.

797
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,140
Also, she wanted us to move into a bigger house before we got married. Aren't you doing everything?

798
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,150
Kehuan, thank you.

799
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,360
You've taken my mother's words to heart all these years.

800
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,460
Oh, right. I've already made plans with the Chairman and the General Manager's wife.

801
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,880
It's the night after tomorrow. Don't forget.

802
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,990
Believe me.

803
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:09,630
Everything I do is for your sake.

01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,940

812
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,060

813
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,020
Why aren't you sleeping? What are you thinking about?

814
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,700
I'm thinking about the house.

815
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,070
Stop thinking about it. I've already talked to my dad about it.

816
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,320

<i>♫ Why, it's all your fault ♫</i>

823
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,450
You're in a relationship now?

824
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:14,930
- What?<br>- You were at your boyfriend's house this weekend.

825
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,070
You didn't even go to Yilan to visit your mom.

826
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,680
Why are you saying this?

827
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:24,050
It's because whenever you come back from Yilan, you smell like the green onions from Sanxing.

828
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:28,400
However, today you smell like a guy who stays at home.

829
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,700
Are you crazy? I just didn't change my clothes, all right?

830
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,510
I'm warning you. If you're in a relationship and you're not telling me,

831
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,390
I'm going to have a falling out with you. Think about it.

832
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:45,890
I treat you so well. If you have a boyfriend and you're not telling me, you'll break my heart.

833
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,760
Why are you talking about it like you're my boyfriend?

834
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,440
In that case, don't you think your boyfriend is a fine young lad?

835
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,400
You, on the other hand, are always wearing suits, suits,

836
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,600
suits, and suits!

837
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,140
You've been wearing this outfit for two years already, right?

838
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,510
This is still wearable and isn't in bad condition. Why do I need to change it?

839
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:11,040
Also, if I live frugally now, I can live better in the future.

840
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,840
In the future? How far into the future? After you die?

841
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:21,020
Let me tell you. A life you haven't experienced is all in your imagination.

842
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,670
You're very tragic.

843
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:28,060
Your happiness is built on your imagination.

844
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,790
Oh.

845
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,280
What?

846
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:37,030
Don't you think I just said something that makes a lot of sense?

847
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:41,510
A life you haven't experienced is all in your imagination.

848

<i>OnePace was formally established in 2018.</i>

849
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:50,810
<i>(Young CEO Mai Ruoyun, New Technology: OnePace)<br>In this year alone, we actually acquired a lot of design ideas</i>

850
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,940
<i>(Young CEO Mai Ruoyun, New Technology: OnePace)<br>and a lot of new ideas in technology.</i>

851
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,190
<i>(Young CEO Mai Ruoyun, New Technology: OnePace)<br>In this year also, we went through a crowdfunding platform</i>

852
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:00,360
<i>(Young CEO Mai Ruoyun, New Technology: OnePace)<br>and obtained the necessary capital for our first year. We're very honored to have such a good beginning.</i>

Why are you saying this, Sister Maizi?

856
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:21,280
You're such a well-known CEO now. It's my honor to be of your service.

857
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,960
Do you have to say it like that?

858
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,520
If you're going to talk like that, then I'm going to respond to you likewise.

859
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,210
Okay.

860
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,090
Okay, let's stop joking around.

861
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:35,230
Last year, OnePace successfully fundraised enough to support seven projects. Your achievement is very optimistic.

862
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,930
The second round of fundraising is about to begin.

863
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:42,140
This is a list of lead investors whom I think will be most suitable. Please take a look.

864
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,900
They showed the largest proportion of investments during the first round of fundraising.

865
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:52,500
To be honest, I've never been too worried about our funding since I have you to help with our financial planning.

866
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,020
As for our internal organization,

867
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,030
I believe there's room for improvement.

868
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,060
Would you be able to recommend anyone

869
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:05,660
who would work well in technology research and development?

870
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,770
Mr. Chu!

871
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,740
Wow, what a coincidence. Are you having coffee?

- Yes.<br>- Sorry to disturb you.

873
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,960
Don't worry about it. Let me introduce you both. This is Mr. Li Haoyi.

874
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,160
- Nice to meet you.<br>- Mr. Li.

- This is—<br>- I know!

01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,610
You're that superwoman CEO who hit it big recently!

877
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,240
Um, Mai...

878
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,470
I'll give you my business card.

01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,350
Oh, right, Mr. Chu. There's something I need to discuss with you.

884
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:46,800
I'll contact you later. I still have some matters to discuss with Sister Maizi.

885
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,860
Okay, sorry to bother you both. Let's make plans later.
