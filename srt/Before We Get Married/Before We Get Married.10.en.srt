19
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,760
It has been hard on you.

20
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,210
Are you used to living over here yet?

21
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,750
The place isn't that big, but the living amenities are very good. There's a supermarket just downstairs.

22
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,690
The food takeout service is also very convenient.

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,130
Then, what time are you finishing work today?

24
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,970
I'm uncertain about that.

25
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,990
We haven't seen each other for so long.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,700
What do you want to eat tonight? I'll go buy some groceries.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Having dinner together is not possible.

28
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,740
Then how about supper?

29
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,850
Don't you have a project on your hands at the moment?

30
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,470
You took leave from the company at the last minute. Didn't anyone say anything?

31
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,190
Over at the company, Kefei will help me.

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,400
Anyway, our group is not just only me by myself. There are other people who can also share the responsibility.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,690
Besides, I haven't had a vacation for so long,

34
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,780
it should be fine.

35
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,430
Your company's administration is really negligent,

36
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,930
approving this vacation without much consideration.

37
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,120
Weiwei, your job can easily be replaced by someone at any time,

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,860
but mine cannot. If the production line is missing me,

39
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,820
our work's progress will then become slow.

40
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,320
You came without any notice. I had to leave the company suddenly to go to the airport to fetch you.

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Once again from the airport coming back to here and to help you settle down as well.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,150
Going there and back took five hours.

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,360
This isn't like going from Songshan to Taipei.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,160
You being like this, my work's degree of progress has been thrown into confusion by you.

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,690
Originally, it may have been possible for me to get off work on time.

46
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,000
It's impossible now. I have to work overtime.

47
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,530
I am sorry. I just wanted to come and see you.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,410
I also want to see you but we should at least have a plan.

49
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,630
It is not that you cannot come to visit, you can come. But you should tell me beforehand.

50
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,890
I could have planned it out first.

51
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,200
I can still free up some time to bring you to the town god's temple and perhaps to the Shanghai Bund for a walk.

52
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,190
But now you being this way,

53
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,650
you can only watch television in the room like this.

54
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,890
I am fine with that.

55
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,620
I had only thought of coming to visit you and accompany you.

56
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,310
All right. You are already here, what else can we do.

57
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,300
You can take a rest first, I am heading back to the company.

58
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,000
Call me before you get off from work then!

59

61
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,140
<i>Weiwei, I am going to KTV (karaoke) with my colleagues at the last moment. Do you want to come?</i>

62
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,200
Zhou Weiwei, what time is it now precisely?

63
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,090
The fine evening is bitterly short. Why are you not rolling around in the bed with 321? Why are you calling me instead?

64
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,590
Kefei...

65
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,230
<i>What's wrong? Is 321 working late like me?</i>

66
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,230
I shouldn't have come.

67
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,700
Everything was not the same as he had said before.

68
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,540
I really do not know what I should do.

69
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,520
I do not know what I should do.

70
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,600
I feel that

71
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,760
life is so difficult.

72
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,590
<i>The signal on your end is very spotty. Are you okay? Hello?</i>

73
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,360
Hello? Zhou Weiwei?

74
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,110
Weiwei. Weiwei, why are you sleeping here? Come.

75
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,030
Go to sleep on the bed. Let me help you.

76
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,090
Don't touch me.

77
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,800
What's the matter? Come.

78
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,760
What's wrong?

79
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,210
How was it? Did you have a nice time singing yesterday?

80
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,590
I'm sorry. Yesterday, we reached a milestone for our research and development,

81
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,550
so Sister Maizi wanted to celebrate.

82
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,460
Even though all of us were very tired,

83
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,180
we didn't want to hurt her feelings, so--

84
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,960
So you put your arms around a woman as you sang?

85
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,360
You came yesterday?

86
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,130
I kept waiting for you but you didn't show up!

87
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,710
I thought you were concerned that you weren't close with my coworkers

88
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,510
that was why you didn't come as you were afraid that you couldn't let loose.

89
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,010
I feel that you had too much fun

90
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,740
and completely forgot that I called you.

91
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,330
Weiwei, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you at home alone.

92
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,420
What about this? I have the day off today. Let's go back to our room and get some rest.

93
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,120
When we wake up, I'll bring you out to eat shengjian (a pan-fried bun filled with meat and juices, a Shanghai specialty).

94
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,720
There's no need. Yesterday, I was so anxious to find you because--

95
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,940
Take a look yourself.

96
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,800
What is this?

97
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,810
It passed?

98
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,390
That's too great! Finally!

99
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,520
What are you happy about?

100
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,930
You don't need to explain this to me?

101
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,160
Wait. So the reason you're mad at me is because... I had thought--

102
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,830
You increased the loan on our house to NT$30 million.

103
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,190
And I found out in this way!

104
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,160
Do you know what this means?

105
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,590
This is such a great opportunity!

106
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,100
Sister Maizi is letting me buy shares in the company! Buy shares!

107
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,440
With this money, I'm not just the company's officer. I'm the company's shareholder!

108
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,460
Isn't this something to be excited about?

109
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,220
I felt that I had been sold off by you.

110
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,600
Such an important decision. This is our house!

111
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
How can you do this without discussing it with me?

112
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I didn't not find you to discuss this.

113
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,150
Sister Maizi told me this news very suddenly,

114
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,410
and she gave me very little time to decide.

115
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,490
If I didn't invest in the company, she would find someone else.

116
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,020
My salary has also increased now. You do not have to be concerned with the increased loan.

117
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,920
This isn't a money issue.

118
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,290
Didn't we discuss this before?

119
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,350
No matter what changes our plan has in the future,

120
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,810
we need to discuss everything together and make decisions together.

121
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,750
Not just you one-sidely making all the decisions for us!

122
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,990
- Do you even respect me? <br> - I just knew you would be like this!

123
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,070
Can't you just trust me? I can let you stay at home and be an upper-class woman who never lacks food or clothing.

124
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,520
Is that bad?

125
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,740
I don't want it. I don't want to be an idiot who doesn't know anything

126
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,660
and gets my whole life manipulated by you!

127
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,310
Manipulated?

128
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,430
I want to give you a better life, and you're calling it manipulation.

129
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,590
Who's manipulating you?

130
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:46,600
We are all tired. Let's get some rest.

131
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,030
Once we're clear-headed, let's get up and talk. Okay?

132
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,770
Let's go.

133
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,370
There's no need. There's nothing to discuss.

134
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,460
What are you doing now?

135
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm going back to Taipei.

136
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,390
So you're just going to be difficult?

137
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,520
Yes, I'm being difficult.

138
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,650
Now you and Sister Maizi can go public.

139
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,820
Zhou Weiwei, we are talking about the house. Why must you mention her again!

140
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,960
There's nothing between us!

141
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,310
That's right, there's nothing between you guys. There's something wrong with me.

142
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,150
I've lost it completely! Everything is wrong with me, okay?

143
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,630
If Sister Maizi is treating me better,

144
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,530
then I really don't understand what the problem is.

145
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,770
She's my boss! Is it wrong that she treats me well?

146
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,090
So you can put your arms around your boss and sing together?

147
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,190
She was putting her arms around me. Could I reject that?

148
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,580
You were putting your arms around her!

149
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,220
Can't you just consider it as me working hard for our future?

150
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,300
Is it that hard to understand?

151
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,750
Do you even know what you're saying?

152
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,330
Don't you think that's laughable?

153
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,560
You put together a life plan

154
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,750
and think it's perfectly planned,

155
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,530
but you never thought about it from my standpoint

156
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,290
and never considered what I really need!

157
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,000
And here I am, just an idiot blindly following you.

158
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,120
With every change of yours, I can only continue to cooperate,

159
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:38,740
but I'm tired now. I'm really tired.

160
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay. Once I go on vacation and return to Taipei, we can register our marriage. Does that work for you?

161
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,540
There's no need. I don't want it anymore.

162
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,620
I already said that once I go on vacation and return to Taipei, we'll register our marriage. What else do you want from me?

163
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
I don't want you to do anything.

164
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
I just want you to fulfill your promise,

165
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,570
to fulfill what you promised me before.

166
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,370
You said that in your future plan,

167
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,920
in your future life, I would be involved.

168
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,750
You've always been involved!

169
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,410
That's called cooperating.

170
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,420
That's called being involved!

171
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,870
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

172
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,140
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

173
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,800
What's wrong with Zhou Weiwei?

174
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,030
Explain it clearly. Why did you break up with 321?

175
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,220
<i>Didn't I just say it?</i>

176
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,190
Saying it is one thing. Doing it is another.

177
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,100
It's like how I always say I want to sleep with Chu Kehuan, but I never actually did.

178
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,890
I thought that you were just blowing off steam yesterday.

179
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,320
<i>I'm tired. I don't want to go on like this in Haoyi's life plan.</i>

180
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,750
<i>I've already returned the ring to him.</i>

181
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,170
- Are you serious?<br>- <i>Yes.</i>

182
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,590
Okay, I understand.

183
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,360
When will you be back so that I can embrace you?

184
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,560
<i>Right now. I'm already at the airport, preparing to board.</i>

185
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,980
I'll wait for you.

186
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,210
Are you picking her up or am I?

187
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,810
Miss, are you by yourself?

188
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,400
Are you here for a vacation? Do you need a chauffeur or a tour guide?

189
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,740
Do you not understand the Chinese language?

190
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,890
Then, do you speak English?

191
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,700
Where are you from?

192
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,060
Singapore?

193
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,760
Thailand? Sawasdee khrap (hello).

194
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,020
Where do you wish to go?

195
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,400
I do not know.

196
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,970
I will bring you to eat some food then?

197
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,880
How about I decide your schedule today?

198
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,160
Why must I listen to you?

199
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,000
Why must you make decisions for me?

200
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Can't I make my own decisions?

201
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,860
At the most unsuitable time,

202
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,760
you said the most unsuitable thing.

203
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,590
Did you know? Over the past three years,

204
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,360
I have been doing my best to follow his plans.

205
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,040
Every day, I only use NT$150 for food.

206
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,200
Every week, we can only see each other during the weekend.

207
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,180
I cannot buy clothes.

208
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,530
And also, I am unable to dine out together with my friends.

209
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,580
My leisure activity

210
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,390
is to occasionally visit the karaoke telephone booth

211
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,960
and spend NT$50 to listen to one song.

212
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,310
I worked so hard,

213
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,500
yet you went somewhere else to develop your new plan.

214
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,930
And I can only cooperate.

215
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,860
I simply wanted to go to Shanghai to see you.

216
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,650
From the airport to the place of residence, you didn't even smile.

217
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,550
You didn't even hug or kiss me,

218
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,570
yet I caught sight of you

219
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,170
embracing another woman and laughing so happily.

220
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,300
Then, what do I count for?

221
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,480
You actually still said that

222
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,830
this was for our future.

223
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,390
What kind of logic is this?

224
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,260
Don't you think that it is very laughable?

225
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,150
I merely wanted to get married. Am I in the wrong?

226
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,830
Was I being too much?

227
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,630
You are really very selfish.

228
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,720
Very selfish.

229
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,670

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,560

256
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,560
Weiwei!

257
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:25,960
I am here. As long as you need me, I'll always be here.

258
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,990
Right now, I just want to be alone.

259
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,320
<i>Put it down gently.</i>

260
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,120
<i>Scoop it up from the side.</i>

261
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,260
<i>I told you that you have to come to this place. It has never let me down before.</i>

262
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,430
<i>The soup was originally free of charge.</i>

263
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,770
<i>If they are afraid of people taking too much, then they shouldn't have put so much in it. Let's eat.</i>

264
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,910
This way, I understand it now.

265
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,210
It should be possible this afternoon. It's not a problem, Sister Maizi.

266
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,200
Then it's fine. We have finished chatting about work now, let's chat about private matters for a bit.

267
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,150
What private matters?

268
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,760
Did you get in a fight?

269
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,350
Women, you know.

270
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,970
You also know that sometimes women can't help but lose their temper.

271
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,670
I don't know that. I don't lose my temper.

272
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,100
That's also right.

273
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,690
What is your girlfriend's name?

274
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,880
Weiwei. Zhou Weiwei.

275
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,390
Zhou Weiwei. Her name repeats.

276
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,560
She must be quite adorable.

277
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,270
Why did you guys fight? Is it because you came to Shanghai?

278
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,600
That's not quite it. It might be because I've been busy lately.

279
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
I have neglected her.

280
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,020
In that case, you're busy working for your own future, is it not?

281
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,780
It's also for both of your futures.

282
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,690
You must look at what hardships are like in front of you, only then you will know what profit to ask for.

283
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,120
I also think so and I also said that to her. But she is just—

284
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:27,390
- Sister Maizi, listen to me. Actually— <br> - No, you listen to me.

285
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,790
If you want to deal with a girl like this, there are always some methods for the way you speak.

286
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,040
Zhou Weiwei, you're so kind.

287
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,530
You are already moving away and your toilet bowl has been scrubbed so completely. It's sparkling.

288
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,500
What about other things?

289
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,360
No more, just these.

290
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,720
That's it? You guys lived together for so long. You only have these things?

291
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,070
I only had these things originally. Whatever I came with, I'll leave with.

292
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,120
You are too nice of a person.

293
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,770
If it were me, I would take everything with me.

294
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,780
You only have these things. Why am I here?

295
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,960
This cardboard box is for you to carry.

296
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,400
I had already told you not to come, I could do it myself.

297
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,960
It's not that. Originally, I thought you were pretending to be polite with me.

298
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,210
I almost made a call to the moving company to come over here.

299
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,800
What's wrong? You can't part with it?

300
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,030
There's nothing to be reluctant about.

301
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,370
Did you tell him that you were moving out today?

302
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,120
No.

303
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:07,640
I already returned the ring. He didn't call me. Let's just leave it at that.

304
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,270
Then... Then... the money for the house. What are you going to do?

305
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,000
Are you going to calculate it cleanly with him?

306
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's move out first and then discuss it.

307
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,410
Please come in.

308
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,970
Weiwei?

309
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,640
Ziyuan.

310
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,280
Come and take a seat first.

311
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,190
I happened to take the day off today, so I wanted to come and visit you.

312
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,210
I hope that I haven't disturbed you.

313
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,500
Not at all. Thank you for coming and also bringing such beautiful flowers.

314
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,930
Your complexion looks much better.

315
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,650
The doctor also said my recovery condition was quite good.

316
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,540
He said that in two days, I can be discharged.

317
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,470
But don't worry. I didn't forget about your wedding.

318
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,220
I helped you find a Bali resort.

319
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,000
- And it's very romantic, I think that it suits-- <br> - Ziyuan.

320
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,020
I'm sorry.

321
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,260
What's the matter?

322
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,460
My wedding to Haoyi has been canceled.

323
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,750
Canceled?

324
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,940
Thank you for helping us with all of this.

325
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,060
All the fees that we should pay, I will pay.

326
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,930
As for your company, don't worry. I will tell your boss

327
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,300
that you are a great wedding consultant.

328
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,590
Very focused, and great at planning.

329
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,180
Why are you canceling the wedding? Didn't you just purchase the house?

330
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,770
<i>And you finally got to this point through all the difficulties.</i>

331
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,920
♫ <i>Love runs too deep</i> ♫

332
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,970
♫ <i>You need not give in, tears don't lie</i> ♫

333
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,530
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

334
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,340
Are you doing okay?

335
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:02,070
I'm doing okay. Ziyuan is waiting for you. Hurry up and go inside.

336
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,330
Why aren't you answering my calls?

337
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:25,050
<i></i>

338
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,450
Thank you.

339
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,810
Thank you for keeping me company

340
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,230
when I was most dejected.

341
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,670
Thank you for having liked me.

342
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,080
That's it?

343
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,500
That's it.

344
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,840
This is the best for the both of us.

345
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,440
I'm leaving now. Go on in then.

346
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,020
Then are we still friends?

347
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,490
Perhaps.

348
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,550
Stay in touch.

349
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,600
I will let you know how much of a good friend I am.

350
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,830
I am really sorry that I didn't go to see you during your hospitalization as I was very busy.

351
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,370
No worries. It was only a small procedure, and it wasn't that serious.

352
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,500
Look. I'm all better now!

353
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,170
Are you okay?

354
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,170
I'm great. It was only a peritoneoscopy operation. It won't leave any scars.

355
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm not talking about that.

356
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,090
Are you and Kehuan okay?

357
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,290
When you were hospitalized, did he visit you?

358
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:41,180
Yes, of course! He came every day!

359
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,580
Ziyuan, you've been together for ten years.

360
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,830
Trust me. He can't get away.

361
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,760
As long as he's still at Guoxin, he won't be able to leave you.

362
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,320
Come and work at Guoxin.

363
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,130
I think you are suited for this position.

364
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,400
Kehuan will be working under your supervision!

365
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,300
It's Xiaowang's position. You know him, right? He's resigning soon.

366
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,560
Are you talking about the Executive Assistant?

367
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:15,350
- Manager! You look a bit different today! <br> - Is that so?

368
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,950
What are you doing?

369
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,370
Are you okay?

370
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,330
I'm great.

371
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,350
It doesn't look good?

372
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,340
No, you look great!

373
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,950
You look good!

374
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,970
What is up with you today?

375
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:44,070
Zhou Weiwei, you're changing your personality?

376
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,960
You were dumped?

377
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,790
I guessed it, huh?

378
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,930
Zhou Weiwei was dumped by Li Haoyi?

379
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,050
Brother Dawei!

380
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,630
Changing clothes means breaking up? You really have no sense of creativity!

381
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,940
Then, today, dressing like this, I'm now a nun?

382
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,000
Don't worry. I won't be that depressed.

383
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,330
Your breakfast.

384
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,770
I already ate.

385
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,910
Qiqi, give it to me tomorrow.

386
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:27,230
Very good. Keep at it. I really like it.

387
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,490
Manager, where did you buy your lipstick?

388
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,850
It's Kefei's.

389
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, turns out its Kefei's? Then I will ask her later!

390
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,010
Manager, you're really pretty today!

391
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,590
Thank you.

392
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,190
Move aside.

393
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,220
When are you returning it?

394
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,170
Move aside!

395
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Brother Dawei, you already ate breakfast?

396
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,410
Or is the breakfast I got not suited for your taste buds?

397
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,220
Then, what do you like to eat?

398
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,160
Sandwiches, hamburgers, hash browns, hot dog egg wraps, or green onion pancakes with egg?

399
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,110
Or do you like something stronger? Chicken rice, braised pork rice, fried rice noodles,

400
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,060
barbecued pork rice, double (pork and beef) rice, or three treasures (chicken, duck, and BBQ pork) rice?

401
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,110
What I like to eat and drink, didn't you hear from Haoyi already?

402
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,960
Why are you still asking me?

403
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,900
I want to hear from you directly.

404
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,460
Stop it. You couldn't hear from him, is that it?

405
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,480
Zhou Weiwei and Haoyi broke up?

406
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,540
Because they broke up, so you don't feel comfortable asking him. Am I correct?

407
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,660
Are you Detective Conan?

408
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,930
Or do you want to be Sherlock Holmes?

409
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,760
That's not right. You're such a thick-skinned woman.

410
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,690
Why would you hesitate to ask just because they broke up?

411
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,460
Why are you saying that about me? My skin is very thin.

412
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,850
If you don't believe me, then why don't you pinch it. Come on, pinch it!

413
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,080
What are you doing! It's the office!

414
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,010
Pinch it!

415
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:12,200
Am I interrupting you? Sorry!

416
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,220
Hey, hey! Hold on. Don't misunderstand!

417
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,580
We don't have any relationship. No relationship.

418
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,710
Of course, we have no relationship. Hualai bans office relationships. Doesn't everyone know that?

419
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,700
Of course, of course.

420
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,450
I am here to give Brother Dawei his breakfast.

421
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,350
Breakfast.

422
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,470
Oh, breakfast.

423
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,650
Brother Dawei made a pot of coffee. It's very good. Come here, I'll pour some for you!

424
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,060
Coffee, coffee.

425
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,650
Okay. Thank you, Brother Dawei.

426
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,360
Thank you.

427
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,380
Meiling, after drinking Brother Dawei's coffee, when you go outside, don't say any nonsense.

428
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,000
Of course, I won't say any nonsense. My mouth is as sealed as Brother Dawei's!

429
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,420
Brother Dawei, I've put your breakfast here.

430
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,750
If you want to pinch me, tell me anytime.

431
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,160
It doesn't matter where you want to pinch.

432
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,290
It doesn't matter where I want to pinch?

433
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,200
No, I can't become CEO Chu's younger cousin.

434
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,420
But why does she smell so good?

435
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,870
♫ <i>You need not give in, tears don't lie</i> ♫

436
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,300
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

437
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,430
What are we waiting for now?

438
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,300
I don't know either. Jessica has called just now asking us to wait for a while.

439
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,040
I've heard that our company has sent out a higher-up over here. We should be waiting for her, I suppose.

440
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,210
Hello, everyone.

441
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,850
Gao Ziyuan, what are you here for?

442
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,320
I am Guoxin's newly-appointed Executive Assistant to the Chairman. From now on,

443
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,390
I will be supervising the progress of this project on Guoxin's behalf.

444
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,220
Please give me guidance.

445
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,400
- Excuse me.<br> - James.

446
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,740
Since Jessica is not here today, I will be the one in charge. Let us just begin then.

447
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,750
I am the PM; allow me to do the introduction then.

448
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,520
For this project, we are developing a neural network supercomputer.

449
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,730
Neural networks imitate—

450
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,260
Imitate biological life to create a supercomputer.

451
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,030
Simply put, it's artificial intelligence.

452
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:03,260
I know that you all think that I just joined you and that I wasn't in this field in the past.

453
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,380
But all this is basic, and I can still understand. I don't need you to explain so much.

454
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,330
What I need to know is progress. When is the prototype going to be finished?

455
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,970
When will the product go on the market?

456
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,560
- And—<br>- We cannot give you a status update right now.

457
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,350
Of course, we have made progress, but we have not yet received the capital we need.

458
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,790
- So the progress we originally planned to have made-- <br> - Then, when will you have all the capital we need?

459
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,230
I am responsible for obtaining the funding.

460
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,730
I have already settled things with the banks. Besides Hualai and Guoxin,

461
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,100
I am in the middle of discussions with other investors.

462
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,300
Is that right?

463
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,920
From what I've heard, this doesn't seem to be the case.

464
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,470
I heard that you haven't been able to get in touch with Chairman Wang.

465
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,770
You haven't even been able to meet him in person, right?

466
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,990
That's right. But Chairman Wang isn't our only choice.

467
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,600
We're also in contact with Zhongbang's and Renchuang's chairmen.

468
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,560
It must be Chairman Wang.

469
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,580
The board of directors specifically noted that

470
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,480
Chairman Wang possesses an index of significance.

471
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,020
Anything that Chairman Wang has chosen to invest in has a success rate of 95%.

472
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,520
So without Chairman Wang,

473
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,940
the parent company will reevaluate the possibility of this special project.

474
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,690
So your meaning is that without Chairman Wang, this special project has the possibility of being terminated?

475
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,600
It's not my idea. It's the board of directors' idea. I'm only in charge of relaying this message.

476
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,710
Anyway, the Board of Directors already gave its instructions.

477
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:39,240
You must finish this within two months.

478
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,130
Then, that's it for now. I'll leave first.

479
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,160
Is that okay? I'm not okay.

480
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,330
I'm really not okay.

481
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,200
You tell me. What are we going to do in two months?

482
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,030
Even if Chairman Wang agrees to sign our contract right now, immediately, straight away,

483
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,990
doesn't it take time to put the contract together?

484
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,060
Does negotiations not need time?

485
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,660
Then, why doesn't she say everything?

486
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,740
And CEO Chu, what I'm more concerned about is

487
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,400
how did your ex-girlfriend drift into this position?

488
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,790
It's even higher than yours! Executive Assistant to the Chairman!

489
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,990
Wasn't she previously a wedding consultant?

490
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,270
Wow, she suddenly understands everything now.

491
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,660
Actually, Ziyuan studied finance and economics. Banking is one of her specializations.

492
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,640
Later, she studied finance and economics in graduate school.

493
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,450
In her class, she has always been a top student.

494
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,640
So the both of you were graduate school classmates, and that was how you met?

495
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:57,030
Weiwei, I don't know when Ziyuan started working at the parent company.

496
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,040
I also didn't know that the person the higher-ups sent was her.

497
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,630
Hello, I asked you a question.

498
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,780
So, the both of you were graduate school classmates?

499
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:14,720
I have no opinion on Ziyuan supervising this project. Whether or not it's her isn't important.

500
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,660
The point is we only have two months time.

501
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,540
We haven't even met Chairman Wang. Now, what should we do?

502
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,880
I know what we should do.

503
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,090
It looks like I don't have any more time to play thoughtful with Liu Dawei.

504
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,870
How did you get up here?

505
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,390
Don't forget. I'm one of Guoxin's employees now.

506
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,520
And my entry pass is all-encompassing.

507
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,950
Do you have something to say as you're looking for me so late?

508
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,970
How come you haven't left yet?

509
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,420
Is it because the meeting this afternoon gave you too much pressure?

510
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,460
Pressure? There's no pressure.

511
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,230
Even if there is pressure, this pressure isn't from you. The time frame wasn't decided by you.

512
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,730
Are you not here to deliver the Board of Director's instructions?

513
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,370
Kehuan, I know that a two-month deadline is very rushed.

514
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,890
If it really isn't enough, I can help to convince the Chairman

515
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,500
to give you more time. Or I can--

516
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,090
There's no need.

517
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:34,760
Ziyuan, do you like this job?

518
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,930
What do you mean?

519
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,450
I am very happy for you that you decided to come back into the field.

520
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:47,130
I also hope that you sincerely like this job, which is why you came to Guoxin.

521
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,000
But the problem is,

522
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,560
why is it Guoxin?

523
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,440
Because of you.

524
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,680
We have been together for ten years.

525
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,080
My circle of life is Guoxin.

526
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,080
My social circle is also Guoxin.

527
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,480
All of my friends are

528
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,410
either Guoxin's employees or executives.

529
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,070
And I need money.

530
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,740
I need to use the fastest method to make money.

531
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,260
That's why I could only choose Guoxin.

532
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,960
You and Ziting have moved out?

533
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,510
Two bedrooms and two living rooms, it's not bad.

534
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,840
If you have time, do you want to come over and see?

535
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,470
Don't worry. I'm only casually saying this.

536
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,370
You can let it go in one ear and out the other. No worries.

537
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,030
Why are you looking for me so late? What do you want?

538
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,820
I came here to return the key.

539
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,180
There were too many people around during the day, so it was not convenient to give it to you.

540
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,140
Then, I'm going now.

541
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,620
Ziyuan.

542
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,770
I hope at Guoxin, you are able to separate work from private interests.

543
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,160
It's difficult. We have been together for ten years.

544
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:04,900
If I am scrupulous in separating work from private interests, won't it be too heartless?

545
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,430
If I am scrupulous in separating work from private interests,

546
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,440
I would not have come here to ask you if you need any help.

547
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:22,290
All right. Thank you. I really do not need any help.

548
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,010
That's right.

549
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,760
If it is towards Zhou Weiwei,

550
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,970
I can absolutely make a clear distinction between work and personal matters.

551
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,790
You had better live up to your word.

552
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,890
I am getting off from work, you may leave now.

553
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,900
♫ <i>You need not give in, tears don't lie</i> ♫

554
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,460
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

555
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,310
Handsome, where's your group leader?

556
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,570
He has requested a leave of absence.

557
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,180
Requested a leave of absence? Why did he do that?

558
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,160
I also do not know.

559
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,820
Thank you then.

560
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,470
S-S-Such a big door.

561
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,770
The cellphone is ringing. He is at home then.

562
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,880
Are you certain?

563
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,580
I am certain about it. I saw him coming home via the security camera. After that, he has not come out since.

564
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,870
Moreover, he also didn't answer when I called him on the intercom today.

565
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,050
Could something have happened?

566
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,880
Big brother locksmith, can you hurry up and open the door!

567
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,490
Don't be anxious. Let me do it.

568
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,350
What do we do now? Is he going to die?

569
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,970
I was scared to death! It really scared me to death. I thought he was dead just now.

570
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,540
He is still breathing.

571
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,870
Thank you and I am really sorry for the inconvenience that I have caused you.

572
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:16,200
That's all right. Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?

573
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,220
That's okay. It is not necessary for now.

574
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,770
- Are you certain? <br> - If there is a need, I'll tell it to you.

575
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:21,190
- All right, all right.<br> - Thank you.

576
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,060
Such a wealthy heir! Your place is so big. Whom are you trying to scare to death?

577
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,850
Get up! Stop pretending. I called you and you didn't pick up. What's up with that?

578
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:38,130
Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,260
Are you okay?

580
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,370
Oh, dear.

581
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,300
Hey, let me take you to see a doctor.

582
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,110
Get up! Liu Dawei!

583
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,600
Hurry!

584
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,530
What's wrong? Hey! Hey!

585
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,800
It's... He-He's unconscious?

586
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,750
What a pain!

587
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,800
Hello, Zhou Weiwei. There's a big problem and it's not pretty.

588
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,290
Zhou Weiwei!

589
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,910
- Shh! <br> - It doesn't work! The fever-reducing patch doesn't work!

590
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,700
- When did you stick it on? <br> - Just now!

591
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,790
Miss, you just stuck it on. Wait for a bit.

592
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,820
Oh, you have to wait for a bit?

593
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:52,180
His house is really big! Just walking around makes my legs sore.

594
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,190
Really, his house is big!

595
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,840
- What are you doing? <br> - I'm cooking mushroom porridge!

596
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,780
Didn't you say that he didn't go to work for two days? It looks like he

597
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,160
really feels uncomfortable and has just been sleeping. He must not have eaten anything!

598
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,400
Later, wait for him to wake up and his fever to subside, and then give him some mushroom porridge.

599
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,540
Would that really work?

600
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,250
Last time I gave him dinner outside the company

601
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,850
and I pretended to be pitiful, and he didn't even pay attention to me.

602
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,440
Cooking it yourself is different!

603
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,190
I really hope it works.

604
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,420
Then he would want to repay us for saving his life,

605
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,790
and tell us where Chairman Wang is.

606
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,570
That is hard to say.

607
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,950
I think if he found out that I cooked this pot of porridge,

608
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,240
he would believe that I poisoned it and would throw it all away.

609
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,800
Poisoned it? Poisoning it is letting him off easy.

610
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,840
I want to spit my saliva in it.

611
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,540
Stop it. Stop it, you. When you found out that he didn't come into the office,

612
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,600
you rushed to his house and broke down the door.

613
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,730
When you found out he had a fever, you called me immediately.

614
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,710
Spitting out saliva? You obviously care about him.

615
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,810
This isn't being concerned about him.

616
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,760
I am doing this because of our work, okay!

617
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,290
I'm selling my body and pretending to have feelings for him

618
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,330
just to know where Chairman Wang is.

619
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,050
Let me tell you a secret.

620
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,150
What?

621
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,700
I took a peek earlier.

622
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,060
Kefei, you're really perverted!

623
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,590
He really has an eight pack!

624
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,530
He's sick and you're over there sneaking a peek.

625
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,780
Of course, I had to peek. It would be a waste if I didn't.

626
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,900
Hey! Not only does he have an eight pack, he really is...

627
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:46,660
Alishan Holy Tree!

628
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,840
He didn't wake up, right?

629
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,610
This must be his dying moment.

630
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,460
My feelings are complicated. It's a bit contradictory.

631
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,440
Me too.

632
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,370
If something really happened to him,

633
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,800
Chairman Wang would show up at his funeral. Right?

634
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,810
Don't spout nonsense, okay? He just has a cold.

635
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,320
If his fever doesn't reduce later, give him some fever-reducing medicine,

636
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,500
and then give him some porridge and let him sleep more. Then nothing will be wrong.

637
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,620
What about you?

638
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,430
Me? After I finish cooking, I have to leave!

639
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,730
If he wakes up and finds out that I'm here,

640
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,610
all of your hard work would have been for naught!

641
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,340
This pot represents your sincerity!

642
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,670
What sincerity?

643
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,600
I am doing this for work!

644
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,120
Yes, yes, yes.

645
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,540
Sorry, are you okay?

646
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,860
I found a special interview

647
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:35,780
that says he really enjoys fishing.

648
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,810
He goes almost every weekend.

649
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,490
Where does he go fishing?

650
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:46,030
The places he likes to go have a few commonalities. Quiet and secretive.

651
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:49,370
The fewer the people who know about it, the more he likes it.

652
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,810
So you're saying that unless he shows up willingly,

653
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,180
we can never find him?

654
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:00,790
If I'd known this, then yesterday I should have taken the pillow and suffocated Liu Dawei.

655
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,490
What?

656
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,270
Nothing, I'm just saying this casually.

657
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,770
Do you have free time this Saturday?

658
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,570
Of course!

659
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,020
I'm not asking you!

660
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,500
Then who are you asking?

661
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm asking CEO Chu, and... and you!

662
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:25,950
♫ <i>Love runs too deep</i> ♫

663
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,900
♫ <i>You need not give in, tears don't lie</i> ♫

664
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,900
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

665
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,240
Weird. This is none of your business. Why did you follow us?

666
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,580
Weird, why can't I tag along?

667
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,670
I'm also a member of the team!

668
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,190
I can't get with the wealthy business owner's heir, so I'm going after the wealthy business owner. Is that enough?

669
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,600
I'm giving your uncle a chance!

670
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,500
What are you even saying!

671
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,330
Rest assured!

672
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,530
There's no need.

673
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,760
- Uncle! <br> - Stop bothering me!

674
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,360
He's fishing. Hold on a second. He doesn't like noise.

675
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,550
Uncle, my friends are here!

676
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,520
I told you to stop being noisy!

677
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,490
It's over.

678
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,130
Dawei! Come here!

679
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,500
Uncle, I'm coming! I'm coming!

680
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,180
Help me tie the fishhook. It's all your fault!

681
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,650
How many times have I told you?

682
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:43,890
When I'm fishing, I hate it when people are on the side creating a ruckus.

683
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,700
Help me tie the fishhook.

684
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,550
I'm sorry. My brain isn't too good.

685
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,060
I can only deal with one task at a time.

686
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,960
And it turns out that I have a lot of things to work on,

687
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,390
so that's why our meeting has been postponed and postponed.

688
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:04,240
Chairman Wang, no worries. Being able to meet with you today is already our pleasure.

689
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,940
Hello, I'm Chu Kehuan. I am in charge of this special project.

690
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,920
Hi, Chairman Wang, I'm the PM, Zhou Weiwei.

691
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,120
Hello, I'm Han Kefei in Marketing and Public Relations.

692
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,830
Good. Sit, sit.

693
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,740
Chairman Wang, let me give you a simple introduction of this special project.

694
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:29,040
It's a neural network supercomputer, also known as artificial intelligence.

695
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,330
Hold on. Dawei has already briefly explained this to me.

696
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:37,420
I'm not very specialized in this field, but I also know that

697
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,700
this type of technology isn't the newest.

698
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,910
The market already has these products.

699
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:46,430
I am just skeptical that with all this competition,

700
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,880
and your scale is so small and you're entering the market so late,

701
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,050
do you have a way to stand out from the masses?

702
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,460
Chairman Wang, what you've said is completely right.

703
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,700
Although this isn't some new technology and the rest of the world is also working on this technology,

704
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,660
with the difference being the maturity of the product.

705
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,260
However, we have already obtained the key technology and patent that other large manufacturers do not have.

706
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,170
I believe that with an ample amount of investment,

707
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,790
we will definitely be able to catch up.

708
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,790
What type of critical technology?

709
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,600
The key is in the coolant.

710
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,420
Not bad, but as of right now,

711
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,460
I can't see any area where this could be profitable.

712
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,000
You have to know that I won't make any investments that have no assurance.

713
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,790
Chairman Wang, if you don't mind, I will release all the fish for you later.

714
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:59,200
Let them go? What are you saying!

715
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,050
Chairman Wang spent all this time and effort to catch the fish and you want to let them go?

716
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:07,590
This fish can be grilled, simmer-fried, and made into soup! It's really tasty. Don't do that!

717
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,650
Can you tell me why you want to do this?

718
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:20,800
This fish tank has an air filter.

719
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,190
I see that the fish you caught, you've put them in here and not an ice chest.

720
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,460
If I didn't guess wrong,

721
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,800
Chairman Wang, all the fish you've caught, you release back into the wild.

722
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,540
Chairman Wang, I think what you like is the process of catching fish.

723
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,330
The calmness and peacefulness of waiting for the fish to take the bait,

724
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:45,820
and the excitement and elation when you've caught a fish.

725
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,440
You said you're the PM--

726
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,080
Zhou Weiwei.

727
01:05:56,130 --> 01:06:03,160
Mr. Chu, for this whole project, will she be involved in it?

728
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,960
Of course. She will partake in all of it.

729
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:13,840
If she participates in this entire project, then I will invest in it.

730
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,770
How can this be? If you let the fish go, he will invest in us!

731
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:24,120
Chairman Wang, then let me first thank you.

732
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,740
No rush. First put away your hand.

733
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,510
I have a condition for this project.

734
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:35,270
You may not accept it.

735
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:39,380
But if you want me to invest, you must accept it.

736
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,650
Chairman Wang, why don't you go ahead and say it.

737
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:48,690
The Design Department for your project needs to be led by Dawei.

738
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:53,330
No, Uncle! At the company, I only do collective buying, gossip, and drink coffee!

739
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:57,430
- They all know that I'm excess personnel at Hualai.<br>- Shut up!

740
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,700
You useless thing!

741
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,190
Can you accept this?

742
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,070
Chairman Wang, I promise you.

743
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,010
Very good.

744
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,490
- Cheers.<br> - Hey!

745
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,860
- You⁠— <br> - I don't want.

746
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:31,830
You're really annoying. Your uncle already told you to personally be involved. Are you going to go against his plans?

747
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,690
I would like to thank everyone here.

748
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:38,620
If it were just me, it would be very difficult to persuade Chairman Wang to invest, but I had you guys.

749
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,420
From now on, we will all be a team. In the future, please give a lot of support!

750
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,730
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers!

751
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,690
Brother Dawei, drink some!

752
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,400
Stop with the "brother." I'm not in the mood. If you want to drink, you can all drink on your own.

753
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,880
I popped this champagne especially for you!

754
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,360
So what? Should I cry miserably in gratitude to you?

755
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,620
Why did all of you force me into doing something I don't even want to do?

756
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:11,530
Okay, okay. Then don't do anything! Let's all ignore him and drink ourselves!

757
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,980
Cheers, cheers!

758
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,180
If Haoyi were here, how great would this be?

759
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,310
After he resigned, I finally understood how important he was to me.

760
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:23,330
Now you want me to be in charge of developing this supercomputer thing?

761
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,970
I can't even begin to imagine how terrible my life will be in the future.

762
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,560
How about... Move aside.

763
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,350
Can you go bring back Haoyi, please? I'm begging you!

764
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:41,580
Mr. Li Haoyi won't be coming back!

765
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,110
Why not? Did they really break up?

766
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:46,530
Do you really need a beating?

767
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,980
Weren't the two of you doing well?

768
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,070
You've been together for so long. What problem is there that you can't solve?

769
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:56,260
For this team, you must find Haoyi and bring him back.

770
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,970
With Haoyi, I won't be afraid anymore.

771
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,850
I think at this point the only way is for you to trust in yourself.

772
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:14,320
The savior is here! It's meant to be! <br> <i> (Haoyi) </i>

773
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,170
Hurry and pick up!

774
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:27,080
Him calling right now must mean he wants to show his compassion for me.

775
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,320
Ah, no, for the entire team. Later, if he calls,

776
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,560
you must pick up. Please!

777
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,390
It's Haoyi, right?

Why are you hanging up?

780
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:55,320
How about this? If you don't want to pick up, I'll call him.

781
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,800
This is her private life. Can you let her deal with it herself?

782
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,460
Dawei, Chairman Wang gave you the important role of research and developing this project, so stop pushing it on others.

783
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,700
Taking on your own responsibility is what a real man does, okay?

784
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,370
At this time, I would rather be a woman. Who wants to be such a hardworking man.

785
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,640
It's Haoyi, is it?

You-

I don't want to drink champagne. I'm full from anger. I'm going out to buy something.

789
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,560
I'll come with you.

790
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,540
Are you stupid?

791
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,370
She doesn't want to pick up and you keep telling her to pick up the phone. Can you read people's emotions?

792
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:49,860
Then can you read my emotions? I'm even willing to be a woman. Who has it as bad as me?

793
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:54,490
You-- Brother Dawei, you don't look well. You must be really hot.

794
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,000
Why don't you take off your sweater and shirt? It will feel better.
