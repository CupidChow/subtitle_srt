14
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>When I come back to Taipei on vacation, we'll register our marriage. Will that do?</i>

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,650
<i>There's no need. I don't want it anymore.</i>

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,730
<i>I will be here as long as you need me.</i>

17
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,380
<i> It's Haoyi, right? </i>

18
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,800
<i> Pick up the phone. </i>

19
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,740
Why are you so happy?

20
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,530
I'm not. I just suddenly had a mental breakthrough.

21
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,270
The only thing in this world that will never change

22
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,330
is change itself.

23
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,690
I remembered when Haoyi and I

24
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,830
just started dating.

25
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,130
We never had rules on how many dates we could have in a week.

26
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,040
We never planned what age we would retire.

27
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,830
No plans to buy a house.

28
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,970
No worries on how much of a deposit we needed to save for.

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,290
Before, all we needed was one phone call

30
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,090
in order to come out and see each other.

31
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,740
And we didn't have to worry about how much money we could spend on a date.

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,820
I almost forgot.

33
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,970
That we once had such a carefree life.

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,600
You still can't forget him?

35
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,560
How could I forget so quickly?

36
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,160
Have you forgotten about Gao Ziyuan?

37
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,290
How could I forget so quickly?

38
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,530
Now that I think back on it, my best times with her

39
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,970
seem like a fantasy.

40
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,930
Nothing seems real.

41
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,230
To be honest. Breaking up with Ziyuan,

42
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,710
still brings me some regret.

43
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,430
I wonder if I made the wrong choice.

44
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,190
Sometimes I'd ask myself...

45
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,390
If I had tried a bit harder, would things be different now?

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,640
But no matter how many times I question myself, the answer remains the same.

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,940
I didn't do anything wrong. I should have broken up with her.

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,450
If you don't think you're wrong, why would you be regretful?

49
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,910
Humans are creatures of habit.

50
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,140
If you suddenly lose something you once held in your hands, you'd feel the loss.

51
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,510
It's just something you're not used to.

52
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,970
But if you really think about if you really like or need it,

53
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,540
you'll find your heart already has an answer.

54
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,960
So you and Gao Ziyuan...

55
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,730
I had already decided. I just didn't know how to bring it up.

56
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,860
Ziyuan always held on too tight.

57
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,420
She forgot that she could loosen her grip.

58
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,350
But now that she's let loose, she's left with nothing.

59
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,260
But if she didn't let loose,

60
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,790
she would never be able to grasp something better or newer.

61
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,730
Just like you.

62
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,400
Me?

63
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,410
I've already let loose.

64
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,160
I just need some time to get used to it.

65
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,370
You haven't let loose.

66
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,770
I have.

67
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,210
You haven't.

68
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,390
I've let loose!

69
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,920
Just drink it like this?

70
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,530
Do you want some?

71
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,370
Have some.

72
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
So satisfying.

77
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,660
Weiwei! I'm back.

78
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
They're taking so long to buy one thing.

79
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,280
They can't really have decided to get a room.

80
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,290
Get a room?

81
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,970
I am just providing an example.

82
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,840
Even if they really wanted to get a room, they wouldn't choose this time.

83
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,780
So they are really together?

84
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,190
Hello? Is anyone home?

85
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,920
I am just making an example. Do you not understand human language?

86
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,200
But, since last time in Yilan, something felt strange.

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,390
Clearly, the one who has rumors with CEO Chu is you,

88
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,650
but you have never appeared together.

89
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,600
Rather, it has always been CEO Chu and Weiwei.

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,250
You're thinking too much.

91
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,580
CEO Chu has only had me in his heart from the beginning, okay?

92
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,110
Is that right?

93
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,520
Is that wrong?

94
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,120
Well, if you already have CEO Chu, then why do you want me?

95
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,540
Are these two things conflicting?

96
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,190
Don't tell me... could it be that?

97
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,870
Or are you jealous? In one day you were jealous twice.

98
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,970
Could it be that you two are "cousins"?

99
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,570
I don't have a blood relationship with her.

100
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,920
I, Han Kefei, still have some basic morals.

101
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,240
I would never sleep with my sister's man.

102
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,990
I caught you, right?

103
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,250
Your sister's man.

104
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,830
So CEO Chu is your sister's man?

105
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,760
Don't say anything strange later.

106
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,630
The two of you are too--

107
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,790
Li Haoyi.

108
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,980
Is Weiwei here?

109
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Hello? What's wrong?

110
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,670
<i>Weiwei's phone is off.</i>

111
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,210
I have something urgent to speak to her about. Is she next to you?

112
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,760
Kefei is looking for you. She seems to have something urgent to speak to you about.

113
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,430
Hello, what's wrong?

114
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,980
You and Chu Kehuan cannot come home yet.

115
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,430
Whether you want to go to a hot spring, get a room, or watch a movie, anywhere is fine. The further, the better. <i>321 is at our house.</i>

116
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,370
<i> I think you should come back in half an hour. </i>

117
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,810
<i> Forget that, never mind. One hour is safer. </i>

118
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,110
<i> I will get him to leave. Don't worry, okay? </i>

119
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,690
What's wrong?

120
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,590
Kefei suddenly doesn't feel well.

121
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,880
Her period came and she drank, so

122
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,800
you know she's in a lot of pain.

123
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,240
Then, should we go buy painkillers for her?

124
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,920
No need, there is some at home.

125
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,190
You should go home first.

126
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,620
Weiwei.

127
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,200
Don't forget to call a taxi. Don't drink and drive. I'm leaving.

128
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,500
I said, Shanghai is such a competitive place.

129
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,990
For a white rabbit with a personality is so truthful like you,

130
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,570
you must be taken advantage of a lot there.

131
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,590
Not at all. Sister Maizi really takes care of me.

132
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,380
All my coworkers treat me well.

133
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,090
Haoyi, if you have endured any injustices, you can tell me. Brother Dawei supports you.

134
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,430
Hualai also welcomes you back anytime.

135
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,890
As long as you're willing, I'll tell our boss right away.

136
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,490
You can immediately take on the role of vice manager of the R&amp;D team.

137
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,670
Please, vice manager? Does that even count as a leap in promotion?

138
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,760
Then, what about Team Leader? We'll be on equal footing. What do you think?

139
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,110
In Shanghai, he's already in charge of an entire department.

140
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,180
He's a Director. You're just an insignificant Team Leader,

141
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,790
do you think he'll be enticed by that?

142
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,530
Kefei, were you able to connect to Weiwei?

143
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,840
It's not like you don't know Weiwei's personality.

144
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,330
When she's in a bad mood, she'll go missing.

145
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,340
I think you should go home and sleep first. Tomorrow morning, she'll come back.

146
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,110
- But-- <br> - Don't worry.

147
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,530
Once I have news of her, I will contact you right away.

148
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,960
Okay, then you must tell her I came back and I'm looking for her.

149
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,990
That's not right, Haoyi. Then the things we will do together--

150
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,900
Liu Dawei, I'm begging you. Can you have some ambition?

151
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,540
I'll leave first.

152
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,420
Weiwei! Where did you go? I was looking for you!

153
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,230
I came back.

154
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,250
That's strange. Why is it so quiet?

155
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,770
Didn't they say they would discuss things?

156
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,190
Why are there no sounds at all?

157
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,630
Did you hear anything?

158
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,200
Your hand!

159
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,030
Oh, sorry. Sometimes my hands are out of my control.

160
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,050
We already broke up. Why did you come and find me?

161
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,260
Broke up? Aren't we just arguing?

162
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,890
I already returned the ring. Is that not clear enough?

163
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,830
But I didn't agree with it.

164
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,500
It's you who threw the ring on the table and left. Is that called clear?

165
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,490
So, it turns out you weren't clear?

166
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,480
For two entire weeks, you didn't contact me.

167
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,220
Wasn't that your answer?

168
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,910
I didn't contact you,

169
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,880
because Sister Maizi told me I should give you some space and time to calm down.

170
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,330
Sister Maizi? You mean the one you put your arms around as you sang?

171
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,340
So now our relationship problem

172
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,630
must be consulted with her and have her tell you how to resolve them?

173
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,260
You've really misunderstood Sister Maizi.

174
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,480
I admit, she really treats me well.

175
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,250
But the two of us really don't have anything between us.

176
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,760
You don't need to explain. Whether or not there's anything between you really isn't important anymore.

177
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,140
Then, tell me why!

178
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,830
In these three years, I've put in so much effort for our relationship.

179
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,840
Maybe you think that I haven't done enough

180
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,750
and not perfect enough, but I already tried my best.

181
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,200
And now we're breaking up so randomly. How can you expect me to accept this?

182
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,890
The life that we want is different.

183
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,980
Where is it different?

184
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,960
Do you really need to ask?

185
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,820
I don't know so that's why I'm asking you!

186
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,840
No matter what you want, I will do all I can to match you. Is that okay now?

187
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,190
There's no need. I don't need you to do anything for me.

188
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,690
Haoyi, I admit

189
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,210
you really put in a lot for me.

190
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,460
You also made a lot of effort for our future

191
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,090
and I know all of this.

192
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,230
And I have never doubted you

193
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,380
and I followed your arrangements,

194
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,330
your rules, your plans.

195
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,860
But after looking back, I realized

196
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,010
I didn't want any of these things.

197
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,400
The most tragic of it all is that I actually got used to it.

198
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,740
After I woke up, I asked myself,

199
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,130
"What do I really want?" My brain went completely blank.

200
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,180
I didn't have an answer.

201
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,630
Tell me. Don't I seem like a white mouse in a lab?

202
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,430
Weiwei.

203
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,430
Let me finish talking.

204
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,960
I don't want to be those women who can only attach themselves to men,

205
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,800
and once their other half is gone,

206
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,450
they act like its the end of the world.

207
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,690
I won't leave you!

208
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,090
Okay! If it's because you think that I don't give you enough security,

209
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,160
then I will change. Okay?

210
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,650
Why can't you just understand what I'm saying?

211
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,530
Then, what exactly do you want from me!

212
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,170
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lost my temper.

213
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,160
Let's go home first. If we have anything to discuss we can do it at home.

214
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,500
All that I should have said, I did.

215
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,000
Haoyi,

216
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,600
let's set each other free.

217
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,760
I understand.

218
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,080
You still need time to calm down.

219
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,590
Then rest early. I will pick you up tomorrow.

220
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,260
You don't need to come and pick me up.

221
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,500
You don't need to come and pick me up!

222
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,300
<i>♫ As the air closes in, I can't squeeze in a reply ♫</i>

223
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:44,070
<i>♫ Whoever makes their stance first ♫</i>

224
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,930
<i>♫ Loses the upper hand in an instant ♫</i>

225
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,190
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

226
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

227
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,000
Here.

228
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,370
How did 321's personality become like this?

229
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,760
You already agreed to break up. Can't it be amicable?

230
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,770
If I were Haoyi, I wouldn't give in to it either.

231
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,470
What does it have to do with you?

232
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,870
What's important is Weiwei already cleared it up with him.

233
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,150
He's still clinging on. How is our Weiwei supposed to live her life?

234
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,720
I'll go talk to him.

235
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,700
You sit down. I will go.

236
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,460
It's okay.

237
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,990
You're still here.

238
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,180
I saw Li Haoyi downstairs. Are you okay?

239
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,170
I'm fine. It's late. You should go.

240
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,810
Seeing you like this, how can I abandon you?

241
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,230
Don't forget, we're just friends.

242
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,060
That's right. This is the concern a friend shows for a friend.

243
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,430
Why can't you guys just give me some space?

244
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,350
Sorry, excuse me.

245
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,390
There's something going on with those two. They're like a bickering couple.

246
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,600
I don't think so.

247
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,120
I see.

248
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,410
It turns out that you and CEO Chu were a lie.

249
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,350
Zhou Weiwei broke up with Haoyi for CEO Chu.

250
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,440
It's not what you think.

251
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,580
- They just-- <br> - Just had an affair.

252
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,060
I'm warning you. Don't spread rumors at work.

253
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,220
Otherwise, I'll post your Alishan Holy Tree photos

254
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,920
on the company's bulletin board. You get it?

255
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,550
I get it.

256
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,770
Han Kefei, you woman.

257
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,800
You think just because you have something against me you can do whatever you want.

258
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,230
Let me tell you, my reputation as Alishan Holy Tree is no sham.

259
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,500
I'm big and firm. Do you even know?

260
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,660
What's big and firm?

261
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,400
You scared me.

262
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,410
Just that I've been working on my chest. It's pretty big. And my attitude is pretty firm.

263
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,470
Why are you here?

264
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,810
Come with me.

265
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,000
Sit.

266
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,400
I stayed because I wanted to ask you about Weiwei.

267
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,270
Isn't she your girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend.

268
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,760
Shouldn't you know more about her? Why would you ask me?

269
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,530
Ever since I left the company, Weiwei has become so strange.

270
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,340
She's become so different from the person I knew.

271
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,890
I wanted to ask. You see her every day at work,

272
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,120
have you discovered anything abnormal?

273
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,910
Her? I've never thought she was normal.

274
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,190
My stomach hurts every time I see her.

275
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,170
If her abnormal is considered normal, then she's still very normal.

276
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,200
I mean. Has she come across anything upsetting at work?

277
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,850
Or is it possible

278
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,690
that she's seeing someone else?

279
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,890
Are you kidding?

280
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,980
She's such a goody-two-shoes,

281
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,730
even if she was two-timing, she wouldn't tell me.

282
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,980
I mean she's such a good girl,

283
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,550
how could she cheat?

284
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,000
I also thought she wouldn't treat me that way.

285
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,870
But I can't think of any other reason why a good girl like Weiwei,

286
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,990
would change so quickly in such a short span of time.

287
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,000
CEO Chu? Why is he here?

288
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,640
Just after you left, he came to ask Weiwei about work.

289
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,870
Work? At Weiwei's house?

290
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,160
The four of us, including Kefei, you know,

291
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,620
are in charge of this project, so we were all there.

292
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,920
Liu Dawei, are you keeping something from me?

293
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,930
No. No. I didn't say anything

294
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,140
about them drinking under Yilan's starry skies.

295
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,250
We went to Yilan for work, the four of us. And we all drank together.

296
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,370
And then?

297
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,520
And then they went for a walk.

298
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,410
Kefei and I were right behind them. So the four of us went for a walk.

299
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,890
And then at night...

300
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,630
we went to our own rooms.

301
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,890
If anything happened, I wouldn't know. But I believe...

302
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,950
I believe nothing happened.

303
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,100
Here, it's warm.

304
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,000
You should be hungry.

305
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,270
I noticed you didn't have dinner but didn't know what you felt like having.

306
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,880
So I bought a whole bunch.

307
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,290
There's pasta, curry rice, omurice, and gyudon.

308
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,370
What would you like?

309
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,220
It's cold at night. Don't stay too late.

310
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,030
I know you don't want to hear anything I say right now.

311
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,080
And you'd only be more annoyed if I stay around.

312
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,590
So I just wanted to make sure

313
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,270
you have something to eat and drink.

314
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,110
Don't overthink.

315
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm not that weak.

316
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,470
I'm trying my best to change right now,

317
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,930
so I can upgrade myself to Zhou Weiwei 2.0.

318
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,260
So I won't be defeated by anyone or anything.

319
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,570
That's great.

320
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,350
Good luck.

321
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,550
Pick something to eat. If you can't eat it all, take it back for Han Kefei.

322
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:58,200
And go take a shower, rest up early.

323
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,280
When you wake up tomorrow,

324
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,590
♪ "It'll be a brand new day."

325
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,520
♪ "It'll be a brand new day."

326
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,710
Hurry, eat. I'm going.

327
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,910
<i> Right. Don't let her get rained on again.</i>

328
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,990
<i> She was rained on? When was this?</i>

329
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,890
<i> Mr. Chu, how did you know about it?</i>

330
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,240
<i> What did you promise me when I sold you the house? You said you'd protect her, take care of her, and make her happy. And now?</i>

331
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,940
<i> You let your woman get stinking drunk. And you only show up in the morning?</i>

332
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,700
<i> Mr. Chu, why are you here?</i>

333
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,580
<i> Aren't you and Weiwei getting married?</i>

334
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,780
<i> If you're too busy to come home, how will you get married?</i>

335
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,890
<i> What about Weiwei? Doesn't she mind?</i>

336
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,820
<i> I mean, you're so busy.</i>

337
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,990
<i> She has to just cooperate with your life plan?</i>

338
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,460
<i>While you're neglecting me,</i>

339
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,470
<i>if I encounter temptation,</i>

340
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,150
<i>I will waver and I will hesitate.</i>

341
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,710
<i> Do you know everything you're doing now</i>

342
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,700
<i> makes me wonder why</i>

343
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,760
<i> I'm keeping our promise.</i>

344
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,250
Wait.

345
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,350
What are you doing?

346
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,350
I'm covering you.

347
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,290
Cover what?

348
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,930
Please, there are scary partners everywhere.

349
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,370
The ones who are the most softly spoken, are the scariest when they snap.

350
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,900
The outcome is unimaginable.

351
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,200
Look at me. You're thinking too much.

352
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm not thinking too much.

353
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,330
If they kidnap you in a dark alley

354
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,130
and rape and mutilate you, what would you do?

355
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,950
He's not that kind of person.

356
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,230
What if he takes sulfuric acid and splashes it onto you?

357
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,140
- Then, I'll use you as my shield.<br>- No, why do you have to ruin...?

358
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,150
Morning.

359
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,920
Good morning.

360
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,210
Why are you here?

361
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,600
I came to pick you up. I think I should pick you up every day for a while.

362
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,730
No need.

363
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,350
This is great.

364
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,110
I won't have to catch a bus or a taxi.

365
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,150
- Do I have the honor of sitting in your car, too? <br> - Of course.

366
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,980
Didn't we say we were catching a bus?

367
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,990
We're going to be late. There's no time.

368
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,540
Get in.

369
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,270
♫ <i>Happiness has accumulated dust, conversations have become silent and broken</i> ♫

370
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,360
♫ <i>There ceased to exist twists and turns in your eyes, you said to break up right away</i> ♫

371
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,000
<i>♫ You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

372
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,180
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

373
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,160
Dawei's team is in charge of development?

374
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,530
Yes, this is Chairman Wang's only condition.

375
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,990
But this is the company's most important project over the next few years.

376
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,570
The Chairman personally directed that this project's research and development

377
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,250
would be assigned to R&amp;D Team 1.

378
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,690
Now, we suddenly need Team 2 to take it on.

379
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,080
This seems to need to go through the Chairman's permission first.

380
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Additionally, Dawei's group is most well known for

381
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,680
the progress to be forever delayed!

382
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,180
That's right.

383
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,550
I will work hard!

384
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,270
From the beginning to end, he has not partaken in any part of this project.

385
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,510
Yep, that's right.

386
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,760
Now, we're in a time crunch.

387
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,690
Dawei, are you confident?

388
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,390
- No. <br> - Huh?

389
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,140
No task is impossible. As long as we work hard, that will be enough.

390
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,330
Jessica, I can coordinate things with Ken from Team 1.

391
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,710
Then I will ask them to in the shortest time possible

392
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,710
take all the research they've done and transfer it to them.

393
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,730
Then I will oversee Team 2 and make sure they are progressing as we've planned.

394
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,550
- Dawei. <br> - Yes.

395
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:27,140
Good luck. If progress continues to be delayed,

396
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,980
then even if you have nine layers of skin, that wouldn't be enough for me to rip.

397
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,130
I'm not joking.

398
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,350
What is this? So random.

399
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,440
They're playing this sort of game during work hours?

400
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,480
But it's still quite sweet. Look.

401
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,060
Being young is great!

402
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,170
Manager! I am so envious of you!

403
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,230
It's on every screen! That's too romantic. <br> <i> (Weiwei, I love you. Marry me.) </i>

404
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,350
It's so romantic!

405
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,770
<i> Will she?</i>

406
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,260
<i> Wow, it's really too romantic! </i>

407
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,800
Why do I feel like it's a bit scary?

408
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,890
No, it's not. It's quite romantic!

409
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,480
I'm leaving.

410
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,790
The male lead is here!

411
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,880
Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!

412
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,720
Brother Haoyi is here!<br><i>(Weiwei, I love you. Marry me!)</i>

413
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,930
Hey, hey! Don't block them!

414
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,110
Weiwei, today in front of all your coworkers,

415
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,000
I want to make up a grand proposal that you've been waiting for.

416
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,340
Why don't you take those flowers out of his hands?

417
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,470
This, I'll hold it for her first. This is my job.

418
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,930
I'll help you take care of it first.

419
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,520
Weiwei, I know that you've sacrificed a lot for me,

420
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,840
but I've only thought about myself

421
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,990
took all your efforts as to be expected,

422
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,410
and I caused you to be wronged.

423
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,980
But I promise that from today,

424
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,110
I will put you in the first place in my heart.

425
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,610
I will put all my effort to make you happy,

426
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,600
I will let you live a better life and you won't have to worry about food and clothes.

427
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,190
And I can even let you live the life of a wealthy wife.

428
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,220
You won't need to work this hard in the future.

429
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,510
You just need to be focused on being Mrs. Li.

430
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,980
You won't need to worry about anything else.

431
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,080
And all the things I've done wrong in the past, I will never do them again.

432
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,000
I will tell you everything.

433
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,660
I promise.

434
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,200
So Zhou Weiwei, marry me.

435
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:28,750
Marry him, marry him, marry him!

436
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,660
Marry him, marry him, marry him!

437
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,940
Marry him, marry him, marry him!

438
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:47,000
<i></i>

439
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,570
Weiwei!

440
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,510
Don't do this, okay?

441
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,570
Don't do this? Then what do you want me to do?

442
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,280
I've already flown back from Shanghai.

443
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,860
I'm carrying such a large bouquet. I bought such a large diamond ring.

444
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,650
And I kneeled down and proposed to you in front of so many people.

445
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,710
What more do you want me to do?

446
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,150
Li Haoyi, can you calm down and stop creating such a bad scene?

447
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,400
- The one who's making a bad scene isn't me! <br> - Kefei!

448
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,580
Chu Kehuan, what are you doing?

449
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,120
What are you doing!

450
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,560
Weiwei already broke up with you. What is the point of your big romantic gesture?

451
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,020
Then, that is between the two of us. What does it have to do with you!

452
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,780
Because your actions have severely impacted the entire office,

453
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,960
and everyone's views towards Weiwei. How can she continue to work here?

454
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,530
Proposals are a good thing. Didn't you see that?

455
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,350
Everyone was wishing us well. What kind of adverse impact would this have on her?

456
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,390
Because she will not accept your proposal!

457
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,310
What right do you have to say this, huh?

458
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,130
Or do you just want us to break up?

459
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,630
Open the door! The two of you open the door!

460
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,470
So, the night I got home you were at Kefei's house.

461
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,060
The second day you came to pick her up early morning.

462
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,390
You were stalking Weiwei?

463
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,670
What you've done together, you are the clearest. Now, what relationship do you have?

464
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,460
Friends? More than friends?

465
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,170
Already lovers?

466
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,890
Or have you already slept together?

467
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,190
Li Haoyi, please talk more cleanly.

468
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,770
Open the door! Open the door!

469
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,120
The key is here! Excuse me! Excuse me!

470
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,340
Which one is it!

471
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,990
Oh, I don't know, just try them out!

472
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,130
Hurry up!

473
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,030
You can not believe me, but you can't not trust Weiwei.

474
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,340
Weiwei, Weiwei.

475
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,110
I'm telling you, Weiwei isn't a name you can call! She's mine!

476
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,850
She used to be. But now she's not.

477
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,540
So you admit it!

478
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,120
Yes, I admit I like Weiwei,

479
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,610
but everything was initiated by me, but she's never accepted me.

480
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,650
So, Weiwei didn't betray you okay!

481
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,500
Liu Dawei, how much longer do you need?

482
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,290
Weiwei, don't call her Weiwei! She's mine!

483
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,800
She's not yours, and she's not mine! Stop bothering her!

484
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,130
She's mine!

485
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,580
Li Haoyi, have you created enough of a disturbance?

486
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,570
You proposed in front of everyone to give her pressure. That's forcing her into marriage not proposing to her, do you know that?

487
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,440
Can you even be considered a man?

488
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,540
Be considered a man? You destroyed our relationship, how can you be considered a man?

489
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,700
To Weiwei, I only have respect. I love her, I cherish her.

490
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,640
When she needed me, I was by her side. Can I ask where you were?

491
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,760
You had your arms around another woman in front of her, isn't that right?

492
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,300
What are you even? You don't deserve to be her man.

493
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,700
They're fighting now! I beg you to hurry up!

494
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,160
<i> Not that one!</i>

495
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,720
Li Haoyi, you better wake up!

496
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,570
Stop it! Stop fighting!

497
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,390
Let go of me!

498
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,000
<i>♫ You need not give in, I surrender my pride ♫</i>

499
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,900
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped, I don't want to struggle anymore ♫</i>

500
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,560
<i> (Weiwei, I love you. Marry me!) <i></i></i>

501
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I thought I had cleared everything up with you.

502
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,670
Why did you still come to my office

503
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,490
and created such an unsightly scene?

504
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,840
It's all because of Chu Kehuan, is that right?

505
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,740
What are you saying?

506
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,720
He personally admitted to me.

507
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,410
He said he likes you, and that he's chasing after you.

508
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,010
It's him who stole you from my side.

509
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,280
Haoyi,

510
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,490
the reason the two of us would break up and cancel our engagement today is

511
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,120
simply because there is a big problem between the two of us.

512
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,090
It has nothing to do with Chu Kehuan.

513
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,780
When you were proposing to me earlier,

514
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,800
all the things you've said to me

515
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,760
were just proof

516
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,970
that you don't understand me at all.

517
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,640
Did you know that last night

518
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,350
when I was preparing these things,

519
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,490
I was thinking,

520
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,240
"How did we get to this point?"

521
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,120
Before, everything was so good between us.

522
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,200
We had the same goals

523
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,380
and worked hard for the same future.

524
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,220
You never doubted me.

525
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,670
But later, you started to question me.

526
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,230
You had more and more questions towards me.

527
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,740
You even got angry at me.

528
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,770
After this fight, I understand

529
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,390
that all of this is because of Chu Kehuan.

530
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,270
When he appeared, you changed.

531
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,730
Yes. I changed.

532
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,100
You also changed.

533
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,210
Even our life plan changed.

534
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,250
Your world already changed to not have space for me.

535
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,980
Your space has always been here.

536
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,500
It's you who left first.

537
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,090
Don't rush. This isn't the time for you to appear.

538
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,110
And what right do you have to go over there?

539
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,480
Weiwei and Li Haoyi have been in there for a long time already.

540
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,850
I am worried that Li Haoyi will do something irrational again.

541
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,710
This is the office.

542
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,380
They've been together for three years, and 321 doesn't have a history of violence.

543
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,010
He won't do anything to Weiwei.

544
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,450
Chu Kehuan said earlier,

545
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,160
that when you were sad, he'd never left your side.

546
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,520
That when you were going through tough times, he had always been accompanying you.

547
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,610
So when I was working overtime in Shanghai, you've always been together.

548
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,300
What were you doing?

549
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,220
Were you complaining about me? Were you criticizing me?

550
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:15,950
Or were you too busy, and completely just... forgot me.

551
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,810
If I really forgot you,

552
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,330
I wouldn't have gone to Shanghai to find you.

553
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,390
And the time of which we've been together,

554
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,030
no matter how poorly I was feeling

555
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,450
or whatever thoughts I had about you,

556
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,590
in front of others,

557
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,050
I've never said a single word of criticism about you.

558
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,370
Including Chu Kehuan?

559
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,920
Yes, including Chu Kehuan.

560
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,460
Why aren't you telling the truth?

561
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,380
I can accept it now.

562
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,060
Exactly how worthless, how sub par I am in your eyes.

563
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,280
Tell me. How is Chu Kehuan better than me?

564
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,200
Can you stop bringing up Chu Kehuan?

565
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,420
I don't want to bring him up either!

566
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,970
But the problem between the two of us is Chu Kehuan!

567
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,500
Last night, I suddenly thought of something.

568
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,030
One day you told me,

569
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,550
in the face of temptation, you will also waver.

570
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,590
The temptation you were speaking of must be Chu Kehuan.

571
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,820
Li Haoyi, please think clearly.

572
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,520
After we finished speaking that day,

573
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,660
- we decided to get married in two months. Isn't that right? <br> - That's because you felt guilty!

574
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,630
You felt that you wronged me.

575
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,290
So you used marriage to make it up to me.

576
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,580
You were the one who brought up marriage!

577
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,100
So you slept together before?

578
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,430
I didn't.

579
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:54,380
I'm sorry for asking, CEO Chu, but you and Kefei are "innocent," right?

580
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,160
How much longer do we have to wait here?

581
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,070
When they finish talking, they'll come out. They won't be in there forever!

582
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,190
So, when Kefei jumped out and confessed her relationship with you,

583
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,430
she was protecting Zhou Weiwei?

584
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,840
CEO Chu, you need to trust Weiwei.

585
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,100
She has the ability to resolve the issue on her own.

586
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,120
At this point, I don't trust anyone, particularly Li Haoyi.

587
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm sorry, CEO Chu. I asked you two questions earlier and you haven't responded to me yet.

588
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,130
What do you want to ask!

589
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,440
I want to ask if the two of you slept together before!

590
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,150
So you've slept together before. I can tell, Zhou Weiwei.

591
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,410
You've really slept together before.

592
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,020
How can you treat me like that?

593
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,780
I trust you so much! I love you so much! How can you treat me like that?

594
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,020
Say something!

595
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,490
Why don't you say anything?

596
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,960
What do you want me to say?

597
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,660
I want you to say you love me!

598
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,430
Say that you don't love Chu Kehuan, that you still want to marry me.

599
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,050
Say that you and Chu Kehuan don't have anything together.

600
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,720
Say that you still want to start things anew with me.

601
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,390
I can't stay here anymore.

602
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,760
- That's not it, CEO Chu! CEO Chu! <br> - Hold on!

603
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,860
I just want to know if you've slept together or not!

604
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,120
- No! <br> - No!

605
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,710
Chu Kehuan, if you really can't be reassured, I'll go take a look.

606
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,280
I'll go.

607
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,910
Wait for me to come back.

608
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,950
Go! Go away!

609
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,010
What are you doing?

610
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,320
Oh, you scared me!

611
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,460
Can you get in?

612
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,190
They locked the door. We can't get in.

613
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,900
So, what can we do now? The key!

614
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,580
Oh, right-right. I'll go get the key! I'll go get the key!

615
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,520
Zhou Weiwei, look at me.

616
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,220
I want you to look at me. Turn around and look at me!

617
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,720
Okay! Do you really want to know? Then, I'll tell you!

618
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,270
That's right! I'm in love with Chu Kehuan!

619
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,830
I fell in love with him a long time ago!

620
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,370
From the day he bought me, I fell in love with him!

621
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,700
Bought?

622
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,500
Yes, that's right, "bought."

623
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,920
Why do you think Chu Kehuan was willing to sell his house to us for NT$8,000,000 less?

624
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,220
Because I sold myself to him.

625
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,620
One night was NT$8,000,000!

626
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,530
What? Now, it's your turn to be speechless?

627
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,380
Hold on!

628
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,760
Excuse me! Excuse me! Weiwei, are you okay? Weiwei!

629
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,540
Don't you want to know the truth? This is the truth!

630
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,500
Chu Kehuan and I have slept together already. And not just one night!

631
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,330
When you were not home,

632
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,600
we slept together in every corner of the house. Are you satisfied now!

649
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,310
This Zhou Weiwei is too much!

650
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,190
It's enough that she rejected Li Haoyi's proposal,

651
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:10,320
but she even let CEO Chu and Li Haoyi get into a fight?

652
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,790
If this gets to the top,

653
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,430
do you think we should be doing this project or not?

654
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Boss, then do we still need to have this meeting?

655
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,220
How can we have the meeting?

656
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,850
The male lead isn't here. The female lead went missing.

657
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,300
The mood in the whole company is so depressing now.

658
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,760
Hold the meeting? I'm holding the meeting with ghosts!

659
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,040
Oh, Executive Assistant.

660
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,570
Ziyuan, you're dressed especially beautifully today!

661
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:43,040
Aren't we having a meeting today? How come I didn't see anyone in the main conference room?

662
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,130
Today's meeting may need to be... canceled!

663
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,850
Why must it be canceled?

664
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,730
Where's CEO Chu? Did he come here already?

665
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,000
What exactly happened?

666
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,110
Executive Assistant, what happened was

667
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,770
today, they-they...

668
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:11,220
<i> (Tomod's Drugstore) </i>

669
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,900
A razor? This is for men!

670
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,370
You can give this to your young men!

671
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,270
And you shave your legs.

672
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,320
Nail clippers? Why are you buying nail clippers?

673
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,520
The one I have doesn't work well anymore.

674
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,470
We still have one at home!

675
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,400
We will use it anyway.

676
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
This one.

677
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,990
Toothpaste.

678
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,950
You're even buying toothpaste?

679
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,830
We will use it!

680
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,180
Are you going on a shopping spree?

681
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,250
If you want to go on a shopping spree, then buy this. It'll replenish your collagen.

682
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,100
It'll give you good energy and a good complexion.

683
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,220
Right now, everyone else has something to say about us.

684
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,230
I want to maintain my own state.

685
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,430
- I would use a strong presence to make them retreat! <br> - Okay!

686
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,710
You're buying too much!

687
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,640
It's a year's worth!

688
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,010
Let's go!

689
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,760
Hello.

690
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,360
Hold on, miss! Hold on!

691
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,080
Weiwei, let's just leave this

692
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,510
and this one, okay?

693
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,320
Why?

694
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,020
That's not it. You got so many things. It's really heavy, I can't carry this all.

695
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,480
Please.

696
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,470
Okay, we'll listen to you.

697
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,990
Miss, we just want to keep this. We don't want the rest. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!

698
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,870
Where are we going now? Give it to me.

699
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,130
Why are you laughing?

700
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,390
I am laughing that when other people are not in a good mood,

701
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,340
they will spend money to eat out of anger or buy luxury goods.

702
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,580
It's the first time I've seen someone have a shopping spree at a pharmacy.

703
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,760
Thank goodness I stopped you; otherwise, I'd laugh even more exaggeratedly.

704
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,500
Eating out of anger can only help you vent your feelings at that moment. After you eat, you'll get fat.

705
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,750
Buying out of anger: after you purchase the luxury goods and get home, you'll just leave it in the closet. You won't be able to wear it more than twice in a year.

706
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,870
You might as well buy something useful.

707
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,800
You broke up well.

708
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,520
What?

709
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,530
I'm saying, you breaking up with 321 was a good thing.

710
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,210
Why are you saying it like that?

711
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,600
Didn't you hear yourself earlier?

712
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,650
You weren't like this before? You were really frugal.

713
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,940
Spending money is considered rational.

714
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,570
But now?

715
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,820
Even when you're venting, you can't be yourself?

716
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,270
You're meticulous and careful with money. You haggle over every cent.

717
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,840
This is 321's thinking and logic.

718
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,120
So I'm saying, breaking up was the right thing to do.

719
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,130
Keifei, you know this the best. Where is the best and most expensive restaurant?

720
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,590
Where is the closest brand name store?

721
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,570
What do you want to do?

722
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:15,750
I want to listen to you. I want to eat out of anger. I want to buy things out of anger! I--

723
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,770
I don't know what I want.

724
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,810
I don't want to be restricted anymore.

725
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,520
I don't want to live my life following someone else's plans.

726
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:46,050
I don't want to listen to someone else tell me how I should act.

727
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,210
I don't want it anymore!

728
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,880
<i> (Chu Kehuan) </i>

729
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,290
Hello?

730
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,930
<i> Where are you? Is Weiwei okay? </i>

731
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,400
You people are really overbearing and forceful.

732
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,990
I really don't want to say it but you were provoking the situation.

733
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,610
If you can't get with her, then don't try to!

734
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,730
I've never seen anyone as determined as you.

735
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,730
<i> I know that Weiwei probably doesn't want to see me right now. </i>

736
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,230
<i> Please take care of her for me. </i>

737
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,750
You don't need to remind me of that.

738
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,260
<i> Thank you. </i>

739
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,480
Ziyuan...

740
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,190
This slap is for Kehuan.

741
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,080
This slap is for myself!

742
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,190
Kefei!

743
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,090
This is between the two of us. It's okay.

744
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,740
Do you need to be this high profile?

745
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,410
Do you need to be so high profile that you let everyone know the person you were cheating with is Chu Kehuan?

746
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,360
Zhou Weiwei, it's enough that you are facing humiliation.

747
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,580
You let Kehuan look so bad.

748
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,470
What if this situation gets to the parent company. How do you want him to live?

749
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,770
How will your people at Hualai view him in the future?

750
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,230
Gao Ziyuan, are you crazy? You'll hit whoever you say you will?

751
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,510
It's clearly Chu Kehuan who is clinging onto Zhou Weiwei.

752
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,000
Han Kefei, I'm not talking to you!

753
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,990
Zhou Weiwei, do you really take me as an idiot?

754
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,300
I already knew about you and Kehuan a long time ago!

755
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,890
I've been hinting at you for so long!

756
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,190
I even became a wedding consultant and personally planned your wedding with Li Haoyi.

757
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,360
The whole time I was reminding you to distance yourself from Chu Kehuan.

758
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,730
Then, can I ask what was up with that situation in the office last time?

759
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:46,770
That time, it was me who was in the wrong and made everyone look bad.

760
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,170
And because of this, Kehuan laid his cards out on the table and broke up with me sooner.

761
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,390
So that's why I withheld my anger and swallowed my thoughts until now.

762
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,640
I've been working so hard to protect him,

763
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,870
and yet you destroy him in one day?

764
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:06,220
Ziyuan, I never thought about stealing Chu Kehuan from you.

765
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,160
That's right. It's you who's the most chaste. You're a holy saint.

766
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,990
It's like what Han Kefei said. All of this is Chu Kehuan's fault.

767
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,920
Today, Li Haoyi will break up with you because he's the one who isn't good enough.

768
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,020
I'm hitting you out in the public because I'm too impulsive.

769
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,380
All of this and more is all someone else's fault and it's you who is the most innocent!

770
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,470
- Don't be too excessive! <br> - Leave!

771
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,840
- What are you doing! <br> - Kefei!

772
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,560
Zhou Weiwei!

773
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,960
Gao Ziyuan! Have you done enough!

774
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,550
Kefei is my friend. Don't do anything to her.

775
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,580
Earlier those two slaps, I'll count it as what I owe you.

776
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,990
But let me tell you, everything that happened now isn't what I was willing to see happen.

777
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,620
If you believe me, that's fine; if you don't believe me, then that's also fine.

778
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,880
I want to tell you

779
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,400
that from today onwards

780
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,020
I will be very careful to not let the same thing as today happen.

781
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,590
But I cannot guarantee it

782
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,220
because I only have the ability to control myself and not others!

783
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,390
What are you saying?

784
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:10,700
I'm saying, I cannot control Chu Kehuan.

785
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,510
You also cannot control Chu Kehuan.

786
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,870
So because I cannot control Chu Kehuan,

787
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,460
you want to manage both Li Haoyi and Chu Kehuan?

788
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,520
I don't want to control anyone and I don't want to care about anyone!

789
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,140
I just want to live my life properly.

790
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:30,760
Zhou Weiwei, I'm telling you. I will deal with you.

791
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,450
- What are you saying, you finished hitting her and just-- <br> - Kefei!

792
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,420
- Come back and explain it clearly! <br> - Kefei!

793
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,760
I will call Chu Kehuan right now!

794
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,700
Don't call him.

795
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,320
What is she even saying! I want to call!

796
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,670
Don't call!

797
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,020
Why are you calling him?

798
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,800
Didn't I say it earlier?

799
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,500
Right now, all I want to do is live my life.

00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:07,690
Today, the board of directors passed a resolution.

812
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,530
Because of Chairman Wang's agreement, they decided to...

813
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,830
that regarding our collaborative project with Hualai, they will continue to increase funding.

814
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,770
All the details are inside.

815
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,350
In the future, please have someone to send the information to me or just email it.

816
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,530
You don't need to personally send it to me.

817
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,940
You don't want to see me that much?

818
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,850
Progress has been very smooth.

819
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,350
What in the world are you unhappy about?

820
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,590
If you don't have anything to do, I'm still busy.

821
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,100
Zhou Weiwei has already rejected Li Haoyi's proposal.

822
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,810
Shouldn't you be very happy?

823
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,030
Your face has already gotten beaten to this point.

824
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,960
Don't you think it's very embarrassing?

825
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,870
Because of a woman, you got in a fight with someone at the company?

826
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,660
Gao Ziyuan!

827
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,220
Don't you think you owe me an explanation!

828
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,300
What explanation do I owe you?

829
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,060
You were willing to sell the house to Zhou Weiwei for NT$8,000,000 less,

830
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,240
just because she was willing to sleep with you?

831
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,600
I don't want to listen to you go crazy here.

832
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,320
So, what is the situation now?

833
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,710
When the two of them came to look at the house, you'd already long been acquainted?

834
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,620
You already liked her a long time ago and pretended you didn't know her?

835
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:21,590
Chu Kehuan, in front of the two of us,

836
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,150
Zhou Weiwei put on Li Haoyi's ring as he proposed.

837
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:28,730
And then she turned around and got in bed with you. You're not afraid of having this type of woman?

838
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,460
Today, she'll betray Li Haoyi, then she'll betray you in the future!

839
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,200
She never betrayed Li Haoyi!

840
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,990
She already slept with you and that's still considered not betraying anyone?

841
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,410
- Get out of the way! <br> - Chu Kehuan!

842
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,620
Chu Kehuan! Chu Kehuan!

843
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,000
I've worked so hard to treat you well for all these years,

844
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,470
and the result is you've done what behind my back?

845
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:52,450
- You know that in these ten years, I have-- <br> - Can you stop with "these ten years" already?

846
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:56,260
Don't forget that we'd already broken up! Can you not revive these old debts?

847
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,890
Do you think I like to reopen these old debts?

848
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:01,890
Do you think I like to say these things to let myself feel sad?

849
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,590
Then, don't say it anymore.

850
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,240
I beg you to have mercy on me, to have mercy on yourself!

851
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,090
Let us both start our lives anew, okay?

852
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,630
How can you let go of our ten years of feelings?

853
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,590
How can you be so heartless? Tell me. How did you do this?

854
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:26,070
Kehuan, I know that you must think I'm living well now.

855
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,550
I have a respectable job, and my position is higher than yours,

856
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,180
but I'm not well. I'm really not living well.

857
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,660
Kehuan,

858
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,040
I miss you.

859
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,750
I really miss you.

860
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,100
Gao Ziyuan,

861
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:51,210
ten seconds earlier you were chewing me out in the office and now you're pulling the corner of my jacket and telling me you miss me?

862
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,290
Can you give this love to someone else?

863
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,670
I really can't bear the weight of your love, Gao Ziyuan.

864
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:02,660
Kehuan, I don't want someone else. I just want you.

865
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,830
DIdn't you tell me to change? I've changed.

866
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,550
I never wanted you to change.

867
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,900
I especially don't want you to change yourself in order to match me.

868
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:22,310
I promise you. I can guarantee that I will no longer interfere with your life.

869
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,480
I can open one eye and close the other and watch yourself with another woman as long as she's not Zhou Weiwei.

870
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,660
Okay?

871
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,440
Kehuan, I beg you.

872
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,230
We can start over again.

873
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,900
There's no need. In this world, "we" have long ceased to exist!

874
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,190
I beg you not to forget that we've already broken up, okay?

875
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,320
Please treat me as a stranger.

Then, is she okay?

<i>What do you think? </i>Today, a loathsome man

886
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,320
was in the office forcing marriage on her,

887
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,500
and the other man pretended to be the knight in shining armor who was out to save her.

888
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,060
In the end, the two of them got in a huge fight in the office.

889
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:25,600
<i> And the best ending is everyone believing that Zhou Weiwei was cheating </i>

890

<i> and that you've used NT$8,000,000 to buy her. </i>

891
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:32,900
<i> And then the two of you slept in every corner of Li Haoyi's house. </i>

892
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,510
<i> Do you think she's doing well? </i>

893

<i> I don't know. </i>

01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,900
<i> I don't even care whether </i>or not the two of you've slept together or not. That's not important.

896
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,470
<i> The point is the entire world thinks the two of you have slept together already. </i>

897
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,360
<i> And you say you have never? </i>

898
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,130
<i> The fact that she has to take on all of this, she's really in a bad position. </i>

899
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:01,000
<i> Li Haoyi restricting her life will only give her pressure. </i>

900

<i> And you? Chu Kehuan. </i>

<i> She doesn't need these. </i>

905
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,380
<i> All she has gotten from the two of you lousy men is pain. </i>

Apologies, I'm drunk and I've said too much.

And can you please tell Gao Ziyuan that--

01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,960
Why are you here?

934
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,420
Because I guessed that tonight you wouldn't sleep well and you'd come out for a walk.

935
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,990
So I was sitting here waiting for you.

936
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:25,970
You can read my mind?

937
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,650
You can read my mind? You know I'm thirsty.

938
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:42,690
<i>♫ I love you more than before ♫</i>

939
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,190
<i>♫ Never having any talent for love ♫</i>

940
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,300
<i>♫ Being too earnest teaches you after getting hurt once ♫</i>

941
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,420
<i>♫ Some passersby in life ♫ </i>

942
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,400
<i>♫ can't be forgotten ♫</i>

943
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,800
I'm sorry.

944
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,160
It's okay.

945
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,690
You know what I'm talking about?

946
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,360
No idea, but it doesn't matter.

947
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,470
No matter what you're apologizing to me for,

948
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:19,770
I will always tell you that it's okay.

949
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:24,490
If you thank me, I will also say you're welcome.

950
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,730
Even if...

951
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:31,390
I tell the whole world that you used NT$8,000,000 to buy me?

952
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,710
Yes, even if

953
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,550
you tell the entire world that I used NT$8,000,000 to buy you.

954
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,750
That is also the truth. It's just that... in the end, it didn't happen.

955
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,000
So it doesn't matter?

956
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,990
It doesn't matter. If you are not afraid to say it, then I'm not afraid to admit it.

957
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:59,000
<i></i>

958
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:05,370
Actually, I should be the one apologizing to you.

959
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,120
I was worried that Li Haoyi's emotions were unstable and that he'd do something to hurt you.

960
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,020
So at the most inadequate time,

961
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,350
I opened the door in the office.

962
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,830
Yeah, I did see you.

963
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:27,380
The moment you opened the door, I thought the world was spinning.

964
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,430
The biggest coincidence in the entire world

965
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:35,000
happened to me?

966
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,960
The same person drove and rode the vehicles,

967
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,800
and they broke down twice on the same day.

968
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:51,200
What I don't want, keeps coming at me; and what I want, I can never have.

969
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:57,620
In this life, I've never lied.

970
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:02,800
But at the most impulsive moment, I told the biggest lie.

971
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,070
And the entire world heard it.

972
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,180
It's not the entire world.

973
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:12,780
Just... all the employees at Hualai.

974
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,320
Thank you.

975
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,000
You're welcome.

976
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,840
That's not right. You should be the one apologizing to me.

977
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,560
I won't apologize for this.

978
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,020
And even more so, I won't help you clear your name over this matter.

979
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,590
Why?

980
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,420
Now, everyone thinks we have slept together.

981
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,220
Now, in the future, we can be public about everything. Isn't that better?

982
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,440
Chu Kehuan, we haven't slept together.

983
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,590
But no one knows.

984
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,980
Everyone thinks we've slept together.

985
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,690
And it turns out that we've never slept together?

986
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:55,570
If it's like that, I've been wronged and it's really unjust. Doesn't that mean I've suffered losses?

987
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,990
What are you laughing about?

988
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:11,980
What do you think? Do you want to let the misunderstanding become reality?

989
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,960
<i> Li Haoyi, do you think we are suited to work together right now? </i>

990
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,790
<i> We aren't suited, but you and Chu Kehuan are suited? </i>

991
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,500
<i>But when you have to choose between me and work,</i>

992
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,300
<i>what would you do?</i>

993
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:38,140
<i>♫ Closing the door, returning to real life ♫</i>

994
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:45,080

01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,490
