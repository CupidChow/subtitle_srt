<i>You'll fly to Shanghai for work. You'll be there for half a year, and the wedding will be postponed.</i>

15
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,200
<i> I'll be back in two weeks! </i>

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,560
<i> You only told me after you made the decision. </i>

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,800
<i> That isn't good. I am someone who's getting married soon.</i>

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,460
<i> If you want to get married, you will need to wait for half a year. </i>

19

<i> Then, from now on, CEO Chu calls the shots for everything. </i>

20

<i>Okay, whatever CEO Chu says.</i>

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,930
<i>Whatever CEO Chu says.</i>

22
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,580

<i> Chairman Wang is my uncle! </i>

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,980
In life, not everything goes the way you want it to. I work so hard.

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,400
I work so hard to try and change the course of my life,

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,980
and the result is that I met my biggest enemy.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,730
Why do I have such a rotten mouth?

29
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,400
Why must I have such a bad attitude?

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,100
Why did I pour coffee on him earlier? Why do I have such a strong sense of righteousness?

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,120
- Why did I help you, you pig-head! <br> - Hey!

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,400
You can't actually have entered Dawei into your list of considerations!

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,640
Considering or not isn't important.

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,100
What's important is that he's our coworker.

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,450
He's the nephew of our important client.

36
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,000
Without considering him, we need to finish our work.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,350
If I consider him, he was born into wealth, so it's only right for me to tie him down.

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,290
But don't you think he's constantly attacking me?

39
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,990
So, I'm telling you.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,730
Right now, I am the biggest asset in this group.

41
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,170
Don't worry, I will keep saying good things about you in front of him.

42
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,050
But regarding the matters about splashing coffee on him

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,900
and scolding him, I have to whitewash it first.

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,320
Which bed are you sleeping in today?

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,770
Whichever. Without a man in bed, sleeping in any bed is the same.

46
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,380
Then I will sleep there.

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,050
If only I had tied down Dawei today, then that would have been great.

48
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,100
We wouldn't have any more worries!

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,000

52
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,090
Alishan Holy Tree!

53
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,700
I'd like to see how much of a holy tree you are.

54
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,950
You can't still be using that dating app, are you?

55
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,270
But didn't you just say you wanted to tie Dawei down?

56
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,200
That's different! Dawei is work. He's career planning.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,490
Holy Tree is my interest and hobby. The two are different.

58
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,420
Whatever you say. I'm going outside to get some air.

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,150
You're not sleeping yet?

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,590
Isn't it too early?

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,020
And now I'm hurting so much, I'm about to burst into tears. How am I supposed to sleep?

62
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,070
Didn't I tell you to go see the doctor earlier? You refused to go.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,180
If you really were that concerned about me, why don't you go buy medicine for me?

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,260
Okay! Where is the pharmacy?

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,930
Ask your phone! Your phone will tell you! Are you from ancient times?

66
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,110
Then if I may ask, do you have a car?

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,960
I have a motorcycle. It's parked outside.

68
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,960
Thank you. Please resist the pain for a bit. I will be back soon.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,070
Let me hop on, too. I need to go buy something.

70
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,680
Buy something? Just tell me, I can get it for you.

71
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,530
It's so late. A woman being outside herself this late is dangerous.

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,370
Okay, then do you know how to ride it?

73
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,320
Of course, I do!

74
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Then you ride it!

75
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,460
I'm not too familiar with the roads here.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,860
I have a phone that can navigate for you.

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,600
To be honest, I rode a motorcycle once in high school,

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,050
but I fell down, so now I have a bit of a--

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,340
Fear?

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,770
Well, not that either.

81
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,170
Then, it must be being afraid?

82
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,600
Well, that doesn't count either.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,730
You mean you're scared of riding this!

84
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,830
I'll take you.

85
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay! Whatever CEO Chu says!

86
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,990
- Get ready to go! <br> - Mhm!

87
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,780
Aren't you going to hold onto me tighter?

88
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,490
Okay, whatever CEO Chu says!

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,260
Let's go!

90
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,090
CEO Chu,

91
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,400
I think I walk faster than you're riding.

92
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,540
I told you, I fell riding a motorcycle once in high school, so I--

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,200
So you're afraid?

94
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,340
So riding slower is safer!

95
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,080
Okay, whatever CEO Chu says!

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,220
Grass jelly tea to cool off!

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,400
Coconut juice? Also, to cool off.

98
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,620
Yogurt? It's guaranteed for smooth and easy digestion and it's a big bottle.

99
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,660
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

100
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,360
What's wrong?

101
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,320
There's completely no response.

102
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,830
The motorcycle is broken. What are you laughing about?

103
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,370
Who can be as lucky as me?

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,620
During the same day, with the same person.

105
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,790
Driving a car, riding a motorcycle, and the vehicles are all broken!

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
How can such a lucky thing happen to me!

107
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,540
So wholeheartedly looking forward to getting married,

108
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,580
and the wedding date continues to be pushed back and pushed back.

109
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,080
Now, it's extended for half a year!

110
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,130
I don't want to go on a business trip.

111
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,030
But now I need to go on a business trip with you!

112
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,280
I am really just too lucky!

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Please calm down right now. I will call Liu Dawei and ask him to take care of it.

114
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,500
Liu Dawei! Liu Dawei is the person who

115
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
hates me the most in this world!

116
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,810
If you call him, he will ignore you.

117
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,590
He will ditch me here and make me wait until the morning.

118
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,500
Please calm down a bit, Zhou Weiwei.

119
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,220
CEO Chu, you don't get to call the shots on everything.

120
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,060
I don't want to calm down!

121
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,140
I don't want to calm down!

122
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,000

If I'm discovered by my coworkers for using a dating app, that's embarrassing!

157
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,890
I am also using a dating app! How is that embarrassing?

158
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,550
Because I told our coworkers that there's a lot of women who go after me,

159
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,660
but actually--

160
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,700
But, actually, there isn't. Right?

161
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Based on your qualifications, the consumer response shouldn't be too bad.

162
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,700
How could this be?

163
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,150
Didn't you say you will show your strong biceps to me?

164
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,850
Where are they? Come on!

165
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,720
I don't know if my biceps will be enough for you.

166
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,500
I'll do my best.

167
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,150
What are you doing?

168
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,700
My back!

169
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Are you tired?

170
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,720
Tired?

171
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,720
I'll carry you.

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,980

You know.

192
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,570
Explain clearly.

193
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,660
Hey, you two are too much.

194
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,160
Brother Dawei has been waiting for a pain relief patch for his back, yet you're here drinking?

195
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,910
The patch is in there.

196
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,720
I thought it was you and him. How is it her and him?

197
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,460
What's important is your back. Let's fix up your back first.

198
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,210
But--

199
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,500
But? Don't you want to put on the patch?

200
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,860
<i>Yes.</i>

201
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,930
Tell me. Why are you thanking me?

202
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,120
Thank you...

203
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,590
Thank you for keeping me company.

204
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,230
Thanking me is not enough.

205
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,020
It's not enough.

206
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,290
There's still a little something missing.

207
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,190
Hello?

208
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,120
<i> Did I wake you up? </i>

209
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,690
<i>I called you this late because I was busy earlier. </i>

210
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,170
<i>Our progress had some issues</i>,

211
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,080
<i> so I probably won't be able to make it back this week. </i>

212
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,460
<i> I am working hard to fix it. </i>

213
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,770
<i> I'm sorry. Don't get mad. </i>

214
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,350
Okay, I understand.

215
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,220
Although I'm not wearing it on my hand,

216
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,120
but Haoyi's ring is here.

217
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,390
I've never taken it off.

218
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,950
I'm sorry.

219
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,540
Zhou Weiwei.

220
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,510
I know that you have been restraining yourself.

221
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,800
I am also working very hard to control myself.

222
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,020
But now, every day,

223
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,530
whenever I see you, I can't say anything. I can't even do anything.

224
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,540
This is completely contrary to my personality as Chu Kehuan.

225
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,620
Zhou Weiwei,

226
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,150
when will you face yourself?

227
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,790
I'm sorry.

228
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,800
We can only be friends.

229
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
We can only be friends.

230
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,160
We can only be friends.

231
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,180
Then, can we be the best of friends?

232
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,400
Best friends.

233
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,970
I'm sorry,

234
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,120
friend.

235
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,760
Your hair is messy.

236
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,100
Your jacket is off.

237
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,380
Your shirt is untucked?

238
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,170
Your body smells like Chu Kehuan!

239
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,940
Did the two of you just...?

240
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,260
No, we didn't do anything.

241
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,570
What do you mean nothing happened?

242
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,900
Did you guys do it yet?

243
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,270
No! I already cleared it up with him.

244
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,800
What did you say?

245
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,570
Friends. Best friends.

246
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,320
Chu Kehuan and I made the decision together.

247
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,620
So you are feeling a bit sad; a bit disappointed?

248
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,830
No, I just feel relaxed.

249
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,620
I'm going to sleep.

250
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:19,560
Okay, this is your decision. I have nothing to say.

254
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,230
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. Japan's airlines are in a big mess right now.

255
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,900
My uncle says even if he has the money, he can't buy a ticket back here.

256
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,510
It's okay. It's impossible to control situations like these.

257
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,980
The car is here. He will send you directly to the station so you can catch a bus.

258
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,310
Then, I will see you tomorrow at the office.

259

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,580
mean that I am dragged here to sleep with you. I clearly have a place to live.

Hello?

270
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,100
Eat noodles!

271
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,580
Miss, are you dating now?

272
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,030
What are you talking about?

273
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,360
That's not right. After I said so much,

274
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,590
you completely do not have any reactions! Are you living in your own little universe?

275
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,350
I was cooking noodles earlier. I didn't even hear what you said earlier.

276
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,810
Okay, continue to pretend.

277
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:12,190
Say it. When you went to Yilan the other day, what happened between you and Chu Kehuan?

278
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,030
In the pavilion, you were drinking and stargazing-

279
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,360
Nothing happened between Chu Kehuan and me. The two of us came to an agreement.

280
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,310
We will only be friends.

281
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,910
Being friends requires an agreement? That in itself is strange.

282
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,950
Then, why don't you agree to be enemies or strangers? Be honest!

283
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,540
Okay, I admit

284
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,970
I liked Chu Kehuan in the past.

285
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,410
I knew it! So the other day you--

286
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,120
No, we didn't!

287
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,830
In any case, the two of us came to an agreement.

288
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,890
Being friends, we can be friends forever.

289
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,360
Being lovers could imply that in the future we could never be friends.

290
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,870
So?

291
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,810
Only friends!

292
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,260
That's your excuse. Actually, you can find other ways, such as—

293
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,160
Do you even want to eat?

294
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,720
Oh, I'll eat!

295
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,580
In any case, I just don't believe you.

296
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,300
I don't believe you, I don't believe you!

297
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,750
As you wish!

298
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,720
Hi.

299
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,980
Good morning.

300
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,330
Good morning. Help me divide this up.

301
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,380
Drink this.

Coffee.<br><i>(Only for you, my friend.)</i>

303

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,800

305

- Good morning.<br>- Morning, Manager Zhou.

306
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,390
Wow, why are there such good treats today? There's even fruit. Who is it from?

307
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,080
Thinking needs some sugar.

308
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,050
Thank you, CEO Chu.

309
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,920
Manager, how come only you get coffee?

310
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,190
There's writing on it. Who wrote it?

311
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,060
- Only for you—<br>- My friend.

312
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,200
Who else would give it to her, other than me? Is this your seat?

313
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I'm sorry.

314
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,730
Only for you, my friend.

315
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,860
Only she will have my one and only unique love.

316
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,500
Isn't that so, CEO?

317
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,410
Oops, you guys are waiting for me to start the meeting? I'm sorry. Let's begin.

318
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,600
Okay. About our revenue, compared to last time...

319
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,190
All right. Please have Secretary Ding arrange it.

320
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,090
Regarding the time, I will completely cooperate with Chairman Wang.

321
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,390
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,070
You missed him again?

323
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,950
Yep, Chairman Wang's schedule continues to shift. I'm concerned that if this continues, there will be unexpected variables.

324
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,670
Perhaps Chairman Wang truly is busy.

325
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,390
I don't know, but it really doesn't feel right that the schedule keeps changing.

326
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,590
On top of that, it's difficult to get a handle on Chairman Wang's personality. He communicates only through his secretary, and we can't meet him in person.

327
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,290
It's hard to tell why he's interested in the project.

328
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,840
This won't do.

329
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,860
I need to come up with a way to meet Chairman Wang in person.

330
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,030
So you need to take a detour and make contact with Chairman Wang directly?

331
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,780
That would be Liu Dawei.

332
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,600
I thought of him, too.

333
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,140
I need to find time to talk to him in private.

334
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,480
You and Dawei aren't close. And you caused him to be yelled at by Jessica.

335
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,620
If I were Dawei, I wouldn't pay attention to you.

336
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,950
Then, I'll go.

337
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,510
Don't you feel guilty saying that?

338
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,450
All of Hualai knows that

339
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,130
Liu Dawei hates you the most.

340
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:34,290
Looks like the only person in this group who's suited to speak to Liu Dawei is me!

341
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,080
Is it only contacting him?

342
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,730
Of course, it's not just that. If I can kill two birds with one stone,

343
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,990
and gain points in my work and private life, then it's by my own ability.

344
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,880
Don't you worry about where I'm going to "come into contact" with him.

345
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,120
If you're willing to make that sacrifice, then we will have to trouble you to deal with Liu Dawei.

346
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,350
No problem. My strength as Han Kefei is reaching mission success.

347
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,940
I will definitely eat Liu Dawei up!

348
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,970
I'll be going first!

349
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,350
Han Kefei...

350
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,620
I'm going to work.

351
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,960
Zhou Weiwei, are you busy after work?

352
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,000
No.

353
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,990
Let's eat dinner together.

354
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,970
It's a dinner between good friends to simultaneously discuss work and fill up our stomachs.

355
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,600
Okay.

356
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,010
One for you.

357
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,470
One for me.

358
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,500
Let's each eat half so our feelings never grow apart.

359
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,260
Hold on. You said you're treating me to dinner, but we're sharing.

360
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,330
What's the point?

361
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm a woman. It's such a big bowl of dumplings. How can I finish it all?

362
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,630
It's not a problem if we each eat half.

363
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,510
I'll feed you some hot soup. If your body is warm, your heart will be, too.

364
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,500
Just say it directly. What's your motive behind treating me to dinner?

365
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,820
Have you always been so straightforward?

366
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,800
What a coincidence. I love men as straightforward as you.

367
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,170
This dumpling soup can be the first step for our reconciliation. Our gratitude and grudges of the past can be canceled.

368
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,700
Where is the gratitude in our past? There are only grudges, right?

369
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,610
Why are you being like this?

370
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,700
Don't you think we're like a little boy and girl?

371
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,960
The boy likes to bully the girl.

372
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,360
He'll lift her skirt and pull on her braids.

373
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,600
I've never lifted your skirt, and you don't have braids either.

374
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,050
Your uncle might invest in Hualai.

375
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,260
All of us are a part of Hualai. I am involved in this project, too.

376
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,800
Our relationship is getting deeper and deeper. Why is the smell of gunpowder so strong every time we meet?

377
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,880
Ha! I knew it.

378
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,230
You came for my uncle.

379
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm telling you honestly, your uncle, President Wang, is just my excuse.

380
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,390
You are the reason.

381
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,010
Everything I said in the past doesn't matter. I'll erase it for you with an eraser.

382
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,230
- From this day forward, we—<br>- Don't come near me.

383
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,150
What is it? I won't eat you.

384
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,270
Cow's intestine and ox's tongue.

385
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,880
I don't eat organs.

386
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,630
Are you a foreigner?

387
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,840
Fish chin.

388
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,560
Mackerel.

389
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,020
Short ribs and Iberian pork.

390
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,390
I eat that.

391
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,580
<i></i>

392
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,970
Cheers.

393
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,170
We forgot dessert. Do you want any?

394
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,120
Huh? You're still hungry?

395
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,330
After a meal, we have to eat dessert. Boss, one ice cream.

396
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,640
I'm saying it now. We're splitting today's bill.

397
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,750
Why?

398
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,520
I always do this with my friends.

399
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,650
Okay, let's split it.

400
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:40,710
Oh, right. The financial holding circle is hosting an event this weekend. Do you want to go with me?

401
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:46,390
No way. I'm the worst at handling social events with the upper class.

402
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,040
Also, what kind of identity should I go as if I went with you?

403
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,330
Hualai's project manager.

404
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,590
I want to take you to network with people from the financial holding circle.

405
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,050
You can also take this chance to introduce the company we both invest in.

406
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,410
That would be really helpful for future fund recruitments.

407
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,580
Forget it.

408
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,070
The pork intestine is ready. Do you want a little?

409
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,790
Try it.

410
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,460
Hello? Haoyi? Why are you calling so early?

411
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,660
Did something happen?

412
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,460
Nothing. But our company has fallen behind in some work.

413
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,960
<i>I may not be able to come back next week as I said originally.</i>

414
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,970
Weiwei, are you mad?

415
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,480
The plan was never meant to catch up with changes. I'll get used to it.

416
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,280
<i>Don't talk like that.</i>

417
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,570
I'm under a lot of pressure here, too.

418
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,990
Haoyi, let me ask you.

419
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,170
As long as I go along with your plan

420
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,130
and get used to your changes, does that make me a competent significant other?

421
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,150
Of course. What else?

422
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,410
<i>I'm happy that you've become independent in Taipei.</i>

423
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,890
Okay. I'm going to be late to work. That's all for now.

424
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,100
<i>Okay. Take care when you head out. I love you.</i>

425
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,610
Bye-bye.

426
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,080
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

427
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,150
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

428
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,570
<i>Wow! There's afternoon tea!</i>

429
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,770
- Wow, Sister Kefei treated us again?<br>- Sister Kefei?

430
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,670
- Yes!<br>- That's so nice!

431
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,950
Kefei loves to give. Just eat it. Why are you all talking so much?

432
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,100
Everyone, quickly thank your senior sister.

433
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,430
Thank you, senior sister!

434
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,020
What "senior sister"? It sounds so serious.

435
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,180
But you guys were able to have this afternoon tea all thanks to Dawei.

436
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,040
Ahh!

437
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,690
Then, Sister Kefei, are we having afternoon tea tomorrow as well?

438
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,630
What do you say?

439
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,050
The day after that?

440
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,920
Of course.

441
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,880
This afternoon tea has so much variety, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,

442
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,600
I'll be paying for it all. Life must be lived splendidly.

443
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,200
Wouldn't you say, Brother Dawei?

444
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,740
I'll thank you on behalf of the Research and Development Department then.

445
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,110
I have a meeting. Everyone enjoy.

446
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,310
Have a good meeting!

447
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,780
I don't believe that this long and deep hook of mine

448
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,810
won't be able to reel Dawei in.

449
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,180
Dawei doesn't seem to be into that tactic.

450
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,550
No way. I, Han Kefei, have never met

451
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,780
a man who fell in and was able to get out.

452
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,960
Han Kefei, this pair of "seniors" aren't the only thing on your body.

453
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,090
You should have something else, right?

454
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,310
If I don't use my upper body, so do I use my lower body?

455
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,780
No. There's also--

456
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,180
You can't be talking about being thoughtful?

457
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,260
What do you think you're doing? Say it.

458
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,290
Why are you so mean?

459
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,220
I saw that you didn't eat dinner at the company.

460
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,880
So I bought you dinner.

461
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,630
I'm leaving now.

462
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,500
Be careful on your way home. Bye-bye.

463
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,320
She changed.

464
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,650
Hello.

465
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,700
<i>You're so smart? You recognize my car.</i>

466
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,400
Where are you?

467
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,110
<i>Behind you.</i>

468
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,120
Why are you here?

469
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,380
I waited for you.

470
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,520
Waited for me? Why?

471
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,530
This is for you.

472
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,110
Even though we're friends, I can't just accept a gift.

473
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,180
I knew you would say that.

474
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,450
This isn't a gift from me. It's for your company.

475
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,170
I prepared it especially for you.

476
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,110
This is--

477
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,850
Cocktail dress.

478
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,960
It's not flamboyant, but most importantly, no one will overlook your presence.

479
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,280
It suits you very well. I looked for a long time.

480
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,620
How are you so sure that it suits me?

481
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,380
I chose it based on my first impression of you.

482
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,390
You're not dramatic, yet you're very eye-catching.

483
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,210
Look at the shoes.

484
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Size 38.

485
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,610
I paid attention when we went camping.

486
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,040
Try it and see if it fits.

487
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,550
If it doesn't fit, I'll take it back.

488
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,020
I can do it myself.

489
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,650
Let me do it.

490
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,190
Come.

491
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,970
Try walking.

492
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,420
Friend.

493
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,510
Don't forget. We're just--

494
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,290
Good friends.

495
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,870
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

496
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,250
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

497
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,200
I sincerely believe that I have good taste.

498
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,650
I picked such a pretty dress.

499
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,430
And made such a pretty friend.

500
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,960
Thank you.

501
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,720
But honestly, I don't feel confident about today's party.

502
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,930
Don't be scared. Stay with me and you'll be okay.

503
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,510
Get in.

504
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,720
We'll go over there.

505
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,240
Did I look really foolish just then?

506
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,590
No, foolish is also a characteristic.

507
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:21,760
What are you talking about?

508
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,430
If you have a characteristic, everyone will remember you.

509
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:29,300
You're already doing really well. Don't let yourself become a sales assistant at the first meeting.

510
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,460
I'm not Han Kefei.

511
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:34,430
What do we do now?

512
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,700
Over there.

513
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,530
Relax. Don't be so nervous.

514
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,490
Madam.

515
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,490
Kehuan.

516
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,950
Weiwei, what a coincidence.

517
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,940
Yes. Let me introduce to you, Madam.

518
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,480
This is Zhou Weiwei, the project manager from Hualai with whom I've been collaborating.

519
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,690
Hello, Madam.

520
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,010
These feathers are beautiful.

521
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,380
- Thank you.<br>- Kehuan,

522
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,200
I have something to talk to you about. Come with me.

523
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,430
I'll go for a bit.

524
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,390
- How have you been lately?<br>- I have been all right.

525
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:47,800
The time for preparing for the wedding has lengthened. I guess you're not under as much stress then.

526
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,530
Haoyi called me.

527
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:56,310
He told me that he wants the scale of the wedding to be even bigger. I'm really envious.

528
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,120
Ziyuan.

529
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,200
I broke up with Kehuan.

530
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,000
Seeing your expression, I'm guessing that you already knew.

531
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:15,190
Actually, I never thought that I would be able to calmly face this matter.

532
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,310
We were together for 10 years.

533
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,490
A lot of people are worried that I can't take it.

534
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,600
But don't worry. I'm really okay.

535
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,300
I didn't want to say it before

536
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,740
because I was scared that if I said it out loud, it would really happen.

537
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:42,390
After, I realized that even if I didn't say it, it was the truth.

538
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,360
In these past 10 years, I've always been reliant on him.

539
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,360
I saw him as the center of my life.

540
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,350
I didn't have my own life.

541
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:02,590
Because I lost myself, I lost Kehuan.

542
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,140
Congratulations.

543
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:15,190
Congratulations? Congratulations for what?

544
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:19,210
Because you are very brave to face yourself.

545
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,660
Not everyone has that kind of courage.

546
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,320
Since you're congratulating me, I would like to send you a blessing.

547
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,580
I bless that you'll soon find your own—

548
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,810
how should I say it— position?

549
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,360
No, that's not right.

550
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,710
I should say, your interpersonal relations.

551
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:05,450
Of course, I am still very thankful to you for becoming my first client.

552
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:11,430
I was able to start my new life. I'm very much looking forward to your and Haoyi's wedding.

553
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,120
I'll head over.

554
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:00,260
What did Ziyuan say to you?

555
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:07,780
Nothing. Men don't need to know the gossip between women.

556
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,590
She definitely told you something.

557
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,110
You're overthinking.

558
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,350
<i>Kehuan!</i>

559
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,930
<i>Come here!</i>

560
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,740
Excuse me! Please step aside.

561
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,790
<i>What happened?</i>

562
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,900
Hurry, and take her to the hospital.

563
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,380
<i>Come.</i>

564
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,420
Stand up.

565
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,620
<i>I bless that you'll soon</i>

566
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,360
<i>find your own interpersonal relations.</i>

567
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,120
<i>Don't forget. We're just--</i>

568
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,870
<i>good friends.</i>

569
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,130
<i>We can only be friends.</i>

570
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,020
<i>Only friends.</i>

571
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,070
Hello? How is Ziyuan?

572
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:06,960
She has acute appendicitis. They are operating now.

573
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,420
Thankfully, it's just appendicitis.

574
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,580
Where are you? I'll come and get you.

575
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:20,790
There's no need. <i>You're at the hospital. Take care of Ziyuan.</i>

576
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,740
I brought you out today.

577
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,940
<i>At least let me send you home.</i>

578
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,310
I'm already in front of my place.

579
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:38,360
Ziting is almost here. When she comes, I'll get you.

580
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,140
Actually, you and Ziyuan were together for ten years.

581
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,050
<i>It's natural to take care of her.</i>

582
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,850
Weiwei.

583
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,900
Don't worry. I'm home.

584
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,470
After her operation, I'll find time to go see her.

585
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,060
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

586
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,210
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

587
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,180
Kehuan.

588
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,490
You're awake? How are you?

589
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,810
Kehuan.

590
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,180
Our 10 years of feelings

591
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,450
don't lie after all.

592
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,240
I'm already lying on the hospital bed.

593
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,680
Must you still treat me so coldly?

594
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,760
Close your eyes then and have a good rest.

595
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:18,240
Why are you so cruel to me?

596
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,490
You don't know why?

597
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,590
I'm sorry.

598
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,140
Kehuan, I'm sorry.

599
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,730
Don't speak. Rest well.

600
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,410
I know that that situation

601
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,140
made you unhappy.

602
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,400
But I had a reason.

603
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,050
Ziyuan,

604
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,570
did you know that what you destroyed was something I looked forward to?

605
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,960
It was a dream in my heart.

606
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:25,730
What does a man work so hard for? It's for a family.

607
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,900
I'm sorry for not being clear with you at that time, but it was our child.

608
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,630
Did you ever ask me?

609
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,720
You got rid of the child just like that.

610
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,960
Do you know what you destroyed?

611
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,900
You destroyed our future

612
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,940
and our relationship.

613
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,170
Kehuan,

614
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,900
the abortion...

615
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,740
Actually, that time I wasn't preg—

616
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,310
Sis, are you okay?

617
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:34,840
Your sister just underwent surgery. She's weak.

618
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,310
Brother Kehuan, thank you for bringing her.

619
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:44,710
If there's nothing else, you can go back and rest. I'll take care of my sister.

620
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:49,720
Appendicitis is not that serious. Rest a few days and she'll be okay.

621
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,080
I'll ask the doctor if any problems come up.

622
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,720
Okay, then I'll find time to come visit again.

623
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,180
There's no need.

624
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,820
You're so busy. I'll find a nurse to watch over her.

625
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,040
Brother Kehuan, I'll walk you out.

626
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,290
Don't come to see her anymore.

627
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,620
She is precisely using being sick to tie you to her side, can you not see that at all?

628
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,970
I know.

629
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:42,170
Let's do this. I'll take care of all the fees.

630
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,940
There's no need. I can cover my sister's hospital fees.

631
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,870
I don't want to owe you.

632
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:56,400
Ziting, can you not act like we're unfamiliar?

633
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,050
You and my sister should act like this.

634
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,860
Didn't we agree to not even be family?

635
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,270
You can't go back.

636
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:08,770
Until my sister gives up on you, you can't even be friends.

637
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:13,080
From beginning to end, the problem was with her, not you.

638
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:18,980
If you really want to help her, then don't be involved with her anymore.

639
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,540
Please.

640
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,270
Miss Zhou, there is a registered letter for Mr. Li.

641
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,050
Thank you.

642
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,810
I haven't seen Mr. Li recently. Is he working overtime?

643
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,150
He went on a business trip.

644
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,760
Thank you.

645
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,130
- Hello?<br>- <i>Weiwei.</i>

646
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,810
I'm sorry, I confirmed that I can't come home.

647
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,890
I understand.

648
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,470
<i>Then, I'll go take a shower.</i>

649
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,930
Okay. Bye bye.

650
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:22,240
<i></i>

651
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,950
Can I get a flight?

652
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:32,640
Of course, but it's very expensive.

653
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,780
Why are you in such a hurry?

654
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,670
Mrs. Li doesn't need a reason to go see Mr. Li.

655
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:44,100
Stop it. What's the big hurry?

656
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,140
I suddenly thought it through. Haoyi and I

657
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,820
definitely have some problems.

658
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:01,180
I think that we need to face them and resolve them.

659
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:05,530
That's the attitude I need to have in my relationship.

660
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,640
If these were the ancient times, I would issue a chastity arch for you.

661
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,910
If you can't get a flight, would you go to the ocean and become the Amah Rock?<br><i>(T/N: Legend about a faithful wife who would wait for her fisherman husband who had drowned at sea.)</i>

662
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:19,240
Stop joking. I'm serious.

663
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,720
Then, Jessica--

664
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,950
Don't worry. I'll take care of Jessica.

665
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,230
Kefei, you're the best. Thank you.

666
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,960
Okay, give me a kiss.

667
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:43,060
I love you. You love me. The plane ticket.

668
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,620
What airline do you want?

669
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,120
This one.

670
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:54,690
Zhou Weiwei told me last time that she didn't want to participate.

671
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,930
Now, she's taking a vacation, and a long one.

672
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:01,940
What is this situation now? Is she the Hualai boss or shareholder?

673
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:07,080
Jessica, it's really hard to be separated from her fiance.

674
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,400
Zhou Weiwei is now looking for her husband far away. Don't you think that it's very romantic?

675
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,150
A saying from the ancients, one has to regulate the family and rule the state to pacify the country;

676
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:18,570
she has to take care of personal matters before work.

677
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:24,450
Otherwise, you can take her vacation out of my salary. That's okay, right?

678
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:28,470
CEO Chu, do you agree with me?

679
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,870
Don't try to get CEO Chu on your side.

680
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:37,320
CEO Chu, I'm sorry that our internal matters are affecting this case.

681
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,970
It's okay. It's not affecting it.

682
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,700
That's right. Our CEO Chu is very capable.

683
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,220
Meiling and I are still here. Don't worry.

684
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:53,080
Meiling, you've been at this company for so long. Show us what you can do.

685
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,870
Later, you will go up and give the report in Weiwei's place. Are you okay to do it?

686
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,360
Okay.

687
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,420
<i>I already told you. When I'm done here, I'll go back to Taipei and we'll get married. What else do you want me to say?</i>

688
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,750
<i>I don't want to be an idiot who doesn't know anything</i>

689
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,570
<i>and gets my whole life manipulated by you!</i>

690
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,670
<i>Who's manipulating you?</i>

691
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,540
<i>I just want to get married. Am I wrong?</i>

692
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,300
<i>Am I going overboard?</i>

693
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,750
<i>When you need me,</i>

694
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,790
<i>I'll always be here.</i>

695
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:37,310
<i>♫ Closing the door, returning to real life ♫</i>

696
