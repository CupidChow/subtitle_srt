00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>The male lead is here!</i>

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,260
<i>No matter what you want, I will do my absolute best to cooperate with you. Will that do?</i>

16
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>Don't be like this, okay?</i>

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,480
<i>Yes, I admit that I like Weiwei, but I took all of the initiative. She never accepted me,</i>

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>so Weiwei didn't betray you. Okay?</i>

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,830
<i>When you weren't home,</i>

20
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,760
<i>we slept with each other in every corner of the house!</i>

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,340
<i>Are you satisfied now?</i>

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>This slap is on Kehuan's behalf!</i>

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,670
<i>This slap is from me!</i>

<i>I've been working so hard to protect him, yet you managed to ruin him in one day!</i>

25
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,680
Now everyone thinks that we have slept together.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Now we can be public about our relationship. Isn't that better?

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,710
Chu Kehuan, we haven't slept together before.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,870
But no one knows.

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,190
Hey, everyone thinks we have already slept together.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,910
And it turns out that we haven't slept together before?

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,750
If it's like that, I've been wronged and it's really unjust. Doesn't that mean I've suffered losses?

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,260
What are you laughing about?

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,260
How about it? Do you want to let the misunderstanding become a reality?

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,470
Zhou Weiwei,

35
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,260
I was joking.

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,620
I know that after being disturbed by Li Haoyi the whole day,

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,140
you must be really stressed and annoyed.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,090
I just hope that you can relax for a bit.

39
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,390
Otherwise, how will you live each day?

40
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,580
Don't worry! I won't force you like Li Haoyi.

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,320
I just hope you can remember,

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,130
that what I said still counts.

43
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,550
As long as you need me,

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,060
I will always be here.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,840
Does it hurt?

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,880
It hurts. After you touched it, it hurts more.

47
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't forget. We are just friends.

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, okay. That's right.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,170
We are just friends.

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,170
NT$8,000,000. I can't even kiss you?

51
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,550
How would it be so cheap? And I didn't even receive it.

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,120
NT$8,000,000.

53
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,440
NT$32,000,000 became NT$24,000,000.

54
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,800
Li Haoyi took it all to increase the loan. Don't you think I suffered a loss?

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,750
Then, wouldn't I have suffered a bigger loss?

56
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,590
Wake up!

57
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,780
Good morning. Is my sofa comfortable to sleep on?

58
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,370
Morning.

59
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,840
It isn't the most comfortable, but it's not bad.

60
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Then come over often.

61
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,370
Next time, if you have guts, sleep in her room, not on the sofa.

62
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,190
That would require her consent.

63
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,730
I would also like to sleep on the bed, not the sofa. But if she doesn't want it, what can I do?

64
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,790
<i>Weiwei, wake up for work! It's time to wake up.</i>

65
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,530
I'm off to work. See you later.

66
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,130
Bye-bye.

67
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,750
He left?

68
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,160
You're acting so natural.

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,910
One slept on the bed, the other on the sofa.

70
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,770
Don't tell me that last night nothing happened. Did you guys do it?

71
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,930
I'm too lazy to talk to you.

72
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,520
Do you two really need to be so reserved?

73
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,930
One pretends to be Virgin Mary, and the other pretends to be a saint.

74
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,760
Come on! From the room to the sofa,

75
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,110
it takes one second to run and three seconds to walk.

76
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,200
And for these three seconds, you wasted an entire night?

77
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,170
It's because last night he drank a little and couldn't drive,

78
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,160
so I let him sleep on the sofa for a night. It's just that.

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,890
You guys even drank? You drank and nothing happened?

80
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,930
You don't know that alcohol is used to—

81
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,980
Used to do what?

82
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,430
Used to develop feelings.

83
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,120
<i>(Zhou Weiwei's Cheating Scandal, Behind-the-Scenes Gossip Group: There are three new messages.)</i>

84
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,980
Idiots.

85
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,230
Do you want to take the day off?

86
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,900
Why would I take a day off?

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,800
After such a big situation, the company must be chaotic.

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,970
First, take two days off to let things blow over.

89
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,790
There's no need.

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,410
Are you sure?

91
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,320
Of course.

92
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,940
I don't want to let what they say

93
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,590
make me give up and take days off work,

94
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,790
and even resign.

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,660
Then, doesn't that mean I've lost?

96
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,680
I am now Zhou Weiwei 2.0.

97
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,280
Whatever I want to do, I will do.

98
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,590
I call the shots on every decision.

99
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,780
That's very good! Zhou Weiwei 2.0

100
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,220
sounds very formidable.

101
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,000
Good luck! I hope you can preserve and stick it out! Ah!

102
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,850
What's wrong?

103
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,010
I forgot!

104
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,230
I forgot I need to call an important client, but my phone ran out of batteries.

105
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,530
- Let me borrow your phone. Is it in your room? <br> - Mhm.

106
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,760
Your phone has that many secrets that you've locked it? What's your passcode?

107
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
I don't use a password. I use a pattern. Give it to me.

108
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,590
Then, how do you draw it? Just tell me. Is it like this? Or is it like that?

109
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,590
- Just give it to me, it'll be faster. <br> - Wait, I'll do it for you. Just tell me how.

110
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,500
- If I unlock it, it'll be faster. <br> - No, it won't. Just tell me how to do it. You're really weird.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,970
- I don't know how to explain it. How would I know how to explain it. <br> - That's not it.

112
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sorry! It wasn't on purpose. I'll pick it up for you.

113
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,960
Oops! It's broken. Sorry.

114
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,030
This type of phone has a screen of 6.3 cm.

115
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,850
The resolution is 3120 x 1440.

116
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,230
It is making use of the CPU of ARMCortex-A76.

117
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,160
As a whole, its performance has increased by 75 percent,

118
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,860
and its overall efficacy has increased by 58 percent.

119
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,990
Are you trying to do a new technology press conference or are you giving me a presentation?

120
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,860
Or are you acting as a blogger that writes on cell phone unboxing experiences?

121
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,330
With you explaining it like that, who would understand?

122
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,030
Apologies. Would you give me another chance?

123
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,390
This phone's complete features will be better than the last generation.

124
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,820
The battery life will be longer. It's biggest distinguishing feature is

125
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,220
its ultra-wide-angle, Leica triple-lens camera.

126
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,830
Here, smile! So pretty!

127
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,510
With such a beautifying camera feature, can you not buy it?

128
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,320
Just buy it!

129
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,530
Let's go. I'll buy it and change the SIM card.

130
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,350
Don't do that. Don't you think that right now

131
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,720
your ears have peace and quiet? Put it in a little later.

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,050
Kefei, I received your good intentions.

133
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,150
- You don't want me to see those messages, but I've already seen them. <br> - Huh?

134
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,010
Then, why did I say so much?

135
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,740
How did you see those messages? Didn't you go to sleep already?

136
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,860
Yesterday, those messages in the group chat were so noisy. How could I sleep?

137
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,740
Are you okay?

138
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,120
Are you sure you want to go to work today? Can you handle it?

139
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,630
I have you here. You're one against a hundred.

140
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,890
And I am now Zhou Weiwei version 2.0.

141
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,800
There's nothing to be worried about.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,800
<i>Boss!</i>

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,650
Unlike some people who can make NT $8,000,000 so easily.

144
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,930
If you don't know, then stop spouting nonsense.

145
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,540
Did I say it was you?

146
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,170
Forget it.

147
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,020
- He looks so irritating. <br> - Seriously.

148
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,270
Which department is he from?

149
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,960
Just ignore them.

150
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,710
I'm going to start working.

151
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,130
Don't think too much. Good luck!

152
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,360
Don't worry. Go!

153
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,930
What's up?

154
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,550
Let me ask you. Do you really need to be like this?

155
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,880
Like what? Yes,

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,790
I want to be a good person. I really want to be a good person.

157
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,800
We're on the ground, not on the roof. Are you trying to reenact <i>Infernal Affairs</i>?

158
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,660
Don't you think the vibe is very similar?

159
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,630
Don't think that pretending to be stupid will confuse me.

160
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,150
I know you and 321 are very close, but do you really need to paint Zhou Weiwei in such a bad light?

161
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,810
First, I didn't create that group chat.

162
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,310
Second, no one added me into that group chat.

163
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,510
So I don't understand whatever you are talking about right now. You don't trust me?

164
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,050
Here, you can see it yourself.

165
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,380
Look clearly. Is there a group chat?

166
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,100
I am already very pitiful right now.

167
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,900
Right now, the entire company thinks I used my connections to steal Team 1's project.

168
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,190
In the R&amp;D Department, I am number one on their blacklist.

169
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,210
AKA: Number 1 Traitor.

170
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,960
Right now in the office, no one wants to gossip with me. That's fine.

171
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,120
They don't even invite me for collective buying opportunities.

172
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,330
I really don't know why I'm coming to the office right now.

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,810
What are you looking at!

174
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,800
You really are perverted.

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,880
Who do you want to send those photos to?

176
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,560
Why would I tell you?

177
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,900
If you don't want to tell me, then it's fine.

178
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,940
Hey, hey, hey! Hold on!

179
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,170
So, from the beginning, you wanted to help Zhou Weiwei and were made the scapegoat.

180
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,760
Then... you had nothing with CEO Chu?

181
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,330
Exactly how many hundreds of times do you want me to explain it?

182
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,520
Do you really need me to admit that I don't have as much charisma as my sister,

183
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,350
and I lost in stealing a man?

184
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,830
That's right! I didn't get laid.

185
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,230
What's wrong? I lost! Are you satisfied? Make fun of me!

186
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,020
If... having loyalty means you are charismatic,

187
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,200
then I really think you are charming.

188
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,640
You know there's an idiom that says

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,530
"If there's no common ground, a single word is a waste of breath." Goodbye!

190
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,530
Good morning.

191
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,630
Good morning.

192
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,120
Good morning.

193
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,000
Apologies. There was a sudden notice that the meeting was shifted an hour earlier. On our side, it was a bit rushed.

194
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,720
Everyone is here? Apologies.

195
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,120
- Your spot is in the back. <br> - Are the seats named?

196
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,030
Isn't the R&amp;D team in the back?

197
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,550
It's okay. Liu Dawei, you just sit there.

198
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,440
Get up. Hurry and get up.

199
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
I said, sit down properly.

200
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,600
First, I would like to give my apologies to Executive Assistant Gao.

201
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Yesterday, there were some issues that came up, so we needed to suddenly reschedule to today.

202
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,980
You're such a forgiving person. Thank you for coming back last minute.

203
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,560
Then, let's not waste our time and get started.

204
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,370
Meiling, start with the personnel distribution report.

205
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,750
Hold on, not everyone is present. Once everyone is here, we can start.

206
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,540
Everyone is present. Let's begin.

207
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,180
I said to wait a bit.

208
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,100
Apologies everyone.

209
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,900
I didn't know that the meeting was shifted up an hour earlier, so I arrived late.

210
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,390
These are materials I received from the R&amp;D team. Take a look, everyone.

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,750
Hey, Zhou Weiwei. We don't need you here anymore.

212
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,180
It's enough with Meiling here.

213
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,930
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

214
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,940
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

215
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,380
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

216
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,620
Sit here.

217
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,670
Zhou Weiwei, we don't need you here anymore.

218
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,190
It's enough with Meiling here.

219
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,850
I am responsible for this special project.

220
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,370
This is also my job.

221
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,650
You're just a PM.

222
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,450
Your job can be done by anyone.

223
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,090
I recommend that Meiling be responsible for this special project in the future.

224
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,220
- Jessica. <br> - Huh? <br> - You can ask her to leave.

225
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,550
Manager Zhou isn't an ordinary PM.

226
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,320
She's a PM that investor Chairman Wang appointed.

227
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,460
Liu Dawei and Han Kefei were present and can testify.

228
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,540
So I'm worried that if Zhou Weiwei isn't working on this special project,

229
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,470
then because of this, the investor can pull out.

230
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,130
Executive Assistant Gao, do you want this to happen?

231
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,100
But I am very insistent.

232
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,840
Zhou Weiwei's private conduct has already severely impacted the progress of this special project.

233
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,330
Even more so, she has severely impacted Hualai's, Guoxin's,

234
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,460
and the future subsidiary's reputation.

235
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,640
So I personally strongly advise

236
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,830
Jessica, not only does Zhou Weiwei need to leave this special project,

237
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,040
she would also need to leave your company. This is what's best for everyone.

238
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
Guoxin's Executive Assistant is interfering with Hualai's internal human resources?

239
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,100
Aren't you meddling in too much?

240
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,050
What's more, I am supposed to be completely responsible for the subsidiary.

241
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,440
At present, I strongly oppose Zhou Weiwei leaving this special project.

242
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
CEO Chu!

243
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,750
Executive Assistant Gao, you should know your limits!

244
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,390
Then, if I'm very insistent?

245
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,410
Meiling, excuse me.

246
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,160
Sit down.

247
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,770
Sit down.

248
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,340
Executive Assistant Gao, if you are insistent on Zhou Weiwei leaving this special project,

249
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,500
then please call the Chairman.

250
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,300
Tell him that I, Chu Kehuan, will promptly leave this special project.

251
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,220
At the same time, I will leave Guoxin.

252
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,790
Are you trying to target me with this?

253
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,420
It's you who was targeting me and Zhou Weiwei from the beginning.

254
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,180
Are you afraid to strike? Okay.

255
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,920
Now, I would like to announce that the preparatory office for the subsidiary company is formally established. James,

256
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,600
find the new office at the quickest by next Wednesday.

257
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,680
Understood, CEO Chu.

258
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,840
Everyone who is related to this project will be transferred to the new office.

259
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,420
Isn't next Wednesday too rushed?

260
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,160
Have you made a report to the parent company yet?

261
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,370
Aren't I giving you a report right now?

262
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,300
You can convey this to the parent company.

263
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,890
And I am supposed to be completely in charge of the subsidiary.

264
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,180
You are just trying to use your public authority to obtain private interests.

265
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,000
If you want to say that I'm using my public authority to obtain private interests, that's fine. Calling me a knight in shining armor is also fine.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,230
Executive Assistant Gao, you are free to believe whatever you want.

267
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,390
We have already wasted too much time. Manager Zhou, please begin your report.

268
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,990
Chu Kehuan!

269
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,400
What is up with you? Did you really not see me or are you actually treating me like air?

270
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,190
I really want to treat you like air.

271
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,760
What exactly do you want? Do you really need every situation to be made bigger for you to be happy?

272
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,710
The person who made things worse is you. Don't have so much intent on being adversarial.

273
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,150
Things can actually be progressing very smoothly and satisfactory.

274
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,380
Do you know that you and Zhou Weiwei's matter

275
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,530
has spread to <i>the entire parent company? </i>

276
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,760
<i> It's me who is working hard to say good things about you in front of the General Manager.</i>

277
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Otherwise, it wouldn't just be hard to guarantee your position as CEO in the subsidiary.

278
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,060
Even your position as the CEO of the venture capital firm won't be protected.

279
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,940
<i> Stop being unable to put aside your private feelings for work. Otherwise, I will be unable to guarantee anything else. </i>

280
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,410
I never needed you to guarantee anything for me.

281
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,810
Even more so, I don't need you to protect my position.

282
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,460
<i> - Earlier in the office, I already said it. </i> <br> <i> - We should go try that hot pot place, it's— </i>

283
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,290
<i>You can call the people above to fire me.</i>

284
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,660
But as long as I'm in this spot for another day,

285
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,640
don't think about touching Zhou Weiwei.

286
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,310
Or else, I will let you know who the extra person in this project is.

287
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,570
What's wrong? <i> Who do you want to call? The Chairman? The General Manager? </i>

288
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,290
<i>Or your favorite, the General Manager's wife?</i> I have all their numbers, too.

289
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,600
Chu Kehuan, you will pay for your stubborn behavior.

290
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

291
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
Weiwei, let's go.

292
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,590
CEO Chu, your actions just now, so cool! So great!

293
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,680
What's so great? It's amazing!

294
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,280
We need to celebrate later. Celebrate CEO Chu teaching Gao Ziyuan a lesson. What should we eat?

295
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,110
- Hot pot? <br> - Okay.

296
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,770
You guys go eat. I won't go.

297
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,530
CEO Chu, let's go together.

298
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,610
No, thanks.

299
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,890
What the heck? Then let's go...

300
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,580
- This way? <br> - This way?

301
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,970
Okay, okay. This way, this way. Let's go.

302
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,660
Weiwei, let's eat together.

303
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,860
I still have work to do in the afternoon. I'll just go to the local mart and buy something simple to eat.

304
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,500
I had a feeling.

305
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,330
After the meeting, you've been intentionally keeping a distance from me.

306
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,250
Yes, keeping a distance is the safest.

307
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,220
<i>Weiwei, dad is in Taipei.</i>

308
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,380
<i>Do you have time to meet after you get off work?</i>

309
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,830
You tell me. You guys were perfectly fine before.

310
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,460
Weiwei went to Shanghai once and then you guys broke up?

311
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,920
Do you have a lady in Shanghai?

312
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,780
I don't!

313
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,630
Then, what's the reason?

314
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,350
It's because...

315
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,220
Tell me!

316
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,160
I used the house as collateral and didn't tell Weiwei.

317
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,100
She became angry when she found out later.

318
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,320
Are you stupid?

319
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,540
Of course, you have to discuss this kind of matter with her first.

320
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,000
She's your other half; you two are of one body.

321
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,090
You made a decision yourself without her consent.

322
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,260
Of course, she'll feel disrespected and angry.

323
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,380
How come you don't even know this basic principle of interaction with your other half?

324
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,710
How did I have a stupid son like you?

325
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,410
With your mom and I, she always handles the small matters and I handle the big matters.

326
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,970
Do you know what a big matter is?

327
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,590
What?

328
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,330
There are no big matters! They're all small matters! Your mom makes all the decisions!

329
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,320
You better apologize well later. If you can't get Weiwei back, I'll beat you to death!

330
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,750
Quickly come in! Quickly come in! Come in!

331
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,990
Quickly, sit, sit. Sit down.

332
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,720
I'll go get you a glass of water.

333
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,800
No need, uncle.

334
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,260
You changed so quickly to call me uncle already?

335
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,710
Come. Sit.

336
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,190
Haoyi, this child, is not sensible. He's dim-witted.

337
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,240
He does whatever he wants to do and had no regard for your feelings.

338
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,510
I already scolded him just now and he knows he's wrong.

339
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,260
Hurry and apologize.

340
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,090
Uncle, no need.

341
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,140
In love, no one's right or wrong.

342
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,480
What are you huh-ing for? What attitude is this? Stand up!

343
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,400
Even Weiwei is so magnanimous. She's not even taking it to heart anymore. And you still won't apologize? Apologize!

344
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,390
I didn't do anything wrong! Why should I apologize?

345
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,570
Such a good girl like Weiwei, you didn't cherish her.

346
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,470
Do you really need to get her to walk off in anger before you're satisfied?

347
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,750
Why do you always think the problem is me?

348
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,160
Why don't you ask her what she did?

349
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:21,050
Uncle! Both people carry responsibility in a breakup.

350
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,140
I also have done wrong. We did our best.

351
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,690
Right now, we just want to separate amicably.

352
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,760
Separate amicably?

353
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,070
So, now you also want my dad to think I treat you unfairly;

354
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,790
that I wronged you, that I'm selfish?

355
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,920
Do you have the courage to say what you did?

356
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,840
- I'll teach you a lesson! <br> - Uncle!

357
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,680
He's in a fit of anger right now. Once his anger subsides, we can talk. I'll leave first.

358
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,930
- Hey, hey. <br> - Go then!

359
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,150
How much longer are you going to play the victim?

360
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,870
Even if you let the whole world think I'm the bad guy,

361
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,270
you're the most innocent, the most virtuous. But in reality?

362
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,440
Li Haoyi, that's enough!

363
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Say it! Why aren't you saying it?

364
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,460
Why aren't you admitting it?

365
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,390
You don't dare say it in front of my dad, right? Say it!

366
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,100
What exactly do you want her to say?

367
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,160
Why do you keep asking me? Why aren't you asking her?

368
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,420
Why aren't you admitting it? Why aren't you telling my dad

369
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,510
what exactly you did in this house?

370
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,310
Tell him!

371
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,620
I got in bed with another man here. Is this what you wanted me to say?

372
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,730
You want me to tell your dad. You want me to admit it, right?

373
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,700
Yes! I admit it that in this house,

374
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,160
a place where we both worked so hard to buy to call home,

375
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,070
I was in bed with someone else!

376
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,300
Are you happy now? Are you?

377
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,770
Dad, you heard it all.

378
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,120
This is the truth.

379
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:22,570
Uncle, this is what happened. I wronged him.

380
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,620
This is the real reason why we broke up.

381
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,430
I'm sorry to have made you disappointed in me.

382
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,410
Weiwei... Zhou... Miss Zhou.

383
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,380
I used to really want you to be my daughter-in-law,

384
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,970
but... but I'm still quite traditional.

385
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,760
Since you two can no longer continue down this path then let's just end it here.

386
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,240
Regarding the house, I'll have Haoyi handle it as soon as possible.

387
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,000
We'll discuss whether we should sell it or buy your portion of it.

388
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,290
Well, in any case, we definitely won't owe you anything.

389
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Let's go with what Uncle said.

390
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,540
Since you've broken up, we'll have to make things clear.

391
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,410
Make things extremely clear so there's no misunderstanding in the future.

392
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,390
I'll leave now.

393
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,290
How did I have such a stupid son like you?

394
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,290
You made the whole world know such an awkward matter.

395
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,360
I initially didn't plan to say it.

396
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,680
Is it better for me to know?

397
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,200
Is it better now?

398
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,940
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

399
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,920
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

400
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,360
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

401
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,160
How is it? Did you handle your family affairs?

402
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,050
Relationship problems can't be resolved in just one or two days.

403
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,290
I can understand this as well.

404
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,690
I'm also not trying to interfere.

405
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,610
But if you still don't come back to work,

406
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,160
saying you're using special privileges is a small matter.

407
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,410
If I find someone to replace you, that'll be a big problem for you.

408
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,760
Sister Maizi, I've actually been thinking a lot these days.

409
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,120
I'm afraid that with my current condition,

410
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,720
I might not be able to focus on work.

411
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,580
Are you really threatening me with you resigning?

412
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,010
Just that... me and my girl...

413
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,560
Weiwei and I, if we continue to live separated,

414
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,160
I'm afraid our distance will get bigger over time.

415
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,150
I won't have the chance to restore it when the time comes.

416
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,840
What's the situation of you two right now?

417
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,810
She returned the ring to me.

418
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,420
So the biggest problem between the two of you is the long distance?

419
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,000
This is one of the main reasons.

420
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,880
Okay, this is the matter I wanted to discuss with you today.

421
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,320
You can stay in Taiwan.

422
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,930
No need to return to Shanghai.

423
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,260
It's so spacious here.

424
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,800
Besides, the most important thing is that your ears will have peace and quiet;

425
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,060
you can't hear that idle gossip.

426
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,810
CEO Chu is so intelligent.

427
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:31,230
Unexpectedly, he has committed himself irrevocably and decided to change to a new office.

428
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,390
It was all to protect you, am I right?

429
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,080
Why aren't you saying anything?

430
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,240
You have to be happy when you come to this new environment.

431
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,370
Give us a smile?

432
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,670
Meiling, where's CEO Chu? He's still not at work?

433
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,020
I don't know either.

434
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,990
Could it be that because he established this preparatory office,

435
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,740
Gao Ziyuan really reported everything to the parent company?

436
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,640
So, CEO Chu is being scolded by the higher-ups?

437
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,660
Why don't you call and ask?

438
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,980
What's the use of me calling? Even if he is being scolded, that's not something I can handle.

439
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,590
Yeah, aren't you meddling in too much?

440
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,480
CEO Chu is Weiwei's boyfriend,

441
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,320
she's not worried so why are you worrying?

442
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,140
He's not my boyfriend.

443
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,540
You already broke up with Haoyi for him.

444
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,570
Plus, you slept with him in every corner of the house.

445
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,210
This doesn't count as being in a relationship?

446
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,250
Liu Dawei, sleeping together means being in a relationship?

447
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,330
Wow! As the Alishan Holy Tree, how long will you—

448
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,760
You clearly know that's not what I meant.

449
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,770
Our relationship is quite variable and quite wonderful.

450
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,310
But Weiwei is not the same. When she sleeps with someone,

451
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,990
then that means she has feelings for him.

452
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,450
And you know that how?

453
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,030
This way, please.

454
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,460
Executive Assistant!

455
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,440
This is our temporary preparatory office. Only, I must apologize.

456
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Since we prepared this so suddenly, we didn't have a chance to organize everything, but don't worry.

457
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,950
The actual office won't look like this.

458
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,830
- I understand.<br>- Excuse me. May I ask what the current situation is?

459
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,150
Where's CEO Chu?

460
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,790
CEO Chu... CEO Chu is here!

461
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:40,010
<i></i>

462
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,390
Kehuan, let me introduce you.

463
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,270
- This is– <br> - I already know.

464
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:50,630
I just received notification from the parent company. Sister Maizi is our fourth source of funding.

465
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,750
It happens to make up for what we were missing earlier.

466
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,310
In addition, she has also brought along our technology stock.

467
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,770
CEO Chu, we're finally working together.

468
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,860
I believe the two of us will create a miracle in the market.

469
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,260
Let me introduce everyone. This is the director of our R&amp;D team,

470
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,650
Li Haoyi. He will be joining your team from now on.

471
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,270
I'm happy to work together with old friends. I hope my addition will be helpful to the team.

472
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,570
Yes! Of course!

473
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,540
Our R&amp;D group has finally got a new force!

474
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,060
Executive Assistant Gao, please speak with me privately.

475
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,000
Sister Maizi, excuse us. Please sit.

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,210
- Excuse us. <br> - No problem.

477
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,660
Can we talk?

478
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,770
Go ahead. It's no problem.

479
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,500
Excuse us. Excuse us.

480
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,260
I have something to ask you. Follow me.

481
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,380
Your company truly is lively!

482
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,230
And it seems like everyone has some sort of special feelings.

483
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,190
What exactly do you want?

484
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,990
What's wrong?

485
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,580
Earlier you were talking about separating work from private matters. Now you're bringing Li Haoyi into the team. What do you mean by this?

486
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,820
I don't have any intentions. Sister Maizi told me to join, so I did. It's that simple.

487
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,950
Is that right? It just so happens to be at a vile point in our relationship. Isn't that such a coincidence?

488
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,490
I was also just recently notified about this situation. When I came back from Shanghai to Taipei,

489
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,960
I found out that Sister Maizi invested in this project.

490
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,390
In addition, I'm her employee. She gave me a job, can I refuse?

491
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:35,730
Li Haoyi, do you think we're suited to work together right now?

492
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,410
Yes, we're not suited, yet you're suited to work with Chu Kehuan.

493
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,100
Let me ask you then. Such an important project,

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,110
you won't be influenced by your personal emotions to the point where you can't continue any longer?

495
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,960
Of course, we must continue with this!

496
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,240
And I also wish that this entire project progresses smoothly.

497
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,370
That's why I asked Mai Ruoyun and Li Haoyi to join.

498
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,580
And Mai Ruoyun is not an idiot.

499
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,670
Would she toss money into the water for no reason?

500
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,890
Of course, she evaluated if this project had potential,

501
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,200
and she would only join if it's profitable.

502
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,770
Kehuan, if this project is successful,

503
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,850
it's a win-win for both of us. Isn't that right?

504
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,830
You make it sound so good. Why can't you just admit that you want to retaliate

505
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,010
against me for establishing the preparatory office for Zhou Weiwei?

506
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,240
Chu Kehuan, why don't you just tell the whole world

507
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,520
that because of Zhou Weiwei, you can't separate your work and private life.

508
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,030
I have never denied that.

509
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,130
On the contrary, it's you who says I'm using my position for private interests.

510
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,900
Then let me ask you. How are your actions any different?

511
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,650
I learned from you.

512
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,570
Since you insisted on keeping Zhou Weiwei on this team,

513
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,190
why can't I bring Li Haoyi in?

514
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,370
At this point from the perspective of the company, all the funding has been received.

515
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,870
I'm very happy we have new technological personnel joining the company.

516
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,420
The parent company hopes that we can speed up our R&amp;D progress.

517
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,910
So they decided to proceed with a press conference to discuss our most recent developments.

518
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,790
At the same time, the Chairman has come up with a name for the subsidiary company.

519
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,360
It will be called Superpower Huaxin.

520
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,870
It represents our supercomputer;

521
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,090
a collaboration between Hualai and Guoxin.

522
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,730
It is scheduled for three weeks from now. Han Kefei?

523
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,500
To have a press conference, we have to find a venue, decorate the site, contact the media, invite guests,

524
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,160
and many other trivial matters to handle.

525
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,790
Only three weeks will not be enough time.

526
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,330
And it's not possible in such a short period of time for the R&amp;D team

527
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,800
to come up with results that we can announce to the public.

528
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,350
The time frame was set by the Chairman. I also don't have the ability to change it.

529
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,040
I can only ask everyone to work harder.

530
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,670
It's not that we are unwilling to cooperate,

531
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,460
it is that the timing is too hurried; we are unable to produce out a good thing.

532
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,120
I believe the Chairman also would not want that to happen.

533
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,910
Regarding this point, I want to say sorry to everyone.

534
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,540
The reason why the press conference is in such a hurry is because of me.

535
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,860
I'm normally in Shanghai and that's the only day I'm free.

536
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,280
If CEO Chu still finds it troublesome, we can change the time?

537
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,360
Set it to another day.

538
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,800
As for whether I attend or not, it doesn't matter to me.

539
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,450
I can have Haoyi represent me to attend, is that okay?

540
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,590
Let's follow what Executive Assistant Gao mentioned. We don't need to change the time.

541
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,050
If CEO Chu is worried that our R&amp;D team will not be able to

542
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,580
come up with what we need for the press conference,

543
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,960
then I can guarantee you right now,

544
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,670
as long as I'm here, then we definitely can.

545
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,400
It's not the time to let emotions rule your decisions.

546
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,800
Can you stop randomly making promises for something you are not absolutely certain about?

547
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,670
Why does CEO Chu think I'm letting my emotions rule my decisions?

548
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,740
Do you not believe in my ability,

549
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,500
or do you not believe in Sister Maizi's ability to see talent in people?

550
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Since Director Li has already said it, I trust in his ability.

551
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,540
Let's not spend time debating on this issue.

552
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,820
All right, it's decided then.

553
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,730
Three weeks from now, the press conference must be successfully executed.

554
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,110
You're really a hero. In addition to developing products, you also know how to manage a business.

555
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,490
Congrats.

556
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,950
Thank you, Sister Maizi.

557
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,340
But since you have to work together with Zhou Weiwei,

558
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,710
there are some things I have to say first.

559
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,990
No matter how you progress with Weiwei in the future,

560
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,720
don't use and you aren't allowed to use

561
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,610
your personal feelings in your work. Can you do this?

562
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,470
Li Haoyi?

563
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,660
Sister Maizi, don't worry.

564
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,490
I will definitely not let my personal feelings

565
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,000
interfere with my work performance.

566
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,470
You must honor your words, okay?

567
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,760
Don't let these small emotions and love affect your work.

568
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay!

569
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:07,690
Once I return to Shanghai, all matters of the company will be handled by you.

570
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,350
All the decisions for this company, you can decide.

571
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,200
All handled by me?

572
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,130
Yes, all of it.

573
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,960
If it was not for Executive Assistant Gao inviting me to come back,

574
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,420
then I wouldn't even want to attend that press conference.

575
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,010
And furthermore, I don't even have that big of a stake in the total shares.

576
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,970
My power of discourse is also not much; hereafter, you can just be the representative and that's just fine.

577
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,130
Sister Maizi, let me ask you.

578
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,980
Why are you so good to me?

579
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,720
You're talented.

580
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,730
Are you drunk?

581
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,960
Am I really just your employee?

582
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,300
What are your feelings towards me?

583
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,570
You tell me.

584
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,280
Who am I?

585
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,000
You're Sister Maizi.

586
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,470
Who is Sister Maizi?

587
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,160
My boss.

588
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,540
Very good. It's good that you remember.

589
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,950
Check, please.

590
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,880
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

591
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,350
<i>​♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

592
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,950
- To catch me?<br>- It will be on standby like this. Yes, of course.

593
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,650
Good morning, Manager! Good morning, Sister Kefei!

594
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,320
- Morning. <br> - Morning.

595
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,790
That's so sickening!

596
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,560
You'll find out if someone's sexually harassing you.

597
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,720
- I don't know.<br>- Just like this, lustfully staring at you.

598
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,200
- That won't do. I'd want to beat him up.<br>- Good morning.

599
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Hey, I'm so thirsty. Hurry.

600
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,850
Did you know that I encountered a pervert near my house?

601
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:10,500
He rode his bike and passed by. Suddenly, he

602
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,480
groped her breast and then rode away.

603
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,200
- Really? <br> - You wouldn't even have time to react and would just be like, "Eh? Eh?

604
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,650
What happened?" And he's already gone.

605
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,750
What's so funny?

606
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,790
Morning, Haoyi!

607
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,820
Morning.

608
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,740
Morning, Brother Haoyi.

609
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,360
Morning.

610
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,190
<i> Why are you so interested in gossip? </i>

611
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,930
<i> Would you die without gossiping?</i>

612
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,880
I just heard you say "a guy something."

613
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,920
What exactly is wrong with him?

614
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,580
Wait for me.

615
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,820
Hello? David Liu speaking.

616
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,810
A bank loan? No, I don't need one.

617
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,010
Why?

618
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,230
It's because I'm from a rich family! It's not okay if I don't lack money?

619
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,360
So random and absurd.

620
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,950
It's not okay if I don't lack money? They wanted to force me to take out a loan.

621
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,140
Kefei, tell me.

622
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,810
Brother Dawei.

623
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,960
What do you want?

624
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,270
Are you free?

625
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,530
Can't you see I'm chatting with Sister Kefei?

626
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,360
I also have to talk business with Brother Haoyi later. What do you want?

627
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,110
I have a pressing matter.

628
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,980
What pressing matter can we not discuss here?

629
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,540
Just follow me. Let's go.

630
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,730
- Wait! Wait! <br> - Hurry! Hurry!

631
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:59,240
She said it's an emergency. Might as well speak about it here.

632
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,980
What are you doing? Don't be like this!

633
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,920
I have someone I like. Why would you bring me to such a shady place?

634
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,180
What if someone else sees?

635
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,490
Sister Kefei?

636
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,090
What in the hell does this have to do with you? Why do you need to know so much?

637
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:15,020
So you have someone you like, but you still haven't gotten her to accept you.

638
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,770
Meiling, I'm telling you. We've already left the Hualai office.

639
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,460
There isn't a restriction on intercompany dating, right?

640
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,420
All right. I'm here to tell you. If you want to pursue Sister Kefei, you definitely can't be too clingy.

641
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,450
What do you mean? She doesn't like guys that are too clingy?

642
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,550
Not only does she not like it, in fact, but she is also sick of it. Do you remember that Yan Baiyang previously?

643
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,580
Who is Yan Baiyang? So that—

644
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,630
No, no. Because that Yan Baiyang was previously too clingy so she fired him!

645
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,570
What should I do?

646
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,360
- You must remember okay! <br> - Okay!

647
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,980
- Good luck! <br> - Okay!

648
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,380
- Hi. <br> - Hi.

649
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,020
Where did you just go with Meiling?

650
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,210
I think that doesn't concern you.

651
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,490
Liu Dawei!

652
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,630
Can you please move out of the way?

653
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,290
Liu Dawei!

654
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,290
I need to work right now. Move aside.

655
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,570
Okay.

656
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,500
Liu Dawei! The materials needed for the press conference, when do you think you can have them ready by?

657
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,380
I don't know about that. You should ask Haoyi.

658
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,300
Aren't you the team leader? You should be responsible for this.

659
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,970
Haoyi is in charge of writing the code. If you ask me, I would ask him all the same.

660
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,060
The office is only this big. I can tell with one look.

661
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,650
Why would there be a need for me to relay your message to him then relay the answer back to you?

662
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,610
So, it's much faster if you ask him yourself.

663
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,630
Liu Dawei!

664
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,530
If the PM gives you a task, you do it. What's the issue? Are you deliberately nitpicking?

665
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,500
I'm not nitpicking. I'm just telling the truth.

666
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,700
The truth is, your not being responsible and pushing it to someone else.

667
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,330
It's something you are tasked to do and you are telling someone else to do it.

668
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,590
Besides, don't you know that Weiwei and 321... what exactly are you doing?!

669
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,590
Kefei! Forget it. I'll go ask myself.

670
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,040
No. Why?

671
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,590
This is clearly something he should do, but he's not doing it so why should you do it?

672
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,930
If it's not important, tell Meiling to do it. You have to go see the venue with me later.

673
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,800
What venue?

674
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,560
The venue for the press conference. Go with me later.

675
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,570
- Meiling? <br> - Sister Kefei.

676
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,790
I'm talking to you standing up and you're still sitting?

677
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,050
Can you ask Li Haoyi when he can give us the things for the press conference?

678
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,570
Li...

679
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,710
Okay.

680
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,600
Where are you going later?

681
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,620
After we see the venue, I'm going back to the company.

682
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:10,030
No. It's so rare for us to come out and relax. Let's not go back too early. Let's go have afternoon tea.

683
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,530
I still have a lot of things to do.

684
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,590
Does it really matter by those two hours?

685
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,320
After leaving the Hualai office, one good thing is

686
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,700
we can go on breaks whenever and not get caught. Second is

687
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,290
Jessica won't suddenly call and say, "Where are you guys? Hurry and get back here!"

688
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,750
This is the best.

689
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:34,860
If it was still at Hualai, it wouldn't be like this.

690
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,390
Every department has people who are crowded in an office.

691
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,330
That's right. That 321 is especially like a spirit behind your back;

692
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:46,560
watching your every move, it's extremely uncomfortable.

693
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,900
How can you progress with Chu Kehuan with him around?

694
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,750
I never said I was going to have progress with Chu Kehuan. I just think it's frustrating.

695
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,130
Frustrating? About what?

696
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,370
I just feel like the two of them are like porcupines.

697
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,290
They can start yelling and fighting at each other at any time.

698
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,610
It's frustrating, really frustrating.

699
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,290
Wow, you're talking about it like you're an outsider.

700
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:11,910
The two of them definitely aren't in a bad mood because of me.

701
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,050
So?

702
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,560
So are you going to have some progress with Chu Kehuan?

703
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,510
I don't know. At least not right now.

704
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,510
Youth is limited. Zhou Weiwei, our youth is like a little bird.

705
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,700
Chirp, chirp, chirp. Once it flies away, it's not coming back.

706
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,260
You don't even date yourself and like being single.

707
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,240
Me being single is wasting youth?

708
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,670
We're not the same. Liu Dawei also said,

709
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,160
your "sleeping together" and my "sleeping together' have completely different meanings.

710
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,210
Let me ask you a question.

711
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Don't you think Liu Dawei and Meiling are a bit weird?

712
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,990
What's weird?

713
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,660
You didn't see?

714
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,290
She pulled Liu Dawei outside in front of me.

715
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:12,010
They were whispering in the corridor and being all sneaky. Who knows what they were up to?

716
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,980
Do you think they're dating?

717
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,740
Wow! Han Kefei, are you jealous?

718
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,780
You like Liu Dawei?

719
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,860
That's the dirtiest thing I've ever heard in the world.

720
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,070
I'm jealous? Han Kefei likes Liu Dawei?

721
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,850
Are you sure that acting aloof will work?

722
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,880
Why do I feel like I just pissed her off?

723
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,750
- Yeah. <br> - That's right! She not angry, she's probably jealous.

724
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,160
Are you sure?

725
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,870
She's jealous.

726
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,580
Kefei, Kefei! Kefei!

727
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,150
She's just ignoring me. It doesn't look like jealousy.

728
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,930
Hey, Meiling!

729
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,660
Manager, I'm going to leave first.

730
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,470
- Bye-bye. <br> - Bye-bye.

731
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,720
I'm leaving Haoyi, bye.

732
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,080
Hello?

733
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,490
Do you have plans tonight?

734
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,330
Yes.

735
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,470
So we can't eat together?

736
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,250
Yes.

737
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,080
Where are you going? I'll take you.

738
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,500
No need. Thanks, CEO Chu.

739
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,070
Kefei, time to leave.

740
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,340
You can go back first. I still have work to do.

741
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,840
You still have work to do?

742
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,500
I need to work overtime.

743
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,790
You need to work overtime?

744
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,370
Yeah.

745
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,540
Okay.

746
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,040
Bye-bye.

747
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,640
Are you waiting for the bus alone? It's Friday night.

748
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,430
You guys should be in a stage of passionate romance. Why aren't you going on a date?

749
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,750
Looks like your new boyfriend, Chu Kehuan, isn't better than me.

750
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,730
Are you finished speaking? Do you have work-related matters to discuss with me?

751
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,010
If not, then I will not speak to you.

752
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,430
I'll take you. I can get the motorcycle.

753
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,300
There's no need. I can walk home alone.

754
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:39,190
Walking home from here will take at least two hours!

755
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,580
What does that have to do with you!

756
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,810
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken like that earlier. Let me take you.

757
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,180
I said, there's no need.

758
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:04,430
We don't need to be like that. Even if we broke up, we can still be friends.

759
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,370
Maybe we can in the future.

760
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:11,650
But right now, you're so hot-headed.

761
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:17,520
Honestly, even being coworkers right now is a bit difficult.

762
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:26,420
<i> Hello? Kefei? Tonight... Okay! </i>

763
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:03,890
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

764
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:07,820
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

765
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,020
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

766
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,370
We are together.

767
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,720
Hi.

768
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,170
- Here's your water. The menu. <br> - Thank you.

769
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,270
Why are you here right now?

770
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,360
You're more familiar with this place. Anything you recommend?

771
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,900
Han Kefei!

772
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:38,360
Don't blame Han Kefei. I'm her boss. She must listen to me.

773
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,180
So, right now—

774
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,930
I'm keeping you company for dinner and holding light conversation with you. And then I'll send you home.

775
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,360
You really don't need to be like this.

776
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,490
How long will you continue to harm yourself?

777
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,170
Looks like Li Haoyi joining our team has had a big impact on you.

778
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,420
Are you keeping your distance from me because of Li Haoyi?

779
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,540
I just don't want someone to be harmed because of this matter again.

780
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,010
Including you.

781
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,250
I am very happy to hear you being concerned for me.

782
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,750
You're missing the point.

783
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:21,600
What I mean is... Don't you care about your career?

784
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,320
I care. Of course, I care.

785
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,810
Do you know why I so actively pursued the CEO position at Guoxin? It's because I was tired.

786
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,700
To be a super trader, apart from having a natural gift, it is also to be conscientious.

787
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,540
To look at the Asian stock markets seriously and to look at the American stock markets seriously.

788
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,420
To take it seriously to do the analysis of the stocks.

789
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,330
To take it seriously making a judgement of the investor's attempt

790
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,860
and to do every single thing seriously.

791
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,700
And then, the immense pressure comes.

792
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,790
Because you don't want to lose, and you can't lose.

793
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,430
And then even greater pressure emerges.

794
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:03,570
In order to relieve that pressure, I started drinking.

795
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:07,250
Picking up girls. Until...

796
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,980
Until I met you.

797
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,550
And I found an entirely new method to relieve stress.

798
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,630
What method? And what does it have to do with me?

799
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,430
Picking you up and pursuing you. At first, I tried to pick you up, then I tried to pursue you.

800
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,400
Why am I so unlucky?

801
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:34,430
That's why I sincerely cherish my career currently.

802
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,830
The position is higher, the free time I have is greater.

803
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,680
And on top of that, I am pursuing you but you won't accept me.

804
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,190
So, I have even more time to sleep and even more time to be bored.

805
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,660
Can you be more focused?

806
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,630
I am very focused. I am very earnest in pursuing you.

807
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,590
I am very sincere in cherishing my current job.

808
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:06,480
But your job is now facing danger and choices.

809
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,830
Crisis? Financial crisis or financial tsunami?

810
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,310
My job grows in the face of danger.

811
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,970
And as for what you've said... choices?

812
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,780
This I don't understand.

813
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,980
The choices I'm speaking of,

814
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,150
is if I agree with your pursuit,

815
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:29,640
you will take on the reputation of stealing a man's wife.

816
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,960
Then, how will your boss react?

817
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,770
You said you really treasure your job.

818
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:43,670
But when you have to choose between me and work,

819
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,520
what would you do?

820
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,600
Weiwei, this—

821
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,910
I don't want you to lose your job because of me.

822
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,400
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

823
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:06,430
I finally confirmed that you kept hiding from me,

824
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,530
not for yourself but for me.

825
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,230
I'm in a hurry. Since Han Hefei isn't coming anyway, can we order first?

826
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,990
<i> (I met you at Le Nini) </i>

827
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,390
What a coincidence!

828
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,550
Are you out on a date on Friday night; the weekend?

829
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,330
You don't need to mind me. I really coincidentally came out to eat dinner. You two can have your meal.

830
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,230
Oh, that's right. This flower is for you.

831
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,590
I have no appetite. I'll leave first.

832
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,970
You're leaving so fast? You've left so much, it's a waste.

833
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,180
The flower!

834
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,000
What's wrong?

835
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,190
- What is up with you and Meiling? <br> - There's nothing going on!

836
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,210
Say the truth! Are you two dating?

837
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,230
I really am not!

838
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,820
Then, what were you two saying earlier?

839
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,020
She was teaching me how to get with you!

840
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,590
Then... tonight.

841
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,670
Your house or mine?

842
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,800
Either is okay.

843
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,900
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

844
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,330
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

845
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,400
Good morning everyone! Morning!

846
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,360
- Good morning, Meiling!<br>- Good morning, Sister Kefei.

847
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,420
Wow, how come you didn't change your clothes?

848
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,120
What does that have to do with you?

849
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,790
Yeah, you didn't come home this weekend either.

850
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:29,810
If I didn't go home, then, of course, I didn't change.

851
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,030
Where did you go?

852
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,010
You guess!

853
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,970
Good morning, everyone!

854
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,560
Good morning.

855
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,400
Your friend... is really hot.

856
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,840
That can't be.

857
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,770
It is exactly that.

858
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,180
He really is a Holy Tree.

859
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,400
I really can't deal with you two.

860
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,300
Here. This is what you wanted for the press conference. Take a look.

861
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,770
Thank you.

862
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,980
Good morning, Haoyi. How was working on it?

863
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,350
- It was all right.<br>- Okay!

864
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:25,600
Li Haoyi, please take this back and redo it. I absolutely cannot accept this!

865
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,760
Calm down!

866
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,450
That's not it, CEO Chu. We already spent two weeks putting this together.

867
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,160
We simply do not have time to rewrite it!

868
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,100
I don't care. This is your problem.

869
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,260
You're obviously a layman leading the professionals.

870
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,450
You're in finance. What do you know about AI technology?

871
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,080
That's right, I don't know.

872
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,690
If I knew, then you wouldn't even be here.

873
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:53,890
But to be honest, I've already seen this somewhere else.

874
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:58,320
How do you expect me to take this to the press conference and tell my investors that this is our leading product, our original concept?

875
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,680
May I ask you where the lead and where the originality is?

876
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,360
I only had three weeks.

877
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,790
I was able to write this up in three weeks, which is already really good.

878
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,070
Do you think coding is that easy?

879
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,540
CEO Chu, regarding this matter, I must stand on Haoyi's side.

880
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,640
Three weeks was a tough deadline from the very start.

881
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,190
Coding isn't just difficult. It's very, very difficult.

882
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,830
David.

883
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:25,930
Yes, to be honest, I thought that the press conference schedule was too rushed.

884
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,320
You definitely wouldn't be able to put together anything good,

885
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,210
but who vowed solemnly at our meeting that as long as you're here, it was no problem?

886
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:36,690
I fulfilled what I promised and handed it over to you. What else do you want from me?

887
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,620
Are you trying to argue with me right now?

888
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:43,260
CEO Chu, perhaps his code isn't that bad at all,

889
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,830
not to the point of rewriting it.

890
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,280
Would I be arguing here if it didn't need to be rewritten?

891
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,530
Even you have to speak up for him?

892
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,960
I'm not speaking up for anyone. I just want to resolve the problem.

893
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,660
It's true that there wasn't enough time. It's also true that the work wasn't done very well.

894
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,700
All of this needs to be resolved,

895
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:08,260
but the two of you loudly arguing here will not solve the problem.

896
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,560
Can we all sit down and calmly discuss this?

897
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,250
I want to discuss it, but does it seem like he's open to discussion with that attitude?

898
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,980
He's like a kid acting like a rascal over there.

899
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,990
- Who's acting like a rascal?<br>- You are!

900
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:20,330
Can you both calm down?

901
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:27,100
Li Haoyi, I'm being real here. There's no way I can accept this attitude of yours.

902
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,620
My requirements are very simple. I only have three conditions for my products.

903
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,720
One, no one else can do it.

904
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,340
Two, no one else can think of it.

905
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,210
Three, only we can do it.

906
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,280
If you can't fulfill these three conditions,

907
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,210
then I must ask you to leave my team.

908
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,960
Yes, CEO Chu.

909
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,950
Haoyi, Haoyi.

910
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,180
Sister Maizi.

911
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:05,180
Come with me.

912
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,830
I happened to be in the area handling affairs, so I decided to come by to visit you guys.

913
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,580
I didn't expect to see such a scene.

914
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,980
I'm sorry.

915
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,300
What are you sorry for?

916
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,360
I'm sorry about today.

917
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,570
Also, that day at the bar...

918
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,650
I did a really stupid thing that day at the bar.

919
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:39,380
Sister Maizi, I'm sorry. I apologize.

920
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,600
It's been so long, and you're barely apologizing to me now?

921
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,450
But it's okay. It's okay, I already found a solution.

922
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,580
It's for us to sit further away from each other.

923
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,730
It's okay, no big deal. Don't get anxious about something so minor.

924
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,980
What I care about is the company's matters.

925
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,350
I must still remind you that

926
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:07,780
you have a really bad habit of dragging the problem out.

927
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,460
I will fix it in the future.

928
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,180
In the future? There's still a future?

929
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,420
It's like your problem with Zhou Weiwei. You guys should have discussed it earlier on.

930
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,900
Weiwei and I don't have any problems. The problem is Chu Kehuan.

931
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,980
If it weren't for him, Weiwei and I wouldn't have even broken up.

932
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:31,410
It looks like even an outsider such as myself can tell that the problem was never Chu Kehuan.

933
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,830
No wonder Zhou Weiwei had a change of heart.

934
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:36,270
So, even you think that I can't compare to Chu Kehuan?

935
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,360
It's not whether you can compare to him or not.

936
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:43,070
It's that this love triangle between you, Chu Kehuan, and Zhou Weiwei should have come to an end.

937
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,930
Didn't you promise me that you would separate work from personal matters?

938
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,380
Then, what did I just see?

939
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,570
- That was because Chu Kehuan—<br>- It's CEO Chu.

940
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,960
Haoyi, just because you were representing me today

941
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,740
doesn't mean that you can be on equal footing with Chu Kehuan.

942
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,300
Our shares are only short of Guoxin's and Hualai's by this much.

943
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,360
That means that compared to Chu Kehuan, your qualifications

944
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,490
fall short by a lot.

945
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,280
I may be letting you represent me today,

946
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,320
but if one day you handle it incorrectly,

947
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,950
I can make you become nothing.

948
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,670
Even though our shares are short of theirs,

949
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,740
we still have technology stock.

950
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,390
Without me, Liu Dawei is nothing.

951
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:37,330
I just want to bring Weiwei back to my side. Am I not allowed to do that?

952
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,200
Who do you think you are?

953
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:46,560
You just asked me if you can compare to Chu Kehuan.

954
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:51,180
That's right, you really can't compare to Chu Kehuan.

955
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,870
Do you know why?

956
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:56,400
It's because he never wanted to compare himself with you from the beginning.

957
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,430
He's also not the kind of person who would badger women and ask whether he falls short of other men.

958
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:07,350
Actually, men who ask these kinds of questions

959
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,370
have already lost.

960
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,500
<i></i>

961
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,310
Meiling, help me order takeout.

962
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,740
Fried chicken or pizza: whatever is fine. I'm treating.

963
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,370
Oh, okay.

964
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,120
I'm treating, but no one wants to eat?

965
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,080
Is this an apology?

966
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,590
The main lead isn't even here. Is there any worth apologizing to us?

967
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:04,590
Liu Dawei, you have a very foul mouth.

968
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,830
I think most of you probably believe that

969
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:10,250
I give Li Haoyi a hard time because of my personal feelings.

970
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,280
Right here, I'm telling everyone that isn't the case.

971
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,860
I genuinely want the best for our company, so as a manager,

972
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,440
I made some requests to my associate.

973
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,400
Perhaps my tone of voice wasn't nice and my attitude wasn't the best,

974
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,320
but I genuinely wish that

975
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,570
we can host a press conference unlike any other.

976
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,360
Something no one has thought of, we thought of.

977
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,350
Something no one has done, we did.

978
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,120
This is my ardent hope for the company.

979
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,320
I ardently hope that our company can become a leader in the industry.

980
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:48,610
Furthermore, I do have a selfish motive behind this.

981
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:53,180
I want to use this press conference as a way for the media or the industry to notice you guys.

982
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,680
So, Liu Dawei, I must ask this of you.

983
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,660
I ask you to push for Li Haoyi's progress.

984
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:06,220
Your highlight will be the main point of the press conference. Please.

985
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,450
Okay, CEO Chu, I won't let you down.

986
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:17,140
I will make Li Haoyi stay far away from Manager Zhou.

987
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,350
Liu Dawei, do you believe that I'll hurl this fried chicken at you?

988
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,480
What I mean is that if Haoyi stays far away from her, he'll focus.

989
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,310
You only know how to be fierce. Eat a piece of chicken.

990
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:30,150
I'll eat it. Who's afraid? Hey, hurry up and eat, guys.

991
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,060
CEO Chu is treating. Eat a lot, okay?

992
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,340
- Eat till you're full so you have the energy to work. Hurry up and eat!<br>- Wow, so many drumsticks!

993
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,400
Do you want that drumstick?

994
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,330
Thank you.

995
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:56,760
I truly believe that you're a good manager.

996
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,600
Thank you.

997
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,800
<i>I admit, I like him.</i>

998
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,940
<i>My heart was moved by him.</i>

999
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,780
<i>You must guarantee that Kehuan will return to his original position.</i>

1000
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,800
<i>As long as you leave, I guarantee it.</i>

1001
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:26,530
<i>I don't want to be controlled anymore. I don't want any pressure.</i>

1002
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:30,770
<i>So Ziyuan, thank you for loving me for ten years.</i>
