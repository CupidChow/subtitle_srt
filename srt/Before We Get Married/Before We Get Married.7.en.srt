<i>Han Kefei, enough!</i>

22
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,010
There's nothing between you and Chu Kehuan?

23
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,700
Come. Come here. Look in the mirror. Swear to yourself in the mirror that

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,240
you have never loved Chu Kehuan!

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,010
You don't even have a tiny bit of feeling towards him.

26
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,490
If you love him today, then you'll be struck by lightning.

27
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,770
Swear it!

28
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,430
Come on! You don't love him, right?

29
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,880
Why are you unable to speak? Swear it!

30
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,860
Chu Kehuan was never my choice. What do you want me to say?

31
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,500
You can even say this lie.

32
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,810
But you really need to think about it today.

33
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,960
One, will you really be better off this way?

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,160
Second, you can let that woman completely give up.

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,670
I can block this slap for you today,

36
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,670
but who will block the second and third slaps tomorrow and the day after?

37
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,710
Sorry about that.

38
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,030
What? So disgusting.

39
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,140
So, I hate dating. I would rather "buy coke."<i> (T\N: make love) </i>

40
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,930
But you're different. You're not just dating, but dating two at once.

41
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,210
Do you want to choose 321 or Chu Kehuan?

42
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,360
You really need to decide carefully.

43
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,190
I know this is very hard.

44
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,640
But you need to remember.

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,140
You need to be true to your own feelings.

46
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,120
No matter what choice you make, I'll always be by your side.

47
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay?

48
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,090
Let me tell you. Don't you dare cry when we go into the office.

49
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,370
The one who was slapped was me and you're the one crying. How will the others think?

50
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,570
I know.

51
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,670
I'm just reminding you.

52
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,310
Are you okay?

53
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,030
You caused a scene at someone's company and even hit someone. Now you're acting like nothing's wrong?

54
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,610
Your calmness makes me very scared.

55
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,960
Are you sure she is Brother Kehuan's girlfriend?

56
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,720
Wait... This is the wrong question.

57
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,970
No matter who is, you should not be causing a scene at a public place like her company!

58
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,820
You need to understand your status is now Brother Kehuan's ex-girlfriend.

59
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm not his ex-girlfriend. Also, Gao Ziting,

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,360
you weren't there earlier to see how that woman was acting!

61
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,640
Me slapping her is just fitting.

62
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,590
Okay, let's not discuss whether you're Brother Kehuan's ex-girlfriend or not. Let's discuss your methodology.

63
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,420
Brother Kehuan is already distancing himself from you, and you went to hit his friend?

64
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,280
Are you not pushing him farther and farther away?

65
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,880
I actually really want to know

66
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,690
what Kehuan's reaction will be if he knows about this,

67
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,840
because I am almost certain that

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,170
I probably slapped the wrong person.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
<i>Hey, that's strange. Why did she come looking for Zhou Weiwei right away?</i>

70
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,190
She looked for the wrong person. Zhou Weiwei isn't like that. I think it's Han Kefei.

71
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,580
Hey, but don't you think this is very ridiculous?

72
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,570
This kind of stuff can be handled privately. Why is she causing a scene at someone else's company?

73
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,180
I feel like Han Kefei is more extreme, okay? He already has a girlfriend,

74
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,410
yet she still went ahead and provoked him. What's up? I haven't finished talking yet.

75
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,710
Hey, if this happened to you, wouldn't you cause trouble for her, too?

76
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,200
I slept with him.

77
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,330
Are you jealous?

78
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,910
An unmarried man and woman. I slept with Chu Kehuan, what did I do wrong?

79
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,830
Enough.

80
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,260
What is it?

81
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,790
Hello, Kefei. Are you available to talk right now?

82
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,690
If you have something to say, hurry and spit it out. My time is precious.

83
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,620
I was thinking that we haven't seen each other for a long time. Do you have time tonight?

84
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,660
No.

85
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,920
<i>You're still angry? </i>Don't be like that.

86
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,470
We were happy together. Don't be like this just because of Brother Kehuan and Sister Ziyuan.

87
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,310
It's precisely your Sister Ziyuan that came to my company and caused a huge scene.

88
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,570
She even slapped me in the face! My face still has a handprint. Tell me! How am I supposed to go outside? It's a disgrace.

89
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,280
Sister Ziyuan slapped you in the face? How is that possible?

90
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,880
<i>You're doubting me? </i>You think I'm lying?

91
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,480
It's not that. You and Sister Ziyuan don't even have any sort of relationship. Why would she cause trouble for you?

92
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,890
Why don't you ask her? She heard that I slept with Chu Kehuan and went crazy. What's her problem.

93
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,840
In the future, every time Chu Kehuan sleeps with someone, she's going to hit someone? If she's not tired, I'm tired.

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,680
You slept with Brother Kehuan?

95
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,140
<i>Is that true? Don't—</i>

96
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,010
I'm really tired of talking to you.

97
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,940
Ah, so irritating!

98
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,930
Yan Baiyang, are you crazy?

99
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,220
I respected you so much and worshiped you!

100
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,430
You clearly know how much I like Kefei, why did you sleep with her?

101
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,620
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

102
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,070
What are you talking about?

103
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,170
I can completely understand Sister Ziyuan. Her slapping Han Kefei is all caused by you!

104
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,690
Calm down okay!

105
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,530
What did you just say? Ziyuan slapped Han Kefei? Who told you that?

106
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,380
Kefei told me it.

107
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,710
Apologize to me.

108
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,590
Why should I apologize to you? Aren't you the one who is supposed to apologize to me?

109
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,690
How can you unashamedly and unabashedly talk to me right now? Don't you think you wronged me?

110
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,840
All right. Since you do not understand me and also feel that I am shameful,

111
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,640
then you don't need to follow by my side anymore.

112
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,290
Boss.

113
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,850
Leave.

114
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,710
Get out!

115
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,250
<i>(Do you have time tonight?)<br>(Meet at the usual place at 7:00 p.m..)</i>

116
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,370
Hello, I'm here. Where are you?

117
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,030
<i> I'm in the next stall. </i>

118
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,550
Don't come over. Just stay there.

119
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,900
Why are you being like this?

120
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm sorry for taking a bit of your time.

121
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,290
I have some things to say.

122
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,000
After I'm finished speaking, I'll leave.

123
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,770
I'm sincerely sorry about what happened today.

124
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,970
I will clear it up with Ziyuan, so this will not happen again hereafter.

125
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,790
The reason why I came to find you today is not to hear an apology.

126
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,520
Weiwei.

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,810
This situation is already out of my imagination.

128
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,950
Kefei has been hurt. Ziyuan has been hurt.

129
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,130
I have also been hurt.

130
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,520
Is this what you're willing to see?

131
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,230
It's not worth it. Really.

132
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,200
I am not so amazing and you are also not so mighty.

133
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,540
There's no need to hurt so many people because of me.

134
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,480
Please. From now on,

135
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,630
don’t contact me.

136
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,770
Don’t come to see me.

137
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,400
Just act as you never met me.

138
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,360
I beg you.

139
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,750
Disappear from my world completely.

140
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,030
I said it! Don’t come any closer!

141
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,510
Do you think that it is so easy to stop at this point?

142
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,410
You are a person with a fiancé and what you are wearing on top of your finger is a wedding ring.

143
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,720
Do you think that I didn't struggle over that before?!

144
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,110
But every day at every moment,

145
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,590
no matter if my eyes are opened or closed, every image that appears in front of me is you.

146
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,070
I have no means to deceive myself, even more I haven't the means to deceive you as well. All these things, I cannot do it!

147
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,750
Can you not be so willful like this?

148
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,310
Even though it is impossible, you must also do it!

149
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,790
How can you talk like you have no responsibility in this at all?

150
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,090
Is it that you don’t like me?

151
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,160
All your smiles, those hugs—

152
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,230
Don’t talk about it anymore!

153
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,920
I admit that I was wrong.

154
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,810
Therefore, I want to make up for it and I want to correct it.

155
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,940
I want to disappear from your world completely.

156
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,800
I won’t give you any more space for imagination.

157
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,880
Go back.

158
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,300
Go back to Ziyuan's side.

159
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,410
Do you think that by doing this, I will go back to Ziyuan's side?

160
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,470
Let me tell you. It’s not possible!

161
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,470
I also don't believe that you can nonchalantly return to Li Haoyi's side as if nothing had happened.

162
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,670
I can!

163
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,280
I can do it!

164
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,380
<i>(Pervert)<br>(Delete)</i>

165
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,990
<i>Have you ever sincerely thought about being my friend?</i>

166
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,950
<i>I don't want to be friends with you!</i>

167
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,630
<i>It’s fine if we can't be friends. Then, we can be—</i>

168
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,080
<i>I won't become lovers with you either!</i>

169
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,420
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears ♫</i>

170
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,730
<i>♫ don’t lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

171
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,640
Why would you come?

172
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,790
You're staying at home so contentedly. Did "that" come?<br><i>(T/N: "That" refers to her period.)</i>

173
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,260
Do you want to drink?

174
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,190
Drink for a bit.

175
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,700
Move over.

176
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,460
No.

177
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,210
Explain yourself clearly first.

178
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,590
Once you explain it clearly, even if "that" came, I will still drink with you.

179
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,260
Talk about what?

180
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,670
Did Chu Kehuan and you have a showdown?

181
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,680
You broke up with Chu Kehuan?

182
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,360
He and I were never together.

183
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
How can it be regarded as breaking up? I have merely made it clear, that's all.

184
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,740
Made it clear, then it is equal to breaking it off.

185
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,260
Are you sure this decision is right?

186
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,930
To me, Chu Kehuan is like an accident.

187
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,760
Since it is an accident, then I must let it pass by.

188
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,900
Just like a stone that is cast into the water.

189
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,280
Although it sets off a slight ripple, in the end,

190
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,320
everything returns to normal.

191
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,510
Are you trying to be poetic right now? You must speak like this?

192
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,550
I can do it, too.

193
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,650
Then, one might well ask, are you listening attentively to the sound of your heart?

194
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,620
My goodness, this won't do. I really can't speak like that.

195
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,850
I beg you.

196
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,200
You don't need to be embarrassed and unable to speak about it. I can speak for you.

197
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,420
That dull-witted idiot 321 is absolutely unable to compete with Chu Kehuan.

198
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,240
Chu Kehuan is not just some ripple.

199
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,760
He is one big wave. The exciting kind.

200
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,760
He washes over you, hitting you one wave after another.

201
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,960
Who can refuse?

202
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay.

203
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,660
Then, let me ask you.

204
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,600
If today you were me, could you like him?

205
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,130
If you fell for him, how would Haoyi view you? How would his father view you?

206
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,140
If you fell for him, how would Ziyuan view you?

207
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,110
All of your coworkers, friends,

208
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,720
and your mom, how would they view you?

209
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,220
Would you worry about how I'd view you?

210
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,130
If I were you, I wouldn't care if they died.

211
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,170
Liking someone is liking someone. Why do you have to worry so much? Are you not tired?

212
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,020
So I’m not you.

213
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,590
I can't be like you, living a life based on my feelings.

214
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,750
Why can’t you?

215
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,910
Because I made myself into a mess.

216
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,350
In the recent days,

217
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,850
I feel that I am horrible.

218
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,210
I don't like this type of life and this type of feeling.

219
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,390
I hate myself like this even more!

220
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,950
What don't you like about yourself?

221
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,400
I don’t like

222
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,650
that sometimes I would think about him.

223
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,920
<i> 321, why are you here only now? </i>

224
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,720
<i> When I sold the house to you, what did you promise me? You said you would take care of her, protect her, and give her happiness, and what was the result? </i>

225
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,990
<i>Zhou Weiwei! Zhou Weiwei!</i>

226
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,730
<i>Zhou Weiwei, I like you!</i>

227
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,230
<i>Zhou Weiwei, you can run from now on,</i>

228
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,620
<i>but I, Chu Kehuan, will chase you to the end.</i>

229
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,050
<i> If you feel wronged, then just cry. </i>

230
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,590
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

231
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,210
<i>Finish eating this.</i>

232
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,350
I hate myself for becoming like this.

233
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,800
But in the beginning,

234
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,190
he was just an annoying pervert.

235
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,530
Only after,

236
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,080
he kept showing up and bothering me. I couldn't shake him off no matter what.

237
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,780
The feeling of being pursued is great,

238
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,590
especially if it's by a catch like him. Please.

239
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,180
We are both over 30 years old. We're not those young girls anymore.

240
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,790
To be pursued by someone with such great qualifications, anyone's heart would flutter.

241
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,960
That's exactly why

242
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,810
I should have kept my guard up

243
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,280
to have not ended up in a state like this.

244
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,270
Just because of this, you decided on 321?

245
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm not choosing.

246
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,080
It's that I've originally been walking on this path.

247
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
I can't suddenly meet a fork in the road and be enticed by it.

248
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,590
Furthermore, my feelings for Haoyi are real.

249
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,220
We have plans for the future.

250
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,050
We're walking forward, step-by-step, following our plan.

251
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,690
This down-to-earth feeling is what I want.

252
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,370
What if Chu Kehuan appears again?

253
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,440
I will treat him as a stranger.

254
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,940
You sure?

255
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,380
I'm really sure.

256
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,140
Even though I don't believe it, I will still congratulate you.

257
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,120
Let's drink.

258
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,960
You really don't believe it?

259
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,490
It's not that I don't believe you, I just don't believe that the heavens

260
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,540
will follow your ideas to plan your fate.

261
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:08,160
This world has many different possibilities. You can't catch a hold of it.

262
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,120
<i> I was just in a meeting and it ran overtime. Stacey, come on! Wait for me a bit, okay? </i>

263
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,160
- I'll treat you to coffee. What do you want? I'll treat you—<br>- Kefei!

264
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,570
Just this once, okay? I'll call you later.

265
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,870
I need to visit a client. I'm short on time. Please move aside.

266
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,600
One second, just listen to me for a second.

267
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,420
Let go!

268
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,140
You... is your face okay?

269
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,060
You're really a mood killer. You're coming to the office to anger me, is that it?

270
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,060
I'm really worried about you.

271
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,850
I'm fine.

272
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,900
Actually, don't blame Sister Ziyuan. She didn't do it on purpose.

273
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,260
At the time she must have been unable to find a place to release her anger so she-

274
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,790
She can't find a place to release it so she did it on my face?

275
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,560
You're so considerate, sweet, and you understand your Sister Ziyuan so well.

276
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,460
You're such a nice guy, then why don't you just get together with Sister Ziyuan?

277
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,630
Kefei! How could I be together with Sister Ziyuan?

278
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,080
You clearly know that the person I like is you.

279
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
That's your problem, not mine.

280
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,860
Kefei, you and Brother Kehuan were together for one night only. I'm the one who really cares about you.

281
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,640
Wait.

282
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,640
What did you say? Me and Chu Kehuan... What one, what night, what only?

283
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,110
You told me. Didn't you say that you and Kehuan already

284
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,680
made love?

285
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,320
So, at the time when I heard it, I was also really angry. My mind went blank,

286
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,860
and I really can understand Sister Ziyuan's feelings, so I-

287
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,710
So I went to punch Brother Kehuan.

288
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,130
You punched Chu Kehuan?

289
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,760
Yan Baiyang, do you believe whatever I say?

290
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,000
Do you not have any ability to make judgments?

291
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,650
Did you really think I, Han Kefei, would sleep with your Chu Kehuan?

292
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,050
- Kefei! <br> - Get lost!

293
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,430
So Kefei... didn't with Boss?

294
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,230
Mr. Li!

295
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,360
Do you still remember me?

296
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,410
You are... Kefei's boyfriend.

297
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,800
I came today as Yan Baiyang.

298
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,890
Hello, Mr. Yan. What's the matter? I'm really busy.

299
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,850
I'll just simply say a few words and leave.

300
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,870
It's about your fiance, Ms. Zhou.

301
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,630
Weiwei?

302
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,490
You said Yan Baiyang came to you? What for?

303
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,030
He just suddenly came over and said I should spend more time with you and care about you.

304
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,220
He even said that would stop you from falling for someone else and ruining someone else's relationship.

305
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,740
Isn't that overboard?

306
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,910
Weiwei, can you keep some distance from Kefei?

307
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,640
Why?

308
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:48,250
It's... Kefei's reputation outside isn't that good.

309
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,410
I know she lives her life like it's a game, but you're not the same.

310
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:58,370
We're about to get married. It might not be very good if you get too close to her.

311
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,720
Plus, today someone came looking for me and said...

312
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,600
Li Haoyi, do you know what you are saying right now?

313
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,260
If I liked someone else, that's between you and me.

314
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,880
It has nothing to do with anyone else, especially Kefei.

315
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,620
I didn't say you liked someone else. I'm just saying...

316
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,820
Can you keep a distance from Kefei?

317
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,220
That's two different things. Can you not mix them together?

318
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,030
I didn't. I'm just...

319
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,950
Okay. To be honest,

320
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,160
I don't like this feeling.

321
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,840
What feeling?

322
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,420
I'm busy working outside, working hard for our future.

323
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,890
Then suddenly, someone comes to me and says you betrayed me.

324
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,070
I just don't feel good.

325
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,810
So you think I betrayed you?

326
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,630
Do you know how serious an accusation that is?

327
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,040
Zhou Weiwei, I didn't say you betrayed me.

328
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,750
I am just saying that if you and Kefei get to close, then maybe

329
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,320
- you might -- <br> - No ifs. No maybes.

330
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,240
You say you don't feel good right now. I also don't feel good right now.

331
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,520
You think you're tired at work every day. Do you think I'm not tired?

332
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,770
Do you want to ask around which working woman

333
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:27,070
can be like me for three years spend only NTD $150 every day (T\N: $4.83 USD).

334
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,100
Didn't we agree on that? Isn't that our plan?

335
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,050
That's right, I know! We agreed to it.

336
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,190
It's our plan. We want to work on creating a beautiful future.

337
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,430
Then tell me. Where is our future?

338
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,130
The only thing I can feel right now is the present.

339
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,720
Right now, I only see that I come home every day to an empty house.

340
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,460
I can't grasp onto any warmth, because when it's time to sleep,

341
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,190
only pillows are by my side.

342
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,000
Do you know what the scariest thing is?

343
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:20,090
The me right now has no expectation or hope

344
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,100
because the expectations won't be met

345
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,060
and the hopes will be ruined. Because you are busy and not here.

346
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,890
You are so busy that you can't even send a text to care about me.

347
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,300
It only leaves the times I call you.

348
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,600
I can only hear,

349
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,250
"Your call is being transferred to voicemail."

350
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,490
Now you're talking to me about betrayal.

351
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,830
Zhou Weiwei. I said already. I didn't say you betrayed me.

352
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,480
But I admit what you said is true.

353
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,150
I'm very busy. I am truly busy, that is true.

354
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,610
But should I not be busy?

355
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,250
Should I be hovering near my phone waiting for your messages?

356
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,980
Or should I just hug my phone and talk to you for twenty-four hours?

357
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,110
We just bought a house that's better than what we had anticipated. We have to pay a mortgage.

358
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,410
I also want to relieve your financial pressures.

359
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,620
Shouldn't I work hard then?

360
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,760
Then, did you think that I was a normal woman?

361
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,100
I have a heart and feelings. I need your care.

362
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,460
If I encounter temptation while you're neglecting me,

363
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,020
I will waver and I will hesitate.

364
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,440
Do you know that everything you're doing now

365
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,510
makes me not sure exactly what I'm working toward

366
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,790
that I still have to hold fast to our promise?

367
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,420
But I am following our promise!

368
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,200
I am following our plan.

369
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,860
But you are neglecting me!

370
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,720
Do you really love me?

371
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,060
Or is your plan the one you love?

372
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:29,450
Do you love the sense of accomplishment you'll get from bringing the plan to fruition?

373
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,420
Zhou Weiwei,

374
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,560
you speaking like this is really unfair.

375
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,270
I thought I could find someone...

376
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:49,280
Finding someone who can walk with you, step-by-step, following life's blueprints

377
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,370
is a very blissful thing, is it not?

378
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,950
So, as long as you find someone who can cooperate with your plan,

379
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,430
it really doesn't matter if it is me or not.

380
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,020
How am I supposed to discuss this with you right now?

381
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,700
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

382
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears ♫</i>

383
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,790
<i>♫ don’t lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

384
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,740
So, as long as you find someone who can cooperate with your plan,

385
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,220
it doesn't really matter if it's me or not.

386
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,750
How am I supposed to discuss this with you right now?

387
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:17,640
You should go and find someone who is willing to discuss with you and cooperate with your plan.

388
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,890
Weiwei, what are you doing? Weiwei!

389
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,420
Sorry.

390
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,260
I was the one who neglected you.

391
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,960
I was the one who neglected your feelings.

392
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,760
But... you have to believe me.

393
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,210
If our plan...

394
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,640
doesn't have you,

395
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,750
then it will be pointless.

396
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,480
Weiwei...

397
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,260
Only you have the right to wear this ring.

398
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,560
No one else can.

399
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,650
To make it up to you,

400
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,650
I’m willing to change the plan.

401
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,930
Two months.

402
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,390
Two months later we will prepare our marriage.

403
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,480
So this is Plan B or Plan C?

404
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,080
This plan is the one that puts you first.

405
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,350
I'm warning you. If you can't make it happen,

406
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,600
I’m really not going to put up with you anymore.

407
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,380
Okay, I know now.

408
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,780
Sorry. It’s my fault.

409
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,230
Your sister already told you?

410
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,020
Yes, she's not the Gao Ziyuan I know anymore.

411
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,590
Actually, when I got home and saw her, I didn't know what to say.

412
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,200
Ziting, I’m very sorry.

413
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:30,070
I know that all of this is because of me. But I did all I could do already. I don't know what I should do anymore.

414
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,840
Looks like maybe the best thing to do is to let time solve it.

415
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,540
I don't think dragging this will be a good idea.

416
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,440
Brother Kehuan, take the house my sister and I are living in and just sell it.

417
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,700
Sell it? Why should I sell it?

418
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,930
That house isn't cheap. And I believe it causes more than a little burden on you.

419
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,560
If what you're worried about is this, then it's not necessary. I can handle it.

420
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,440
And even if we sell the house--

421
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,850
If the house is sold, then stop caring about us.

422
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,960
Love isn't like marriage with obligation and responsibilities. With a divorce, there are even alimony fees.

423
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,000
Within a couple, not loving anymore is not loving anymore. There's no right or wrong.

424
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,740
I want you to sell the house, because any sort of warmth you give my sister is cruel to her.

425
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,790
If you really are looking out for my sister,

426
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,010
then you should break it up even more cleanly. Stop meeting up with her,

427
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,400
and stop letting her into your house. Stop treating her like your family.

428
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,870
Just... completely treat her like a stranger.

429
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,970
You waited for a long time, right?

430
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,610
I bought your favorite Thai food. I was afraid you'd be hungry.

431
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,370
The house is cleaned up really nicely.

432
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,700
It isn't because you knew I was coming so you specially cleaned for me?

433
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,150
Actually, if in the future you want to clean, you can call me.

434
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,120
Eat first. They are all your favorite dishes.

435
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,990
I bought lemon fish, pepper chicken, and green curry.

436
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,950
I asked you to come not to share a meal together.

437
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,650
So you asked me to come

438
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,930
to put me on trial?

439
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,460
Why did you hit someone?

440
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,410
Han Kefei is innocent.

441
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,090
So I really hit the wrong person?

442
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,260
Or the person I should have hit was Zhou Weiwei?

443
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,390
Weiwei is also innocent.

444
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,630
You're calling her so intimately.

445
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,730
Let me say it again. Weiwei is also innocent.

446
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,230
If you want to hit someone, you should have hit me!

447
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,900
Why are you treating me like this? What right do you have to treat me like this?

448
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,190
Because we already broke up! What right do you have to hit me?

449
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,230
What I want to do has nothing to do with you! Who I like has nothing to do with you!

450
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,440
But you and Weiwei? She's...

451
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,220
I told you already. Zhou Weiwei has nothing to do with you and me. Do you understand?

452
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,490
But you are mine.

453
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,200
Our ten-year relationship cannot be broken just by you calling it quits!

454
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,150
Give me your bag.

455
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,350
What do you want?

456
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,460
I said, give me your bag.

457
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,540
Chu Kehuan! What do you want to do?

458
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,440
- I'm only taking away the things that don't belong to you.<br>- Kehuan, what are you doing?

459
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,230
Let go of me.

460
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,710
I said, let go of me!

461
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,410
Listen carefully.

462
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,410
You're only Gao Ziyuan.

463
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,370
You're not Mrs. Chu.

464
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,400
But you promised my mom that

465
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,790
you would take care of me forever.

466
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,730
I believe that your mom would approve of me taking care of you this way.

467
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,900
Do you hate me so much

468
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,010
that you have to force me into a dead-end

469
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,650
and not give me any way out whatsoever?

470
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,620
If I wasn't giving you a way out,

471
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,350
I would even take back the house that you're living in right now.

472
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,460
I hope that we'll never see that day.

473
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,580
Gao Ziyuan, please listen carefully.

474
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,070
Please strongly consider how you should be living your life.

475
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,630
Find your own life again.

476
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,420
You're not Mrs. Chu.

477
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,520
You're only Gao Ziyuan. Leave now.

480
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,690
Uncle, sorry for making you come all the way out here again.

481
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,660
It's not a hassle at all. I'm happy to take a daughter-in-law and eat engagement cakes.

482
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,510
Oh, right. Where's Haoyi?

483
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,960
Haoyi said something came up at his company, so he'll be here a little later.

484
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,420
Does that brat even remember he's the groom? Seriously.

485
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,690
Weiwei, can I take a look at the ring Haoyi proposed to you with?

486
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,980
Right here.

487
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,360
It's so small that I can hardly see it!

488
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,030
People will make a joke out of it. Even if others don't laugh at it, I'm laughing at it.

489
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,750
No, engagement rings are just a formality.

490
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,690
Haoyi's career has just taken off.

491
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,270
He doesn't need to spend too much money on this. It's the thought that counts.

492
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,420
Look at you. How can there be such a thoughtful girl in this world?

493
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,750
How did that wretched son of mine get so lucky?

494
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,960
Uncle, you're exaggerating. It's only right of me to do this.

495
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:30,530
You've already put on the ring. Why are you still calling me Uncle?

496
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,560
Dad.

497
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,840
Good! Good, it sounds good and energetic.

498
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,840
I feel great hearing it.

499
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,420
What makes you feel great?

500
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,940
I feel great here.

501
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,660
You're late...

502
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,030
and you bought such a small ring. Shameful.

503
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,020
Let's look at the engagement cakes. We'll buy the best ones.

504
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,280
What's wrong with Dad?

505
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,180
Dad's happy.

506
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,780
What did you call my dad? Can you say it one more time?

507
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,130
I think that this bakery's not bad. It tastes good and has nice packaging.

508
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,750
It's simple and natural. It's settled.

509
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,400
- Uncle.<br>- Hey.

510
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:23,810
Dad, this bakery isn't very cheap.

511
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:28,770
Don't worry about this. Just tell me how many boxes you need.

512
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,140
Sixty boxes? Is that too few?

513
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,960
Sixty boxes are too many! We don't need that many.

514
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,650
We don't have that many relatives and friends.

515
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,550
You have colleagues, too!

516
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,320
Dad, she works for a publicly listed company.

517
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,870
There are easily one to two hundred people at headquarters alone. You can't distribute to them all.

518
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:49,700
That's right, I just need to give it to some of my colleagues I'm closer to.

519
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,120
We really don't need to waste that much money.

520
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,100
I'm telling you. You guys are young

521
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,760
and don't think deeply enough. You are a manager after all.

522
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,100
You must have clients and such. You have to have this personal touch toward others.

523
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,840
Otherwise, people will talk about you.

524
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,800
It's settled. We'll do at least sixty boxes.

525
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,390
Weiwei, figure out the numbers when you get back.

526
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,850
If you should be giving it to them, don't let them slip through the cracks. It's not worth it to offend someone.

527
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:16,600
If it's money that should be spent, then Haoyi absolutely cannot be pinching pennies. Got it?

528
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,820
Got it.

529
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,190
You'll pay for the engagement cakes yourself.

530
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,370
Dad, really?

531
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,340
Not really.

532
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,340
Chairman, are you sure you want me to lead this project?

533
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,140
Rest assured, I will report to you at any time.

534
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,580
Yes, James already sent the files over.

535
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,320
Yes, I will handle it.

536
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,690
Yes, Chairman.

538
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,900
That's weird. Why is Jessica looking for us?

539
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,900
Did we mess up recently?

540
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,050
I don't think so.

541
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,610
Could it be the incident with Gao Ziyuan?

542
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,220
Hey, don't look at me. My lips are sealed. I didn't say a word.

543
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,320
Forget it. It's useless if we guess. We'll find out soon.

544
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,790
You guys are all here. Take a look at the files on the table.

545
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,930
This is a new project that the company is developing.

546
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,190
It requires a large number of funds, so we found a venture capital company to help us increase our capital.

547
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,840
Their staff will be meeting with us soon.

548
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,980
Why are we being involved with this?

549
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,300
If the company wants you to do something, does it need to first obtain your approval?

550
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,430
Just do what you're told.

551
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,600
Yes.

552
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,330
Come in.

553
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,950
Director, Guoxin Venture Capital's staff has arrived.

554
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,820
Okay, let them in.

555
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,690
Please come in.

556
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,160
Thank you.

CEO Chu, nice to meet you. I'm Jessica.

558
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,840
Hello, we meet at last. You can call me Kehuan.

559
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,200
Okay. Come, take a seat. Welcome.

560
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,620
Thank you.

561
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,830
CEO Chu, let me introduce you to my team.

562
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,310
This is Meiling,

563
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,270
Kefei,

564
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,560
and our project contact, Zhou Weiwei.

565
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,180
Zhou Weiwei, why are you sitting down?

566
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,750
- Let me introduce our team members.<br>- Okay.

567
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,950
This is James, and this is Fanfan.

568
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,550
They will assist in the completion of this collaborative project.

569
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,120
Our chairman said he considers this project a top priority

570
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,960
and personally assigned it to me, so over the next few months

571
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,500
I will frequently appear at your office.

572
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,280
Okay. Okay, great!

573
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,700
Everyone, relax and take a seat. CEO Chu,

574
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,550
if you come to our company, I will definitely treat you for coffee.

575
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,780
Zhou Weiwei, take a seat.

576
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:28,810
Jessica, I want to withdraw from this team.

577
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,140
Zhou Weiwei, the chairman handpicked this team.

578
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:47,710
If you want to withdraw, go tell the chairman.

579
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,260
Okay.

580
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,040
If you take one step out of this room,

581
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,720
I will break your legs.

582
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,360
CEO Chu, our company's employees just love to joke around. I'm laughing so much my stomach hurts.

583
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,890
She's really testing my patience.

584
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,690
I almost don't have any patience left.

585
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,740
Okay, I would like to officially announce that for this special project,

586
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,550
CEO Chu will take full responsibility.

587
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,010
CEO Chu calls the shots.

588
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,720
As for additional workplace education for our company's employees,

589
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:35,090
I will see to it that it is reinforced.

590
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,770
Okay, let's start the meeting.

591
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,550
I'm sorry, please wait for me. Thank you.

592
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,170
There's no more room at the back.

593
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,270
I'm sorry.

594
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,000
Excuse me.

595
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,730
CEO Chu, you went a bit too far there.

598
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,190
What are you doing?

599
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,580
It's only the first day and you're already pulling tricks out of your sleeve with no restraint.

600
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,700
Aren't you the same? Otherwise, during the meeting, you wouldn't have so plainly said that you're quitting.

601
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,380
Don't get so close to me!

602
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,510
Could it be that you even think I arranged Hualai and Guoxin's collaboration?

603
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,740
Is that not the case?

604
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,000
Am I that idle?

605
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,700
You look very idle! Also, you knew that you were coming to my company, didn't you?

606
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:54,090
Are you saying that if I knew about it ahead of time, I should've deliberately declined the opportunity? Is that what you want me to do?

607
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,310
I don't want you to do anything!

608
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,400
That better be it. Lately, someone keeps reminding me that I'm not that great,

609
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,920
so I've been obediently following my company's orders according to procedure. Whatever they want me to do, I do it.

610
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,740
This doesn't go so far as to hurt anyone, does it? Even if it does hurt someone, that was not my original intention.

611
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,150
Stop acting innocent!

612
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,600
I'm not acting innocent!

613
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,170
Sir, what's wrong? What happened?

614
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,890
I apologize, I'm not too familiar with your company's elevator.

615

616
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,670

617

and your fellow Yan Baiyang for looking for Haoyi.

619
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,120
He wanted Haoyi to hang onto me tightly,

620
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,590
so we decided to get married two months from now.

621
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:01,650
Whether you came to our company intentionally or unintentionally, actively or passively,

622
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,080
your plot won't be successful, because

623
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:12,340
I am getting married. Aren't you going to congratulate me?

624
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,450
Okay. Congratulations to you,

625
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,830
but you don't need to explain so much to me.

626
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:28,580
It's none of my business when you're getting married. Furthermore, you don't need my approval to get married.

627
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,220
I'm not explaining anything to you. I just want to clear things up with you. That's all.

628
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,200
Then, let me give you a refresher. We are work partners,

629
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,820
so everything I do for my work partners also applies to you.

630
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,090
Encouragement, recognition, and punishment.

631
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,820
Therefore, I hope that you won't overthink it and act normally. I believe that

632
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,800
we will have a very pleasant collaboration, partner.

633
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,760
We're not partners.

634
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,460
We just accidentally started working together. Also,

635
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,880
I will stay far, far away from you.

636
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,820
Manager Zhou,

637
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,930
before you leave work, I need the company's detailed customer base analysis data. I'll leave it to you.

638
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,980
Yes, CEO Chu.

639
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,900
Also,

640
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,320
I, Chu Kehuan,

641
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,080
will do as I promised.

642
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,160
What are you saying? I don't understand.

643
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,460
That's fine as long as I understand.

644
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,770
It really isn't like that. I just thought it would be good for both you and Sister Ziyuan.

645
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,270
I did it for the two of you.

646
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,850
Whether you did it for the two of us or not,

647
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,450
the fact of the matter is that you don't trust me.

648
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,320
Of course, I trust you.

649
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,710
Then, why don't you trust in the choices I make?

650
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:10,290
Why don't you trust that the choices I make are the best option for Ziyuan and myself?

651
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,910
Boss.

652
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,420
It doesn't matter anymore since you already did it.

653
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:29,000
In investment terms, this will be the time to review the outcome.

654
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,310
What do you mean?

655
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:38,580
Baiyang, I know that you've been with me for a long time,

656
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,010
but you seem to have never been on the same wavelength when dealing with me.

657
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,720
You work hard and you're not bad at all,

658
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:51,630
but I believe that being with the right boss will be better for your future.

659
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,160
Boss.

660
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,080
Go back to the equity security company.

661
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,030
You still have a lot to learn.

662
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,960
I spoke with Shuming already. I believe he'll take good care of you.

663
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,910
You don't need to come to work tomorrow.

664
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:29,500
Gao Ziting, why don't you cover this meal today?

665
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:35,680
I want you to experience what it's like to be an adult with personal responsibilities.

666
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,660
This restaurant is so far and so expensive.

667
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,080
It's going to cost me quite a bit, isn't it?

668
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:48,690
It's not bad. Compared to what your brother-in-law and I used to pay for you, this isn't much.

669
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,310
Stop pretending, Gao Ziyuan.

670
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:57,510
"Be an adult with personal responsibilities"? I'll send those same words straight back to you.

671
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:01,900
Also, stop calling Brother Kehuan my brother-in-law. Hearing that makes me feel uncomfortable.

672
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,660
Your credit cards got shredded, huh?

673
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,610
Gao Ziting,

674
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,030
you're not even willing to save this last bit of pride for me?

675
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,490
I'm not trying to make you lose face.

676
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,890
I just want you to bravely face reality. Are you really nothing without Chu Kehuan?

677
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:34,650
Go find a job. You can make a living for yourself.

678
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:42,220
Realize your full potential and lighten the load on Brother Kehuan. Let him see your merits.

679
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,320
Perhaps then, you'll have one last chance.

680
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,540
<i>(Coronation.Lace Bridal)</i>

681
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,790
Miss Gao, are you here to apply?

682
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,690
I heard the company is recruiting, right?

683
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,560
A perfect wedding must have perfect planning prior to the event.

684
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:18,000
There must be smooth communication with the newlyweds. Most importantly, the concept and...

685
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,100
<i>♫ I can only rely on my dreamland ♫</i>

686
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:33,650
<i>♫ You must have heard them say that I speak of you ♫</i>

687
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,020
<i>♫ It's just like how you look for them to vent about the past ♫</i>

688
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,210
This slide shows our company's four biggest flagship features.

689
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,950
The first one is super AI technology. Using AI algorithms, we can intelligently create

690
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,120
3D models of faces and take unique selfies.

691
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,060
The second one is infrared rays. The top configuration of infrared rays...

692
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:56,800
<i>♫ Yearning is like a song, playing in a loop ♫</i>

693
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,720
<i>♫ The prelude is just meant to set off the chorus ♫</i>

694
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:08,800
<i>♫ When memories boil out, paired with a husky timbre ♫</i>

695
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,210
<i>♫ It covers up all the yearning and reluctance to part ♫</i>

696
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,950
<i>♫ Listening to this song, hearing the bitterness <br>between the lines ♫</i>

697
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,170
<i>♫ Choosing to let go because it was so happy before ♫</i>

698
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:32,020
<i>♫ Both of us have new choices, feelings are no longer being dragged ♫</i>

699
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:40,640
<i>♫ When the melody plays, I finally understand, what about you? ♫</i>

700
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:48,830
<i>♫ What about you? ♫</i>

701
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,750
Okay, everyone must be tired.

702
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,400
Let's go. I'll treat everyone to a nighttime snack.

703
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,020
- That's great.<br>- I'm going to die of exhaustion.<br>- I'm so hungry.

704
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,590
I need to get drunk tonight. Today was so stressful for me.

705
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,790
- I'm so tired.<br>- I'll help you clean this up.<br>- Izakaya.

706
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,790
Miss!

707
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,990
Where are you going?

708
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,010
I don't want to eat. I'm going home.

709
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,010
Can you not be so difficult?

710
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:26,970
The more difficult you are, the more it shows that something's off with you. Didn't you already clear things up?

711
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,030
I'm not being difficult. I just don't trust him.

712
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,020
I don't trust you.

713
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,060
Han Kefei.

714
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,460
What I mean is, you have to trust yourself.

715
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,830
Just don't get confused by his tricks for picking up girls.

716
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,670
You're really—

717
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,860
Sister Kefei, are you guys done talking? I'm really hungry. Let's go.

718
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,740
Let's go together.

719
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,700
We can talk about business along the way. If it gets too late, I can...

720
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,130
I can ask James to take you home. How does that sound?

721
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,330
I'll go get your bag for you.

722
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,470
Let's go.

723
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,540
Let's go.

724
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:09,000
Everyone, let's toast to the one who is getting married. Okay?

725
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,690
Okay!

726
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,320
Congratulations!

727
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,400
I toast to you!

728
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,060
Yay!

729
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:27,840
Manager, let me tell you. Even though I don't know that Li Haoyi or whatever,

730
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,130
he's very responsible for you and loves you so much!

731
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,910
You will definitely live in bliss.

732
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,020
Hearing the word "bliss," I must toast to you, too.

733
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,680
- I'm so jealous!<br>- Congratulations!

734
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,930
- I'm so jealous! <br> - You have to be happy...

735
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,940
- You have to be happy.<br>- I'll toast to you, too.

736
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,990
I'm so jealous of you.

737
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:55,030
Like you, I want to hurry up and find

738
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,340
that Li Haoyi in my life.

739
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,880
Let me tell you. At this time,

740
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,250
I also really want to find someone and bid farewell to the single life.

741
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,310
It's fine even if it's only for one day.

742
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,510
She's flirting again.

743
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,970
Manager Han, I'm different from you.

744
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,160
Right now, I just want to

745
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,460
change my Facebook relationship status to

746
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:24,330
"in a relationship."

747
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,170
- I want to be in a relationship, too!<br>- Just me, not you!

748
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,170
- Not fair!<br>- I want to be in a relationship, too!

749
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,590
You're too much.

750
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,600
What about me?

751
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,130
What about me?

752
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,740
- What about me?<br>- Congratulations.

753
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,870
Let's be in a relationship.

754
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,090
Zhou Weiwei, I toast to you.

755
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:47,850
Oh.

756
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,430
Stop having complaints and objections toward me.

757
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,230
I, Chu Kehuan, congratulate you.

758
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,480
- Drink!<br>- Drink up!

759
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,360
Drink up!

760
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,460
Wow, CEO Chu can really drink!

761
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,400
For someone like him,

762
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,480
let's make sure he can't walk out of here in a straight line tonight, okay?

763
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,080
- Okay!<br>- Whatever you guys want.

764
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:23,130
I'm okay with anything. However, I have one condition.

765
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:29,320
You... need to stop drinking from this point forward,

766
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,510
because you have to take me home.

767
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,140
- No, no! She's married already. Why should she take you home?<br>- That's right.

768
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,700
Am I going to eat her?

769
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,560
Out of all of you, who is more sober than her?

770
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,020
- That's right, she didn't even drink. It should be fine.<br>- Why don't I take her home?

771
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,890
Why would you take her home? She drank so little.

772
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,470
You drink! You drink!

773
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,000
You can't take her home. You can't!

774
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,550
Drink.

775
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,610
- What?<br>- Where are you going?

776
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,300
I'm going home.

777
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,170
I said you have to take me home.

778
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,730
Why do I have to take you home?

779
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,390
Go back to your seat. Go back.

780
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:16,090
Manager, just help us take CEO Chu home. He told you to do it, so do it.

781
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:19,190
- Sit down.<br>- No, no!

782
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,280
Congratulations to the newlywed!

783
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,320
Cheers! Cheers!

784
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,860
Congratulations!

785
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,840
I'm out of beer.

786
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,730
You're out of beer! I'll pour it for you.

787
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,960
Weiwei!

788
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,030
Sit still!

789
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:40,780
Put on your seatbelt!

790
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,370
Weiwei, I'm really grateful to you.

791
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,040
Go away!

792
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,470
Thank you for taking me home.

793
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,740
You're welcome.

794
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,980
Weiwei, I'm really grateful to you.

795
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,940
You're blocking me. Sit still!

796
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,730
I don't want to put on my seatbelt.

797
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,020
No, sit still!

798
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,070
Chu Kehuan, stop acting drunk.

800
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,360
- Give me your hand.<br>- What are you doing?

801
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,180
Thank you so much.

802
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,380
You're so embarrassing.

803
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,190
Thank you for taking me home.

804
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:25,150
You're welcome. Please sit still!

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,980

I'm really grateful to you.

816

Chu Kehuan, you're home!

817
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,920
Excuse me, sir. Could you help me carry him out?

818
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,640
I can't, really. Look at my physique.

819
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,570
- What?<br>- He said he can't do it.

820
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:09,340
Please help me! Get away, you pervert!

821
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,140
Okay, pull yourself together.

822
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,920
We're almost there. Don't fall down!

823
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:22,940
We're almost there. Ouch, my head.

824
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,590
For Pete's sake.

825
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,010
We're here.

826
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,240
Where's your key?

827
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,320
Where's your key?

828
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,570
Where's your key?

829
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:26,750
What are you moaning for?

830
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:51,290
For Pete's sake.

831
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:55,720
Why are you so heavy?

832
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,790
Why are your legs so heavy, too?

833
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:32,010
One, two, three.

834
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,110
Sorry.

835
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,180
One, two, three.

836
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:48,110
Lift your butt up. One, two, three!

837
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,970
Please get up. One,

838
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,460
two, three!

839
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,790
My head.

840
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,980
My hand.

841
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:10,020
Get away. You're so heavy.

842
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,310
My God, what are you doing?

843
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,140
Get away!

844

845
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,900
What?

01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,910
You pervert!

847
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,540
Who gave you permission to kiss me?

848
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:59,210
Your mouth is so stinky. You even started snoring after kissing me!

851

852
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:26,390
<i>Do you think that doing it after you made me angry is going to fix everything?</i>

853
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,840
<i>Let me tell you. Even if you relieve yourself, I will still be full of pent-up anger.</i>
