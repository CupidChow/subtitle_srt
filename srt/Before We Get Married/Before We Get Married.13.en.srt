00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,460
<i>Since you insisted on keeping Zhou Weiwei on this team,</i>

15
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,910
<i>why can't I bring Li Haoyi in?</i>

16
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,820
<i>You said you really treasure your job.<br></i>

17
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,920
<i>I must ask you to leave my team.<br></i>

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,360

<i>what would you do?<br></i>

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>Weiwei, this—<br></i>

21
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,490
Hello? Please go ahead.

22
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,070
What? Chairman will be late?

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,840
Sister Maizi will be late?

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,220
Are you guys all joking with me?

25
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,460
Do you think this is the Oscar's or the Golden Horse Awards?

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,950
You guys are walking the red carpet and competing to see who will be later?

27
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,100
I will start promptly anyway, so you guys figure it out. Goodbye.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,590
Being a CEO is so great! Don't need to do anything and just need to stand there to watch.

29
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,890
Don't you see everyone is busy to death!

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,160
Why are there only a few flowers? Aren't we a big company?

31
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,950
The supervisor is here! Everyone clap! Move aside, Supervisor.

32
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,000
Does the CEO need to handle these matters themselves?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,110
I'm just lending a helping hand. What's up?

34
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,320
Did you know? Today, the Chairman

35
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,200
will announce the CEO candidate for Superpower Huaxin.

36
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,070
And you've been performing very well recently.

37
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,200
Also keeping an appropriate distance with a certain someone,

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,140
it didn't attract any of the Chairman's attention at all.

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,910
So, undertaking this CEO position is fair and reasonable.

40
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,080
Thank you.

41
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,280
It's all thanks to your plotting and scheming to bring Li Haoyi into our team

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,390
that Zhou Weiwei has been keeping her distance from me.

43
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,320
This is all going according to your plan.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,820
You're doing so well, so perfect; zero mistakes.

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,070
It's because of you that I'm doing this.

46
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,040
Exactly, that's why.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,530
That's why I'm saying thank you.

48
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,570
Manager! Manager! Oh no! We're doomed.

49
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,050
Keep calm.

50
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,190
Before the press conference is over, I won't be doomed. What happened? Tell me.

51
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,460
Brother Dawei can't load their results for the press conference!

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,360
Can't load them?

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,960
Liu Dawei, get out!

54
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,250
There's only half an hour until the press conference, and the computer crashed?

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,500
The computer didn't crash. The hard drive is broken. It's being repaired right now.

56
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,330
How long is it going to take to fix it?

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,440
Around thirty minutes or so.

58
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,730
The press conference is going to begin in thirty minutes. Can you fix this before it begins?

59
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,160
I hope so.

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,290
You hope so?

61
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,890
You're very composed. You better stay this composed till the end!

62
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,860
I have a backup, in the office.

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,980
You have a backup. Why didn't you say so earlier?

64
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,730
Who is still in the office? Tell me now!

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,900
This.. This is the last box. Thanks for your help.

66
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,390
Hello? Kefei? The last box is in the car now.

67
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,820
Huh?

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,350
Backup hard drive? Okay, I got it.

69
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,650
I'm sorry. Can you please take it to the venue? There will be someone at the venue waiting for you.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,020
Haoyi, why are you here?

71
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,790
Dawei told me to come back and get the backup hard drive.

72
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,540
You don't have a key. How could you get it? Let's go.

73
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,140
Get in the car.

74
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,450
Whose car is this?

75
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,730
Mine. I bought it just for you.

76
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,850
You're not planning to walk to the venue, are you?

77
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,560
You won't make it in time if you wait for a bus. There's also no taxis around.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
Suit yourself.

79
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,560
Driving a nice car really makes a difference.

80
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,550
Hello, Kefei? We're on the way to the venue now.

81
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,720
That's great! You guys got it.

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,610
Wait. "We"?

83
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,090
Yes, us. I'm in Haoyi's car.

84
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,290
<i>You're in 321's car?</i>

85
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,880
Wasn't 321 just here? How could he be in a car?

86
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,900
Don't tell me you two are riding a bike.

87
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,420
No, he bought a car.

88
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,830
Did Haoyi get the backup hard drive yet?

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,050
It should be on time.

90
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,380
Wait!

91
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,680
<i>You told Haoyi to go back for the hard drive?</i>

92
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,240
- <i>Hey!</i><br>- It's good. Take a look.

93
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,730
It's fixed!

94
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,130
Oh my God, Zhou Weiwei! We fixed it.

95
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,120
What? It's fixed?

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,470
Okay, we'll be there soon. You two go back to work.

97
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,600
The hard drive is fixed?

98
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,720
The press conference is about to start. We should hurry and go there.

99
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,020
We're not the main leads and we don't need to be on stage.

100
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,290
It makes no difference if we go early or late.

101
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,500
This press conference is very important to me.

102
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,870
I don't want to be late. I also don't want to be absent.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,720
I actually wanted to buy a car a long time ago, you know that?

104
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,140
But in the past, I always thought it was too expensive. I couldn't bring myself to buy it.

105
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,580
Now that I think about it, I was really stupid.

106
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,960
In order to save money, I didn't want to buy anything.

107
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,830
I gave up everything that I wanted.

108
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,600
In the end, I was given up by the person I love.

109
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,720
Do we have to discuss this right now?

110
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,070
Then, when should we discuss it?

111
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,840
Li Haoyi--

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,630
You know I actually don't have many friends.

113
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,040
So after we broke up, I didn't have anyone I could talk to.

114
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,790
Yet you could go around telling everyone how terrible I was.

115
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,020
I've never said anything about you to anyone.

116
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,580
- Li Haoyi, right now, can you...<br> - Can you not talk about these things?

117
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,770
I know. You're too lazy to talk to me now.

118
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,360
You even hate hearing my voice and seeing my face.

119
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,690
That's not true.

120
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,070
You don't even want to get into my car.

121
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,650
Three years of being together and you don't even dare get into my car.

122
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,090
Li Haoyi, it's not that I don't dare get in your car.

123
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,130
It's just that I don't want us to be this awkward.

124
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,080
It was like this at the restaurant the other day, too.

125
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,220
You ran away right when you saw me. Am I that scary?

126
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,190
We were together for three years. Three years! And you're that scared of me!

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,520
Calm down. You're driving too fast!

128
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,710
Don't you want to get there sooner?

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,780
Meiling, step aside and talk to me for a minute.

130
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,400
- What's wrong? <br> - Have you seen Zhou Weiwei?

131
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,110
Manager... I haven't seen her all day.

132
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,970
You haven't see her at all?

133
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,100
No worries. You can go back to work.

134
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,040
Okay.

135
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,720
Hi, CEO Chu. Long time no see.

136
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,490
- Long time no see. <br> - Congratulations!

137
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,860
Thank you.

138
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,280
Li Haoyi, where are you driving to?

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,450
You're driving the wrong direction! This is not going towards the press conference's location.

140
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm not driving to the wrong place. We're not going to the press conference.

141
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,700
The hard drive is fixed anyway. What's the point in us going?

142
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,310
Oh, I understand. You want to see Chu Kehuan go onstage, right?

143
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,740
That's right! Sister Maizi did mention it. Today, the board of directors will announce that Chu Kehuan

144
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,750
is taking office as CEO of the subsidiary company.

145
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,970
Did you want to see his grand entrance to the stage?

146
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,400
Or did you want to see my haggard self?

147
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,450
CEO Chu! CEO Chu! The press conference is starting. You should take your place.

148
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,790
Okay, then can you call Zhou Weiwei for me? Tell her the press conference is starting.

149
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,600
- Okay? I'm leaving it to you. <br> - Okay.

150
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,750
Next, let's welcome the youngest and most handsome CEO,

151
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,810
Guoxin Venture Capital's Chu Kehuan. Let's give him a round of applause!

152
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,970
Li Haoyi, where exactly are you taking me right now?

153
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,110
<i>I am telling you right now I don't care about anything at all.</i>

154
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,930
<i>I only care about you!</i>

155
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,560
<i>Can you please not drive so fast? It's very dangerous!</i>

156
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,220
<i>I'm begging you. Please take me back.</i>

157
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,160
<i>I won't take you back.</i>

158
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,910
<i>Where exactly are you taking me?!</i>

159
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,530
<i>I won't take you back!</i>

160
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm taking you away!

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,650
<i>The three years of feelings between us... We ought to be the ones who are most trusted and extremely close to each other. </i>

162
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,420
<i>What about the outcome?</i>

163
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,520
You have regarded me as a terrifying lover.

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm keeping my distance with you

165
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,330
because I don't want to give you... an unnecessary expectation.

166
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,810
Do you know what my expectation is?

167
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,690
I just wanted to be with you.

168
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,800
Is this unnecessary?

169
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,790
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

170
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,230
<i>To the mountain. Didn't you always want to go to Wulai to soak in a hot spring?</i>

171
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,160
<i>I could only ride a motorbike before. I felt sorry for you</i>

172
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,300
<i>and did not wish to let you be windswept and battered by rain together with me. </i>

173
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,840
Right now, it's different. You see? I have a car.

174
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,700
Isn't it comfortable sitting in a car?

175
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's go. We're going to the mountain for the hot spring.

176
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,850
What are you doing? Zhou Weiwei!

177
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,100
Zhou Weiwei, where are you going?

178
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,390
Li Haoyi, let go of me!

179
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,850
I'm taking you to the hot springs. Why are you leaving?

180
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,550
Even if I want to go to the hot springs, it shouldn't be like this. You're forcing me!

181
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,200
Wasn't this your wish? Now that I brought you here, why are you leaving?

182
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,520
I don't want to. Let go of me! I don't want to!

183
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,120
Get over here!

184
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,730
Let go of me.

185
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,930
Li Haoyi, let go of her!

186
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,190
Give it back to me.

187
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,240
Let go of her!

188
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,110
You called him?

189
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,330
I brought you out and you called him for help?

190
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,690
Li Haoyi, you constantly said that you loved Zhou Weiwei.

191
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,220
Look at how you scared her.

192
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,330
Get out of the way.

193
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,320
Stop coming over!

194
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,730
I'm warning you. If you come any closer, I'm calling the police.

195
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,320
Call the police? Okay, go ahead.

196
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,570
Just right, we can set up a press conference at the police station.

197
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,360
Let everyone in the world know what you two did.

198
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,870
A dignified CEO from a publicly-listed company

199
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,460
is a homewrecking piece of trash!

200
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm warning you. Stay away from Zhou Weiwei.

201
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,240
Don't forget. We work in the same company.

202
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,920
Then let's see you try.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,910
♫ <i>Love runs too deep</i> ♫

204
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,930
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

205
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,210
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

206
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,830
Are you okay?

207
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm fine.

208
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,390
Did you run out of the press conference?

209
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,820
As long as you're okay.

210
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,230
Why did I call you?

211
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,220
If you didn't call me, who can you call?

212
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,390
Calling anyone else will be okay, just not you.

213
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,780
Hello, Kefei?

214
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,100
<i>Zhou Weiwei,</i>

215
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,900
where did you go?

216
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,600
I didn't see you the whole day.

217
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,740
- How is the press conference? <br> - It didn't even start and it's already over.

218
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,590
<i>Chu Kehuan is a lunatic.</i>

219
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,350
<i>What did he say? We want to let the people of the entire world notice us. </i>

220
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,780
It's all nonsense!

221
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,930
<i>Can you tell me what exactly is going on with Chu Kehuan? </i>

222
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,070
Chu Kehuan left the press conference because of me.

223
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,360
What?

224
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,820
Why exactly did I call you?

225
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,510
Such an important press conference,

226
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,850
an investment of several billion.

227
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,910
What am I doing?

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,930
It's nothing. Don't think too much on it. We can handle it.

229
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,750
Handle what?

230
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,370
It's all your fault!

231
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,070
What does this have to do with me?!

232
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,930
If you had told me earlier

233
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,360
that you have asked 321 to go back and get the backup hard disk,

234
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,520
I wouldn't have told Zhou Weiwei to stay at the office to look for it.

235
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,070
The two of them wouldn't have met.

236
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,060
Zhou Weiwei wouldn't have gotten into 321's car.

237
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,710
Or you shouldn't have fixed that damn hard drive.

238
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,240
This way 321 would have then brought the backup hard disk to the conference hall.

239
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,650
Chu Kehuan wouldn't have gotten on stage and then left.

240
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,330
You can even blame me for this? This woman is seriously...

241
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm seriously what? Tell me clearly.

242
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,710
Are you okay?

243
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,730
Zhou Weiwei, it's because of you again.

244
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,630
This whole thing is because of you, did you know?

245
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,450
You can't blame her. What happened can't be blamed on her.

246
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,650
Chu Kehuan, because of this woman, do you really want to

247
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,840
get yourself lectured by the Chairman

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,770
and bring shame and ruin to your reputation? Does that mean nothing to you?

249
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,400
I will take responsibility for the things that I did.

250
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,330
Regardless of what the outcome is, I will be most willing to assume the responsibility fully.

251
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,570
So touching.

252
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,950
I really feel very touched.

253
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,720
I'll get to work.

254
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,380
How come CEO Chu hasn't appeared yet?

256
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,960
I heard CEO Chu is going to be fired because of the manager.

257
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Where did you hear this from? Do you have evidence?

258
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,980
There's no proof to the matter; don't you talk nonsense about it.

259
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,690
Can you not be so gossipy like this, all right?

260
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't think it is gossip.

261
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,810
Chu Kehuan left during such an important press conference.

262
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,960
It made such a huge impact on the company.

263
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,670
If I were the boss, I'd directly fire him.

264
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,270
Li Haoyi, may I ask why Chu Kehuan left the press conference?

265
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,290
How do you still have the nerve to make these sarcastic remarks?

266
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,140
Like this had nothing to do with you, huh?

267
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,750
Yes. It does have something to do with me.

268
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,990
But what did it have to do with Chu Kehuan?

269
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,590
I was taking Weiwei out to relieve boredom. It's baffling that he came out there by himself.

270
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,280
I have seen a lot of shameless people before,

271
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,220
but this is the first time I've seen such a shameless person like you!

272
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,160
If Chu Kehuan didn't go looking for you guys, who knows what would've happened to Weiwei?

273
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,030
What could I do to her?

274
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,900
If Chu Kehuan didn't appear,

275
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,630
Zhou Weiwei would have been bullied by you; ravaged by you and defiled by you!

276
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,970
I bullied her? Why don't you think about it?

277
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,560
Weiwei turned into the way she is today all because of you!

278
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,290
Me?

279
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,300
Yes. You.

280
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,490
Weiwei used to be very good. It was because she lived with you

281
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,860
and saw your messed-up private life

282
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,700
that she ended up two-timing.

283
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,870
- It's all because of you. <br> - Li Haoyi!

284
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,590
Don't go overboard. Don't criticize my woman.

285
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,690
I won't be able to endure someone bullying her. Go and apologize.

286
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,520
You and her... are together?

287
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,940
This is the funniest joke I've heard in this century.

288
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,460
Li Haoyi!

289
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,500
Don't bully my woman. Say sorry.

290
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,800
Liu Dawei, don't be like this.

291
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,820
I...

292
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,420
I treat you as my brother, even this much of consideration; you are also not willing to give it to me.

293
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,000
Kefei!

294
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,180
Kefei! Han Kefei!

295
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,470
What's wrong with you? Did I do something wrong just now?

296
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,520
- Can I not help to speak on your behalf? <br> - Why must you help to speak on my behalf?

297
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,910
You're not anyone to me. Who are you to me?

298
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,130
Didn't we already at an earlier time⁠—

299
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,820
Stop! Please get this straight.

300
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,630
I'm not a pure and innocent woman.

301
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,720
Just because I sleep with someone doesn't make them my boyfriend.

302
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,380
I just simply want to care for you and watch you.

303
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,360
I just want to be by your side, to protect you when you need to be protected. Is that wrong?

304
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,810
Kefei...

305
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,990
Liu Dawei, what are you doing?

306
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,360
This is a public space. Don't do some surprise or something, I don't like it.

307
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,560
Your shoelace is untied.

308
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,930
It's okay now, you're so insensitive.

309
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,760
You didn't even know your shoelace was untied. What if you had fallen?

310
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,830
Such a pretty face. It would have been such a pity if you had fallen and scraped it.

311
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,250
Hello? Hey, Uncle!

312
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,730
You are looking for Weiwei? I will help you to arrange a meeting time.

313
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,800
CEO Chu, your performance at the press conference...

314
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,520
really was hot-blooded.

315
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,710
If it was me thirty years ago,

316
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,080
I believe I would have probably done the same thing as you.

317
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,620
Just that I'm older now and I don't have the courage anymore.

318
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,490
Chairman Wang, I am really sorry about that day. It was my fault.

319
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,550
But I will certainly make my all utmost effort to make up for the mistake that I 've made that day.

320
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,380
- Chairman Wang, you ought not to—<br>- I won't.

321
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,170
You can be rest assured, I will absolutely not withdraw my investment that easily.

322
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,460
- Thank you, Chairman Wang. <br> - Thank you, Chairman Wang.

323
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,410
What I'm most worried about right now is that the public distrust toward you

324
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,120
will affect the company's operation and profits.

325
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,480
If it really is like that,

326
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,930
then I'll truly be unhappy.

327
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,190
Chairman Wang, I will certainly do all I can to make up for it.

328
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,510
I'm sorry, Chairman Wang. I must take this call.

329
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,460
Go ahead.

330
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,970
I beg your pardon. I'll be back soon.

331
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,770
This man is pretty good. He's already having trouble saving himself,

332
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,470
but he didn't forget to take good care of you.

333
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:00,600
Chairman Wang, CEO Chu is actually a very responsible person.

334
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,820
Can I directly call you Weiwei?

335
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,950
Of course.

336
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,690
Weiwei, as a matter of fact, I was already very interested in the project from the start.

337
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,160
But in the end, the reason why I decided to invest

338
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,430
was because of you. I like how focused you are on your work,

339
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,820
and your observant attitude toward details.

340
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,880
I also believe that this project

341
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,390
won't be affected by your personal actions.

342
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,740
But it will... for Chu Kehuan.

343
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm quite straight-forward when I talk so I hope you don't mind.

344
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,860
However, think about it.

345
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,220
A CEO flees from a press conference with everybody watching.

346
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,450
Who would trust him?

347
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,050
Who will still let big tasks with a heavy responsibility be handed over to him?

348
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:00,260
I believe that for him to be where he is today, it wasn't easy at all.

349
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,260
If it is because of getting into a romantic relationship and to be destroyed in a moment,

350
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,560
then it'll truly be a pity.

351
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,270
Of course, if you guys want to date privately,

352
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,470
I have no objection.

353
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,530
But I am a businessman.

354
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,280
I definitely cannot allow my money to...

355
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,440
to be thrown into the water (gone to waste).

356
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,030
What did Chairman Wang talk to you about?

357
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,930
Nothing. Just reminding me of a few things.

358
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,840
What things?

359
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,150
Things about the company. How about you?

360
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,730
What was the phone call that you absolutely had to take?

361
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,830
The Chairman?

362
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,990
Did he say anything?

363
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,180
Just...

364
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,920
Morning.

365
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,710
Why are you so early today?

366
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,340
Aren't you the same?

367
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,140
I'm the PM, you're the CEO; of course, we're not the same.

368
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,640
That's no longer true.

369
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,640
Don't be sorry. It's not like I lost anything.

371
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,990
This isn't considered a loss?

372
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,320
Superpower Huaxin is your blood, sweat, and tears.

373
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,870
It's everyone's blood, sweat, and tears.

374
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,770
I am only bearing an empty title and a reputation with no substance, that is all.

375
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,110
If we must talk about losses,

376
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,300
then it's that we can't start work together every morning,

377
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,520
can't get off work together,

378
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,730
can't eat lunch together,

379
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,540
can't do many many things together.

380
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,210
I also can't be like right now, always watching you.

381
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,860
CEO Chu.

382
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,730
Can you call me Kehuan?

383
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,800
Kehuan.

384
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,920
Also, stop saying sorry to me.

385
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,870
Right now, I just want to cherish every minute and every second

386
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,670
to look at you with earnestness and attentiveness.

387

397
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,720
Morning.

398
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,670
Good morning.

399
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,620
Wow. This is...

400
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,340
Delicious sandwich and sausage.

401
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,150
Here.

402
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,610
Try.

403
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,520
- Good? <br> - Good.

404
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,970
Both of us have requested a leave of absence at the same time, is it being too high-profile?

405
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,400
With great difficulty, our relationship is finally officialized. Of course, we would need to be more high-profile about it.

406
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,430
Just tell them you asked for leave today

407
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,560
to lie in my bed.

408
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,390
I also want to loudly announce

409
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,470
you will be waking up in my bed every day in the future.

410
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,110
We have only slept together for two days, our relationship already needed to have a status?

411
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,350
How is it? Do you have the feeling of being a wife?

412
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,940
Kefei, I hope every night

413
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,390
I can see you before I sleep.

414
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,980
Every morning when I wake up, I also see you.

415
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,340
In the future, after you wear a pretty white dress,

416
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,530
every morning it's you feeding me,

417
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,970
me feeding you, and on the side there might also be

418
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,610
one, two, three.

419
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,680
So... not only will I become a wife,

420
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,760
I will also become

421
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,190
a mommy?

422
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,070
And then you can call me "Daddy."

423
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm sorry, I don't feel so well.

424
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,260
Mommy, you already have one so soon?

425
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,130
Yeah, right, you idiot!

426
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm going to be a godmother?

427
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,530
Nonsense, okay!

428
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,550
I felt very nauseous after hearing those keywords, okay?

429
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,560
Wife. Mommy.

430
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,900
Why are you like this? I think it's great!

431
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,240
What is good about it? As a wife, in that case, let it be.

432
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
But mommy?

433
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,590
If I really do give birth and the son is like him and the daughter like me, what should I do?

434
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,680
Turns out Han Kefei dating can be this cute.

435
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,700
What's cute? I don't want to be cute.

436
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,590
I want beautiful and sexy, okay?

437
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,040
You're the strange one.

438
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,810
What's strange about me?

439
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,060
Because of you, Chu Kehuan has ended up so miserable.

440
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,330
To you, you'd probably blame yourself a lot, be very sad, and very depressed.

441
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,640
But you're completely not, and you were smiling so happily just now.

442
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,310
Is there a solution? Chu Kehuan can get his position back?

443
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,040
<i>(Gao Ziyuan)</i>

444
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
The solution is here.

445
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,340
You're not asking why I came to look for you?

446
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,960
I think I know. We're here for the same thing.

447
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,180
That's also the reason I'm looking for you.

448
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,760
I've already prepared it.<br><i>(Resignation Letter)</i>

449
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,370
But...

450
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,200
you have to promise me that Kehuan can go back to his original position.

451
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,870
As long as you leave, I promise.

452
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,930
You're still scared?

453
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,190
Why are you here?

454
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,810
I can't be here?

455
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,900
This was our usual date spot when we first started dating.

456
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,660
We were so happy at that time.

457
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,520
But how did we become like this now?

458
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,270
I say one thing to you and you get scared.

459
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,400
I approach you and you retreat.

460
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,510
Even if I see you from afar, you'll avoid my eyes.

461
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,570
Why?

462
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,020
Is it because of that day?

463
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,340
I just wanted to fulfill my promise to you.

464
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,990
I just want to do the things I promised you but couldn't do before,

465
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,490
yet you thought I would do something to you?

466
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,990
You're making me feel really sad and hurt, don't you know?

467
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,440
I was really scared by what you did.

468
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,890
Haoyi, I don't know what you want to do,

469
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,260
but you're very emotionally unstable.

470
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,240
How am I unstable?

471
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,270
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,370
I think it's not suitable for us to be talking right now. I'll leave first.

473
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,150
Are you making a call again?

474
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,800
Who are you calling? The police?

475
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,100
Or is it Chu Kehuan again? Here, I'll call for you.

476
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,280
- Don't! <br> - I'll help you call him.

477
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,820
I'm sorry.

478
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,990
Why are you like this?

479
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,310
Why can't we go our separate ways on good terms?

480
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,890
When I needed you, you weren't there.

481
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,490
When I needed you to help me, you couldn't do anything.

482
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,900
When I told you I was tempted, you ignored me.

483
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,880
You pushed me away.

484
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,540
How did I push you away?

485
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,070
When did I ever push you away?

486
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,600
You suddenly went to Shanghai and didn't say anything. Isn't that pushing me away?

487
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,540
You postponed the wedding and increased the loan on the house.

488
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,480
Sister Maizi, too. Isn't this all pushing me away?

489
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,680
There's really nothing between Sister Maizi and me!

490
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,400
And if you weren't happy, you need to tell me!

491
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,040
I told you but did you hear me?

492
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,230
Two weeks after I came back from Shanghai,

493
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,430
you didn't call or contact me at all.

494
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,820
That was the most heartbreaking and saddest time for me.

495
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,410
So those two weeks,

496
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,450
you fled into his embrace, is that it?

497
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,860
I admit. I like him.

498
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,130
My heart was moved by him.

499
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,260
I'm very sorry.

500
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,230
I'm really sorry.

501
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,020
So you guys slept together?

502
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,630
No.

503
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,900
Then, why did you admit to it?

504
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,870
You kept badgering me about the reason we broke up.

505
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,850
I told you but you wouldn't believe me.

506
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,600
Your heart already firmly believed that I was with him.

507
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,200
So I denied it but you didn't believe me, wasn't that so?

508
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,240
You guys didn't sleep together but you like him.

509
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm sorry.

510
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,490
I hurt you.

511
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,450
Then... Then... what if I choose to forgive you?

512
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,100
I can't continue.

513
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,260
Because of Chu Kehuan?

514
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,100
No.

515
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,450
It's because...

516
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,100
I can't continue to love you.

517
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,500
The subsidiary company's budget still has some issues. Please take a look.

519
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,790
Okay.

520
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,200
Also, Meiling, I've already sent you related matters for the project.

521
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,430
- Okay.<br>- Please follow up on it.

522
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,480
Okay, I'll take a look.

523
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,900
Hello, Sister Maizi? Yes, I was looking for you.

524
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,940
Regarding the transfer back to Shanghai, have you considered it?

525
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,770
I'm certain. Okay, I understand.

526
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,840
Thank you, Sister Maizi.

527
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,470
You're going back to Shanghai? Then, what about the work here?

528
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,700
If you leave, who will cover me?

529
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Dawei, you simply don't need me to cover you.

530
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,690
Your capabilities aren't any worse than mine.

531
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,560
You just lack a bit of motivation.

532
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,820
But you have your motivation now. Believe in yourself a bit more.

533
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,260
Kefei, I know you're Weiwei's best friend.

534
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,350
You've always taken care of her. That day...

535
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,240
I shouldn't have talked about you like that.

536
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm sorry.

537
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,600
Who are you? What's your name?

538
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,700
My surname is Li. You can call me Li Haoyi. Please take good care of me.

539
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,720
I'm going back to Shanghai.

540
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,000
Once I hand over my work to Dawei, I will leave.

541
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,450
Regarding the house, I'll have the agency take care of it. Once it's sold,

542
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,360
I'll wire the money to you.

543
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,500
Thanks to you, the house was discounted by NT$8 million.

544
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,600
If we sell it now, we should be able to make quite a bit of money.

545
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,390
That's it.

546
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,990
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

547
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,990
♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

548
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,480
Come take a seat inside.

549
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,780
Do you want anything to drink?

550
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,860
No need. I'm leaving soon.

551
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,500
Why did you suddenly come?

552
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,960
Oh, I know. You haven't seen me for a whole day and you miss me.

553
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,260
You're being so serious about looking at trade magazines and stocks.

554
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,980
Yeah.

555
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,490
I thought you didn't like stocks.

556
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,470
That's not true, I like stocks.

557
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,010
It's very exciting, that's why I was in the industry for so long.

558
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,900
Just that when the interest turns into a job, the feeling is completely different.

559
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,980
And when you're playing with your own money or someone else's money, the feeling is completely different.

560
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,560
If you lose your own money, then so be it.

561
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,460
But if it's someone else's money, it could be money that they shed blood, sweat, and tears for.

562
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,520
When you lose...

563
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,770
Wow! That pressure is huge.

564
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,980
So, if you can't even keep your position as the venture capital CEO,

565
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,430
do you plan on going back to being a stockbroker?

566
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,510
Chances are always left to those who are prepared.

567
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,770
You're that great?

568
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,430
Since you're that great, are you free tomorrow?

569
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,770
To do what?

570
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,630
Go on a date.

571
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,300
Date?

572
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,910
With me?

573
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,230
Who else?

574
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,430
Where to?

575
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,070
To... a place where everyone who's dating will go.

576
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,650
One popcorn, please.

577
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,280
Thank you.

578
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,760
It's Ming Dao!

579
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,360
Is that his girlfriend?

580
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,130
Why does it feel so weird?

581
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,430
It can't be my sister?

582
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,270
Of course, it can.

583
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,990
I'm sorry.

584
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,950
<i>♫ I'd like to hear the details ♫</i>

585
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,000
When can I meet your mom?

586
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,180
Meet your mom.

587
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,850
Meet my mom?

588
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,880
We're on a date so it's like we're dating.

589
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,360
The next step is meeting the parents.

590
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,930
This is our first date, and you want to meet my mom.

591
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,660
Is this right?

592
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,360
Are you sure?

593
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm sure.

594
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,250
I remember you told me before,

595
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,190
Ziyuan's mom...

596
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,770
Okay, fine.

597
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,970
Let's just talk about us today, okay? Us.

598
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,600
I always wanted to ask you a question.

599
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,240
Why do you like me?

600
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,700
Who wouldn't like you just seeing your face on the streets?

601
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,870
So, you're part of the good-looks club?<br><i>(T/N: People who attach great importance to a person's appearance.)</i>

602
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,360
I'm not that shallow.

603
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,650
Then, what is it? You like my body figure?

604
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,390
I haven't seen your body figure so I don't know.

605
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,450
Be serious.

606
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,910
What exactly do you like about me? Why are you so persistent?

607
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,430
I always believe one thing.

608
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,420
If love has a reason,

609
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,250
then it's the same as give-or-take; that feeling is very uncomfortable.

610
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,860
So...

611
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,050
So I like you, no reason why.

612
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,610
I just like you. Is it romantic?

613
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:41,460
This response... I guess I can somewhat accept it.

614
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,590
But I can't completely agree with it.

615
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:52,030
Okay. Then what should we do after the movies? Where do you want to go?

616
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,570
We're not in a hurry. Do we have to discuss that now?

617
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,840
Okay, we're not in a hurry. I'm yours the whole night anyway.

618
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,340
Time's almost up; let's head in.

619
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,320
Do you still remember this song?

620
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,530
Didn't you say that I can't carry a tune? I'll sing it for you.

621
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,370

663
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:10,270
<i>And right now, this is what I want.</i>

664
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,200
<i>But I have to tell you truthfully.</i>

665
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,630
<i>We can't be together.</i>

666
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,880
<i>It's because only two people should be together.</i>

667
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,460
<i>Four people really is too many.</i>

668
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,810
<i>A relationship like this</i>

669
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,150

670
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,960
<i>Kehuan,</i>

671
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,810
<i>I admit I like you.</i>

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,150
<i>I really like you.</i>

673
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,260
<i>Sometimes you're rough. Sometimes you're gentle.</i>

674
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,880
<i>Sometimes you're refined and courteous.</i>

675
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,460
<i>Perhaps it's because you're so hard to figure out</i>

676
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,190
<i>that toward you, I</i>

677
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,510
<i>went from being curious to liking you;</i>

678
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:21,130
<i>liking you to the point that I destroyed my original relationship.</i>

679
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:27,560
<i>I'm not complaining nor am I regretting.</i>

680
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,800
<i>I just think that</i>

681
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,060
<i>I tied up my own hands and feet all my life.</i>

682
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:41,220
<i>I want to change. I want to live happily.</i>

683
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,960
<i>I want to be a happy person.</i>

684
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,250
<i>I don't want to be subordinate to anyone.</i>

685
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,200
<i>Whether it's love or hate,</i>

686
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,720
<i>I want to make my own decisions.</i>

687
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,430
<i>Whether it's love or hate,</i>

688
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,980
<i>I need to first learn to love myself.</i>

689
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,630
<i>I truly hope that</i>

690
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,620
<i>once I upgrade to Zhou Weiwei 2.0,</i>

691
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,420
<i>I can face you again</i>

692
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,970
<i>as the brand new Zhou Weiwei without any burdens.</i>

693
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,200
<i>This is more fair to you.</i>

694
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:33,000

♫ <i>Emotions are being kidnapped</i> ♫

697
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,560
I'd like to announce something to everyone.

698
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,140
The parent company would like to turn the preparatory office into an official new office,

699
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,290
so I would like our office's overall style

700
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,710
to take on an entirely new look and be completely redone.

701
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,230
It shouldn't look as simple as it is now.

702
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,820
- Oh right, James.<br>- Yes.

703
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,130
Help me find a good designer.

704
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,810
The CEO's space cannot look like this.

705
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:10,160
So, I hope that you can have them turn the CEO's space and office

706
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,880
into something more stylish and grand.

707
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,100
The office space for the entire department needs to be redone as well.

708
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,440
This includes the R&amp;D, Marketing &amp; PR,

709
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,390
Planning, and Accounting Departments.

710
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:26,860
Excuse me, Executive Assistant. The newly-appointed CEO is...?

711
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,560
Chu Kehuan.

712
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,860
Who else could it be?

713
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,760
That's right, Meiling.

714
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,380
Help Kehuan find a new assistant.

715
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,470
It has to be a guy. Remember he doesn't eat breakfast

716
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,380
and doesn't like sweets or dairy products.

717
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,240
But every morning he must have a cup of black coffee.

718
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,630
Did you get all of that?

719
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,960
Okay.

720
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,390
I believe that after our Superpower Huaxin rids itself of weeds,

721
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,630
we will welcome a new appearance and style.

722
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,600
Therefore, I hope that everyone can work hard with me, okay?

723
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,440
Then, we'll end today's meeting.

724
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,720
Should we do a farewell party for you?

725
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,210
No need.

726
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,710
Then, I'm leaving now.

727
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,250
Today's your last day.

728
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,620
I heard. It's so fast.

729
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,450
Since I already made the decision to leave, why drag it out?

730
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,230
I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow morning.

731
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:10,100
Destiny in life is quite intriguing.

732
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,240
Three years ago, we came into this company at the same time.

733
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:20,790
Three years later, we're pretty much leaving the same time.

734
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,460
Yes.

735
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:33,860
For us, we're both starting anew at the same time. Right?

736
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,800
This is pretty good.

737
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,580
Where are you going? I'll take you.

738
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,120
Didn't you just get here?

739
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm being transferred soon anyway. It doesn't make a difference.

740
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,930
No need. I'll go myself.

741
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,100
Chu Kehuan is coming to get you?

742
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,540
No.

743
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,630
I don't need anyone to pick me up or take me anywhere.

744
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,110
In the future, wherever I want to go,

745
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,140
I'll go myself.

746
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,970
Okay, I won't pressure you. I respect that.

747
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,450
I'm leaving.

748
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,980
Bye-bye.

749
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,810
Haoyi!

750
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,880
Thank you for the past three years.

751
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,360
Same here. Thank you.

752
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,450
Wait!

753
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,770
Before, I always watched you from behind as you left.

754
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:54,300
Let's make it fair this time. It's your turn.

755
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,900

762
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,200
What's with you now?

763
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,890
Didn't I already tell you? Weiwei resigned today. She must be in a really bad mood.

764
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,090
I need to go home to accompany her.

765
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,600
I know. You can go home to accompany her, but you don't need to take everything with you.

766
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,420
I'll feel very insecure.

767
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,720
Oh, you're using this method?

768
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay, fine.

769
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,550
Okay, I know you like me. You can't bear for me to leave.

770
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,590
This is for you, this is for you. And these two.

771
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,130
- I'll give it all to you, okay? <br> - Okay.

772
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,250
Give me my toothbrush.

773
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,540
Toothbrush.. no.

774
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,960
If I give you the toothbrush, you won't come back.

775
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,240
That's not right. If I don't have my toothbrush, how am I going to brush my teeth?

776
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,240
You can buy a new one.

777
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,930
Okay, fine. I'll go buy a new one. I'll leave these to you, okay? I'm leaving.

778
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,530
- Bye-bye. <br> - Bye-bye.

779
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,780
Hey, there's something else.

780
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,690
What now?

781
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,830
I know you're close with Weiwei,

782
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:38,840
but can you spend Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with her and Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays with me?

783
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,600
Okay, I promise you. I'm really leaving now.

784
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,620
Hey, wait.

785
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,770
Seriously, what do you want exactly?

786
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,880
What is this?

787
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,630
Take a look for yourself.

788
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,180
Why are you giving me your bankbook?

789
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:01,270
I'm a very fair person. I asked you to leave some things behind

790
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,790
so that I can have a sense of security. In order to repay the favor,

791
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:08,960
I want to give you something to give you a sense of security.

792
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,830
Oh, so you want me to keep your bankbook in safekeeping?

793
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,540
My ATM card and seal as well.

794
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,530
Oh, seriously?

795
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,420
Liu Dawei, let me take a look.

796
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,370
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousand,

797
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:33,600
hundred thousand, million,

798
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,950
ten million?!

799
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,800
Where did you get all this money?

800
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,700
I'm a wealthy heir. Did you forget?

801
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,790
I... I'm saying this first.

802
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,650
It's not that I love money,

803
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,530
but your bankbook, ATM card, and seal...

804
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,510
Are you sure you want me to hold them in safekeeping?

805
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:55,530
Is it really okay?

806
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,970
It's okay.

807
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,140
I'm really leaving now.

808
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,180
Okay.

809
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,040
- Bye.<br>- Don't forget to let me know when you get home.

810
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,400
- Okay. Bye.<br>- Bye.

811
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:17,000
<i>Liu Dawei! I love you!</i>

812
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,030
I love you, too!

813
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,970
You're early.

814
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:40,070
Yes, I wanted to take a look at the environment

815
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,420
and see how we can create an interdisciplinary

816
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,540
and luxurious office that suits you best.

817
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,630
What about you? Why are you so early?

818
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,350
I thought that if I came early, I could hand over some work,

819
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:59,820
but I ran into you. I'll tell you directly then.

820
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,570
Okay, go ahead.

821
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:07,560
One, I don't want to be controlled anymore.

822
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,690
Two, I don't want any pressure.

823
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:18,960
Three, I don't want to be talked about like I got this position through nepotism.

824
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:26,720
So, Ziyuan, thank you for loving me for ten years, but I'd like to switch jobs now.

825
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,570
Please deliver these two letters to the Chairman.

826
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:41,370
Superpower Huaxin. Guoxin Venture Capital.

827
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,730
I'm out. Thank you.

828
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,300
Kehuan. Kehuan!

829
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,760
Goodbye.

Hello?

835
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,730
It rang for so long before you picked up? I thought you weren't going to answer my call.

836
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:09,170
How could that be? We're still friends, aren't we?

837
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:13,450
Friends? Don't you know how much I hate this word?

838
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,530
So, we can't be friends?

839
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,730
I'm not saying that.

840
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:26,070
<i>How is it? Have you been doing well lately?</i>

841
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,000
It hasn't been bad lately. I feel quite free.

842
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,900
Hey, you're so rude.

843
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,300
It turns out you left Hualai because of me?

844
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:44,130
Who did it for you? I did it because

845
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,120
if I didn't leave, I wouldn't be able to give myself a chance to start anew.

846
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,520
You make it sound so honorable.

847
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,360
<i>Aren't you the same?</i>

848
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,630
I left first and you followed in my footsteps.

849
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,500
How is it? How's being a stockbroker?

850
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,930
It's great. I'm the top stockbroker.

851
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,040
Congratulations.

852
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,330
Hey, then what about you? Have you been promoted yet?

853
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,710
How would it be that fast?

854
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,730
Then...

855
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,400
When you get promoted to Zhou Weiwei 2.0, please notify me immediately.

856
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,710
I don't care. I'm first in line.

857
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:37,370
Okay, as long as you're not in love with someone else

858
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:41,330
and I'm not in love with someone else by then.

859
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,810
That won't be the case. I have faith in myself.

860
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,600
You won't fall in love with someone else.

861
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,850
That's good.

862
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,740
I'm hanging up.

863
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:05,800
Okay, bye. Take care.

864
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,160

You clearly knew that I was the best man, yet you still dared to attend?

874
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:47,530
You clearly knew that I was the maid of honor, yet you still dared to attend?

<i>confidants, lovers, teachers, and listeners.</i>

877
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,150
Have you been well this past year?

878
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,190
I've been all right.

879
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,210
You never called me.

880
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,790
Have you upgraded to Version 2.0 yet?

881
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,480
I'm at around 1.8 right now.

Hey, you guys are going too far.

883
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:22,340
The pastor is speaking, but you guys are chatting.

884
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:27,390
Hello, today is my wedding.

885
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,290
- Sorry.<br>- Sorry.

886
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,610
I heard Li Haoyi already got married.

887
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,810
What?

888
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,270
Seriously? How is it that you know and I don't?

889
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,710
One of our former colleagues told me just now.

890
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,950
How fast. Look at him.

891
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:47,330
He's already married. Why aren't you working on it?

892
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,740
What does it have to do with me?

893
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,500
I heard that Ziyuan has a partner, too.

894
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,100
I wish her the best.

895
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,160
You're such a gossip. Why do you know all these things?

896
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,110
Come on! This is who I am.

897

<i>Look after her in times of sickness, and comfort her in times of hardship,</i>

Zhou Weiwei, what are you doing after the wedding?

01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,800
<i>Preserve your love exclusively for her in your lifetime.</i>

902
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,610
Nothing.

903
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,150
Continue. Keep talking.

904
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,460
