<i>(Before We Get Married)<br>(Episode 8)</i>

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,280
<i> Recently, someone has been reminding me that I'm not that mighty, </i>

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,950
<i> so I obediently followed the company's plans, <i></i></i>

16
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,260
<i> doing whatever the company wanted me to do. </i>

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,000
<i> Doing this I can't have harmed anyone.</i>

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,490
<i> When you choose to get married has nothing to do with me. </i>

19
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,050
<i> Even more so, whether or not you want to get married doesn't require my approval. </i>

20
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,770
<i>Chu Kehuan, don't you dare act drunk.</i>

21
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,890
<i>What are your hands doing?</i>

22
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,510
<i>Almost there! Don't you dare fall down!</i>

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,820
The product is developed by Hualai.

24
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,090
We know the production schedule best.

25
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,520
Even though your company is counseling us on the capital increase,

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,650
it does not mean that these matters of great concern

27
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,490
must be decided by your company.

28
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,480
Production numbers affect sales. That then affects the decision of the investors.

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,580
There's no way I would put embarrassing numbers on an investment report.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,060
Oh, so it just needs to look good on a surface level.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,700
What if it can't happen?

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,040
What it will affect is Hualai's reputation.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,060
By then, Guoxin will have already finished the project and left the scene.

34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,730
Is this your attitude towards responsibility?

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,340
The valuation numbers on the report were produced by professional valuators.

36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,180
It's not a luxury brand you can dream up! What's more...

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,270
You can't represent the Manufacturing Department.

38
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,960
If you didn't try it, how would you know it wouldn't happen?

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,430
You said it. Don't give people false hope and an opportunity to exploit.

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,220
So I'm telling you right now,

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,010
it can't happen!

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,450
I'm sorry, can you maintain your rationality?

43
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,690
What you're saying now and what we are currently discussing are two completely different things!

44
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,470
You're the one who likes lumping everything together, aren't you?

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,090
You can't still be thinking that I'm using official business for private interests, can you?

46
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes, that's what I think.

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,620
I have always been separating work from private life. From when I accepted this case to every tactic that I've spoken about, it has all been because of work.

48
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,030
No matter how high my position is, I would never take such large funds as a joke.

49
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,120
So I hope that in the future, I will no longer need to make such immature explanations! Is that possible?

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,230
You don't need to be worried about this. It won't happen anymore.

51
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,200
Because two months later, I will get married.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,220
Manager Zhou, I already know that you will get married in two months. Are you trying to emphasize this

53
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,560
to strengthen your own confidence?

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,190
I haven't finished talking.

55
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,020
Because I am about to get married, I can leave at any time.

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,570
So you already talked to 321? Then let me ask.

57
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,410
Which of 321's ABC plans does this fall into?

58
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,250
Doesn't matter which plan, it has nothing to do with you.

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,390
I am not caring about it! You can throw your resignation letter then! I am just curious though.

60
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,490
If you weren't going to get married today, what excuse would you use to resign?

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,940
- Excuse? <br> - Yes.

62
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,100
I just feel like you wouldn't dare admit

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,870
that you are arguing with me right now because you like me.

64
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,850
You want to resign because you're afraid to confront me, isn't that so?

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,150
Chu Kehuan! Where are you getting this confidence from? Who do you think you are!

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,930
It's better than you not having any confidence at all!

67
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,990
Sorry. Yesterday, I really drank too much,

68
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,350
but thank you for sending me home.

69
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,360
See? You're the one mixing your personal and professional lives.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,430
Weiwei.

71
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,720
Shut up!

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,330
Start the meeting! Where is everyone?

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,000
<i>Hello?</i>

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,740
Don't you think we should have another meeting before signing a contract with Dongda?

75
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,320
It's because the information... Hurry and look behind you!

76
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,690
Hi.

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,030
Ziyuan.

78
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,150
I want to tell you that I found a new job.

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,780
I am now a wedding consultant.

80
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,820
The two of you are potential clients of mine, so I specially came here today to

81
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,530
receive some guidance from you guys.

82
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,850
Chu Kehuan won't raise you anymore?

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,150
For the slap I gave you last time, Kehuan did get angry at me.

84
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,600
But after our argument, nothing is wrong now.

85
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,420
Ms. Han, last time it was because I was too impulsive.

86
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,230
I hope you wouldn't mind, okay?

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,920
My god, you're the weirdest person I've ever met in this life.

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,550
You can sit across from me without being embarrassed?

89
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,100
In order to apologize to Kehuan

90
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,770
and to show my sincerity, I decided to come out and work.

91
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,980
I hope to let Kehuan know,

92
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,160
for him, I can change.

93
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,660
Ms. Gao, if you started to work, then you wouldn't casually come to someone else's office and hit them.

94
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,330
This is obviously great.

95
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,760
But to be honest, you didn't come here today out of the goodness of your own heart.

96
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,520
Indeed, I had other motives for coming here today.

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,130
Weiwei, can you be my first client?

98
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,610
Weiwei has not budgeted for a wedding planner yet, but I can introduce you to other clients.

99
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,790
I'm just trying to meet my quota and performance.

100
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,560
I can fully refund my commission for your and Haoyi's wedding.

101
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,720
Ziyuan, thank you for your consideration.

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,200
But I don't think...

103
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,460
Is it because you do not trust me enough?

104
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,240
Yes, it is.

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,860
No, it isn't.

106
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,960
Then it's settled. You are my first customer.

107
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,020
How did this happen?

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,600
Weiwei, thank you.

109
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,410
I'll provide you with the wedding details.

110
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,120
Don't worry. You're very special to Kehuan and me.

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,580
I will make sure you and Haoyi will have a wonderful wedding.

112
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,350
Then I'm going to leave. Bye.

113
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,940
Ziyuan found a job?

114
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,130
<i>Yes. She just called me and told me.</i>

115
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,220
She seemed very happy. She even posted on Instagram already.

116
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
What kind of job?

117
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,920
<i>Wedding planner. She even said she has already found a customer.</i>

118
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

119
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,790
<i>The first customer at the beginning of my career.</i>

120
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,370
Weiwei?

121
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,100
You found a wedding planner?

122
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,710
Wait. Doesn't this mean there will be additional expenses?

123
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,570
Weiwei, let me tell you. My company sent out our new products for testing today.

124
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,830
As we wait for results,

125
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,130
I happen to have some time. I can help prepare for the wedding.

126
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,250
What do you mean by I happen to have some time?

127
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,430
The point is, I can be with you.

128
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,320
Then, we don't need a wedding planner anymore.

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,020
This way we can save some funds for other areas of the wedding.

130
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,980
The wedding planner I found was Ziyuan.

131
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,680
Ziyuan?

132
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,620
She just started to work and we're about to get married.

133
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,890
I was thinking we can return a favor.

134
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,860
That's right, too.

135
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,000
If they didn't sell their house to us, we wouldn't be this lucky.

136
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,770
But Ziyuan has never worked, right? Wasn't it Kehuan who was supporting her?

137
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,460
It must be that they've been together for a long time.

138
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,560
She probably got tired of being a housewife, so she was bored.

139
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,270
It might be. I don't know.

140
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,100
Who called so late?

141
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,720
Hello, Sister Maizi.

142
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,980
<i>Are you available to come here right now?</i>

143
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,200
Now? Meet out?

144
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,790
<i>Yes!</i>

145
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Did something happen to the company?

146
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,770
<i>Does it have to be company-related for me to ask you to come out at night?</i>

147
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,550
I don't mean that.

148
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,650
<i>Don't worry. For sure it will be good news. Let me tell you.</i>

149
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,750
<i> Others don't get treated like this.</i>

150
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,190
<i>I'll send the address to you now, see you there.</i>

151
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,080
Weiwei, I--

152
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,700
I heard it. I'm going to sleep first.

153
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,170
Okay, then I'm going to change. Rest early.

154
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,880
<i>It's your turn to drink!</i>

155
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,590
<i> You beat me so many times just now.</i>

156
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,010
Brother Haoyi?

157
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,200
Over here, come!

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,780
Over here!

159
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,220
Come sit. Don't be nervous.

160
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,330
Sister Maizi, what happened over the phone earlier?

161
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,600
Brother Haoyi, you're the most important person in my life right now.

162
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,090
Sister Maizi, I'm just your subordinate. I'm sorry.

163
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,990
I'm joking!

164
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,040
Everyone, what should we be calling Brother Haoyi now?

165
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,010
Director!

166
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,610
Hello, Director!

167
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,710
Wait, wait! What Director?

168
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,950
Two hours ago, I got a call from a big boss in Shanghai.

169
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,910
He said he's very interested in the product we're developing and wants to work with us.

170
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,130
Really?

171
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,590
And he said, not only will he provide plenty of funding,

172
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,120
but he'll also provide the manpower, software, and hardware equipment.

173
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,850
He just wants our product to see skyrocketing success.

174
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,430
So, someone has noticed our hard work?

175
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,270
Yes, you and your group have been noticed!

176
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,020
Yeah!

177
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,540
Am I dreaming?

178
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,410
I feel like I'm dreaming, too. But next,

179
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,590
I will definitely

180
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,980
sign the contract as soon as I can.

181
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,010
So shouldn't you... drink up?

182
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,080
Let's toast to the Director!

183
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,850
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers! <br> - Cheers!

184
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,060
Thank you, Sister Maizi.

185
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,470
Congratulations, you've worked hard.

186
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,320
Everyone's worked hard.

187
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
You're at home?

188
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,080
You're awake? The breakfast is almost ready. Wait for me for a bit. Take a seat first.

189
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,490
Your milk.

190
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,400
Such an abundant breakfast. Cheese-egg rolls.

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,970
I should feel very happy and satisfied, right?

192
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,270
You don't have this feeling?

193
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,370
A bit. What time did you come back yesterday?

194
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,030
When I came back, you were already asleep.

195
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,010
What did Sister Maizi want with you last night?

196
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,720
Something minor at work. I dealt with it and came back.

197
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,920
What minor matter?

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,840
It's just us...

199
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,580
If it was a minor matter, why did she call you out so late?

200
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,430
- I don't mean that. It's just that work... <br> - Forget it. Pretend I didn't ask.

201
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,530
Should we decide on the dessert menu for the wedding banquet?

202
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,030
Don't we have Ziyuan? She's our coordinator. She should give us some options.

203
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,270
Even if that's the case,

204
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,510
the last decision is still us.

205
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,470
Do you have something to do?

206
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,500
I don't have anything to do. Hurry and eat. It's getting cold.

207
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,340
I think you're a bit weird.

208
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,260
Weiwei, actually, I think

209
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,330
our wedding seems a bit rushed.

210
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,980
Too rushed?

211
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,170
We only have two months to prepare for the wedding.

212
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,940
I think it's a bit chaotic. It's not fair to you.

213
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,510
But I don't want to delay it.

214
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,400
Hello, Ziyuan?

215
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,380
Trying on wedding dresses?

216
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,480
<i>It's a new designer I know called Simon.</i>

217
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,860
His gowns are incredibly beautiful.

218
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,970
- This... <br> <i>- Oh right,</i>

219
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,950
Haoyi doesn't need to work today. Right?

220
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,600
<i>Why don't you two come together?</i>

221
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay.

222
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,000
Today, you don't have anything to do. Right? Ziyuan is taking us to try wedding dresses.

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,570
I still have to go to the company to work overtime.

224
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,810
I feel reassured if Ziyuan's there. You guys can choose.

225
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,620
Hello, Ziyuan.

226
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,460
<i>It's fine. I heard it.</i>

227
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,610
Please tell him to rest assured.

228
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,850
I'll definitely make his girlfriend

229
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,590
the most beautiful bride in the world.

230
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,030
Okay. See you later. Bye-bye.

231
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,690
<i>I'm helping my first client try on wedding dresses. I'm so happy.</i>

232
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,540
<i> (@ZhouWeiWei. #simon is the wedding dress designer)</i>

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm just trying on a wedding dress. Do I need this much makeup?

234
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,810
Of course, your makeup should be pretty.

235
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,940
That way it can match the feel of the dress.

236
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,880
But I...

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,530
Don't you worry, I have planned it all out.

238
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,050
It's free.

239
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,730
Raorao, come here. Show Weiwei the dress.

240
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,820
This is the one I picked for you. I think it really suits you. Do you want to try it?

241
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,530
Isn't this too revealing?

242
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,360
I think it's okay. Would Haoyi not let you wear something this revealing?

243
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,140
If it were my Kehuan,

244
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,240
he wouldn't let me wear sexy, revealing clothing like this.

245
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,910
Don't you think sometimes the way a man shows his love for a woman is quite immature?

246
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,220
Okay, go try it on. If you don't like it, we can choose something else.

247
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,330
Raorao, if you could.

248
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,500
<i> (Seen by 17 people)</i>

249
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,590
He saw it so quickly.

250
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,350
<i>♫ You're distancing yourself from my naivety ♫</i>

251
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,700
<i>♫ I don't question your mood swings ♫</i>

252
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,360
Excuse me, is Miss Zhou Weiwei trying on dresses?

253
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,730
- Yes, she's upstairs. I'll take you up. <br> - It's fine, thanks.

254
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,430
<i>♫ It's like I'm looking at and begging for ♫</i>

255

256
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
<i>♫ is that possible. Yeah ♫</i>

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,420

261
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,810
Excuse me, is Miss Zhou Weiwei trying on dresses?

262
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,630
Yes, she's upstairs. I'll take you up.

263
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,380
It's fine, thanks.

264
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,660
- Sorry.<br>- It's okay.

265
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,040
Congratulations to the groom.

266
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,400
Why would you show up here?

267
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,360
Staring without saying anything is very rude, don't you know?

268
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,880
What do you want?

269
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,520
I find it unfair. It shouldn't be like this.

270
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,190
You shouldn't be trying on wedding dresses. You should be my--

271
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,720
Whatever.

272
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,990
What are you talking about?

273
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,520
You're the one who shouldn't be here, right?

274
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,010
I came here to protect you.

275
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,270
Protect what?

276
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,370
You shouldn't have agreed to Ziyuan's ridiculous request and let her be your wedding coordinator.

277
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,820
I need a coordinator.

278
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,720
Also, I feel that I must do this.

279
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,400
Nothing is a must.

280
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,730
I'm not sure who you're coming as today,

281
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,500
but I'm getting married.

282
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,600
Can you say something to congratulate me?

283
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,390
You're so pretty.

284
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,760
You are really pretty.

285
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,270
Thank you.

286
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,340
Thank you.

287
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,490
Actually, I've been thinking

288
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,970
you and Ziyuan... shouldn't have broken up.

289
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,230
The two of you should get back together.

290
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,340
And then Haoyi and I will get married.

291
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,180
This is the perfect ending.

292
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,280
Hearing you say that I'm very pretty makes me happy. I will remember it.

293
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,940
Thank you. Please leave.

294
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,090
Close the curtains.

295
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,140
Looking at you right now,

296
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,910
I'm unable to leave.

297
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,000
Come with me.

298
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,320
I never thought you would really come.

299
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,620
Didn't you post the photo on the Internet in order to get me to show up?

300
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,540
What in the world are you doing?

301
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,660
Why did you get Zhou Weiwei to become your client?

302
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm a wedding planner. She's getting married. It's mutually beneficial. Is that weird?

303
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,740
Don't tell me you don't have other intentions.

304
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,050
Even if I have other intentions,

305
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,190
I want her to be happy just like you do. Do you believe me?

306
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,060
Gao Ziyuan.

307
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,250
I beg you to let yourself off.

308
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,190
I beg you to let Zhou Weiwei off, okay?

309
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,020
Kehuan, we've been together for ten years;

310
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,060
a whole ten years.

311
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,320
You're so proud that you've never asked me for anything.

312
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,540
Now, because of Zhou Weiwei,

313
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,160
you're begging me.

314
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,260
I'm surprised.

315
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,500
I am so happy.

316
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,260
I'm happy my client is so well-respected

317
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,160
that Mr. Chu Kehuan would come and personally ask me for a favor.

318
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm happy my work is so important

319
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,680
that Mr. Chu Kehuan would personally come to my shop

320
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,230
and beg me.

321
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,170
Okay.

322
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,190
I will accept your plea.

323
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,020
I will work even harder

324
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,550
to prepare Weiwei's wedding.

325
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,670
<i> I find it unfair.</i>

326
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,970
<i> You shouldn't be trying on dresses. You should be my--</i>

327
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,410
<i>You are so pretty.</i>

328
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,130
<i>You are really pretty.</i>

329
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,500
<i>Weiwei, do you like the wedding dress?</i>

330
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,020
<i>There are still many more. Take your time picking one.</i>

331
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,870
You haven't slept yet?

332
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,960
You came back?

333
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,320
How was wedding dress shopping? Did you find one you like?

334
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,030
Even though I like it... But the price... I'll pick another one.

335
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,800
So what? It's more important that you like it. The price is not important.

336
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
The price is not important?

337
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,840
Weiwei, let me tell you good news.

338
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,960
Even though the duties are the same,

339
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,980
I've been promoted.

340
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,060
What do you mean?

341
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,150
The company found a new investor,

342
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,670
and Sister Maizi wants me to lead a team of fifty people.

343
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,590
I'm the director of this team.

344
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,920
This team is located in Shanghai.

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,780
So... After a few days, I need to go to Shanghai to work.

346
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,560
After a few days, you are going to Shanghai to work?

347
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,310
How long?

348
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,360
This project needs at least half a year.

349
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,910
Do you have other things to tell me?

350
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,200
I decided to change our wedding...

351
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,460
What is it?

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,970
I decided to change our wedding to half a year later.

353
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,940
You're flying to Shanghai for half a year for work?

354
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,400
You decided to postpone the wedding.

355
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,030
Are you just informing me?

356
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,530
Weiwei, don't be angry.

357
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,530
I must take this opportunity. I must go to Shanghai.

358
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,010
If I don't go to Shanghai, Sister Maizi will give this opportunity to someone else.

359
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,130
Is our wedding so easily postponed?

360
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,610
Weiwei, I know this makes you unhappy.

361
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,580
- But please wait for me for half a year. I promise-- <br> - Are you taking me with you?

362
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,480
No. Think about it. Whether I'm working here or there,

363
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,210
it's all the same. I'll be out all day.

364
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,460
And if you came with me, I'll be worried that you're all alone in a strange city.

365
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,800
Or that you can't get used to the lifestyle.

366
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,920
We just bought a house.

367
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,960
Do we just leave it empty?

368
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:28,020
So my job now is to be a housesitter?

369
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,360
Don't make it sound so bad.

370
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,700
My salary if I go to Shanghai will be so much more than what I'm on now.

371
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,000
I can afford both our lifestyles. If you don't want to work, you can quit at any time.

372
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,660
If I wanted to be a kept woman, I would never have dated you.

373
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,580
I don't like that you're treating our wedding like a game. Delaying it at the drop of a hat.

374
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,510
I just want to stick to our original plan.

375
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,510
We'll still have a wedding.

376
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,350
It's just... moving it back a bit.

377
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,150
We can use this extra time to plan for it.

378
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,900
How about we go get married in the Maldives?

379
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,890
Or do you want a laser light show wedding?

380
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,960
Or do you want it in a glass church? It's all up to you.

381
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,200
Weiwei, this time I must go to Shanghai.

382
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,320
These opportunities are hard to come by.

383
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,190
Don't worry, I've already talked with Sister Maizi.

384
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,760
I have four days of vacation every month to come back.

385
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,950
After I leave this time, I'll be back two weeks later. Wait for me for two weeks.

386
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,800
I'll come back to plan our wedding, okay?

387
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,050
Then, now... is it Plan C?

388
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,300
Or Plan D?

389
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,180
Whether it's Plan C or Plan D, they all have you.

390
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,010
That's right, I'm in all of them.

391
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,750
I'm cooperating with you in all of them.

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,220
Stop!

418
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,050
Enough.

419
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,150
You should at least prepare first.

420
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,340
There's no need. We're about to get married.

421
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,700
It doesn't matter if you get pregnant.

422
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,290
What does that mean?

423
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,190
What can this mean?

424
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,150
What if I'm pregnant?

425
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,160
If you get pregnant then just have the child!

426
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,460
So you mean that in half a year I need to get married with a huge belly?

427
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,700
Or are we extending it for another year?

428
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,560
Wait for our baby to be born and have the baby's one-month birthday celebration

429
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,020
Or we can combine it with the one-year celebration?

430
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,390
Why are you so angry?

431
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,340
Because you are really selfish.

432
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,860
Do you think that after making me angry you can just do this with me and nothing is wrong afterward?

433
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,430
Let me tell you. Even after you get rid of your desires, I will still be angry.

434
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,960
You satisfied your urges but our problems have yet to be solved!

435
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,150
Then what do you want me to do? Didn't I explain it?

436
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,610
That's your explanation.

437
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,710
I can't listen to that, nor can I accept it.

438
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,350
Li Haoyi, being together

439
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,580
needs two people to be together.

440
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,130
No matter if its lovers or a married couple,

441
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,510
it requires two people to continue the relationship.

442
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:59,480
As soon as there's one person making all the decisions and thinking only about themselves,

443
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,230
then don't blame the other person,

444
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,970
for being immature, angry, and even

445
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,040
doing something that both of us will regret.

446
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,860
Weiwei...

447
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,160
If you can't fall asleep, go and pack your luggage.

448
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,790
Half a year. There must be a lot of things to pack.

449
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:39,990
<i></i>

450
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,120
Han Kefei is pretty impressive.

451
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,370
She must still be angry about that slap.

452
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,110
So she directly went to Chu Kehuan and tied him to our company for this collaboration.

453
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,290
You have to know, the company is acting as the bedroom.

454
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,210
Talking business in the bedroom is so convenient!

455
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,130
It's not likely. She doesn't hold any sway over Guoxin.

456
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,730
It's really important. I'll say it again.

457
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,420
Han Kefei is very impressive.

458
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,460
Who knows how many of Guoxin's executives she's had in her bed?

459
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,590
You know, with her body!

460
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,820
She can do everything.

461
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,730
Let me warn you. If you dare to say Kefei whatsoever, I'll tear your mouth!

462
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,990
I'm so scared.

463
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,500
Let me tell you! Don't let her get with any of you.

464
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,950
The Research and Development team lost one of its important members because of her.

465
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,820
If she continues to get with this team, I'll need to go home and eat myself.

466
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,960
What are you saying!

467
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,850
Are you awake? Zhou Weiwei would never consider any of you!

468
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,750
You two sisters have such a good relationship, huh?

469
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,520
I'll say something about you, and she flips out.

470
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
I'll say something about her, and you flip out.

471
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,910
The two of you cover each other to this extent?

472
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,620
It can't be that the two of you and Chu Kehuan...

473
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,040
What are you saying, huh?

474
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,850
I'm sorry, the cup was too slippery and I wasn't able to hold it properly.

475
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,630
Did I interrupt one of your internal meetings?

476
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,990
CEO Chu, did you hear that?

477
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,970
This is your company's internal issues, I'm unable to take part in it.

478
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,730
You guys continue.

479
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,930
He was attacking your character!

480
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,980
<i>I didn't hear it. If I heard it, he would be dead.</i>

481
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,730
Mr. Chu isn't coming out.

482
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,630
Liu Dawei, our project team is using this conference room. Can you get lost?

483
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,380
She's going to get violent. I'm so scared.

484
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,940
Such a huge conference room is being used by your little project team?

485
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,590
What else do you want?

486
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,850
- Jessica, he—<br>- I heard it.

487
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,380
Your R&amp;D team is very idle, huh?

488
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,900
Do you live by the sea? Your nosiness knows no bounds.

489
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,830
You're even butting into CEO Chu's private life.

490
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,050
You alone are responsible for ruining Hualai's reputation.

491
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,530
Do you know how long I was scolded by the boss?

492
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,220
Ten seconds.

493
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,360
A whole ten seconds!

494
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,400
- Apologize right now! <br> - Sorry.

495
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,980
Not to me! To them two!

496
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,400
Okay, not going to apologize, is that it?

497
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,230
Guys like you...

498
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,630
- are a dime a dozen on the street. <br> - I'm sorry.

499
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,940
Just that?

500
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,910
I won't do it again.

501
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,360
If you do it again?

502
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,630
Then I will pack my bags and leave.

503
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,510
Okay, not bad.

504
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,470
Hold on. Did I say you could leave?

505
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,020
Come with me and apologize to CEO Chu.

506
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,520
Yes.

507
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,690
Chu Kehuan is so sly.

508
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,860
Yelling at people is so tiring. I'm so thirsty.

509
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,430
Hm, no more water? Let's go fill it up.

510
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,890
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

511
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,070
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

512
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,740
Did everyone arrive? Okay, then we can start the meeting!

513
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,730
CEO Chu has new updates he wants to announce to us.

514
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,210
After much consideration, our companies decided to form a subsidiary company with Hualai's new product.

515
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,020
Guoxin Venture Capital will help raise funds for this.

516
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,990
We all want Hualai's new product to enter the market as soon as possible.

517
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,700
Okay, thank you, CEO Chu.

518
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,080
As for the progress,

519
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Zhou Weiwei will report directly to you.

520
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,020
If there's anything else about Hualai you'd like to know,

521
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,700
you can also ask Zhou Weiwei and her team to organize it for you.

522
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,130
As for preparations for the new company,

523
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,000
CEO Chu, you may directly order Zhou Weiwei to handle it.

524
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,470
Jessica, can I refuse this work?

525
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,630
Zhou Weiwei, what are you doing?

526
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:23,890
Zhou Weiwei, you're refusing this work in front of CEO Chu?

527
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,590
Do you want to stun me on purpose?

528
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm just asking if I can refuse.

529
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,990
Then can I say no?

530
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,420
The boss personally requested this team.

531
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,700
It's an extremely important project for both Hualai and Guoxin.

532
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,930
What do you mean by you won't take it?

533
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,790
I was just asking. Since that's a no,

534
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,400
okay.

535
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,570
I'll do everything the company asks.

536
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,170
Jessica, now that we've discussed the different roles.

537
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,770
Let's announce the next stage. It's pretty important, too.

538
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,200
Okay.

539
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,600
Then, from now on, CEO Chu calls the shots on everything.

540
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,410
I will fully cooperate.

541
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,650
Thank you.

542
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,610
James.

543
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,980
No problem.

544
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:37,000
<i> Here's some information and data for the investment.</i>

545
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,870
What did you say?

546
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,630
That loser of yours announced on his own that the wedding would be postponed?

547
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,040
This spectacular?

548
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,130
I'll treat you to whatever you eat today.

549
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,870
You are...

550
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,600
What?

551
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,740
Very unlucky.

552
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,450
What's wrong with 321? He said two months then it's two months. He says half a year, now it's half a year?

553
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,130
You're going to let him do whatever he wants?

554
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,030
What else can I do?

555
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,290
Do you want me to have a wedding without a groom in two months?

556
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,860
You can have a wedding with a different groom.

557
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,560
You should just say "I want to get married right now!"

558
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,620
There will be a line from here to outside just for you.

559
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,020
Over here.

560
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,240
You're in a bad mood today?

561
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,920
Why is he here?

562
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,580
He asked, so I answered.

563
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,980
Why did you tell him?

564
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,450
I'm a person who never lies.

565
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:40,080
CEO Chu, 321's career is skyrocketing and is in Shanghai.

566
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,240
He wants Zhou Weiwei to wait half a year for him.

567
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,180
Meaning her wedding has been postponed for six months.

568
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,710
Han Kefei, not speaking for a second would kill you, huh?

569
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,530
That's the truth, why can't I say it?

570
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,880
You don't need to say everything.

571
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,950
I can't talk? I'll leave then.

572
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,720
Hey, where are you going?

573
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,730
What?

574
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,580
Let's have a talk.

575
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,320
Sit.

576
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,930
This isn't okay. I'm about to get married.

577
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,590
But your wedding is in half a year.

578
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,960
Zhou Weiwei, in the meeting, you said you didn't want to take on this project.

579
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,360
Is it because you do not want to see me?

580
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,020
No, I just did it on a whim.

581
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,450
It was just a slip of the tongue.

582
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,640
On a whim? Why would you act on a whim?

583
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,610
Is it because 321 postponed the wedding which caused you to not be happy making you want to leave?

584
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,860
Whether I'm happy and whether I want to leave has nothing to do with you.

585
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,020
Good thing it has nothing to do with me.

586
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,440
I was worried you couldn't face your emotions.

587
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,730
You'd rather give up your career and future for it.

588
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,380
You are correct. I can't face my emotions.

589
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,320
Therefore, I want to give up on my career and future.

590
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,100
But all of this has nothing to do with you.

591
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,200
Why didn't you give up in the end?

592
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,130
CEO Chu, what's up with you?

593
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,760
I can't do this and I can't do that, what do you want me to do?

594
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,230
I just want to remind you that as a woman,

595
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,970
you should always have your own thoughts,

596
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,250
principles, and life.

597
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,000
Don't be affected by some things that didn't go your way

598
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,120
and lose control of your judgment and emotions.

599
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,880
Then, I have decided to stay and continue working. Is that better?

600
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,400
Of course. But I'm just here to remind you.

601
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,450
Anything else?

602
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,290
If I were you, I wouldn't have allowed Gao Ziyuan to handle my wedding.

603
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,500
It's too much pressure, and too risky.

604
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:40,140
Thank you for your advice, CEO Chu. I will think about it. I'm going to head back now.

605
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,920
Also,

606
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,330
the wedding dress you wore that day was really beautiful.

607
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,060
Look. This is the hotel I mentioned. Garden Hotel.

608
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,740
I spent a lot of time and research to find it.

609
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,850
What do you think? Is it pretty?

610
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,430
Ziyuan, thank you. But...

611
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,070
What are you thanking for? It's my job.

612
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,990
What she meant was, thank you for your consideration,

613
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,750
but sorry, she can't make use of it because her wedding has been postponed.

614
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,100
Postponed?

615
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,510
Yes, I'm sorry for wasting your time, Ziyuan.

616
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,230
Why was it postponed? For how long?

617
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,980
Why are you so nervous? It's not like you can't get married.

618
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,860
Weiwei, did you and Haoyi run into some trouble?

619
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,950
It's because...

620
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,500
Because one of them

621
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,640
fell for another person; therefore, is having some doubts.

622
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,290
What are you saying?

623
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,070
I didn't say anything wrong.

624
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,980
321 chose work, so the wedding has been postponed.

625
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,940
It means he loves work more. Did I say anything wrong?

626
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,200
Weiwei, you don't have to worry about this part.

627
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,420
You can tell Haoyi that all things related to the wedding

628
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,210
can become my responsibility.

629
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:29,470
All he has to do is appear and give you a happy future. Nothing to worry about.

630
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,650
- But...<br>- Miss Gao,

631
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,680
I know at least a hundred people in Taiwan's wedding planning industry.

632
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,040
None of them were this committed to their jobs. There are two reasons:

633
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,160
1. You are a very committed workaholic.

634
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,380
2. You're treating Weiwei as your imaginary enemy.

635
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,290
Men's hearts are hard to predict.

636
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,530
Women should consider all other women

637
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,570
as imaginary enemies.

638
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,790
In this day and age, sometimes a woman's enemy is a man.

639
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,330
Are you going to oppose the entire world? Isn't that tiring?

640
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,790
Thanks for your concern, Miss Han.

641
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,270
But this is honestly just because Weiwei is my friend from university.

642
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,910
I want her to be happy. That's why I'm working so hard.

643
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,310
Ziyuan, I'm sorry.

644
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,560
Honestly, it all happened very suddenly.

645
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,470
I don't have the energy to prepare for the wedding.

646
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,090
So I want--

647
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,730
Weiwei, are you trying to break our agreement?

648
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,100
If so,

649
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,250
I might lose this job.

650
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,670
Please... don't be so cruel.

651
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,590
No. Her wedding is getting postponed. What can we do?

652
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,630
I know. If you're going to postpone,

653
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,550
you can consider a destination wedding.

654
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,770
I'll get some brochures.

655
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,590
Wait a minute.

656
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:07,760
Excuse me. I think someone just told me they wanted to change their wedding planner.

657
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,340
No, but just look at her.

658
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:16,150
Right! Because I'm the cruel one, you're the kind one.

659
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,950
Let me tell you! She sure has her ways.

660
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,120
You're making me so angry.

661
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,140
I'm all packed.

662
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,090
You didn't even discuss going to Shanghai with me.

663
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,520
Why are you telling me now that you're packed?

664
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,830
Weiwei, after I go to Shanghai, you'll be all alone in Taipei.

665
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,130
Am I supposed to be here with someone?

666
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:18,740
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

667
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,340
I'm going to sleep.

668
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,140
So early?

669
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,390
When I'm home alone in the future, I'll sleep early and get up early.

670
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,530
It'll be a better habit.

671
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,930
Hello?

672
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,030
Just a moment.

673
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,390
Who?

674
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,190
Dad called.

675
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,600
Hello, Uncle?

676
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,450
<i> Weiwei, Haoyi is going to Shanghai tomorrow.</i>

677
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,520
I don't know how to say it either.

678
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,490
I already scolded him.

679
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,170
But he just wanted to give you a better life.

680
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,140
<i> You have to understand his intentions.</i>

681
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,740
<i> I know the wedding date wasn't what our original plan was.</i>

682
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,390
I'm the most upset really. I've waited for so long.

683
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,520
You're not even calling me "dad" now.

684
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,950
<i> I'm actually pretty sad.</i>

685
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,200
Dad, don't say that.

686
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,080
<i> I feel much more reassured after hearing you call me "dad."</i>

687
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,180
And also more guilty.

688
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,010
Haoyi and I owe you too much. I'm sorry.

689
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,150
No one owes anyone anything.

690
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,190
<i> Haoyi told me he'll definitely marry you in half a year.</i>

691
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,680
<i> I trust he won't lie to me.</i>

692
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,560
<i> Please just bear with it for half a year and wait.</i>

693
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,640
<i> I'll make him marry you in the most extravagant manner in half a year.</i>

694
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,400
I know. Bye-bye.

695
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,980
What did Dad say to you?

696
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,010
You're too scared to say it so you asked your dad to?

697
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,060
No, I didn't say anything to my dad?

698
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,940
- You know him. He-- <br> - I'm going to bed.

699
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,420
Weiwei.

700
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,590
Weiwei, please bear with it. Wait half a year for me.

701
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,100
I'll definitely marry you.

702
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,190
I won't let you down. I'll make you happy.

703
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,450
I won't--

704
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:59,510
<i>♫ Was it worth being together in the past? ♫</i>

705
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,450
<i>I'll make you happy for the rest of your life.</i>

706
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,980
<i>I'll definitely make our island wedding dreams come true.</i>

707
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:12,160
<i>Just bear with it for half a year.</i>

708
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,570
<i>I'm going to Shanghai for our future. I'll earn money, we'll live better lives.</i>

709
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:23,850
<i>Just think about it. The furniture you want</i>

710
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:27,470
<i>we can buy without thinking too much about it.</i>

711
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,860
<i> Isn't that a great thing?</i>

712
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,910
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

713
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,540
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

714
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,310
Weiwei. Weiwei!

715
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,170
Weiwei, I overslept. I have to go.

716
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,240
Don't you only need to be 1.5 hours early for business class?

717
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,630
It's better to be early.

718
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,400
I haven't brushed my teeth.

719
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,590
Okay. I'll get going then.

720
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:07,680
I'll be back in two weeks. Call me when you can.

721
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,120
Bye-bye.

722
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,430
Why didn't you say you'd call me every day?

723
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,130
321 left?

724
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:44,710
I thought you'd dramatically force him

725
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:49,630
and then he'd stay for you. Then you can live happily like in a drama.

726
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,160
Okay, don't be angry. He's already gone to Shanghai.

727
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,510
However, you're about to work directly with CEO Chu. Can you handle it?

728
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,850
What won't I be able to handle?

729
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,980
No one else is here? I didn't get the time wrong, did I?

730
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,620
CEO Chu, while no one is here, I just wanted to remind you that 321 has flown to Shanghai today.

731
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,170
Han Kefei!

732
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,960
What? I'm telling the truth.

733
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,430
Weiwei is home all alone. Don't you take advantage of that.

734
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,730
Would you die if you stayed silent?

735
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,760
Can you pretend to be mute?

736
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,670
It's not her first time being alone.

737
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:39,200
What's important is where her heart's at.

738
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:46,370
CEO Chu is here already. Meiling, it's time for the meeting!

739
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,660
Guoxin has already found a potential investor.

740
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,730
This weekend, we'll go pay him a visit depending on his schedule.

741
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,320
I hope Hualai can send someone, too.

742
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,000
No problem. Zhou Weiwei, you should go with CEO Chu.

743
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,030
Why me?

744
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,140
Why?

745
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:13,800
Because you're the project manager. You understand the situation best.

746
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,600
Okay, you're the boss.

747
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,440
Jessica, I'll go.

748
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,890
Weiwei has to prepare for the wedding. She's very busy, but I'm free. I can go.

749
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,380
She can still prepare for her wedding. It's only a couple of days.

750
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,880
Jessica, I agree that Han Kefei should go.

751
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,600
The investor might want to know about Hualai's future marketing plans.

752
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,760
Okay, no problem. Let's have both Kefei and Weiwei go with you.

753
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,610
Manager Zhou, you should be more at ease with one more person on board.

754
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:51,010
Thank you, CEO Chu. Whatever you say goes.

755
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,900
Thank you, CEO Chu.

756
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,290
Hi.

757
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,740
Wow, someone's eager.

758
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,890
Han Kefei.

759
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,200
Good morning, CEO Chu.

760
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,790
Good morning.

761
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,190
CEO Chu, were you so excited you couldn't sleep? Are you an elementary school student going on a field trip?

762
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:27,770
I just don't like being late. Get in the car.

763
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,990
Thanks.

764
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,150
Thanks.

765
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,810
CEO Chu, you're so thoughtful.

766
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,410
You opened the door for both of us.

767
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,780
CEO Chu, you should concentrate on driving.

768
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,530
The road's in front of you, not behind you.

769
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,550
Is this clearer, CEO Chu?

770
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,330
- What's wrong? <br> - What?

771
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,160
I don't know.

772
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,530
Let's get out and take a look.

773
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,560
What are you laughing at?

774
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,870
What do we do now?

775
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:14,160
Yeah, it's almost our meeting time. Should we get a taxi?

776
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:19,580
Call a taxi, take the bus, or walk? Pick one, CEO Chu.

777
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,040
Would we be able to get a taxi here?

778
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,890
Could be a bit difficult.

779
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,480
Is the bus stop very far?

780
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,430
Not really.

781
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,070
Let's take the bus.

782
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:34,640
Okay. Whatever you say, CEO Chu.

783
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,540
You can sit.

784
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,660
No, it's ok. You sit.

785
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,100
Bus is here.

786
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,320
Finally. There are so many mosquitoes.

787
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,840
Excuse me.

788
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,210
Hello.

789
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,370
Have a seat.

790
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,260
Hi.

791
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,460
Hey.

792
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,020
Are you still studying?

793
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,240
Yes.

794
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,870
- Do you live nearby?<br>- Yes, I live nearby.

795
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,790
How long will it take?

796
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,570
We'll know once we get there.

797
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,980
Okay.

798
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,840
Listen to some music.

799
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,510
No thanks. I'm going to sleep.

800
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:21,110
Music will relieve your boredom.

801
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,630
Okay. Whatever you say, CEO Chu.

802
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,920
Don't force yourself.

803
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:53,940
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

804
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,500
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

805
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,820
Now what?

806
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,010
We walk.

807
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,900
Walk?

808
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,820
How long do we have to walk? Seriously?

809
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,220
Zhou Weiwei, when are we getting there?

810
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,940
It's really sunny. I'm wearing high heels.

811
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,950
I'm so tired and hot!

812
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,920
We still have twenty minutes to go.

813
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,200
Zhou Weiwei, did you put in the right address?

814
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:50,580
You're the one who gave me the address, CEO Chu. Do you want to check it?

815
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,150
There's no need. You can handle it.

816
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,800
Whatever CEO Chu says.

817
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,210
She ate dynamite, and I ate a grenade.

818
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,880
It's so hot!

819
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:12,180
I can't get tanned. Hello?

820
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,980
Slow down!

821
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,570
Zhou Weiwei, what exactly...?

822
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,620
This person has such a cultivated taste.

823
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Are you sure this is Chairman Wang's home?

824
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,060
We confirmed the address twice. It should be correct.

825
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,560
Weiwei, take a look at the map.

826
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,740
It's here.

827
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,010
Is anyone home?

828
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,890
- Hello, is Chairman Wang here?<br>- Chairman Wang?

829
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,440
We've waited for a long time. Please come in.

830
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,360
Thank you, thank you.

831
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,890
Please have a seat here.

832
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,320
May I ask where the restroom is?

833
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,310
Every room has a restroom. Take your pick.

834
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,180
Thank you.

835
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,590
Thank you.

836
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:17,610
- I'm going to the restroom.<br>- Okay.

837
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,760
Chairman Wang seems to have quite the cultivated taste.

838
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,130
It's vacation-style. Isn't that what all rich people do?

839
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:00,090
Chairman Wang takes good care of himself.

840
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:04,200
He's so young. His back muscles are so defined.

841
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,820
Who's there?

842
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,790
Chairman Wang, are you okay?

843
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,200
Chairman Wang?

844
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,810
Chairman Wang?

845
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,480
Ouch!

846
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,060
Hold on, my... my...

847
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,830
Chairman Wang, I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose!

848
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:53,910
I'm not Chairman Wang!

849
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,090
You're not Chairman Wang?

850
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,550
Dawei?

851
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,310
Chairman Wang is my uncle!

852
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,350
Get up!

853
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,360
I'm sorry!

854
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,690
- Are you good?<br>- Thank you.

855
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,820
I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it.

856
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,940
However, there was a keyword I didn't hear clearly.

857
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,620
Chairman Wang is your...?

858
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,340
Uncle. He was supposed to have come back from Japan today,

859
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,740
but the airport in Japan was closed for some reason.

860
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,380
He told me to come here and take care of the guests. It turns out it was you guys.

861
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,920
There's the bringer of bad luck, too.

862
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,660
Your waist looks like it's in a lot of pain. Do you want to see a doctor?

863
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,740
I don't need to, thanks. Go sit there.

864
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:46,320
Zhou Weiwei, ever since you took Li Haoyi away, first the R&amp;D Department became a big mess,

865
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,890
and then Jessica scolded me badly.

866
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,970
Today, I got injured before I even saw you guys.

867
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,590
Tell me. Aren't you the bringer of my bad luck?

868
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,750
Don't be angry.

869
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,830
I'm the one who made you fall.

870
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:02,270
CEO Chu, I sincerely recommend that

871
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,410
you stay far away from this woman. It won't be good if she brings you bad luck.

872
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,360
- You...<br>- Stop.

873
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:13,870
Actually, Zhou Weiwei has worked really hard

874
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,260
to make it a smooth collaboration for both of our companies.

875
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,430
Also, we were very lucky to encounter you here.

876
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:24,040
I believe that whether it's for the benefit of your company or for yourself,

877
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,460
you will put in a good word for us to Chairman Wang. Right?

878
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,360
Did Chairman Wang have anything to relay to us? Did he say when he would be back?

879
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,390
Tomorrow. He hopes that you will wait for him.

880
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,650
Okay, then we'll stay for a night.

881
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,220
That should be fine, right?

882
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,840
May I ask if there are any inns nearby?

883
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,220
There's no need. My uncle specifically requested for you guys to stay here.

884
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,310
There are a lot of rooms anyway.

885
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,500
Then, let's sleep here for a night. What do you think?

886
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,210
Okay, whatever CEO Chu says.

887
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,160
- Brother Shen!<br><i>- Yes?</i>

888
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,780
Help me prepare the guest rooms; one for the man and one for the women.

889
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,970
No problem. This way, please.

890
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,420
Thank you.

891
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,570
This way, please.

892
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,010
Thank you.

893
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,960
Brother Dawei.

894
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,160
What is it?

895
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,780
Nothing much. Are you very close to your uncle?

896
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:55,130
You're helping him deal with this matter.

897
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:59,820
My uncle isn't married. He only has his sister, who is my mom. Would you say that's close?

898
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,200
Is that so? Then...

899
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:07,060
You could just live off of your uncle. Why do you need to work?

900
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:12,540
You're always finding cheap deals with your colleagues and getting yelled at by Jessica. Are you...

901
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,110
Are you okay?

902
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,800
You don't understand.

903
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,660
This is a sense of accomplishment.

904
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,900
I just like to find great deals on the Internet. I just like to gossip with my colleagues.

905
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,060
I don't go to work to make money, but to make friends.

906
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:34,540
You live your life with so much attitude.

907
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:42,030
Han Kefei, from the things you're saying,

908
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,170
why am I getting the feeling that you're interested in me?

909
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,240
We're all colleagues here. I think that building relationships with each other is a great thing.

910
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,250
That way, it will feel different seeing each other at the office.

911
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,130
Don't you agree?

912
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,470
Yes.

913
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:11,430
<i>We can only be friends. Then, can we be the best of friends?</i>

914
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,360
<i>CEO Chu, you can't call the shots on everything.</i>

915
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,170
<i>I don't want to calm down.</i>

916
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:21,320
<i>I don't want to calm down!</i>
