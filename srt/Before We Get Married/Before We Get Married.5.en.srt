15
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,630
<i>I'm willing. Haoyi, hurry up and marry me.</i>

16
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,840
<i>Let's break up.</i>

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,850
<i> Miss Zhou Weiwei, do you not want to get married?</i>

18
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,730
<i>When did I say that?</i>

19
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,420
<i> I can accept us separating temporarily,</i>

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,250
<i> but separating temporarily doesn't mean breaking up.</i>

21
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,370
Hey, we're here.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,460
Let's not eat this. We can just eat whatever.

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,250
Didn't I say I'll treat you?

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,290
I know how much you earn every month. I don't need you to treat me.

25
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,020
But I'm living so much better than you.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,680
Look at the things you normally eat.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,800
What I eat isn't important. All that matters is that I'm full and can pay off my mortgage.

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
What a coincidence.

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,700
Are you a stalker? Why can I see you wherever I go?

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,980
I swear this is just a coincidence.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,080
Coincidence? Then why did you come here yourself?

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,100
To eat.

33
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,120
Okay, let's go.

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,980
How about we eat together? I'll treat.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,800
- No need. <br> - Okay!

36
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,990
Don't you have no money?

37
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,520
Isn't it perfect that someone is willing to treat us?

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,550
- I don't want to. <br> - Let's go.

39
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,260
We'll each pay our own when we pay the bill later.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,170
It's between you guys that you want to be treated by him. I'll pay for my own portion.

41
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,400
You're really boring. We haven't even started eating and you're already spoiling the fun.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Some things should be settled clearly. No gray areas.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,320
Otherwise, things may drag on.

44
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,750
Okay. Let's do as you say.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,000
You guys...

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,700
What? I'm not close with him.

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,350
Not close? That's right, Kefei.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,640
I was there when 321 proposed to her. The ring 321 bought was the one I recommended to him.

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,830
I sold the house she and 321 are currently living in with an NT$8,000,000 discount.

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,330
Do you think we're close or not?

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,380
Kefei, I will warn Haoyi to stay far away from this person.

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,130
I will also stay extremely far away, too.

53
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,950
Sorry, I have a phone call.

54
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,770
But can you two pause?

55
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,530
Your conversation is too interesting. Wait for me.

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

57
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,070
<i>Wait for me. I'll be there soon.</i>

58
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm so sorry. I really want to eat with you guys

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,030
but I'm in a rush to "buy a coke."

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,080
Hey, Han Kefei!

61
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,780
I really think that you two are... strange.

62
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,550
Han Kefei!

63
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,570
Looks like you still have a lot of feelings for me. Otherwise, why would you not have the courage to even have a meal with me?

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,960
Are you really using such old-fashioned taunts on me?

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,370
Yeah! I'm just laughing at you for not having the courage.

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,640
Excuse me, here's your pizza.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,670
Enjoy.

68
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm asking you where your engagement ring is.

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,230
Shouldn't a person who just got proposed to be very happy to talk about her engagement ring?

70
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,560
Why don't you have any reaction at all?

71
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,700
Here. Isn't it right here?

72
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,470
I took it off because it was inconvenient to wear it at work.

73
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:04,230
If I were you, I wouldn't just leave my ring anywhere. You almost couldn't even find it in your pocket.

74
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,170
What does it have to do with you?

75
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,310
It doesn't. I just want to be nosy.

76
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,460
I'm already finished eating, so I'll be going first.

77
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,420
I have the courage to have this meal with you individually

78
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,850
because I want to prove that I don't have any feelings for you at all.

79
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,550
Here's NT$350 for the pasta.

80
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,270
Goodbye.

81
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm really unhappy today.

82
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,920
But thank you for eating this meal with me.

83
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,460
If you had any more time,

84
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,400
think of it as helping a friend get through one of the toughest days in their life.

85
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,420
I would be very grateful.

86
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,610
Okay.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Tell me. What big event happened

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,600
that made a high-level trader like you

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,430
beg me like this and even use the word "grateful"?

90
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,750
I'm so surprised.

91
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,210
Today, I suffered my biggest loss in the history of my career.

92
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,870
I'll definitely be disciplined by the company executives. My personal life is also getting increasingly complicated.

93
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,400
So, I want to know what you do when you're unhappy

94
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,830
to help yourself get back up and maybe I can try it.

95
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,760
Master, where is this?

96
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
This is Taipei.

97
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,680
No, what I meant to say is where's this? It really hurts!

98
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,420
Master, where is this?

99
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,940
This is Nanjing East Road.

100
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
No, I meant, Master, where's this?

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,390
You use your brain too much.

102
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,380
Use my brain too much?

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,630
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

104
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,580
Are you good?

105
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm very good.

106
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,510
Really?

107
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,560
- Are you okay? <br> - I'm fine.

108
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,520
It's all because of you! Are you happy now?

109
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm very happy. I didn't think you could be so open in front of me.

110
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,490
Yelling so unreservedly in pain.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,930
But I really want to thank you.

112
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,790
Did you know? You're the only person who has made me laugh this happily in these past few years.

113
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,490
I'm really thankful to you.

114
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,220
It's just a foot massage, nothing to thank me over.

115
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,690
But with other people, there are no feelings; but with you, it's really okay.

116
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,580
Isn't it just a massage?

117
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,480
Thank you.

118
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,550
- Mr. Li.<br>- Chairwoman Mai.

119
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,620
- Have you been waiting long? <br> - No, I just arrived.

120
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,250
That's good. My R&amp;D team will arrive soon.

121
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,990
I was hoping we could all discuss and see if we could come up with some new ideas.

122
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,020
All right. No problem.

123
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,610
Let's go in first and wait for them. We can eat and chat at the same time.

124
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,510
Okay. Chairwoman Mai, this way.

125
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,390
Thank you. I heard this restaurant is very good.

126
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,860
- I'm leaving. <br> - Wait.

127
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,300
I told you to come back and grab your stuff. Are you really leaving after you get your stuff?

128
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,810
Yeah, why not?

129
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,240
You have nothing to say to me?

130
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,260
What do I need to tell you? I'm leaving.

131
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,430
Come on.

132
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,850
You're not skilled enough to play dumb with me.

133
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,990
Tell me. What did you do with Chu Kehuan after I left the restaurant?

134
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,730
What was I supposed to be doing with Chu Kehuan?

135
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,540
I haven't even scolded you yet. You ditched me and left on your own.

136
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,400
Please, I left because...

137
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,810
Hello? Staying there would've made me the biggest third wheel.

138
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,710
Stop lying. Chu Kehuan is obviously pursuing you.

139
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,590
He's not. I'm about to get married.

140
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:11,360
You marrying 321 is a future matter. Chu Kehuan pursuing you is a current matter.

141
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,000
Frankly, even if you were married

142
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,990
you can't stop someone from pursuing you.

143
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,420
Can we not talk about this topic?

144
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Why can't we talk about this topic? Is it because I hit the nail on the head?

145
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,250
No.

146
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,990
I'm right. What are your feelings on this?

147
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,050
Is your heart beating like crazy?

148
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,340
No. I already accepted Haoyi's proposal.

149
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,410
Why would my heart be beating?

150
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:03,200
Then tell me. What if 321 didn't propose to you? What would you do?

151
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,730
I saw your eyes light up. That means you would've jumped in headfirst, right?

152
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,920
Stop answering your own questions. You're not me.

153
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,020
Because I'm not you, I can see things more clearly.

154
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,480
The chemistry between you two is clear. You're more than friends, almost lovers.

155
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,870
We're not.

156
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,160
Let me tell you again... No means no.

157
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,270
Tell me honestly. Do you really love 321?

158
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,070
Is he really your ideal husband?

159
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,250
Yes, he is.

160
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,840
Bye.

161
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,720
- You're lying. <br> - I'm not.

162
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,780
You are.

163
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,530
Whatever you say.

164
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,580
You want to resign? Why?

165
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,660
I'm about to get married.

166
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,520
When did you get a girlfriend?

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm sorry. I kept it from you guys for three years.

168
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,040
Three years... Three years.

169
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,220
That's not right. Even if you're getting married, why do you have to resign?

170
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,430
You know that we have a lot of projects that we need to rush.

171
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,660
It's because my fiancée is also your coworker.

172
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,420
Coworker?

173
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,110
Who?

174
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,740
Zhou Weiwei.

175
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,240
Zhou Weiwei.

176
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,490
Zhou Weiwei! You really are something. You took care of my Li Haoyi just like that.

177
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,670
You even made him resign for you?

178
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,180
He's resigning?

179
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,980
Don't tell me you didn't know.

180
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,140
If you guys are getting married, the one leaving should be you. Why would it be Haoyi?

181
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,430
You don't know how important he is to our R&amp;D department.

182
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,980
Sister Weiwei, you're going to marry Li Haoyi?

183
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,860
No such thing. Go do your work!

184
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,890
Dawei...

185
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,770
You don't have to explain anything to him.

186
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,470
Brother Dawei, her getting married is none of your business.

187
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,570
Do you really have to come to our office and get all worked up?

188
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,430
Okay, Zhou Weiwei. I underestimated you.

189
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,270
But our R&amp;D department is a mess now!

190
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,850
I don't think you know how hard it is to find a good engineer.

191
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,610
Now that Li Haoyi is leaving because of you, if we can't find a suitable person to replace him

192
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,700
and all our department's projects get delayed, it's all on you!

193
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,130
Sorry.

194
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,910
Why are you apologizing to him?

195
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,170
If your department has to delay the whole project because of Li Haoyi resigning,

196
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,150
is everyone else in your department a pig? Why are you so envious they are getting married?

197
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,710
You stayed single for so long that you have some mental problems? If you have the ability, go find someone to get married.

198
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,240
- If I want to get married, I wouldn't find someone like Zhou- <br> - Keep going.

199
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,050
Keep talking. If you dare to keep going, I'll rip your mouth.

200
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,080
If Li Haoyi is willing to sacrifice himself for Zhou Weiwei,

201
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,170
then that's our Zhou Weiwei's ability. What does it have to do with you?

202
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,290
That's enough, Kefei. Stop talking.

203
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,200
Go back to your office right now, immediately, at once.

204
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,240
Otherwise, I'll report to our boss and say you're disrupting our office's peace and harassing female employees.

205
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,550
You're ruthless.

206
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,640
What are you guys looking at? Have you never seen me mad? Get to work!

207
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,310
This 321 has guts. I mentioned it to him not too long ago and then he resigned.

208
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,680
You were the one who told him to resign?

209
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,540
Yeah, he didn't tell you?

210
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,200
Wow, this guy really has problems.

211
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,540
He resigned without even discussing it with you?

212
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,690
Boss, HR sent out the announcement. Congratulations!

213
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,650
Brother Kehuan, congratulations!

214
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,190
Starting tomorrow, you're going to be Guoxin Venture Capital's CEO!

215
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,440
Let's have a party tonight!

216
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,880
Thank you, everyone. I will treat you all to a meal.

217
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,170
Thank you, Brother Kehuan!

218
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,690
You got promoted even after making such a big mistake

219
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,910
and the company didn't even say anything. I'm really envious that you have someone backing you.

220
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,390
Someone backing me? What do you mean?

221
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,410
Behind every successful man, there is a strong woman. That's the truth.

222
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,700
Congratulations.

223
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,820
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears ♫</i>

224
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,070
<i>♫ ​don't lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

225
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,070
Why didn't you tell me beforehand that you were resigning?

226
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,740
And is announcing our marriage something that should be done so casually like that?

227
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,140
I didn't say it casually. I wanted to surprise you.

228
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,890
I only feel shock. I don't feel like this is a surprise at all.

229
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,190
Now the whole company thinks I'm the one who caused you to resign.

230
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,460
Let me ask you. How am I supposed to face my coworkers in the future?

231
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,590
Especially Dawei with that face of his.

232
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,400
You don't have to think so much. Us getting married is a good thing. Your coworkers won't make things difficult for you.

233
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Dawei is just a big mouth. You can ignore him.

234
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,370
Okay, let me ask you.

235
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,170
How are we going to live after you resign? Have you found a job yet?

236
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,990
You know we have a mortgage to pay off every month.

237
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,900
We can't have one of us be unemployed.

238
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,950
I already found a job.

239
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,680
I'll be the manager of the R&amp;D department at a new company. The salary is much better than my current one.

240
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,380
I did not neglect our future.

241
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,620
How come I didn't know about any of this?

242
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,670
Don't tell me this is also a surprise.

243
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,200
I feel like you have no respect for me.

244
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,890
Your plan changed, yet I didn't know anything about it at all.

245
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,750
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,750
I didn't plan carefully enough. I didn't discuss my plan with you.

247
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,560
But it's because I didn't want you to worry.

248
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,720
What I don't understand is

249
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,410
that in the past, when I changed the plan, as long as I explained it to you, you'd never get mad.

250
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,020
How come you're like this now?

251
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,610
So I shouldn't be mad?

252
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,230
My life's plan follows your plan and changes as you please.

253
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,130
I don't even get to discuss it. I can't be mad?

254
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,420
Li Haoyi, I put my future in your hands.

255
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,980
But when it changed, I didn't know anything about it.

256
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,100
You make me feel like I'm living as a fool.

257
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,850
Hey...

258
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,360
Thank you.

259
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,160
Thank you.

260
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,110
Congratulations on your new role.

261
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,230
Thank you.

262
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,480
Thank you.

263
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,090
To the CEO.

264
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,110
What are you looking at?

265
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,750
Nothing.

266
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,870
Where's Amy?

267
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,630
Amy went to buy a present. She'll be here soon.

268
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,370
Sister Ziyuan is here.

269
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,810
Ziyuan is not bad, right?

270
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,440
Right.

271
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,410
I came here to congratulate you myself. Don't misunderstand.

272
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,830
I won't.

273
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,930
Kehuan, as a company director, I've always held high hopes for you.

274
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,550
Your discernment skills in love and business have been exceptional.

275
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,200
But this time you've made a mistake.

276
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,480
I've already discussed with the General Manager. Your appointment as CEO is unchanged.

277
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,340
Thank you, Madam.

278
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,990
The person you should be thanking is Ziyuan.

279
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,890
You can always recuperate losses on the stock market, but you may not be able to win back a good woman.

280
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,650
You should appreciate having Ziyuan as such a good helpmate.

281
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,880
Remember, without her, you wouldn't be who you are today.

282
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,390
- Here. <br> - Okay.

283
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,360
So sour.

284
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,310
I told him to quit. So he quit without discussing it with you?

285
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,750
Why doesn't he decide everything himself? Why even have you around?

286
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,190
Family? A relative? Or just a teammate?

287
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:26,360
Yeah. He didn't even tell me he changed jobs. He should've at least mentioned it.

288
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,940
I only found out about him quitting through David.

289
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,850
Isn't that ridiculous?

290
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,910
Extremely. Even David is better than him.

291
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,450
Drink.

292
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,010
<i> (Haoyi) <br> </i> He's calling you.

293
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,970
I'm not going to pick up. Let's see how many times he'll call.

294
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,330
Yeah. How many times?

295
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,680
He stopped calling.

296
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,520
Why are you here today? To give gifts and buy support?

297
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,020
Or are you just here to tell me how great you are?

298
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,560
I just came to thank everyone for their support.

299
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,820
I wasn't disciplined after making a mistake at work.

300
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,410
I'm still a CEO. It's all thanks to you.

301
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:42,430
Thanks for sucking up to the General Manager's wife. It's the only reason I could be at this party, right?

302
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,710
Kehuan, you know,

303
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,520
I've always put you first.

304
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,990
I can't not do anything when I see you in trouble.

305
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,440
Do you know what everyone's saying about me?

306
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:06,030
They say I only made it this far because of you. Even the GM's wife says that. I should thank you.

307
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,870
Thank you for making me realize my hard work for the last seven years was all a waste.

308
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,560
Kehuan, that's not what I meant. You're misunderstanding.

309
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,600
I love you. If you think I've done something wrong,

310
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,350
then I apologize. I apologize, okay?

311
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,170
However, please believe me when I say that for the past ten years, I've worked hard to dress myself up,

312
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,170
assimilate into high society, and have afternoon tea with rich ladies, all for you.

313
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,450
- Everything I've done-- <br> - I've got a call.

314
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,660
Hello?

315
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,470
<i> Chu Kehuan, </i> I'm super depressed right now.

316
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,580
Last time, I made you happy. Now, it's your turn to make me happy.

317
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,240
Are you drunk?

318
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,010
<i> Yep. I'm drunk.</i>

319
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,370
<i> Super super drunk.</i>

320
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,820
Hurry up and get over here. Find a way to make me happy, got it?

321
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,500
Where are you?

322
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,770
Something came up. I'm leaving now.

323
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,290
Kehuan, where are you going?

324
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,110
My friend is upset. I'm going to go cheer her up.

325
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,050
But you're the star of this party.

326
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,550
No, I'm not. You are.

327
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,350
Hello?

328
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,000
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

329
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,810
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

330
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,580
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

331
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,990
Men all think they're all that.

332
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,390
Yep. They think they're really great.

333
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,190
So never believe anything a man says in bed.

334
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,800
What did your man say in bed?

335
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,840
Which man?

336
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,240
Who did you call?

337
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,700
Me?

338
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,750
I think Chu Kehuan.

339
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,210
Why did you call him?

340
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,520
I forgot.

341
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,790
You forgot?

342
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,760
Yeah. Forgot.

343
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,960
Why would you forget?

344
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,750
I don't know.

345
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,770
My abs hurt.

346
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,390
I'm so tired. I want to go home.

347
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,900
Home?

348
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,020
Okay. Let's go back to our house.

349
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,920
We'll finish our drinks then we'll go home.

350
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,950
- Okay. <br> - Bottoms up!

351
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,180
<i>We'll go back to our place.</i>

352
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,770
<i>Drink!</i>

353
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,450
Miss.

354
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,540
Why did you drink so much?

355
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,780
Why are you here?

356
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,440
Didn't you call for me to come and make you happy?

357
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,120
I did?

358
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Yeah. That's right. I remember now.

359
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,560
I want to tell you a little secret.

360
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,960
I hate you so much.

361
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,590
I hate that you're distracting me from my work.

362
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,330
I hate that you're so good to me.

363
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,380
I hate that you're making me doubt my life.

364
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,720
I hate you even more...

365
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,860
because you're making me...

366
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,150
doubt my relationship.

367
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,440
Yet, you keep annoying me and dragging me

368
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,760
here and there. I can't refuse you.

369
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,190
I'm really mad about that.

370
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,460
What are you doing? Didn't you hear her?

371
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,740
She hates you. Yet you want a kiss?

372
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,010
No way.

373
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,480
Go away. We'll keep drinking.

374
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,940
Boss, why are you here?

375
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,000
"One Root"!

376
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,300
Why did you only just get here?

377
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
<i>Be careful.</i>

378
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,350
<i>You hit the door.</i>

379
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,620
Where's your bedroom?

380
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,720
Over there.

381
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,310
Hold it in.

382
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,000
Stop moving around.

383
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,430
Which one is your room?

384
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,380
Inside.

385
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,040
Don't spew. Don't spew.

386
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,570
Don't spew. Wait.

387
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,800
Why don't you have a bucket?

388
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,730
So uncomfortable.

389
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,100
Chu Kehuan,

390
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,760
I hate you.

391
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,560
Zhou Weiwei,

392
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,540
I like you.

393
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,410
I like you.

394
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,340
Kefei, what are you doing?

395
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,230
How was I to know you were there?

396
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,720
Wait. Why are you in my room?

397
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,740
You called me to come to the bar. Don't you remember?

398
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,910
So you laid here all night?

399
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,800
Why not?

400
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,570
You entered my room and didn't get in my bed.

401
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,360
Are you trying to insult me?

402
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,020
Give me some respect.

403
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,620
Why are you here?

404
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,660
You called me when you got drunk last night.

405
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,410
I called you? Impossible. Why would I call you?

406
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,740
Don't you believe me? Check your call logs.

407
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,720
Am I crazy? Why would I call you?

408
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,990
Is it there?

409
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,160
So you brought me home? And then?

410
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,730
Did anything happen?

411
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,840
So we...

412
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,340
Me... and you?

413
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,380
You and me?

414
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,090
You told me a secret.

415
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,710
A secret?

416
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,430
What secret?

417
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,550
You said that I'm annoying.

418
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,550
You are very annoying.

419
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,300
You said I messed up your life.

420
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,010
Uh-huh?

421
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,000
You said I ruined your relationship.

422
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,820
I didn't say that.

423
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,260
I was drunk. How would I know what I was saying?

424
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,620
Besides even if I said that, I was drunk.

425
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,360
It doesn't count. It doesn't count!

426
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,130
Go away. Stop following me. Zhou Weiwei--

427
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,260
The two of you...

428
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,780
What's with your face?

429
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,380
I... I...

430
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,260
I should be the one asking why you are here.

431
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,760
You two are both missing a huge chunk of your memory.

432
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,240
You got drunk and called Baiyang. She got drunk and called me.

433
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,150
Is there anything wrong with my being here?

434
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,300
I suppose.

435
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,010
Morning.

436
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
Wait a minute! I'm not wearing pants!

437
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,490
Zhou Weiwei! Move aside.

438
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,430
321 is here! Why are you here? Get inside.

439
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,230
Why should I stay inside?

440
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,710
Don't talk. Don't breathe.

441
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,260
Kiddo, please get inside.

442
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,980
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

445
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,940
Morning.

446
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,600
Wait a minute! I'm not wearing pants!

447
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,030
Zhou Weiwei! Move aside. 321 is here!

448
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,430
Why are you here? Get inside.

449
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,160
Why should I get inside?

450
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,770
Don't talk. Don't breathe.

451
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,380
Kiddo, please get in here.

452
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,050
Zhou Weiwei, please put your bra on.

453
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,980
321 is here.

454
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,180
<i> Please come in.</i>

455
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,200
What are you looking at? I'm dressed now.

456
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,250
Is Weiwei here?

457
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,390
Zhou Weiwei!

458
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,530
He's here.

459
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,820
Weiwei, you didn't return my calls all night.

460
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,850
I figured you'd be here,

461
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,010
so I came to pick you up.

462
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,920
I quit and found a new job,

463
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,690
publicized our relationship without your consent.

464
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,370
<i>That's my fault. I'm sorry.</i>

465
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,290
That's it?

466
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,570
Hello? Is one sorry going to cut it?

467
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,420
Weiwei, you should take this opportunity and lay everything out on the table.

468
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,990
Lay what?

469
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,790
He should apologize again.

470
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,470
A sincere one.

471
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,120
I'm sorry.

472
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,780
You know what I think? I think you're a know it all.

473
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,420
This happens with you all the time.

474
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,400
<i>Is it that difficult to communicate?</i>

475
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,090
I'll go get my things.

476
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,870
Boss, why are you coming out?

477
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,180
321, why are you only here now? What did you promise me when I sold you the house?

478
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,800
You said you were going to take care of her, protect her, and make her happy.

479
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,370
And yet you let her get stupid drunk and only show up in the morning?

480
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,200
Mr. Chu? Why are you here?

481
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Could Baiyang take care of two drunk women by himself?

482
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,800
In a situation like this, any man would want to help.

483
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,040
Moreover, Weiwei is Ziyuan's university classmate, is she not?

484
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,100
Baiyang is...

485
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,890
I'm her boyfriend.

486
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,410
We got drunk yesterday. He couldn't look after us by himself, so he called his Boss to help.

487
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,330
It's my fault for not looking after Weiwei.

488
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,320
Sorry to bother you last night.

489
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,750
Thank you.

490
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,880
It's okay.

491
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,960
Weiwei, let's go home.

492
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,130
We'll get going.

493
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,710
Boss, why did you go to Zhou Weiwei yesterday?

494
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,070
I should be the one asking you.

495
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:49,560
Why does Ziyuan know what happened at work? And why was she at the going away party?

496
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,380
Sister Ziyuan has been through so much with you all these years.

497
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,120
She takes such good care of you. I thought she should know.

498
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,690
What gives you the right to let her know? Did you ask me? Or did she buy you out long ago?

499
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,090
Boss, it's really unfair for you to say that. You know I'm on your side.

500
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,920
But Ziyuan is the woman who can support you. As for Zhou Weiwei...

501
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,420
Enough.

502
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:21,190
I will sort my own problems out. You stay out of it in the future. You're late for work.

503
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,610
Was everything I saw real? Or was I blind drunk last night?

504
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,010
What did you see?

505
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,170
First, you called Chu Kehuan when you were drunk.

506
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,800
Second, Chu Kehuan ended up in your room.

507
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,950
Third, that means Chu Kehuan picked you up when we were drunk

508
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,140
and looked after you all night.

509
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,280
First, I don't know.

510
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,790
Second, I'm not sure.

511
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,260
Third, I don't understand.

512
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,820
Keep pretending. Do you know what this means?

513
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,500
It means I called the wrong number?

514
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,170
I'm giving you the chance to come clean. And you're playing dumb?

515
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,470
I remember very clearly.

516
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,540
Chu Kehuan appeared when you were drunk

517
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:43,810
and you said "I have a little secret. You're so annoying."

518
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,980
When 321 showed up to pick you up this morning, I wanted to chew him out

519
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,640
but who knew Chu Kehuan would scold him even more than I would have?

520
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,170
Do you know what that means?

521
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,700
It means Chu Kehuan is a psycho.

522
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,830
That's not my understanding.

523
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,890
Chu Kehuan is not a psycho. He likes you.

524
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:15,130
He cares about you, yet doesn't have the right to. So he released all his anger on 321.

525
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,490
You think too much.

526
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,940
Am I thinking too much? Or do you like him too much?

527
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,350
Han Kefei. First, I really called the wrong number.

528
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,640
Second, I'm very certain about something.

529
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,650
Please take a thread and needle to your mouth, and sew it shut.

530
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,750
I think.

531
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,460
I think so, too.

532
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,100
So...

533
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,580
Now...

534
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,780
we can only.

535
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,260
Are you sure?

536
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,360
Or what?

537
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,400
<i> (Baiyang)</i>

538
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,670
Yan Baiyang, I'm doing overtime and you're not here with me. Why are you calling?

539
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,630
Which hospital?

540
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,460
What did you tell him?

541
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:12,540
I said Zhou Weiwei fainted.

542
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,480
What are you scared of? If you want to know the truth, don't be scared.

543
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,440
Then, are you calling Zhou Weiwei?

544
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,050
I'm unlocking my phone right now.

545
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,470
Hello?

546
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,050
Weiwei, Yan Baiyang just told me

547
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,340
<i>Chu Kehuan was in a car accident. He's in the emergency department.</i>

548
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,420
Hello? Hello?

549
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,930
What happened?

550
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,990
She hung up on me.

551
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,250
Is she going to come?

552
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,980
How would I know? She hung up on me and didn't say anything. How would I know?

553
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,130
And why are you wearing a face mask?

554
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,980
They're not even here yet. Why are you in a disguise? Are you a ninja?

555
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,310
Do you want me to get a blanket and cover you up? That way, no one will see you.

556
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,110
What's wrong with you?

557
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:58,110
We're in trouble. Brother Kehuan's feelings are real. Can't you see?

558
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,300
I saw. I have eyes.

559
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,600
Will Zhou Weiwei come?

560
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,780
What if she comes? Then there are mutual feelings.

561
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,730
My head is full of Sister Ziyuan right now, yet Brother Kehuan's head is full of...

562
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,670
It's probably better not to know. Should we really be doing this?

563
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,410
What's wrong with your brain?

564
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,880
You were the one who wanted to know the truth? Why are you over thinking it?

565
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,810
We've confirmed one of them. There's a second one.

Zhou Weiwei, I like you!

602
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,490
You can avoid me but you won't be able to avoid yourself.

603
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,200
I didn't want to avoid you.

604

I just don't want to pay attention to a crazy person who is yelling loudly on the streets.

Let go of me! What are you doing?

606
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,230
I don't want to let go of you.

607

I also don't want to cling onto you. I also don't like who I am right now.

I also don't know why I'm talking to you right now, but I can't control myself!

609
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,010
I used to think

610
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:11,290
that taking a step back and ignoring what I hear and see would make forgetting you easy,

611
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,340
but I can't do it with you.

612
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,380
Zhou Weiwei,

613
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,460
from now on, you can run away,

614
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,080
but I, Chu Kehuan, will chase you until the end.

615
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,720
Chu Kehuan, I can't stop you from chasing me.

616
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,630
But I will keep avoiding you.

617
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,510
- Zhou Weiwei, do you not have even a little- <br> - No!

618
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,030
Not even a little!

619
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,870
<i>Zhou Weiwei! Zhou Weiwei, I like you!</i>

620
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,010
Miss, are you getting on?

621
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,500
- Haoyi... <br> <i> - Weiwei, I can't talk right now.</i>

622
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,940
- But right now- <br> <i> - I'll call you back later.</i>

623
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,220
But right now...

624
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,940
I... really need you.

625
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,220
You're back?

626
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,300
What? You want to yell at me?

627
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:41,180
Yell at me for lying to you? For creating this trap?

628
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:47,060
For making you show your true colors, allowing me to find out that you like Chu Kehuan?

629
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:54,760
Go ahead and yell. I'm prepared. It'll be better if you could yell and tell me all your feelings for Chu Kehuan.

630
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,420
Say something. Why aren't you yelling?

631
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:03,280
I really have such a great friend like you.

632
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,900
It's because of a good friend like me who knows how to make you reveal your true feelings.

633
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,310
Those aren't my true feelings.

634
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,420
If they're not your true feelings, then what are they?

635
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,870
Then, why were you worried and panicked?

636
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,230
Why did you run to the hospital immediately and look for Chu Kehuan?

637
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:24,010
If it's not your true feelings then why haven't you gone home yet?

638
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,720
You don't have to feel guilty for having feelings for Chu Kehuan!

639
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,180
I don't like him!

640
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,890
You don't like him or you can't like him?

641
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:44,320
They have two different meanings. It'd best to think about it carefully before answering me.

642
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,630
I only have Haoyi in my heart.

643
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,410
Really? Then why aren't you going back to Li Haoyi's house?

644
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,790
Okay, I'll go back then.

645
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,290
Wait!

646
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,860
Return my keys. You don't live here anymore.

647
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,730
I don't want to see my best friend in the middle of the night

648
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:15,530
sitting here unable to decide what to do

649
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,900
with a mouth full of lies, lying to me and herself.

650
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,340
I don't want to.

651
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,040
Are you trying to get out of it?

652
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,900
Yes, I am.

653
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,050
If I return your keys,

654
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:43,190
in the future, if I want to escape, yell at someone,

655
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,250
or want a hug, where would I go?

656
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,930
I'm really angry right now. I'm leaving.

657
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,760
Loser!

658
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,270
You're lying to yourself. Like an ostrich. You big ostrich.

659
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,060
With huge ostrich eggs.

660
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,750
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

661
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,190
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

662
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,410
<i> I have to go to the factory. <br> I have to turn off my phone.</i>

663
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:08,780
<i> It might take all night. <br> You go to sleep first.</i>

664
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:37,370
<i>(Kehuan)</i>

665
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,440
<i> (Congratulations CEO Chu Kehuan. All the best. OnePace Chairman, Mai Ruoyun)</i>

666
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,640
Director Li, congratulations.

667
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,540
No, I should congratulate you, CEO Chu.

668
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,640
Ever since buying your house,

669
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,000
my luck has really turned.

670
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,060
Why are you guys being so formal?

671
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,890
Then I should be formal, too.

672
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,910
Kehuan, if it weren't for you,

673
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,530
I wouldn't have met such a talented individual as Haoyi.

674
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,040
He's the director in the R&amp;D department at our company.

675
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,280
Honestly, it's only since he's come on board

676
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,870
that I could

677
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,720
come discuss our development plans with you.

678
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,810
I will definitely and thoroughly analyze this.

679
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,710
Haoyi is a rare talent.

680
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:25,020
Ever since he's been a part of us, our development speed has increased a lot.

681
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,050
I believe we can achieve IPO status within three years.

682
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,530
I'll need your help then.

683
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,380
I'll do my best.

684
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,730
Haoyi has been leading the department

685
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,400
in making advances in our processes tirelessly the last few days.

686
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,580
You've done well.

687
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,210
Thank you.

688
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,910
You've been working tirelessly?

689
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,860
It's okay. I'm still young. Not going home for a few days is not a big deal.

690
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,570
It's more important to finish the product.

691
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,880
Are you blaming me for being slow and not having a finished product?

692
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,800
The R&amp;D department is the cause of the bottleneck. Is that my fault?

693
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,500
You're talking louder now that Li Haoyi has left.

694
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,980
How loud I'm talking has nothing to do with Li Haoyi resigning.

695
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,210
I'm just stating facts.

696
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,170
All right, I'll state some facts for you.

697
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,960
Li Haoyi suddenly quit. He didn't do a proper handover.

698
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,990
Look at how busy our R&amp;D department is.

699
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,530
Then, go look for him. What does that have to do with me?

700
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,690
I can't get in contact with him. What did you think?

701
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,720
He's either turned his phone off or he refuses to answer.

702
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,460
Here, here. It's good you came.

703
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,740
I must trouble Li Haoyi's fiancée to hand this task list to him

704
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,110
and ask him to respond as soon as possible.

705
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,250
I sent it to him.

706
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,950
Don't you live together? Why don't you just take it to him directly?

707
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:54,610
Because I, like you, often can't get in contact with him.

708
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,210
I'm sorry. He's very busy at the moment.

709
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,620
I don't know if I'll see him today either.

710
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,230
Texting him is the best way.

711
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,220
He'll see it eventually.

712
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:08,150
But the fact an employee has quit is not my problem.

713
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:12,940
If you don't catch up on your progress this week, I'll have to report to the bosses.

714
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,470
What are you looking at?

715
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:25,790
Let me tell you all. If I get fired, you all get fired!

716
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,890
Here.

717
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,420
Thanks.

718
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,270
I want to go to the bathroom.

719
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,990
Oh, it's that way. Turn right down the hall.

720
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:39,380
Thanks.

721
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:46,340
Looks like you're really busy. So busy you can't go home.

722
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,010
It's better to be busy than not at this time, right?

723
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:54,130
Right. I have to thank you for selling your house to me.

724
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,720
Ever since I moved in, everything has gone really well.

725
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,580
Aren't you and Weiwei getting married soon?

726
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,560
If you're too busy to go home, how will you get married?

727
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,420
For men, our career is more important.

728
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:12,060
Once our career is stable, can we provide a stable home for our partner.

729
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,840
Then what about Weiwei? Doesn't she mind?

730
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,100
I mean, you're so busy.

731
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,860
Weiwei should probably understand.

732
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,760
She's always been very supportive of me.

733
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,710
Besides, I'm doing this for our future.

734
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,200
So, she has to constantly accommodate your life plan?

735
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:39,430
What I mean is, you're so lucky to have met such a great other half.

736
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,890
No matter what you do, she continuously supports you.

737
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,980
Yeah. I am really lucky.

738
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,000
What are you two chatting about so happily?

739
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,330
Nothing. Just small talk.

740
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,380
Then, I'll leave my IPO with you?

741
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,310
No problem, I'll do my best.

742
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,990
I'll get going first.

743
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,350
See you, Kehuan.

744
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,330
- Bye. <br> - Bye.

745
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,180
Boss, what did you say to Li Haoyi? Did you lay out all your cards to him?

746
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,140
Do you have any observation skills?

747
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,170
If I laid everything out for him, would he have left so calmly?

748
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:22,440
That's good. I was so worried in the office just now. I was afraid you'd--

749
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,330
What are you afraid of? No matter what I do,

750
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,800
I will protect those I need to protect.

751
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,970
Do not pay any attention to my private life from now on. Understand?

752
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,440
Then, Sister Ziyuan...

753
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,540
If you want to make a bigger deal out of this,

754
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,600
or if you can't control your own lips,

755
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,610
then go ahead and tell your Sister Ziyuan.

756
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:53,060
I've known Kehuan for a long time.

757
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,300
We're old friends.

758
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,480
Hold this.

759
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,390
But seeing how well you two get along,

760
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,430
I think our expansion plans should go well.

761
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:08,010
When the time comes, you and I will be in Shanghai taking over the world.

762
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,670
Really?

763
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,110
You have to jump on opportunities as they come.

764
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:15,190
Otherwise, it'll slip out of your hands.

765
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:17,320
Yes, Chairwoman Mai.

766
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,660
On the first day we met, I told you to call me Sister Maizi.

767
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,290
Calling me Chairwoman Mai is very impersonal.

768
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,020
Sorry, Sister Maizi.

769
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:36,230
But I think you have another problem.

770
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,340
What problem?

771
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,460
Doesn't your girlfriend style you?

772
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,270
What?

773
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,810
You're now the head of the R&amp;D department at OnePace.

774
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,710
You'll have to come with me to greet clients.

775
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,360
You dress like the stereotypical engineering geek.

776
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,300
I understand, Sister Maizi. I'll do better.

777
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,770
How will you do better?

778
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,240
A different colored polo? Or put on a shirt?

779
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,070
Is that not okay?

780
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:12,440
Relax. The company will treat you well. Let's go.

781
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,130
Okay.

782
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,220
If I get any more mail, please--

783
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,560
Miss Zhou, you have mail.

784
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,490
Thank you.

785
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:39,900
Excuse me. If Miss Gao has any more mail in the future,

786
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,690
please redirect it or contact her directly. We no longer live together.

787
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,760
Okay, I understand.

788
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:53,290
I'm so lucky to run into you when I'm just picking up mail.

789
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,190
Yeah. What a coincidence.

790
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,440
I have something to say to you. Come here.

791
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:13,890
Can you redirect all your mail in one go?

792
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,980
So you don't have to come again.

793
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,930
I quite enjoy coming here for my mail every day.

794
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,160
What do you want?

795
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,700
I'm telling you! Listen to me carefully.

796
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,410
I'm Mrs. Li.

797
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:28,640
Not yet.

798
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,450
Everyone knows I'm about to be.

799
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:33,700
"About to be?" It means you're not yet.

800
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:39,020
If you want to tell me you're about to be Mrs. Li, I already know that.

801
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,150
You put the engagement ring on in front of me.

802
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:46,850
And before you put that ring on, I kissed you.

803
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,960
Chu Kehuan!

804
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,230
Zhou Weiwei, can I ask that before you become Mrs. Li,

805
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:57,020
to be true to yourself. And consider me?

806
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:02,060
<i></i>

807
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,630
<i>You have a guest?</i>

808
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,490
<i>It's a woman. Do you need to go up and take a look?</i>

809
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:10,650
<i>Mrs. Li, please make sure to keep this ring on.</i>

810
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,380
<i>Then, when are we getting married?</i>

811
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:16,260
<i>It's you in this car, right? What's your relationship with Chu Kehuan?</i>

812
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:19,570
<i>Zhou Weiwei, don't forget.</i>

813
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:23,470
<i>- I'm Mrs. Chu!<br>- Didn't you say that you don't love him?</i>

814
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:25,160
<i>Why can't you bring yourself to say anything?</i>

815
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:30,030
<i>Chu Kehuan was never my choice to begin with. What do you want me to say?</i>

816
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:37,350
<i>♫ Closing the door, returning to real life ♫</i>

817
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:44,200
<i>♫ Shedding this skin, lazing around ♫</i>

818
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,650
<i>♫ Living freely ♫</i>

819

<i>♫ Neither bad nor good, it's just one person hanging on ♫</i>

820
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:04,290
<i>♫ Love runs too deep ♫</i>

821
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:10,250
<i>♫ I miss you more than before ♫</i>

822
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,770
<i>♫ I've been forcing a smile all these years ♫</i>

823
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:17,290
<i>♫ Trying hard to live and be a better person ♫</i>

824
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:24,120
<i>♫ Believing that time will always take something away ♫</i>

<i>♫ I love you more than before ♫</i>

827
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,480
<i>♫ Never having any talent for love ♫</i>

828
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,480
