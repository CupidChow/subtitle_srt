3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,350
Let me ask you this. If today you had a quarter in your hands

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,350
and it falls to the ground and disappears,

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,090
please raise your hands if you would do everything you can to find it.

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's congratulate them because they're about to be penniless fools.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,000
The loss of money causes a fit of panic for people.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,960
The most important thing in a successful trade is the quality of your mind.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,610
You need to have your own ideas for every entry and exit.

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,710
In this world, there's no such thing as a steady investment without loss, so we have to be able to diffuse the risk.

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,960
Seriously speaking, investment and dating are actually one and the same.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,100
I believe that people in relationships who cheat also have a mentality of diffusing the risk.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,210
Investments inevitably have risk. Cheating also inevitably comes with consequences.

Hello, I'm Zhou Weiwei.

34
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>How many times do you want me to say it?</i>

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,740
I'll take care of it right away.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm starting the three-way call now.

37
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,670
<i>Manager Zhou, don't you know what time it is?</i>

38
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,000
<i>Yesterday, I worked all night until dawn. You're just asking me about the R&amp;D matter now?!</i>

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,960
<i>- What gives you the right?<br>- What exactly does your R&amp;D team want to do?</i>

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,880
<i>- There's going to be a delay in pushing the product out.<br>- That's not our problem!</i>

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,820
<i>Our R&amp;D Department is working overtime every single day. What else do you want?</i>

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,160
- But―<br><i>- You're just the project manager, not my manager!</i>

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,690
<i>Stop calling me at this time!</i>

44
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,380
Both of you, can we discuss this calmly?

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,540
Boss just called earlier. Today's meeting is very important.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,170
I'll have to trouble you then. See you both at the office later.

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,450
- Hi.<br>- Good morning.

48
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,740
Han Kefei, you've done it again!

49
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,170
Wash up quickly! I need the bathroom!

50
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,010
Bye.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,190
What do you think? Is he handsome?

52
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,010
Yes.

53
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,140
Don't be mad. I promise... I won't bring anyone over for the night anymore.

54
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,580
- Aren't you going to go to work?<br>- Of course.

55
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,190
Why are you still like this? You haven't even put on clothes yet. I'm going. I can't wait for you anymore.

56
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,400
Let's take a taxi together later.

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,290
I don't have money for you to ride in a taxi. Hurry up!

58
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,900
Help me clock in!

59
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
No!

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,810
<i>Good morning, are you awake?</i>

61
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,870
<i>I'm getting ready to head out. Do you want me to pick you up?</i>

62
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,960
<i>I'm already on the way.</i>

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>However, I want to spend some time with you after work today.</i>

64
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,780
<i>Even though it's in the middle of the week and we shouldn't see each other,</i>

65
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,660
<i>I wanted to make plans with you, too.</i>

<i>(Hualai Director, Jessica)</i>

67

Hello, Jessica.

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,620
Zhou Weiwei, what's up with Dongda?

69
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,040
Before I even got into the office I got a call that there will be a delay in pushing out the product. What's with that?

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,660
That's not possible. I confirmed the date with them two weeks ago.

71
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,870
I need you to resolve the problem, not throw it back to me!

72
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,240
Go make a trip out to Dongda and look into what happened.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,110
I understand. I might have a delay.

74
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm not sure I can make it in time for the meeting later.

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,190
Resolve the problem, and come back on time for the meeting.

76
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,670
Excuse me, can I be reimbursed for the taxi fees?

77
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,970
<i>Mr. Chu, your credit card was charged for a large transaction.</i>

78
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>We need your confirmation that you made the transaction.</i>

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,670
Please wait. I'm aware of that transaction. It's not a problem.

80
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,910
How much will that be?

81
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,050
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,050
Hello? Yes, Manager Fang.

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,270
I'm at the front of the office.

84
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,890
- I'm sorry, I need a receipt.<br>- Okay.

85
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,860
I know. Please don't be mad. I know...

86
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,700
No. Manager Fang, please wait for me. I'm really here already. No.

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,210
I'm almost there.

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,040
It's a receipt for NT$105. Why are you chasing so hard for it?

90
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,410
The receipt is for reimbursement. Of course, I have to chase it.

91
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,970
Thank you.

92
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,700
Please take me to the Zhongxiao East Road. Thank you.

93
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,070
- Good morning.<br>- Good morning.

94
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,970
Today's the accounting day for the third quarter profits. You haven't forgotten, right?

95
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,400
How could I forget? I lost to you by NT$12 million.

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,630
Catching up to you in one go is difficult. What is it?

97
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,530
Do you want me to congratulate you now for becoming the venture capital's CEO?

98
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,940
Who doesn't know your name in this circle?

99
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,060
You could probably beat me down with NT$12 million in three seconds.

100
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,110
We still don't know who the venture capital's CEO is going to be.

101
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,200
I heard you want to do J06853.

102
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,760
I saw the supply chain with my own eyes. The information was a lie.

103
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm not doing it anymore.

104
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,690
Brother Shuming,

105
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,490
if you really want to do J06853, I must remind you to be careful.

106
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,180
Thank you.

107
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,210
I'm also curious as to

108
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,900
who will become the venture capital's CEO after today.

109
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,530
Good luck.

110
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,390
Boss, these are the main points of the trades today.

111
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,220
Brother Shuming, this is today's trade summary.

112
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,900
Wow, come here and look!

113
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,120
This camera was discounted from NT$19,900 to NT$1,990!

114
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,330
Hurry up and buy it!

115
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,070
Selling an NT$19,900 camera for NT$1,990, huh? I'm going to buy ten units and make you take a loss!

116
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,670
Credit card failure!

117
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,610
I can't get into the website!

118
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,440
Stop! Use the Trojan from Second Sister's concert! Hurry up!

119
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,000
I got five!

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,190
- Yes! I got it!<br>- I got it!

121
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,730
I got five units!

122
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,410
I got it! I got it!

123
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,750
Keep going!

124
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,770
Don't stop! Go!

125
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,450
Keep going!

126
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,130
Haoyi, don't you see that everyone's fighting for this?

127
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,480
An NT$19,900 camera is selling for NT$1,990. I'm telling you, only an idiot wouldn't buy this.

128
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,210
I can just use my phone to take pictures.

129
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,030
How can you even compare your phone with a DSLR? It might not be restocked again. Take the chance and buy it.

130
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,670
Take your card out and charge it.

131
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,190
I don't have a credit card.

132
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,470
What? You don't have a credit card?

133
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,580
Then, how do you live?

134
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,840
Living is in your own hands.

135
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
If you swipe a credit card, there's no realistic concept of spending money.

136
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,530
Only cash transactions can prevent meaningless expenses.

137
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,590
Whatever floats your boat.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,450
Brother Dawei, can you turn in the feature that can take photos with the additional ability to hand-draw from last time?

139
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,280
Stop rushing. Can't you see I'm busy.

140
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,600
But I really need it right now.

141
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,880
I heard the supply chain is out of stock. We don't even know if the product can come out on time.

142
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,030
Why should I turn it in today? It's clearly not urgent.

143
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,020
Who says it's not urgent?

144
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,750
- Manager, I was just telling him...<br> - I heard it all.

145
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,790
I've already taken care of Dongda. Even if there's an insufficient amount of materials,

146
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,800
it definitely won't be because you delayed the process.

147
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,910
Manager Zhou, you're the project manager.

148
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,130
You're not my manager. I have no responsibility for your progress.

149
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,500
Brother Dawei, please remember

150
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,020
that you are part of the project team. You must take responsibility towards the progress.

151
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,000
Why is the progress that was asked for two weeks ago not turned in today?

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,480
Was it? I remember in the last meeting I said I would turn it in within a month. I think you must be mistaken.

153
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:58,270
Brother Dawei, everyone received the meeting minutes. It is supposed to be turned in today.

154
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,210
Good thing I didn't wrongly accuse you. Even your coworker said so.

155
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,160
After the meeting later, I will continue to rush your progress.

156
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,080
Let's go, Meiling.

157
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,870
Li Haoyi, are you part of our team or hers?

158
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,140
I'm only using the facts to tell the truth.

159
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,290
Not bad. Very good.

<i>(J06853 Daily Rank: 2)</i>

161
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,180
You told me to be careful. If I listen to you, I'd be an idiot.

162
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,980
Bulan, transfer me all of your quotas today.

163
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,450
Yes!

164
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,970
Brother Shuming, my NT$60 million has already been transferred over.

165
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,980
NT$80 million transferred.

166
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,610
I've transferred everything to you.

167
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,860
Big Brother, you're still working on E47454? This has been falling continuously for a month.

168
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,680
Are you tired of being the winner and just trying to experience what it's like to be a loser?

169
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,670
Boss, today's your decisive battle with Brother Shuming. You can't lose! If you lose, you won't be the CEO!

170
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,900
Give me your quotas.

171
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,780
Everyone is trying so hard. Shouldn't I try, too?

172
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,280
- Boss.<br>- Hurry up.

173
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,200
Boss, I transferred over the quota!

174
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,120
It went through!

175
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,190
Brother Shuming, fighting!

176
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,840
Everyone, fighting!

177
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,250
Where is your manager?

178
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,440
She's likely in the meeting room.

179
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,900
Okay.

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,750
Don't be nervous.

181
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,390
Honestly, your job is very simple.

182
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,300
Han Kefei, before you left today, did you see my notebook?

183
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,520
No, I didn't.

184
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,890
I remember that I brought it with me.

185
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,350
Hey, Zhou Weiwei, close the door!

186
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,030
You're ridiculous. You even want to eat the interns.

187
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,500
Are you okay? Reply.

188
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,690
At this important moment, you're still trying to look cool?

189
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,400
When the tide recedes, it will be revealed who wears the pants.

190
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,010
Brother Kehuan, E47454 is saved!

191
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,580
Someone is willing to buy it, it's going higher and higher!

192
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,370
It flipped! There's hope now.

193
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Brother Shuming, be careful.

194
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,230
Shuming!

195
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,760
Your J06853 really is dangerous.

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,650
Brother Shuming...

197
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,510
I have eyes. I can see! Call the company. I want to put in another NT$200 million.

198
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,450

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,340
<i>Congratulations, Guoxin Venture Capital's CEO.</i>

214
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,600
<i>But I have been questioning this for a while.</i>

215
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>Why are you fighting so hard for the venture capital's CEO position?</i>

216
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>Isn't it going well doing stocks here?</i>

217
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,400
Isn't being CEO better?

218
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,930
Yes, it does sound great. On the surface, it's a promotion,

219
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,870
but the annual salary hasn't changed for the past three years. Even though the income fluctuates here in stocks,

220
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,000
you can also rake in a big one at any time. Right, Boss?

221
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,040
Do you know how long I've been doing stocks in Guoxin?

222
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,570
Do you need to mention it? Seven years.

223
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,800
Also, during the inspection every three and a half years, you've already won twice in your seven years.

224
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,490
Come on, Boss. I'm completely aware of your history, all right?

225
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,360
That's why I'm saying, it's such a shame to go to the venture capital fund.

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,600
It's not a shame. Money isn't important to me anymore.

227
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,810
Right now, I just want to rest and sleep well.

228
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,570
That's right.

229
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,070
What are you looking at?

230
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,100
I found it this morning.

231
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,140
Isn't it bad to go through someone else's stuff?

232
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,060
If I don't go through it, how do I find the owner?

Zhou Weiwei, in an hour and twenty minutes I need to report our project to the boss.

265
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,000
Did you know that overseas,

266
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,380
if a person asks you "May I buy you a coffee?" it means they want to start a relationship with you?

267
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,070
I just spoke Chinese, so I'm not sure what you meant by that.

268
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,460
But I sincerely want to treat you to coffee.

Isn't buying a house in Taipei for NT$20 million a little too hard to find?

274

You went through my notebook?

Gently scoop up from the side.

283
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,100
I told you that you have to come to this place.

284
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,930
It has never disappointed me once.

285

The owner is looking at you.

286

So what? It's free to start with.

287
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,740
If she's afraid of someone taking too much, then don't put out so much.

288
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,800
Today was a nightmare. Good thing I got through it; or else, I'd have been done for.

289
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,170
Don't mention it. I was scared, too. If you were fired, we have to change our plan of retiring at 65.

290
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,220
Wait a second. Let me get you some more.

291
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,260
Hey, stop. We can't finish it.

292
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,450
And if you keep getting more, I don't think I will be able to come back next time.

293
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,090
Having you eating with me today is already enough.

294
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,650
Even though we promised to not see each other from Monday to Friday in fear of coworkers seeing us,

295
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,580
for you, today's an exception.

296
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,260
<i>Just wait for me, I already said I'm already on the street.</i>

297
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,790
<i>- Help me order.</i><br>- What's wrong?

298
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,660
It's that pain-in-the-ass Dawei from your department.

299
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,470
Did he leave yet?

300
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,570
<i>Okay, okay. Bye.</i>

301
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,630
- Is he gone?<br>- I think so.

302
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,410
- You sure?<br>- Yes, it's fine now.

303
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,790
If David saw, he would tell our bosses and we would both be fired.

304
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,230
Don't even mention buying a home, eating would become a problem, too.

305
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,350
That's right! Do you know what day it is?

306
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,540
Of course, I know what day it is.

307
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,950
Why else would I risk everything to meet up with you today?

308
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,900
Really? What day is it then?

309
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,250
Today is our 3rd year anniversary.

310
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,920
But... there's one more thing that is more important than our anniversary.

311
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,700
What is it?

312
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>Not a winner.</i>

313
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,510
<i>Haha, not a winner.</i>

314
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,390
<i>Not a winner.</i>

315
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
<i>Haha, not a winner.</i>

316
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,450
<i>Not a winner.</i>

317
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,960
I hate you. Scanning receipts to see if we won anything is more important than our third anniversary?

318
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
This is another way to celebrate. It's a hope that only happens every two months.

319
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,470
It happened to land on our third anniversary. Don't you think that's especially significant?

320
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,580
If we won NT$200, we can enjoy another meal of pork chops.

321
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,030
If we won NT$1000, we can enjoy a meal of steak.

322
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,900
Even if we both had steak at the night market, it wouldn't even add up to NT$500.

323
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,560
We can save up the remainder. Wouldn't that make us one step closer to our goal of retiring at 65?

324
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,160
If we won NT$2 million...

325
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,810
What about NT$10 million?

326
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:45,340
We would be able to buy a car. Do you know how much we could save for our mortgage?

327
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,790
So, if we bought a house, we'd save NT$10 million on the mortgage.

328
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,870
All of NT$10 million.

329
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,610
Let's check.

330
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,600
<i>Not a winner.</i>

331
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,020
<i>Haha, not a winner.</i>

332
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,230
<i>Not a winner.</i>

333
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,980
<i>Haha, not a winner.</i>

334
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,780
I remembered, I still have some in my purse.

335
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,380
<i>Not a winner.</i>

336
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,300
<i>Not a winner.</i>

337
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,410
<i>Congratulations, you won!</i>

338
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,990
NT$4,000! NT$4,000.

339
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,190
It's NT$4,000!

340
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,540
With NT$4,000, how many times can we eat steak at the night market?

341
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,440
At least 10 times?

342
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,460
That's not right, we should save all of the money.

343
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,600
This way, we would be closer to our retirement plan.

344
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,910
<i>- Let me ask you. Do you think the way we're eating shaved ice is a little...<br> - I don't think so.</i>

345
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,210
<i>I think mango is delicious.</i>

346
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,010
<i>And I also really like their sherbet and cheese. </i>

347
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,500
<i>That's good.</i>

348
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,930
<i>Oh yeah! This is my part, NT$250.</i>

349
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,260
So that's why I initially made the decision to chase after you.

350
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,560
Because you are the first girl that is willing to pay for her part on a date.

351
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,080
What is so great about this?

352
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,380
This is something I want to mention throughout my life.

353
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,530
A girl who pays for her part. How rare.

354
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
I have a present for you.

355
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,200
Our third anniversary must be celebrated.

356
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,780
For real?

357
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,400
I spent so much effort in collecting enough points for this.

358
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,700
I asked the owner to hold this for a long time.

359
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,460
You're so great. I collected points for a long time, and I couldn't even get to that goal.

360
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,590
Thank you.

361
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,760
Happy three years.

362
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,800
You don't need to thank me. What's yours is mine, and what's mine is yours.

363
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,660
Then... today...

364
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:52,050
I want to give myself to you as a present for our three years.

365
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,120
I will stay over tonight.

366
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,120
Weiwei.

367
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,900
I promise that it's not that I don't want you to stay over.

368
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,510
It's just that we promised each other.

369
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,740
We only stay over on Saturdays.

370
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,240
Once the rule is broken,

371
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,790
it's going to keep being broken.

372
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,510
Then our life plan will be ruined, do you understand?

373
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,340
I understand.

374
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,510
Good girl.

375
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,660
Happy three years.

376
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,270
Bye-bye.

377
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,330
- Bye.<br>- Bye.

378
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:01,540
<i>♫ You need not give in, tears don't lie<br>Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

379
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,130
<i>I will sue you!</i>

380
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,610
Why is it you again? What do you want?

381
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,960
I said, what do you want?

382
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
What do you want from me exactly?

383
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,110
In addition to treating me to coffee, you also owe me NT$50.

384
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,140
Here is your NT$50. Also, I haven't sued you yet. Be careful.

385
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,650
Zhou Weiwei,

386
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,870
we bumped into each other three times in one day.

387
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,050
Don't you think this is fate?

388
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,150
Also...

389
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,930
You don't know my name and contact information. How are you going to sue me?

390
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,490
Chu Kehuan?

391
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,520
Not bad. You remember it?

392
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,030
I read it straight off the card.

393
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,100
What? You don't have money?

394
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,050
You're destined to owe me NT$50.

395
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,160
Where are you going? This is a public place.

396
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,280
The glass is transparent. What is there to be afraid of?

397
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,310
Okay.

398
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,370
Let's see what you really want.

399
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,760
Sing.

400
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,230
<i>♫ Every time you call me "darling," this word gives me <br>confidence ♫</i>

401
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,270
Are you not picking up the microphone because I'm here, or because you're tone-deaf to begin with?

402
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,000
Since I already paid NT$50,

403
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,360
don't you think it's a waste if you just watch and not sing?

404
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,830
And isn't it painful to eat three meals with NT$150?

405
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,760
If you went through my notebook in such detail,

406
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,580
that's already a violation of my privacy.

407
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,940
No, I already told you. If I didn't go through it in detail, how would I be able to find you?

408
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,630
And I'm really curious about the NT$150 for three meals.

409
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,670
- How did you do it?<br>- Breakfast: NT$25 sandwich.

410
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,300
Lunch: NT$50 lunchbox.

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,200
Dinner: NT$75 buffet.

412
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,240
Two vegetables and one meat with free soup, how is it not possible?

413
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,640
You can be satisfied with this lifestyle?

414
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,370
Why not?

415
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,130
So you can save up NT$20 thousand every month to save for that down payment?

416
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,720
How long do you have to do this for?

417
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,070
I'll be done by the end of the year.

418
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,520
That means your boyfriend is providing a few million, right?

419
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,250
You went through our retirement plan.

420
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,380
Don't you think that's a little too far?

421
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,240
Honestly, you can probably only buy a haunted house at the price of NT$20 million.

422
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,100
That's only because you've never seriously looked for homes with high CP (cost-performance) ratios.

423
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,680
My boyfriend is able to find them.

424
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,870
If your boyfriend is that incredible,

425
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,870
he wouldn't need to plan this thoroughly for retirement at 65.

426
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,230
What's wrong with planning ahead?

427
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,040
Is it your life or your boyfriend's life?

428
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,770
It's OUR life.

429
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,420
But life is full of mishaps.

430
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,920
What if you died before 65?

431
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,690
I'm very healthy, I cross streets with caution, I will not die that early.

432
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,080
Stop following me.

433
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,870
You seem to be very sure of yourself.

434
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,600
And you said you want to give birth to two kids before 35.

435
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,740
Isn't that a little hard?

436
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,240
Why does it matter how many children I want to give birth to?

437
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,320
Why would a pretty girl like you speak with such a rude tone?

438
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,790
I just want to remind you kindly.

439
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,030
Also, I'm very curious. What if you accidentally get pregnant with a third child?

440
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,700
Then I'll give birth to it, too.

441
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,810
Then your plan will change.

442
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,940
So what if it changed? I can manage.

443
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,320
Why am I telling you this much?

444
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,170
You make it sound like you can control all of it.

445
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,600
If you can't control yourself and aren't confident in yourself, you can't do anything at all!

446
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,830
Then, I wish you luck. Oh, right. What if your husband betrays you and has an affair with a mistress?

447
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,410
Are you done yet?

448
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,490
I want to sue you. I will sue you!

449
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,980
I welcome you.

450
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,170
This way, we can meet multiple times.

451
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,030
And every time, I will appear personally.

452
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,840
You have problems.

453
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,850
<i>♫ The sky turns dark, the lights turn on ♫</i>

454

455

459
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,770
I welcome you. That way, we can see each other many times.

460
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,600
And every time, I will appear personally.

461
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,270
You have problems.

462
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,340
Just return this another day.

463
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,090
You know where to find me.

464
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,110
You're welcome.

465
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,940
Your shirt ripped?

466
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,770
Your chest was exposed? What were you wearing underneath?

467
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,920
Nude color tank top.

468
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,710
Nude color tank top?

469
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,340
Are you a grandma? Why would you wear a nude color tank top?

470
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,040
Why didn't you wear black lace?

471
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,610
How would I know that he'd appear?

472
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,170
That's right, I can't blame you on that.

473
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,470
Then?

474
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,720
What? There's nothing afterward.

475
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,810
I don't believe you.

476
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,210
How could there be nothing afterward?

477
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,970
Your shirt ripped.

478
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,360
He took his jacket off.

479
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,050
And he covered up the chest that was going to be exposed.

480
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,310
That smell.

481
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,310
He had cologne, right?

482
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,690
You're disgusting.

483
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,590
Tell me. Is he handsome?

484
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,190
If he's handsome, seduce him.

485
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,570
You have problems. I alread-

486
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,560
I don't know him.

487
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,840
Also, he went through my notebook,

488
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,520
as well as harassed me. He's lucky I'm not suing him.

489
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,840
If he's handsome.

490
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,640
It's okay to be harassed.

491
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,180
You're thirsty.

492
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,920
This isn't being thirsty, it's called "enjoying."

493
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,130
Let me ask you. We've been living together for three years.

494
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,670
I've never seen you have a boyfriend or bring a man home.

495
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,420
Are you hiding something?

496
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,980
Zhou Weiwei,

497
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,680
my sexuality is very open.

498
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm open to any confessions.

499
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,130
Are you crazy? You're so stupid.

500
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,230
I'm serious.

501
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,110
You share rent with me.

502
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,740
Even if you can't be the same as me,

503
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,000
make the most of your body. You have to use it occasionally.

504
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,070
I need to talk to you about this topic.

505
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,310
You've been bringing men home too often.

506
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,470
We made an agreement to not have them stay overnight.

507
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,570
It's because spring is here. It's inhumane to ask me to take a break every other day.

508
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,190
Also, I saw how cruel Jessica was to you today.

509
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,600
I gave up on a lot of young fresh meat today.

510
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,330
All because of you.

511
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,260
Did your thing come?

512
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,830
Oops. You noticed?

513
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,990
I'm going to shower and ignore you now.

514
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,260
I want to make a bet that he'll ask to meet up with you again.

515
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,990
That better happen.

516
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,190
<i>Getting a house is our next step in the plan.</i>

517
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,460
<i>When we buy a house, we'll get married.</i>

518
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,370
<i>After we get married, at 32, we'll have our first child.</i>

519
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,100
<i>Is this your life or your boyfriend's life?</i>

520
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,530
<i>An NT$20 million budget can only buy a haunted house in the suburbs. What if you died before you reach 65?</i>

521
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,370
<i>You said that you want to have two children before 35. Isn't that a little too hard?</i>

522
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,200
<i>What if you accidentally get pregnant with a third child?</i><br><i>That means your plan will change.</i>

523
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,240
My life will go according to my plan.

524
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,860
I will be able to do it. I must do it.

525
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,760
<i>If you can't control yourself and aren't confident in yourself, you can't do anything at all!</i>

526
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,040
<i>I will sue you. I will definitely sue you to death!</i>

527
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,230
<i>(Zhou Weiwei)</i>

528
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,400
<i>(Unknown Number)</i>

529
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,110
Hello, it's Zhou Weiwei.

530
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,560
I am Chu Kehuan.

531
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,970
The last part is the package design.

532
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,200
<i>(Unknown Number)</i>

533
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,340
- Hello, it's Zhou Weiwei.<br>- I am Chu Kehuan.

534
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,760
<i>(Unknown Number)</i>

535
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,250
You! Stop calling me.

536
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:59,490
I want to see her at tonight's party.

537
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,090
Boss!

538
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,860
I don't know her.

539
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,440
<i>Hello, are you alone?</i>

540
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,900
<i>May I buy you a drink?</i>

541
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,500
<i>Number?<i></i></i>

542
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,050
<i>Your company's stock number.</i>

543
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,970
<i>F52893.</i>

544
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,590
<i>Hello, E47498.</i>

545
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,230
<i>Sit.</i>

546
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,860
Hualai. Let me tell you, this party is going to be fun.

547
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,330
We hired the top 30 of the 100 biggest DJs.

548
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,570
Each month they receive about more than 10 to 20—

549
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,080
So, you want a matchmaking party.

550
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,110
It's my boss' promotion party.

551
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,850
It's just in the tradition that all parties end up a matchmaking party.

552
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,300
It's pretty interesting.

553
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,160
I heard your company has a girl named Zhou Weiwei and she's beautiful.

554
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,900
How do you know about her?

555
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,160
I'm warning you, she's not like us. I don't hurt my sisters.

556
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,690
No, who says that she'll get hurt from coming? Also, she doesn't have a boyfriend, right?

557
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:24,880
It's very normal for single women to attend a matchmaking party. There will be a lot of successful people tonight. Help her find one.

558
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,150
Do you have time to eat dinner with me tonight?

559
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,300
- Tonight?<br>- You don't have plans.

560
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,530
I actually do, but you know I—

561
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,670
Don't worry, I won't let you go waste money.

562
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,960
Is there really something that good?

563
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,520
We're just going to eat dinner, why are we dressing up?

564
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,120
We're just going to eat dinner, why are you dressed like that?

565
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,550
Is there something wrong with being dressed like this?

566
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,860
Is the way you're dressed correct?

567
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,030
Don't worry, let me handle this.

568
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,110
- Nope.<br>- Yes.

569
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,830
- Nope.<br>- Yes.

570
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,560
I thought we're going to grab dinner, why are we at this type of place?

571
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,820
This place is also a place to eat dinner; it's all-you-can-eat.

572
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,330
Hi, you're finally here.

573
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,350
Where do we sit?

574
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,660
Over there. Let me take you there.

575
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
You can all sit here.

576
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,590
Everyone! The party officially starts now.

577
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,500
Before the party starts, please let the girls first introduce themselves.

578
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,300
The introduction is very simple and unique, no need for a name or your three sizes.

579
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,710
Just tell the men two things.

580
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,890
1. Type of stock.

581
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,760
2. Stock price.

582
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,940
- Why don't you start. <br>- 1. Photoelectricity stock.

583
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,000
2. 5020.

584
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,050
Everyone give her a round of applause.

585
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:56,990
This is an easy point, E47008, known as the King of Stocks.

586
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,490
This particular stock is really good.

587
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,130
Everyone here works for publicly listed companies.

588
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,070
<i>J02433.</i>

589
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,140
Then what if they don't work for listed companies?

590
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,220
That's a bye-bye then.

591
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,060
Relax. You just need to have fun.

592
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,830
If a guy likes you, you just tell him the number.

593
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,690
And just try hard to guess his number.

594
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,370
Everyone was able to guess it correctly. Very good!

595
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,630
Relax a bit.

596
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,460
Your turn.

597
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,290
Your turn.

598
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,840
Type of stock.

599
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,180
1. Technology stock.

600
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,080
2... Today's closing price...

601
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,970
I don't know today's closing price.

602
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,390
E47498.

603
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,200
The closing price is 256.5. Hualai Electronics.

604
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,100
Everyone, let me introduce you to tonight's host:

605
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,040
Guoxin Venture Capital's new CEO, Chu Kehuan.

606
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,460
<i>♫ You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

607
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,850
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

608
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,470
Everyone, let me introduce you to tonight's host:

609
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,440
Guoxin Venture Capital's new CEO, Chu Kehuan.

610
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,590
- I'm Kefei.<br>- Excuse me.

611
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,050
It's you.

612
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,290
We meet again.

613
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,880
- You know each other?<br>- We don't.

614
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,340
How can we not know each other, Zhou Weiwei?

615
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,570
I never thought that we would meet at a matchmaking party.

616
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,320
Matchmaking party?

617
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,390
Didn't you say it was a dinner for a celebratory party?

618
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,420
This is your celebration?

619
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,170
Welcome.

620
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,750
What is the meaning behind the matchmaking party.

621
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,750
It's...

622
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:03,190
A matchmaking party is where men and women spend time together, drink some alcohol, and relax.

623
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,950
Ending with events that should happen between men and women.

624
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,990
I'm leaving.

625
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:16,950
If you leave, our friendship ends today.

626
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,910
Fine, I'll go and eat.

627
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,120
I'm going hard.

628
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,030
Rock. Paper. Scissors.

629
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,200
How did that happen?

630
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,350
Han Kefei!

631
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,170
Are you crazy?

632
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,120
Are you sober yet? Let's play games.

633
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,960
Everyone!

634
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,540
To celebrate Brother Kehuan's promotion to Guoxin Venture Capital's CEO,

635
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,440
I prepared this game for him specially.

636
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,800
As long as he can win this game,

637
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,680
he can invite one girl to spend a night with him.

638
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,980
Hey!

639
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,900
What kind of perverted game is that?

640
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,410
CEO! CEO!

641
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,090
CEO! CEO!

642
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,560
I just need one chance.

643
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,530
If I don't succeed,

644
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,910
I'll spend the night alone.

645
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,620
It's Brother Kehuan!

646
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:33,730
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

647
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,650
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

648
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,000
<i>Grab it. Grab it.</i>

649
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,920
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

650
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,980
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

651
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,200
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

652
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,370
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

653
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:59,520
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

654
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,740
<i>Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.</i>

655
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,810
He got it.

656
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,080
Now, I will go to my choice.

657
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,690
What do you want?

658
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,350
I choose you.

659
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,300
I don't want to participate in this perverted game of yours.

660
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,780
Perverted? So, you're saying everyone here is a pervert?

661
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,950
You didn't need to go through all that to pick me.

662
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,950
Hey.

663
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,960
How about this? I give you three chances.

664
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,270
If you can grab one, you can reject me.

665
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:10,180
Three tries. You can, right?

666
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,890
<i>Challenge him. Challenge him. Challenge him.</i>

667
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:18,270
<i>Challenge him. Challenge him. Challenge him.</i>

668
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,160
I have three tries, how can I not be able to grab one.

669
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:32,320
<i>Don't grab it. Don't grab it. Don't grab it.</i>

670
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:38,430
<i>Don't grab it. Don't grab it. Don't grab it.</i>

671
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,400
<i>Don't grab it. Don't grab it. Don't grab it.</i>

672
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,970
<i>Don't grab it. Don't grab it. Don't grab it.</i>

673
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,760
- Hey!<br> - <i>Don't grab it. Don't grab it. Don't grab it.</i>

674
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,400
Where are you going?

675
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:49,410
This beautiful night is about to begin.

676
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,180
I'm warning you, don't get close to me.

677
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,370
Everyone here is an adult. You lost your bet to me. Trying to run away now doesn't fit your personality.

678
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,720
What do you know about my personality?

679
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,200
Let's understand each other then.

680
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,720
I'm not going to do anything with you. I already have a boyfriend.

681
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,260
I know. I have a girlfriend, too. We've been together for ten years.

682
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,290
Why are you like this then?

683
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:17,290
Today, we're standing on the same benchmark.

684
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,400
Behind our partners' backs, we attended

685
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,930
a different type of matchmaking party.

686
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,920
I didn't even know it was a matchmaking party. I thought it was a celebration.

687
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,260
I just came for dinner.

688
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,960
I'm going to get married to my boyfriend soon. Didn't you see it in my notebook?

689
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,890
As someone who is preparing to get married, you didn't leave even while knowing it was a matchmaking party. Your behavior in itself is questionable.

690
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,130
I was kept here because of my friend.

691
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,420
Then, did you tell your boyfriend?

692
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,620
Did you tell your girlfriend then?

693
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,690
I don't plan to tell her.

694
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,030
How are you going to explain the things that will happen?

695
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:57,390
You don't need to worry about me. I never planned on saying anything to begin with.

696
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,950
You're a player. I feel bad for your girlfriend.

697
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,500
Have you ever thought that she's waiting for your phone call at home?

698
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,380
Have you ever thought about the things she has done for you in the past ten years?

699
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,840
If you really don't love her, break up with her.

700
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,950
Why are you here doing yourself dirty?

701
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,760
You do not deserve to be a man.

702
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,240
Let go of me.

703
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,080
Che Kehuan.

704
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,560
You are in no place to tell me how to treat my girlfriend.

705
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,530
Let me go!

706
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,740
If I were you, I would stop moving around carelessly.

707
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,780
It would be hard to explain why your wrist is red to your boyfriend.

708
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:50,190
I'm warning you, don't mess around. Let me go!

709
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:54,390
Rest assured. I, Chu Kehuan, would not force anyone to do anything,

710
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,960
much less do anything illegal.

711
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,090
This is already illegal.

712
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:03,140
However, it hasn't violated my moral standards yet. This is just a game.

713
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,470
Good night.

714
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,670
Chu Kehuan. Chu Kehuan. Stop right there. Chu Kehuan!

715
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,940
Let me go or I'll call the cops.

716
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,260
I actually look forward to you calling the cops.

717
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,810
Then your boyfriend will know how wonderful your night has been.

718
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,590
I'll leave the keys here.

719
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,640
Good night.

720
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,490
Chu Kehuan!

721
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,420
Somebody come save me!

722
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,390
Save me!

723
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,810
<i>Where are you, Kehuan? When are you coming back?</i>

724
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,740
<i>Are you coming home yet? I need you for something.</i>

725
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,320
<i>It's urgent. Please call back when you see this.</i>

726
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,140
<i>Where are you, Kehuan? I can't seem to find you anywhere.</i>

727
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,170
<i>♫ You need not give in ♫</i>

728
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:12,410
<i>♫ Tears don't lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

729
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,220
Are you practicing yoga?

730
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,170
Hurry home. Don't forget to call your boyfriend.

731
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,490
I'm going to sue you!

732
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,470
I will sue you to death!

733
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,910
The same woman wants to sue me twice in one day.

734
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,940
What? That's not okay?

735
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,060
Go back home before I regret it.

736
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,960
<i>(What are you doing? Since you're not responding, I'm going to go to bed now.)</i>

737
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,380
<i>(I'm at the door. Please let me in.)</i>

738
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,660
I want to stay here tonight.

739
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,560
But today's not Saturday.

740
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,060
I don't care. I just want to stay here tonight.

741
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,370
If you keep talking to me about principles, then let's...

742
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,660
let's break up.

743
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,280
Okay, come on in.

744
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,280
What's so urgent that you came looking for me?

745
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,410
I forgot the key card so I wasn't able to get in.

746
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,110
Also, I bought too much stuff.

747
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,470
Congratulations, Guoxin Venture Capital's new CEO.

748
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,840
How do you know about that?

749
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:03,640
The General Manager's wife told me when we went on a stroll tonight.

750
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,890
Congratulations.

751
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,110
Let's go. Let's go up.

752
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:15,920
Kehuan, did you get that stuffed animal for me?

753
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,580
I bought it for Baiyang. He wants to give it to his girlfriend.

754
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,870
Do you need help?

755
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:27,880
Didn't you call me home to help you carry these? I can do it on my own.

756
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,310
But you've never given me a stuffed animal.

757
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,460
It's because you don't need one.

758
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:59,220
Congratulations. I bought you this gift. Do you want to wear it to work tomorrow?

759
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,190
Thank you.

760
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,040
Let me tell you. Today Madam told me that she plans on completely redecorating your office.

761
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,100
I told her there's no need, but I saw that she was so insistent, so if I kept saying no

762
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,330
it would come off as impolite.

763
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,820
Thank you.

764
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,660
Oh, right. I'm thinking if should I block out some time

765
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,710
to invite the Chairman and the General Manager's wife for dinner.

766
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:35,120
This would be to thank them for taking such good care of you.

767
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,150
When are you free? I'll set it up.

768
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:41,250
Ziyuan, you don't have to do so much.

769
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,570
I'm not doing much.

770
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,730
I'll go prepare your clothes for tomorrow.

771
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,250
Don't you need to take a look at the U.S. stocks? Go ahead.

772
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,890
What happened?

773
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,660
Tonight I...

774
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,780
<i>Today, we're standing on the same benchmark. Behind our partners' backs,</i>

775
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,900
<i>we attended a social event that is a little different than typical.</i>

776
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:18,070

01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,670
Tonight I...

778
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,790
missed you a lot.

779
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,380
I miss you a lot, too.

780
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,420
Hold on.

781
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,630
What's wrong?

782
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,310
I think my period came.

783
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,860
Careful, here's your coffee.

784
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,620
Thank you.

785
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,570
I charged so much to your credit cards today. Didn't you receive notifications?

786
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:34,520
I did receive them.

787
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,790
Then, are you mad?

788
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,800
No, why would I be mad?

789
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,780
Everything you do is for my good, isn't it?

790
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,350
Okay.

791
01:08:56,230 --> 01:09:01,760
The day after tomorrow is my mom's death anniversary.

792
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,260
If you need to work and don't have time, I can go on my own.

793
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,400
I will set aside some time.

794
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,270
Thank you. Rest early.

795
