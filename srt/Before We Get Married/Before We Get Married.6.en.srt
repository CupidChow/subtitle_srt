00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,280
<i>Zhou Weiwei, I like you!</i>

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,930
<i> From now on, you can run away. But I, Chu Kehuan, will definitely chase you to the end! </i>

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,360
<i>There's no need to feel guilty if you like Chu Kehuan.</i>

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,070
<i>I don't like him.</i>

18
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,220
<i>Weiwei always supported me.</i>

19
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,440
<i>So she needs to follow according to your plan?</i>

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,570
I'm telling you! Listen to me carefully. I'm Mrs. Li.

21
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,790
You are not yet.

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,660
The whole world knows I’m going to be.

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,130
Going to be? Going to be means you are not yet.

24
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,220
If you want to tell me you're about to be Mrs. Li, I already know that.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,110
You put the engagement ring on in front of me,

26
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,680
and before you put on the ring, I even kissed you.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,100
Chu Kehuan!

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,470
Zhou Weiwei, before you become Mrs. Li, can I ask you to

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,390
please face yourself and take another look at me?

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,630
That's not necessary.

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,680
Why? You're afraid that taking another look at me will cause your heart

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,090
to tremble a little more?

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,890
Who do you think you are?

34
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,520
I know that very well. My name is Chu Kehuan. What about you?

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,150
It’s fine if you don't look at me. Then, how long has it been since you've seen your 321?

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,360
How long have you not eaten dinner with 321?

37
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,980
How long have you woken up and not seen 321 by your side?

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,220
This is mine and Haoyi's business. I don't need you to care about it.

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,050
Have you eaten dinner?

40
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,630
I don't need you to care!

41
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,110
Does 321 know that you didn’t eat dinner because you are saving money?

42
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,520
Chu Kehuan! This is my last time telling you.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,960
Don’t come close to me. Everyone gets hurt when you get close to me.

44
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,140
Love is like an investment.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,530
There's risk and you also must pay the price.

46
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,470
You already know that I broke up with Ziyuan. So I don't have any burdens in pursuing you!

47
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,550
But I do! How can you be so selfish?

48
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,100
Right, you are not selfish. Then, why can’t you tell your 321?

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,470
You wish you can eat dinner with him every day. You wish you can see him every day.

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,040
He is assuming by himself that you can follow all of his arrangements and his life plans.

51
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,470
Okay. I’ll go find my Mr. Li right now.

52
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,520
I’ll tell him how much I need him. How much I miss him.

53

<i>(No Service)</i>

<i>(46 minutes)</i><br><i>(Last regular bus service is already over)</i>

56
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,170
Get on the car. I’ll take you to find Mr. Li.

57
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,860
No need.

58
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,790
Hey. Where are you going? Are you walking there?

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,820
Yeah, so?

60
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,230
If you don't want to get in my car, that's okay. But you should at least call a taxi!

61
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,520
I don't have the budget, young master.

62
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,060
Budget? Look at the kind of life your Mr. Li wants you to live. You have to consider your budget even when looking for him?

63
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,060
What are you mad at? It's my business that I want to save money.

64
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,880
It has nothing to do with Haoyi, and even more, it has nothing to do with you!

65
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
I’m mad because I cannot pretend that I didn’t see it.

66
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Get in the car! It's so late and you want to go there, then I should safely escort you there.

67
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,800
I don’t want to!

68
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,010
Okay, then I’ll call 321 that someone is walking there to find him.

69
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,150
Are you threatening me right now?

70
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,390
Yeah, so?

71
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,550
Get in the car.

72
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,580
Let go of me! Chu Kehuan!

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
Get in the car.

74
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,520
No!

75
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,140
Let go of me!

76
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,040
Get in the car.

77
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,980
<i>-You— <br> - Get in the car.</i>

78
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,280
- Your mail.<br>- Thank you.

79
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,330
Did you see Mr. Chu?

80
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes, he came to get his mail.

81
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,730
Then, did you see him with someone?

82
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,360
I didn’t see anyone.

83
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,820
Then, did you see Ms. Zhou?

84
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,450
Mr. Chu and Ms. Zhou spoke briefly, but I don't know what happened after that.

85
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
That--

86
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,460
You’re welcome!

87
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,470
Miss, sorry about that. They didn't answer the call upstairs, so I can't let you go up.

88
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,940
There's a couch over there. If you would like, you can take a seat there.

89
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,760
- Okay, thank you. <br> - You’re welcome.

90
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,170
<i> (I'm waiting for you in the lobby. I won't leave until I see you.) </i>

91
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,030
Hello, Miss. We are closed.

92
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,050
Miss? Sorry about that, we are closed.

93
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,250
Sorry.

94
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,270
Weiwei? Weiwei.

95
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,350
Haoyi?

96
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,490
Why are you sleeping here?

97
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,570
How come it's morning so quickly?

98
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,510
The lobby's couch is too comfortable. I ended up falling asleep.

99
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,410
Sorry, I didn't see your message until I left the production line. Didn't I tell you I wouldn't be able to come out until morning?

100
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,870
Because I miss you. I want to see my Mr. Li.

101
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,080
You miss me that much?

102
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,040
- Let’s go eat breakfast. <br> - Okay.

103
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,980
Let’s go.

104
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,370
Everybody addresses me as Brother Haoyi.

105
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,740
Some people even call me Brother Yi! Saying this myself makes me feel embarrassed.

106
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,830
But my boss told me that I should accept it.

107
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,400
After all, I am now a director.

108
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,310
Everyone's decisions must go through me for approval.

109
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,950
This type of feeling of being respected by others is not bad!

110
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,820
Director's wife.

111
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,990
Is it too vain of me to say it like this?

112
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,740
It's not. This is what you earned through your hard work.

113
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,390
That's right. I earned it.

114
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,070
I'm so hungry.

115
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,320
Just this is not enough.

116
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,300
Boss, one more order of egg pancake rolls!

117
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,670
Wait. I can’t eat anymore. I’ll give you mine. Don’t order anymore. It’s wasteful if it’s not finished.

118
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,480
Don't worry, I already got a salary increase.

119
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,520
You don't need to mistreat yourself to this extent. Order whatever you want to eat.

120
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,840
Brother Yi will pay for it. Not just breakfast. Count lunch and dinner on me as well!

121
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,230
Weiwei, our times of struggle are over.

122
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,320
From when you accepted my proposal,

123
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,320
our luck has been rising.

124
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,890
All of our hard work in the past has all paid off.

125
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,960
Mrs. Li, you must keep your ring on. Do you understand?

126
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,150
Then, when are we getting married?

127
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,670
♫ <i>I'd like to hear the details, you have her</i> ♫

128
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,270
♫ <i>Stand in my position, please retain... </i> ♫

129
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,030
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears ♫</i>

130
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,800
<i>♫ don’t lie. Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

131
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,020
Mrs. Li, you must keep your ring on. Do you understand?

132
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,670
Then, when are we getting married?

133
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,100
Wait until I'm less busy at work.

134
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
How long will that be?

135
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,880
There's a lot of pressure at R&amp;D recently. You also know that I'm a person with a strong sense of responsibility.

136
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,000
For now, I can't divert my attention to other things.

137
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,460
Marriage is not other things.

138
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,880
What did you say?

139
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,670
Nothing.

140
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,220
Look at you. You must be tired. You must not have slept well in the lobby.

141
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,480
Then hurry and go home and rest.

142
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,080
Boss! Change the egg pancake rolls for take-out. Thank you.

143
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,090
You must be tired, too. You haven't slept all night. When you get home later, take a shower and sleep, too.

144
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,430
Weiwei, sorry. I saw your message because I was in the washroom.

145
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,600
I thought that no matter what, I should eat breakfast with you before I worked overtime.

146
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,700
Later, I must go back to work.

147
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,880
Do you still need to work overtime on Saturday?

148
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,530
There's nothing I can do. It's a critical period right now.

149
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,640
How about this. I’ll tell everyone, then I’ll take you home.

150
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,480
It’s fine. I can go home by myself.

151
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,410
I just want you to know that I'm often the only one at home.

152
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,750
I don't like it either, but I'm working hard for our family right now.

153
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,650
Wait.

154
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,350
Hello? Yes.

155
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,020
But...

156
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay. Wait for me. I’ll go back right now.

157
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,680
Okay. See you later.

158
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,690
Weiwei, the company has some issues. I need to go back.

159
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,420
Continue to eat and then go home and rest, okay?

160
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,200
Boss, the check?

161
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,900
<i>♫ How many seasons have passed? ♫</i>

162
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,340
<i>♫ I've forgotten all the key points of our quarrels ♫</i>

163
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,470
<i>♫ If we meet again, can we act as if nothing has happened and not bring up the past ♫</i>

164
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,480
♫ <i>Exchanging conventional greetings to act as safety boundary line</i> ♫

165
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,710
♫ <i>I'd like to hear the details, you have her</i> ♫

166
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:14,560
<i>♫ Stand in my position, please keep the status quo ♫</i>

167
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,160
♫ <i>I'd like to hear the details, it has nothing to do with me</i> ♫

168
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:29,100
<i>♫ I'm so stubborn, you can see through my whole pretense ♫</i>

169
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:39,500
<i>♫ Telling a lie, it's your way of being understanding ♫</i>

170
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,790
What do you mean?

171
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,970
Didn't you see, too? Brother Kehuan has completely gotten seasick.

172
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,260
Before no matter how much we played around, how much we went on blind dates,

173
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,330
I never saw him act like this to any other woman.

174
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,670
So you're saying our Zhou Weiwei seduced Chu Kehuan?

175
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,490
I didn't mean it like that. But if you want to interpret it like that, I can accept that, too.

176
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,650
Please tell your Zhou Weiwei to stop seducing our boss.

177
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,880
Who are you? What does this matter to you?

178
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,730
Both of them have yet to get married. Is it illegal for them to be together?

179
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,600
So you support them being together?

180
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,850
Zhou Weiwei is my sister. No matter what she does, I will support her.

181
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,250
Kefei, do you know how much Sister Ziyuan helped Brother Kehuan these past 10 years?

182
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,880
If it weren't for Sister Ziyuan, Brother Kehuan would not be here today. Brother Kehuan cannot dump Sister Ziyuan.

183
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,300
Gao Baiyang.

184
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,480
My surname is Yan.

185
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,560
In my heart your surname is Gao.

186
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,380
All you say when you open and close your mouth is Gao Ziyuan, Gao Ziyuan.

187
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,440
Is Gao Ziyuan your mom or your sky?

188
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,620
If you want Zhou Weiwei to not steal your Chu Kehuan,

189
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,100
okay, no problem! I might as well step in.

190
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,190
I will find Chu Kehuan to "buy coke." The problem is solved. You're happy.<br><i>(T/N: Make love.)</i>

191
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,410
This meal is on you.

192
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,130
Kefei, can you stop messing around?

193
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm being serious.

194
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,060
<i>The number you are dialing is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. Thank you for calling.</i>

195
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,730
<i>Please shut it off. Goodbye.</i>

196
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,200
Hello, Haoyi.

197
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,690
<i>It's me.</i>

198
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,210
What happened to you?

199
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm fine. What's up?

200
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,310
You're coughing like this and you say you're fine? Where's Li Haoyi?

201
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,850
<i>He’s not there, right?</i>

202
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,840
I’ll take you to see the doctor.

203
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,310
There's nothing wrong with me. There's no need. Hello?

204
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,710
<i>Zhou Weiwei, hurry and open the door. Zhou Weiwei, I know you're in there. Zhou Weiwei!</i>

205
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,480
Zhou Weiwei, hurry. Come with me to see the doctor.

206
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,840
Why are you here?

207
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,460
Zhou Weiwei, if you don't open the door, I'll let the whole world know there's a man looking for you.

208
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,190
Chu Kehuan, stop messing around, okay?

209
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,020
Open the door! Open the door!

210
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,980
Come with me to see the doctor.

211
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,660
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

212
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,790
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

213
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,950
I’ve got the medicine. Are you okay?

214
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,040
I feel better.

215
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,570
I originally wanted to tell you to stay at the hospital since you're so sick,

216
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,130
but I just went to check and there are no hospital beds available.

217
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,100
The doctor also said you just have a cold and don't need to stay overnight.

218
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,960
But I really do think it's very serious.

219
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,170
So, I wanted to see if you could stay overnight but there are no spots. It's not like I could let you stay in the hallway.

220
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,930
So I thought we could just sit outside for a while.

221
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,270
After your IV drip is done, I'll take you home.

222
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,670
Lean on me and rest for a while.

223
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,630
Get some rest.

224
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,790
Why did you have to bring me to your house?

225
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,240
Or what? You won’t let me go to your house.

226
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,100
I can't just leave you there and not care so please bear with it.

227
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,350
Sit down.

228
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,990
Zhou Weiwei!

229
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm not that delicate.

230
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,820
Stop acting strong, okay?

231
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,280
Here. Take the medicine first.

232
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,460
Get some rest. Once you're better, I'll take you home.

233
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,020
I’ll go pour some water.

234
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,300
Thank you.

235
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,470
I’ll help you go upstairs to rest.

236
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,860
No need. I’m good here. Thank you.

237
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,930
Why are you being so stubborn? You're already sick, what can I do to you?

238
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,300
Lie down.

239
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,700
<i>Hi.</i>

240
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,290
You’re awake?

241
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,190
Ziyuan is here.

242
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,860
Ziyuan is here?

243
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,690
You don’t need to be nervous. I won't let her in.

244
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,900
That wouldn't be good. I'll get going first.

245
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,680
Where are you going? You’ll see her when you open the door.

246
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Then, what should I do right now? I’ll hide then.

247
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,350
Why can't we use this opportunity to explain things clearly?

248
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,120
Explain what? This is a problem between you two. What does it have to do with me?

249
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,260
I don’t want to be misunderstood. The bedroom is upstairs, right?

250
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,500
Why would you come?

251
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,830
<i>Do I need a reason to come?</i>

252
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,790
Even though I'm not welcome here, you still opened the door for me.

253
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,040
You have a guest?

254
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,180
Yes. It’s a woman.

255
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,380
She's upstairs right now. What is it?

256
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,570
Do you need to go up to take a look?

257
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,460
Are you sure you can face it?

258
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,950
Even if you do see her, then what? You'll fight?

259
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,170
Don’t forget that we already broke up.

260
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,520
You said you want to break up. I did not agree.

261
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,770
Chu Kehuan, what does our ten-year relationship count for?

262
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,010
What does everything I did for you in the past ten years count for?

263
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,610
<i>What do the promises you made me in the past ten years count for?</i>

264
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,120
<i> I haven't even agreed to breaking up yet and you bring another woman home? What is the meaning of that?</i>

265
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,130
Family is my bottom line.

266
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,550
There's no way I can keep on continuing.

267
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,500
Chu Kehuan, listen to me.

268
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,170
A quote a line from our professional jargon, "This is the best time for you to set up a stop-loss point."

269
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,130
Both of us cannot pay to continue on with this.

270
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,640
Kehuan, then you tell me. What should I do?

271
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,210
I'm willing to do anything. I'm willing to accept anything. You just have to tell me.

272
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,600
Don't ignore me. I beg you, okay? I beg you, don't ignore me!

273
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,360
- Tell me!<br>- You don't need to do anything!

274
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,630
Nothing you do will make a difference anymore.

275
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,550
I stopped loving you the moment you aborted our child without discussing it with me.

276
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,840
<i>♫ ​You need not give in, tears don't lie ♫</i>

277
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,720
<i>♫ ​Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

278
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,180
Then tell me, what must I do?

279
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,780
I'm willing to do anything. I'm willing to accept anything. You just have to tell me.

280
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,970
Don't ignore me. I beg you, okay? I beg you, don't ignore me!

281
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,860
- Tell me!<br>- You don't need to do anything!

282
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,050
Nothing you do will make a difference anymore.

283
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,100
I stopped loving you the moment you aborted our child without discussing it with me.

284
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,930
<i>I am unable to even touch you anymore. Haven't you noticed?</i>

285
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,410
From that point forward, there was no way I could love you.

286
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,300
There was no way.

287
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,690
Kehuan,

288
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,820
so because of this,

289
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,490
you're going to punish me for the rest of my life?

290
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:29,080
For all the years I've been treating you like this, I've also been punishing myself!

291
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,330
Do you know how painful that wound is?

292
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,910
That wound is carved into my heart. It will never--

293
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,730
I beg you, please leave.

294
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,120
Never come and find me again. I beg you.

295
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,940
Stop hurting the both of us.

296
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,250
Leave.

297
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,620
Leave!

298
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,630
You heard everything, right?

299
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,530
Liking you and not loving Ziyuan are two different matters altogether.

300
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:32,670
At most, it was you who gave me the courage to deal with this situation.

301
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,680
My old self was not brave enough.

302
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,850
But from now on, I will be very brave.

303
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,520
I don't need that. I should leave.

304
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,150
I'll take you home.

305
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,580
I want to say something to you.

306
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,120
If in the future you and 321 encounter an obstacle on the path ahead,

307
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,340
remember to turn back.

308
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,390
I will be there.

309
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,170
I don't need that. And you don't need to say these things anymore.

310
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,570
Umbrella for you.

311
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,010
No need. I'll walk over. Thank you.

312
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,410
<i>I stopped loving you the moment you aborted our child without discussing it with me.</i>

313
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,720
<i>I am unable to even touch you anymore. Haven't you noticed?</i>

314
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,690
<i>Liking you and not loving Ziyuan are two different matters altogether.</i>

315
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:31,690
<i> At most, it was you who gave me the courage to deal with this situation. </i>

316
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,530
- You helped me order? <br> - Mhm.

317
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,840
You went to buy things? For who?

318
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,630
For myself.

319
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,580
You mean you bought men's items.

320
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:05,660
I originally wanted to buy things for myself, but after I finished buying them, I realized they were for Kehuan.

321
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,710
You and Brother Kehuan already broke up.

322
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,090
But I didn't agree to it.

323
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,110
From the beginning to the end, I never agreed to breaking up.

324
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,250
Is it that important whether or not you have agreed to breaking up? He's already broken all contact but you want to hang onto him. Do you have that much pride?

325
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,410
Then, what do you want me to do?

326
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,980
You know I have been watching him being snatched by another woman?

327
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,410
I always thought it was that the two of you have problems with each other,

328
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,680
but the result was the old-fashioned reason of a third-party interfering with your relationship?

329
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:41,930
From the other day when I saw a woman getting into his car, I was already very suspicious.

330
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:47,120
Later, when I bought things and went to his house, Chu Kehuan personally told me that

331
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,660
there was another woman in his room.

332
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,950
Then that's good!

333
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,690
Gao Ziting! What are you saying?

334
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,610
At least that can help you fully wake up!

335
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:16,740
Gao Ziyuan, stop running away from yourself. Brother Kehuan has already stopped loving you. He's stopped loving you for a long time already.

336
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,620
Do you know that you look like a complete loser right now?

337
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,890
Even though I look like I don't care, but I am actually very sad.

338
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,730
You're no longer the strong Gao Ziyuan that I know in my heart.

339
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,450
You're just a nobody who gave your entire life to a man!

340
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,660
Chu Kehuan's life is my life.

341
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,100
You're not sad anymore. You are perverted.

342
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:11,660
You can be more positive. Besides Chu Kehuan, your life has other possibilities!

343
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,720
My god, look at yourself. You look like a crazy woman hanging onto him!

344
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,240
If I were him, I would also want to flee far away.

345
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:28,860
That's not right. Think about it. It's unfair to him that as one person he needs to provide for both of our lives. How can he handle that?

346
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,640
The two of us do not need Chu Kehuan to take care of us for the rest of our lives!

347
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:42,710
Sister, you're so pretty and smart.

348
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,810
You can actually also be very independent!

349
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,580
This is also why I loved you so much since I was young!

350
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,910
I'll accompany you, okay?

351
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,490
You're not alone! I'll accompany you in whatever you want to do, okay?

352
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,100
I will accompany you to walk out of this.

353
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,480
You're not me. You don't know how much I'm hurting.

354
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,010
Thank you. No worries. Drink coffee.

355
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,090
Drink coffee!

356
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,180
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

357
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,290
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

358
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,160
I’m back.

359
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,840
You’re back?

360
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,890
Why are you eating instant noodles?

361
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,870
I didn't know what to eat by myself, so I just ate whatever.

362
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,430
Zhou Weiwei, I'm telling you that in the future, you are not allowed to wait for me at the office.

363
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,070
It's only been a night and you turn like this?

364
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,500
New suit?

365
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,890
Isn’t this brand pretty expensive?

366
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,870
Don't worry or overthink it.

367
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:35,170
My boss not only gave me this but also personally went with me to buy it.

368
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,080
Your boss? Two big men buying a business suit. Isn't that a bit strange?

369
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,940
My boss is a woman. Everyone calls her Sister Maizi.

370
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,250
In the future, if I get the chance, I'll introduce you.

371
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,030
She's a woman? Isn't that more strange? Why is she gifting you clothes?

372
00:42:54,030 --> 00:43:00,440
Strictly speaking, she didn't gift it to me. The company did. It's part of the benefits.

373
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,630
Your company's benefits are so good. Does every new employee get a luxurious suit?

374
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:19,830
Sister Maizi told me that I'm a director now and no longer an engineer who spends his days in the lab.

375
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,920
And now when I meet clients outside, I'm representing the company.

376
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,660
Don't you think that all of my clothes in the closet look very engineer-like?

377
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:33,980
So she only gifted you and not any others?

378
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,250
I don't know if she gifted anyone else,

379
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,340
but maybe the other high ranking officials have all received her gifts in the past!

380
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,540
Hold on. Why are you so concerned about this?

381
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,690
How old is your boss? Is she married?

382
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,980
She's in her early forties? She's a young and accomplished entrepreneur.

383
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,250
She probably hasn't gotten married yet. I have only just entered the company. How would I know about her personal information?

384
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:11,910
I just think that it's really strange that a female boss gifted her male employee a luxurious suit.

385
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,820
If she were a sixty-year-old auntie, then that's a different story. But--

386
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:22,000
Zhou Weiwei, this is the company thinking highly of me. You should be happy for me.

387
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,740
And this suit is so useful. Beyond attending meetings,

388
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,570
I can wear this whenever we attend weddings or other events!

389
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:34,920
What's more, this suit is so expensive that we would never buy it ourselves. We got a great deal.

390
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,250
Stop having other thoughts.

391
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,460
After a bit, after I stop being busy, let's find some time to watch a movie,

392
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,730
eat a good meal, and enjoy the time we spend together. Okay?

393
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,380
Hurry up and eat your medicine. I am going to take the suit into the bedroom.

394
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:53,350
<i>(I went to deal with something at the company. Since you caught a cold and looked unwell last night, I let you sleep in.)</i>

395
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,400
<i>(After you get up and finish eating breakfast, remember to take Vitamin B.)</i>

396
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,170
It hurts!

397
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,800
Hello? Kefei, I'm at the door. Just three more minutes.

398
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,100
Can you help me clock in?

399
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,210
- Remember to help me make an additional copy! <br> - Oh, I really-

400
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,040
Liu Dawei!

401
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,840
Why are you blocking the middle of the road!

402
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,320
Why are you walking backward and not looking at the road!

403
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,710
Is that right? Sorry.

404
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,330
What am I supposed to do now? My clothes are soaked!

405
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,300
Now your clothes have also a quite postmodern feel to it. Hurry up and attend the meeting.

406
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,740
Hey!

407
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,140
You're finally here. Jessica is already inside yelling at people, hurry.

408
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,380
- But I'm like this right now. <br> - Go in first, we will talk later.

409
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,850
Jessica ate an explosive, is that it?

410
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,710
Just one problem with the printing house she yelled at us for 30 minutes straight!

411
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,540
It's fine, stop talking about it. I'm already unlucky today.

412
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,310
I fell this morning, and I haven't even had the chance to clean it,

413
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,520
then my entire body was soaked in that darned Dawei's coffee.

414
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,230
This Dawei is really itching for a beating. You are so pitiful.

415
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,670
Whatever. Getting yelled at by the boss is just a coincidence.

416
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,830
The main point is just now at the last moment, she wanted me to write out the bulletin for the new product.

417
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,690
How is that possible? I'm about to go crazy!

418
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,700
You're so unlucky. I'll stay far away.

419
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,340
You're such a great friend.

420
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,880
I have another set of clothes, do you want to change?

421
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,980
- Do you? <br> - Mhm.

422
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,720
- Okay! <br> - Okay, come!

423
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,760
Wait, hold on. I'll change later. I want to take a rest.

424
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,590
Manager, when I was in the meeting, I kept smelling a nice coffee scent on you.

425
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,310
You can't tell that I've been completely soaked by coffee?

426
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,210
Oh, no wonder you smell so great! You smell so good!

427
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,230
Han Kefei! I want to change!

428
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,100
What are you doing? It's almost time for the meeting. How come you're not going out?

429
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,840
Do you think this is okay?

430
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,180
For an emergency, I think this looks fine.

431
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,240
I feel very self-conscious, I can't do this. I should put my dirty clothes back on.

432
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,990
Don’t wear dirty clothes. You’re okay like this.

433
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,670
I don't want to. This is really—

434
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,080
Manager, you are dressed so sexily. Are you going to a matchmaking party?

435
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,750
That's not right. We're not off work yet. Why did you get changed so early?

436
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,500
Also, you are someone's wife. How can you go to a matchmaking party?

437
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,050
Come, come, come. I'm telling you, why can't someone's wife go to a matchmaking party?

438
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,760
Your manager is trying out a change of personality before marriage. Do you comprehend?

439
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,720
- Do you understand?<br>- Oh, before marriage...

440
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,070
Go wash your hands. So dirty. Go, go, go, go, go.

441
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,130
You can’t wear these.

442
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:51,950
Fast wireless recharging. The speed of recharging battery is twice as much as other models.

443
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,010
Come. Having this shawl, you should be able to concentrate more, right?

444
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:00,080
- Fortunately, I've made preparation at normal times. I'll help you fix it properly. <br> - Thank you.

445
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:06,020
Okay, don't do that anymore. Can't you see that I'm rushing to finish the new product report right now?

446
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,410
This looks like a lot of work. Can you finish it?

447
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:14,380
I don't know. I just hope there aren't any other incidents today. I don't want to work any more overtime.

448
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,680
Today is the only day Haoyi has time to eat dinner with me.

449
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
The R&amp;D Department wants us to change something again?

450
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:28,060
- Brother Dawei said that the report content needs to be more dynamic. Check your e-mail.<br>- He wants to change it again?

451
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,020
This basically means that I have to do the whole report again.

452
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,240
Okay, no problem. Hand this over to me. I'll help you. You too, Meiling.

453
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, okay.

454
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,760
Here.

455
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,470
- I will send the email to you.<br>- Okay.

456
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,950
You should add a new function for AI over here.

457
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,140
Is it the "one, two, three, four, five" that Jessica's always talking about?

458
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,150
That's right. Our new phone has <i>one</i> supercar design and is among <i>two</i> of the best in the world.

459
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:16,070
It has <i>three</i> ultra wide-angle camera lenses, <i>forty</i>-watt speed-charging, and <i>five</i> new AI technology features.

460
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,370
Jessica yells about this every day. She yells so much that I already memorized it.

461
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,030
Hello?

462
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,160
<i>Hello? Are you feeling better?</i>

463
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,580
What are you trying to do?

464
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,890
If you can't now, then don't do it. You need more rest right now.

465
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:44,470
I cannot rest right now. Also, I might have to work overtime today.

466
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,780
No, you haven't fully recovered yet, why are you working overtime?

467
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,990
Even if I died, it's none of your business. I'm already down on my luck today. This morning I fell,

468
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:58,000
<i>my coworker spilled coffee all over me</i>, and my boss nagged me to death. My workload suddenly shot up to the skies.

469
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,400
Everything I do is wrong. If I work overtime for three more minutes today,

470
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,490
then it's because your phone call is delaying my time!

471
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,550
Are y-you okay?

472
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,340
I’m not okay.

473
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,590
Calm down.

474
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,950
Manager Zhou?

475
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,920
You're already fixing it? That's perfect. You're such a responsible manager.

476
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,490
But remember, if you don't finish it today you can't get off work.

477
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,040
Jessica said it. Bye.

478
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,760
Wait!

479
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,630
Is he the one who poured coffee on you?

480
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,860
- Give me the coffee. <br> - What are you going to do?

481
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,810
Give me. Close your eyes.

482
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,510
Wh-Why?

483
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,590
Please take your trash and clean up the floor.

484
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,610
Was she throwing a tantrum at me just now?

485
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,070
- Boss.<br> - What?

486
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,670
OnePace's financial report is already transferred over. Can you take a look in a while?

487
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,430
I know.

488
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,690
Is there anything else?

489
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,420
Nothing. I just saw you staring at your phone...

490
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,130
Boss, that OnePace's capital increase case. What do you think?

491
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,080
Let's first change it.

492
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,410
Sister Maizi has been a bit too aggressive lately. I don't want to rush in too quickly.

493
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,880
Okay.

494
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,940
Hello?

495
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,390
<i>Weiwei, I’m here; you can come down.</i>

496
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:39,730
I... You might need to wait a little longer. I still have a bit of work to finish, is that okay?

497
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,740
How long do you need?

498
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,430
Almost, almost. That’s it! Wait for me.

499
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,270
Get up.

500
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,130
What?

501
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,720
I'll do it for you. Aren't you going to your husband?

502
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,740
Do you know how?

503
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,600
Do you really think I only “buy coke”?

504
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,560
Please. To me, this is a small piece of cake.

505
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,420
Whatever. I’ll do it myself.

506
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,890
What? You reject me for helping you? Fine then.

507
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,690
Let's see how long it will take you. I wanted to help, yet you rejected it.

508
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,030
Kefei, can you come and help me?

509
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,890
No.

510
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,750
Please?

511
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,470
Beg me.

512
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,150
I beg you, Great Beauty Han, can you?

513
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,310
Louder and more sincere, please.

514
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,510
Are you going to help me or not?

515
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,130
Hello, Sister Maizi?

516
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,100
The calculation has a bug?

517
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,480
Shanghai wants it by tonight?

518
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,220
Okay, I... I’ll go back.

519
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,120
Okay, I understand.

520
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,020
Hello? I’m coming down right now. Hello?

521
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,250
No, my company suddenly wants me to-

522
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,460
Hello? Why is the signal so bad?

523
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,980
Hello?

524
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,230
I'm sorry. Something just came up at work, I'm leaving.

525
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,170
Haoyi! Haoyi!

526
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,500
<i>♫ You need to not give in, tears don’t lie ♫</i>

527
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,680
<i>♫ Emotions are being kidnapped ♫</i>

528
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,090
Sorry. Sorry.

529
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,830
Don't you watch the road when you're walking?

530
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,670
I was riding here! Why didn't you move?

531
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,490
All my fruits are ruined! What should I do?

532
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,650
Sorry, uncle. I didn’t mean it. Sorry about that. Sorry.

533
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,610
Do you think a sorry is enough? I'm telling you, I have heart disease and high blood pressure.

534
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,680
You almost scared me to death just then.

535
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,830
If you scared me to death, would you be able to take responsibility?

536
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,100
- I'm sorry. <br> - All right, all right.

537
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,970
Just compensate me for the cost of these fruits.

538
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:20,280
I bought these fruits from abroad. They're very expensive. They cost several thousand NTD.

539
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,640
Several thousand?

540
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,580
Don’t pay him.

541
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,160
Sir, this is the sidewalk, not the bike lane.

542
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,620
And your fruit is way too expensive.

543
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,330
If you have any grievances, should I call the police to handle it?

544
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:47,560
Here is NT$1,000. It should be enough to compensate for your fruits.

545
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,350
All right, let's just say I had bad luck.

546
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,250
I'll pay you back for the NT$1,000.

547
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,780
I don’t care about money. I care about you.

548
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:14,110
You're sick, yet you had to work overtime. You fell, were bullied by your coworker, and got yelled at by your boss.

549
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,280
You finally got off work, but your fiance didn't even wait for you.

550
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,930
You are already very unlucky today. Why would you let a stranger scam you?

551
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,280
Are you a stalker?

552
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,250
I care about you! What are you thinking? Someone says you should compensate and you'll compensate?

553
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,020
I don’t need you to care about me.

554
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:34,120
I'm foolish, I'm dumb, I deserve it. It's all my fault.

555
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,970
Today I fell.

556
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,700
I got yelled at by my boss. It's all my fault.

557
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,850
It's my fault Haoyi didn't wait for me today, too.

558
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,620
What does this have to do with you?

559
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,720
If you want to cry, just cry.

560
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:42,440
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

561
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,580
<i>Thank you for your business. Thank you.</i>

562
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,110
Here, Miss, your dish is here.

563
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,750
Boss, I didn’t order this.

564
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,150
Oh, this mister ordered it.

565
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,620
Aren't you guys together? How come you are not sitting together?

566
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,110
It’s fine, it’s fine. Just leave it there.

567
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,590
Thank you.

568
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,950
Just set it over here, that's fine. Don't need to trouble yourself; let's eat it together.

569
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,960
Set it down.

570
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,610
Are you still living with a daily food budget of NT$150?

571
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,310
To be honest, I regret selling the house to you.

572
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,640
It’s because of you, that’s why I sold the house to 321.

573
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,600
It is because I thought by doing so, you would be happy.

574
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,190
But then I noticed... I might be wrong.

575
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:24,810
After you guys bought the house,

576
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,250
your quality of life not only didn't get better but also made you more unhappy.

577
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:36,300
I really regret it and feel quite guilty.

578
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,390
I really hate you.

579
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,780
I hate that you know and understand so much about...

580
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,570
me.

581
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,150
I hate that when I was helpless,

582
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,160
you appeared right by my side.

583
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:07,760
I hate that you even know when I am hungry.

584
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:18,180
You're welcome. If you'd really like to thank me,

585
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,430
finish all the food I ordered. Don't make me feel guilty.

586
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,160
Finish it.

587
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:38,620
Also, everything you just said about disliking me, I feel like I've heard it before.

588
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:42,310
What did you say? I didn't hear it.

589
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,940
Please stop the car.

590
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,740
Miss, do you want to eat noodles?

591
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,960
No need.

592
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,760
<i>(Department of Public Safety)</i>

593
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,950
You are so early today.

594
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,950
Of course, I have to work earnestly.

595
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:07,170
Sister Weiwei, I didn't think that Brother Haoyi was such a romantic person. He even sent you flowers.

596
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:11,210
I wanted to look at the inside of the card just now. What did he write exactly?

597
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,120
Read it out.

598
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,010
I’ll help you read it.

599
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,390
This is also my...<br> <i>(This is my intention, please accept it. Chu Kehuan.)</i>

600
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,420
Me? Me...

601
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,190
- Me, me, me what? <br> - Me...

602
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,930
The married couple wants to whisper sweet nothings. It has nothing to do with you.

603
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,470
Did you finish finding information?

604
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:34,070
Can you not cut yourself off halfway all the time? It's annoying. Come on, come on.

605
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,960
You are annoying. Go to work.

606
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:40,950
What?

607
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,010
Thank god I was the one who saw it; otherwise, you would be done for.

608
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,360
This Chu Kehuan is quite bold.

609
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,750
He even sent you flowers. He has guts.

610
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,220
What guts? He's an idiot, okay?

611
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,310
This evidence needs to be destroyed.

612
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,770
If it gets out, you're dead.

613
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,520
Zhou Weiwei!

614
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,030
Zhou Weiwei! Zhou—

615
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,700
Ziyuan?

616
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,760
Why did you come?

617
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,030
Is this you in the car?

618
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:24,970
What is your relationship with Chu Kehuan?

619
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:38,070
Zhou Weiwei, did you forget

620
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,690
that you are my schoolmate?

621
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:45,050
We sold the house to you guys.

622
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:50,220
In front of me, you accepted Li Haoyi's proposal and put on Li Haoyi's ring.

623
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:54,960
I even wished you a wonderful love relationship, a wonderful marriage, a wonderful future!

624
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,620
- Miss, please don't be so angry.<br>- Meiling,

625
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,930
this has nothing to do with you. Sit down.

626
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,290
Oh.

627
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:06,820
Why were you in Chu Kehuan’s car?

628
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,860
That day, the person who hid in the room and was too afraid to come out was you. Right?

629
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,970
Zhou Weiwei.

630
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,840
Don't forget,

631
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,960
I'm Mrs. Chu.

632
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:28,370
If you have a problem, go find your Li Haoyi. Don't bother my Chu Kehuan!

633
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,680
- Ziyuan, I—<br>- Miss!

634
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,190
May I ask you, are you married?

635
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:36,580
Mrs. Chu? How funny!

636
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:42,380
Your boyfriend is out every day picking up girls yet you can't even keep him under control. What right do you have to say you're Mrs. Chu?

637
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,700
It has nothing to do with you. Go away.

638
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,360
What do you mean it has nothing to do with me? Let me tell you

639
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,950
that day in the bedroom was me.

640
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,840
I’m the one who slept with Chu Kehuan. So what?!

641
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,360
Stop fighting! What are you doing!

642
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,840
What are you doing! Let me go!

643
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,340
Enough, Han Kefei!

644
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,780
Can you go back first?

645
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:31,740
Why did you block me?

646
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,470
I like to sleep with different guys every night. So what?

647
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,360
All of you go back to work!

648
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,200
Let's go.

649
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,230
Good thing you have eyes and held me back; otherwise, I would have beaten her to death.

650
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,600
<i></i>

651
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,690
Say it. Do you want to take him or give him up?

652
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,470
What?

653
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,910
What?

654
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,780
Gao Ziyuan already came to fight. You are letting her win?

655
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,130
I guarantee you that Chu Kehuan loves you more.

656
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:10,250
Or else she wouldn’t come today.

657
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,900
How do you fight against her?

658
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,160
Can you stop saying it?

659
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,960
Why did you say those things to Ziyuan?

660
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,460
This situation has nothing to do with you.

661
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,200
Why did you let her slap you?

662
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,260
What do you mean it has nothing to do with me?

663
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,430
If I didn't step out,

664
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,220
this slap would be on your face.

665
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,160
So what?

666
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,840
There’s nothing between me and Chu Kehuan. Why should I be scared?

667
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,170
As long as I explain things to Ziyuan and she understands, then everything will be okay.

668
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,530
But now after what you did, won't it lead to a greater misunderstanding?

669
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,160
How can you explain?

670
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,720
When Gao Ziyuan came today, you looked like you had been caught in bed with him.

671
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,980
Can I ask you how she's supposed to believe you with that kind of expression on your face?

672
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,810
But the truth is...

673
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,330
There’s nothing between me and Chu Kehuan.

674
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,720
There’s nothing between you and Chu Kehuan?

675
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,370
Come. Come here.

676
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,480
Look in the mirror. Swear to yourself in the mirror that

677
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,050
you have never loved Chu Kehuan!

678
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,860
You don't have any feelings for him.

679
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,190
If you love him today, then you'll be hit by lightning.

680
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,640
Swear it!

681
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,330
Come on! Didn't you say that you don't love him?

682
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,660
Why are you afraid to talk?

683
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,680
Swear it!

684
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,550
Swear it!

685
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:50,310
