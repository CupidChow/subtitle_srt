What sports do you like

Soccer

34
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,644
Hi, I want to get closer to you

35
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,980
Hi! Let's get closer!

36
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,691
How tall are you?

37
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,943
180 cm in the morning, 179 at night

38
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,280
Why are you so funny?

39
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,825
I don't think I am

40
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,369
What's your type?

41
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,622
A bright and cheerful person?

42
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,001
Someone I can talk to
and relax with when we're together

43
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,212
How's your seatmate?

44
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,883
She's fun. Different
from what I thought she'd be like

45
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,058
Pyeong-seok!

46
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:38,273
Did you call me?

47
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,610
What activity did you like the most?

48
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,280
Everything we did at Wolmido

49
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,658
How's your seatmate?

50
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:58,168
My seatmate's so friendly and nice

51
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,712
What's your favorite food?

52
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,256
I like everything

53
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,175
Do you have a crush on anyone?

54
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,804
Give me 500 won if you want to know

55
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,145
Attracted to anybody right now?

56
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,608
Yes!

57
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,152
What makes you dislike someone?

58
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,072
Nothing, really

59
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:34,704
What's your type?

60
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,971
Someone who smiles a lot,
speaks nicely, and likes sports!

61
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,663
Do you think your feelings will change?

62
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,168
I'm not sure

63
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:32,220
Someone who smiles a lot,
speaks nicely, and likes sports!

64
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,240
Attracted to anybody right now?

65
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,830
What kind of relationship do you want?

66
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,291
One where we can rely on each other

67
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,752
One that's like a friendship?
But also romantic?

68
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,796
Do you think your feelings will change?

69
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:15,347
I don't think so. Not at the moment

70
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,362
What makes you dislike someone?

71
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,531
When they're being rude

72
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,911
but that rarely happens.
Maybe when they confuse me?

73
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,313
What's your type?

74
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:12,570
Someone playful with double eyelids

75
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,283
Best memory from cooking class
or the field trip?

76
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:22,914
When I succeeded
in cooking with my partner!

77
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,043
What would you want to do
if you had a girlfriend?

78
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:33,174
Take a walk at night holding hands

79
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,805
Who made the best first impression?

80
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,685
Well… the new student?

81
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,321
Well… the new student?

82
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:12,714
Who made the best first impression?

83
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,900
The one who gave you the book and letter,

84
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,111
do you like her?

85
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,284
Do you like anyone?

86
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,428
Do you like anyone?

87
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,980
Honestly, I'm not sure

88
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:25,954
JI-MIN

89
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,103
What did you like most in school?

90
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,815
It was nice to see the ocean at Wolmido

91
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,236
What's your type?

92
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,281
My first impression of them has to be nice

93
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,993
Do you usually express your feelings

94
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:10,582
to girls you're interested in?

95
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:17,255
I haven't done it before, so I don't know

96
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,802
Did you like cooking?
Want to try making anything else?

97
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,431
Nothing in particular

98
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,187
What made you like the person
you're interested in?

99
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,569
I just liked her as soon as I saw her

100
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,625
What was most memorable from yesterday?

101
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,587
Riding the Ferris wheel

102
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:14,646
JUNG-YUN

103
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,174

00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,302
She's a good friend who's nice to me

105
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,347
Do you like sushi?

106
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,475
I love sushi

107
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,436
What was the most fun so far?

108
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,525
I'll never forget the ocean
we saw at Wolmido

109
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,613
Interested in anyone yet?

110
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,291
Maybe? But I'm just
getting to know everyone!

111
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:44,861
Maybe? I don't like vague answers

112
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:16,392
We're still getting to know each other
but I am interested in someone

113
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:21,522
There is someone but I just don't show it

114
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,950
Who gave you the best first impression?

115
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:42,585
I don't remember which day it was,
but the last person to come in

116
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,566
