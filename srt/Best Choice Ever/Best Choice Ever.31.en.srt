2
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,720
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:32,706
How time flies.

4
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:37,387
Both of you have grown up.

5
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:42,187
You two have your own jobs and lives.

6
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:45,627
And you're the boss of Xing'anli.

7
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:51,146
Naturally, your worries have increased.

8
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,627
Do you wanna talk about it with me?

9
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:00,184
Sit, dad.

10
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:12,987
Actually, it's not about me.
It's Yao Zhiming.

11
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:17,107
He had a big fight
with his dad at Xing'anli today.

12
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,306
They argued fiercely.

13
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,984
I have never seen him like that before.

14
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,787
He has been downcast since he came back.

15
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:28,586
I want to help him,
but I don't know how.

16
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:30,840
I feel so useless.

17
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,987
Don't be silly. You've done very well.

18
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:41,426
You let his dad stay
in a guest room at Xing'anli.

19
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,787
You've done him a big favor.

20
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,306
You gave him a way out.

21
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:51,507
I never thought
you would handle it so well.

22
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:57,387
It's still not enough.

23
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:01,987
Dad, Yao Zhiming is quite pitiful.

24
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,336
He looks aloof,

25
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,586
but it's all an act.

26
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:10,387
It's a shell to protect himself.

27
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,586
If you get to know him better,
you'll find

28
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,706
that he's soft-hearted,
fragile, and even sensitive.

29
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:24,746
He has a sincere longing
for the warmth of a family.

30
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:28,586
He had a tough childhood.

31
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:32,507
I don't know when the trauma
his original family

32
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,306
brought him will heal.

33
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:42,904
Yes, I never imagined
he had such an experience.

34
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:49,176
Listen, at this time we absolutely can't

35
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:54,067
simply persuade him
to forgive or not to forgive,

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,787
because we haven't been through
the hardships he has experienced.

37
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:03,987
You're right, dad.
I've been too impatient.

38
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:10,906
Indeed, you're too concerned.

39
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,787
Why are you suddenly so concerned
about Mr. Yao?

40
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:24,826
I've always been concerned about others
since I was young.

41
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:32,147
Besides, Mr. Yao is my friend
and landlord.

42
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,306
It's natural to show some concern.

43
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:37,592
Understood.

44
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:43,907
I just remembered something.

45
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:49,624
One night,
I was tending to these plants.

46
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:55,027
When he came back,
I gave him a pot of flowers.

47
00:04:55,987 --> 00:05:00,707
Here, this pot of flowers is for you.

48
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,360
Thank you, Mr. Mai.

49
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:05,147
A few days later, I noticed

50
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:10,547
that his flowers looked better
than mine.

51
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:17,667
What does that tell you? It tells

52
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:23,826
that Mr. Yao deeply longs for love
and to be loved.

53
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:38,426
Well, I can see him every day.

54
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:44,147
I'll look for an opportunity to talk
to him more and enlighten him.

55
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:49,386
Our family shows him more care.

56
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:56,386
Let him feel the warmth of a family.

57
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:02,826
Let time slowly heal the trauma
in his heart.

58
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,907
Thank you, dad.

59
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,386
Do you want another one?

60
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,587
Can't eat at this late hour.
It'll make me fat.

61
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,056
Who is it?

62
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,960
Mr. Yao.

63
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:42,946
Dong.

64
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:43,987
Long time no see, Mr. Yao.

65
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:48,266
You look the same as
when you were little. Come on in.

66
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,707
Take a seat.

67
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,712
Thanks, Mr. Yao.

68
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,232
Mr. Yao, please have a seat.

69
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,386
Well, Zhiming asked me

70
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:05,347
to come over and see
if you need anything.

71
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,626
How about you lend me some money?

72
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,186
Sorry, but I can't, Mr. Yao.

73
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,547
If I lend you money now,
I will lose my job.

74
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:23,547
Come on. When I was in jail,

75
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,787
didn't you come to see me
on behalf of Zhiming?

76
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,426
But guess what, Mr. Yao?

77
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:30,136
Back then, Zhiming warned me
not to do that again.

78
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:33,027
I advise you

79
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:35,707
to hang out more often.

80
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,946
Look at what's being shown on TV.
The outside world is fascinating.

81
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:42,107
You should go out more
and experience the local culture.

82
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:43,907
It's better than staying here.

83
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:46,787
I knew you two were in cahoots,

84
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,587
desperately trying to drive me away.

85
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,224
Is Zhiming hiding something from me?

86
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,946
No, what could he hide from you?

87
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:58,667
Really? Then why was he so foolish

88
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:02,147
and gave Xing'anli to Mai Chenghuan?

89
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,528
Don't you know your own son?

90
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,386
He's a fool in love.
No one can help him.

91
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,426
What? A fool in love?

92
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:16,186
Are you saying
Zhiming is dating Mai Chenghuan?

93
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,587
Hello? I'll be right there.
Okay, wait for me.

94
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:23,266
Mr. Yao, I have something to do,
so I have to go.

95
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,147
Hello? I'll be there soon.

96
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:33,307
That woman is not simple.

97
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,827
She has Xing'anli,
the old Western-style house,

98
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:43,187
and Zhiming.

99
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:51,906
Yu, what are you doing?

100
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,746
You've been sitting for half an hour.
What are you thinking about?

101
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,472
I still feel something is off.

102
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,072
About what?

103
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:06,626
Huan said that Yao Zhiming's dad
moved to Xing'anli.

104
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:08,187
Don't you find it strange?

105
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,104
His son runs a hotel.

106
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:13,626
Why did he move to Xing'anli?

107
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,666
Could he be trying
to take over Xing'anli?

108
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,146
I don't think so.

109
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:22,786
Besides, Xing'anli
was his family property.

110
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,707
He hasn't returned for many years.

111
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,546
Since he came back to Shanghai,

112
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:29,307
it's normal for him
to visit that place again.

113
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:32,067
I'm afraid he will try to take it back.

114
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,947
Yao Zhiming will stop him.

115
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,947
He can't help. Remember?

116
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:41,386
I used his lunar birthday
for fortune-telling.

117
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:44,546
It predicts a violent mishap.
There's nothing he can do.

118
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,947
You did the same thing
with the astrolabe.

119
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,587
It tells that he'll make a fortune
in the next couple of years.

120
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,546
Yes, how come the results are different?

121
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,427
I still feel his dad is suspicious.
I have to keep an eye on him.

122
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,786
Alright. Come on, get to sleep now.

123
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,026
How exactly should I watch him?

124
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:13,467
Don't rush. Everyone has this.

125
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,120
Come on.
You've seen Roman Holiday, right?

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,144
Yeah, I've seen it.

127
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:19,347
This is the Plaza de Espana.

128
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:21,427
Audrey Hepburn ate ice cream right here.

129
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,107
I bought this ice cream for Zhiming.

130
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,906
He got a mouth full of it.

131
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,067
This is the Prague Square.

132
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:32,546
The singer Jay Chou sang at this place.

133
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,666
Mr. Yao, you've been to these places?

134
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,746
Of course, I went abroad
when I was just a teenager.

135
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,107
Guess what?

136
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:46,427
The grass you're standing on
used to be my football field.

137
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,146
We used to have activities
here every week.

138
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:54,187
Now, Mai Chenghuan owns this place.

139
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,608
In hot weather, do you have
an allowance for working overtime?

140
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,227
No? I'm telling you.

141
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,072
You should learn from foreign countries.
Go on strike.

142
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,592
It's trendy online now for Gen Z
to reform the workplace.

143
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:13,227
We must be against the bosses
who exploit their employees.

144
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:14,232
Yao Renfu.

145
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,152
Get out of here.

146
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,666
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:27,347
I cook, clean, and wash for your son.

148
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:30,040
What are you doing here?
Are you trying to sabotage my daughter?

149
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:35,546
Ms. Liu, I was just joking
to liven up the atmosphere.

150
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,987
I'm telling you that I am very angry.

151
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:40,227
Don't be angry. Let me buy you a coffee.

152
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,227
Coffee? Who wants to drink your coffee?

153
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,386
Top-quality coffee.

154
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,546
Alright. I will take a free coffee.

155
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:50,227
I'll take this chance
to give you a lecture. Let's go.

156
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,504
Please put it
on Mai Chenghuan's account.

157
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,546
Okay.

158
00:11:57,546 --> 00:11:58,866
Ms. Liu, have coffee.

159
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,026
Why should it be charged
to my daughter's account?

160
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:05,987
It's just a cup of coffee.
Your daughter is a boss.

161
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:10,746
As a boss's mom,
how can you be so petty?

162
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:13,427
A cup of coffee is worth nothing.
No big deal.

163
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:17,816
There you go.
Don't treat me as if I'm a bad guy.

164
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:20,408
Although I'm down on my luck now,

165
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,906
I used to be somebody
in Huangpu District,

166
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,026
a well-known Old Gentleman.

167
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:29,080
Before my family emigrated, my assets
were worth more than ten Xing'anlis.

168
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,347
Mr. Yao, that was a long time ago.

169
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,386
A true hero
doesn't dwell on past glories.

170
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:39,626
Don't forget where you're from now.

171
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,947
I made a stupid mistake.

172
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,587
But I have a son.

173
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:50,427
I have passed on my intellect,
insight, and vision to him.

174
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,347
He became such an excellent person

175
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,626
because he has a dad like me.

176
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,307
Your daughter is lucky.

177
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,307
What are you talking about?

178
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,256
Don't you know that?

179
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,952
About what?

180
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,467
Nothing.

181
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:11,626
Ms. Liu, you don't know your daughter.
She's not simple.

182
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,427
Let me tell you, Mr. Yao.

183
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,107
My daughter comes from a decent family,

184
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,827
raised with integrity.

185
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:22,467
Even in business,
she is a respectable businessperson.

186
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:25,067
She let you stay here
out of sympathy for you.

187
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:28,187
She's kind, alright?
You've got to recognize it.

188
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:31,906
If you make trouble for her,
I will fight you to the end.

189
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:46,146
Ms. Liu, take care.

190
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,307
Alright, that's all.
Go back to your work.

191
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,427
Okay, I gotta go.

192
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:57,784
Mom.

193
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:01,746
Why are you here?

194
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm here on important business.

195
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,987
I'm here to keep an eye on Yao Renfu.

196
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,264
Guess what? I found a big issue.

197
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:13,227
He is trying to drive a wedge
between you and your employees.

198
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,336
Are you here to inspect my work?

199
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,160
No, not really.

200
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,987
Listen, he was in jail.

201
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,827
He committed a crime,
which means he was a bad person.

202
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,107
That's why I worry about you.

203
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:28,376
I know, mom.

204
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,227
I have taken it to heart.

205
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,746
But Yao Renfu is Yao Zhiming's dad.

206
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,576
We need to be kind to others, right?

207
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:39,947
I get it, but you should be wary
of potential crises

208
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,827
to protect yourself...

209
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,866
Without harboring the intention
to harm others.

210
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:44,866
Exactly.

211
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,587
I understand.
I will keep what you've told me

212
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,107
in mind, okay?

213
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,746
I'm getting off work.
How about I go back and cook with you?

214
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:54,827
We can go now.

215
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,386
- Sure.
- Go.

216
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:04,347
Mr. Mai, did you invite me to fish
for something else?

217
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:12,626
Are you and Huan together now?

218
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:20,347
Yes, I confessed to her,
and she accepted me.

219
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,546
But we are prioritizing our careers.

220
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:26,386
So we didn't plan to make it public.

221
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,786
You must have thought it through
before confessing to her, right?

222
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:37,906
You must be sincere, right?

223
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:44,107
Mr. Mai, I'm absolutely sincere
towards her.

224
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:52,467
How do you plan to resolve the matter
with your dad?

225
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,307
Rest assured, I will make him move out
as soon as possible.

226
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,587
He won't bother you anymore.

227
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,506
No, that's not what I mean.

228
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,786
I'm not asking you
to drive your dad away.

229
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:11,307
Let me tell you something
that happened to me.

230
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:19,026
More than 20 years ago,
my mom passed away.

231
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:26,587
But not long after, my dad decided
to marry your Grandma.

232
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,467
I was very angry.

233
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:35,227
In a fit of anger,
I cut off ties with my dad.

234
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:40,146
I never went to see him when he died.

235
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:49,227
Later, I reached the age of my dad.

236
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:51,427
I slowly realized

237
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:58,266
that what the elderly fear most
is loneliness.

238
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,987
The elderly need a companion.

239
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,427
At that time,
I just started my own family.

240
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,147
I devoted all my attention
to my daughter

241
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,306
and my own home.

242
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,306
I owe my dad.

243
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:30,187
Mr. Mai, you're not like my dad.

244
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,147
No need to persuade me to forgive him.

245
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:40,147
You're a smart person.
You will understand what I mean.

246
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:46,147
Huan is my daughter,
and no one knows her better than I do.

247
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:52,867
Once she accepts you,
she will be wholeheartedly good to you.

248
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,632
I hope you don't let the past

249
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,066
affect your emotions

250
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:05,147
or your relationship with my daughter.

251
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:12,786
I don't want Huan to suffer any setbacks
in her emotional life.

252
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:20,546
Mr. Mai, although I'm not sure

253
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,187
how long I can be with Huan,

254
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,306
I can promise
that I will cherish every moment

255
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,306
I spend with her.

256
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,066
It's such a good rod.

257
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,387
This box is quite heavy.

258
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,187
Mr. Yao, why don't you wait here for me?

259
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,408
I'll bring the car here.

260
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:53,496
I'll drive.

261
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:57,826
You drive? That isn't proper.

262
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:03,867
Give me the key, Mr. Mai.
Come on. Wait here for me,

263
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:05,546
I'll go with you.

264
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,026
Back. Good.

265
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,826
I'll cook, and you rest.
That's your dad.

266
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:12,920
It's okay now.

267
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,586
- Dad.
- How come you're back so early?

268
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:21,506
He's your boss.
How could you let him drive?

269
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:22,746
And you were directing him?

270
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,147
This is between men.
You don't understand.

271
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,147
Come over here. Don't do stupid things.

272
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,106
It's okay to let him help at home.

273
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,586
Outside, he's your boss.

274
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:34,987
I'll help you cook when we get back.

275
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:37,106
- Huan, give it to me.
- Hurry up with the cooking.

276
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,266
Hurry. Go home.

277
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,147
What did you guys do?

278
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,306
We went fishing.

279
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:47,667
Your dad has accepted me.

280
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,026
What did you say?

281
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,867
Your dad has accepted me.

282
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,746
Good for you, Mr. Yao.
You're quite efficient.

283
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,026
Of course, let's go.

284
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,987
Don't pull me in case my mom finds out.

285
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,266
Don't follow me.
Come in later and keep your distance.

286
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,987
What's there to be afraid of?

287
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:24,227
This is the place.
Look, they live upstairs.

288
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:27,546
Various guests come and go all day here.

289
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:30,840
How can I let Dingding live
in such a place?

290
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,867
Their home is upstairs.

291
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,432
- Take pictures.
- Why are you here again?

292
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,987
I came with a lawyer.

293
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,306
What is he taking pictures of?

294
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:40,586
Aren't you suing me?
I'm here to gather evidence.

295
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,427
There's a process
for collecting evidence.

296
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:44,627
We don't allow photography here.

297
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,136
Mai Chengzao, you didn't learn enough
at my law firm,

298
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,627
so you will pay tuition to learn?

299
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,306
Mr. Song, to fight against such a brat,

300
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,907
is it worth it for you
to pay me so much?

301
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,106
As a dad, I did it all for my child.

302
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,826
I hope to make it foolproof.

303
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:13,867
Mr. Luo, as a lawyer,
you uphold justice.

304
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,306
There's no need
to flaunt your seniority.

305
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:21,667
Be careful.
A novice like me could take you down.

306
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,867
I will give my all to this case.

307
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:34,066
Let's meet in court. You may leave.

308
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,456
We shall wait and see.

309
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,746
Don't forget how you punched me.
I'll make you pay.

310
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:49,867
Song Huaimin, if you come again,
I'll punch you.

311
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,106
Let's go. Calm down.

312
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:04,387
You were so cool
when you were confronting that lawyer.

313
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:06,667
I've never seen you like that before.

314
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:10,987
Oh, my, let's celebrate.

315
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:18,667
- Be careful.
- I'm too excited.

316
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,026
Mao, I want
to discuss something with you.

317
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,427
Do you remember when we got together,

318
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,746
you gave me a chance to choose again?

319
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,266
Now, putting myself in your shoes,

320
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,147
I also want to give you a chance
to choose again.

321
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:42,467
Choose what?

322
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:49,987
I can't deny
that Luo Mingli is better than me.

323
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:56,346
I'm thinking
whether we should find a senior lawyer

324
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,627
to help you with this case.

325
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,667
So you have no confidence in yourself?

326
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:07,266
No, I'm serious. I hope you can win.

327
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:14,427
I'm serious too.
I hope that we can win together.

328
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:20,667
We should
confront this lawsuit together.

329
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:25,506
I need you now very much.

330
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,826
And I believe that you can win.

331
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,947
Once we win the lawsuit,
we'll bring Dingding over

332
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:40,746
to start a new life, alright?

333
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,624
Okay.

334
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:15,266
Excuse me, are you Yao Renfu?

335
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:19,320
I made an appointment with you.

336
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,296
You are...?

337
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,907
Mr. Yao, I am Ziyu's mom.

338
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:34,586
Zhiming took care of Ziyu
when she was in Switzerland,

339
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:36,667
acting both as a teacher
and as an elder brother.

340
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,546
Do you remember?

341
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:42,667
Ms. Zhang?

342
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:45,147
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

343
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,667
What can I do for you?

344
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:55,266
Your family's property
has been taken away.

345
00:24:55,266 --> 00:25:00,152
Yes, Mai Chenghuan is too cunning.

346
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:04,056
She's totally fooled my mom and Zhiming.

347
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,667
Such a huge property is given to her.

348
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:09,592
As an outsider, I can't even stand by.

349
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:13,627
So I want to discuss with you

350
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:17,627
how to retrieve your property.

351
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:18,680
Great.

352
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:28,346
But why do you want
to get involved, Ms. Zhang?

353
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:34,907
I have my reasons,
but there are benefits for you.

354
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,280
You just returned. I guess
you have no time to exchange money.

355
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,907
This is my welcome gift for you.

356
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:55,826
Ms. Zhang, feel free
to share your bright ideas.

357
00:25:57,627 --> 00:26:01,066
We'll contact you
when the right opportunity arises.

358
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,987
Come on.

359
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,026
Alright.

360
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,826
(Top Ten Unique Hotels in Shanghai)
Duoduo starts working today.

361
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:12,467
The two of you have already met.

362
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,467
From now on, you'll be a small team
and should help each other.

363
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,227
Alright, I'll get straight to the point.

364
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:21,867
Our hotel is currently ranked fifteenth
in the selection.

365
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,506
But we still have a month to go.

366
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:24,867
So we need to make a sprint for it.

367
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:26,467
Do you have any good ideas?

368
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:29,266
The top 14 are all large groups.

369
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,600
Their customer base and the capital pool
are much larger than ours.

370
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:36,106
We're competing
against strong rivalries.

371
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:38,586
Yes, so we need
to leverage external forces.

372
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:39,907
I have an idea now.

373
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,667
The Shanghai Tourism Festival
is coming up.

374
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,266
As I know, during the first week
of the opening,

375
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,106
a delegation is coming to Shanghai.

376
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,187
Among them,
there are government leaders,

377
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:52,586
global hotel industry leaders,
journalists, and brand representatives.

378
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,707
Moreover, the theme of this event

379
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:57,306
happens to be about tasting history,
inheritance, and exploring secrets.

380
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,896
Xing'anli is
an old Shanghainese-style building.

381
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:03,786
So I hope we can take on the reception.

382
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:05,826
Then we'll do a marketing campaign
with significant impact.

383
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:11,346
Good, Chenghuan, you're quite ambitious.

384
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:14,746
It's like gambling with small stakes.
Quite thrilling.

385
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,346
Alright, leave the promotion to me.

386
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:19,987
I'll promote it
on all the major platforms.

387
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:21,106
I will provide backups.

388
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,586
I'm relieved to hear that.

389
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,432
Let's all work hard together.

390
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:26,546
Come on.

391
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:45,546
Mr. Yao, where have you been?
You look so happy.

392
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,387
Where did all this money?

393
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:50,360
None of your business.

394
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:56,387
No, I just think
that life is finally getting better.

395
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:58,040
Don't make the same mistakes again.

396
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,066
I've been in jail for 15 years.

397
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:02,106
Even if you send me to gamble now,
I'd be scared, alright?

398
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:06,387
What? You took away my property.

399
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:09,066
And I can't even have some money?

400
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,387
No, Mr. Yao, you've got me wrong.

401
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:14,586
I'm happy for you to have money.

402
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,147
How is it going?
Are you getting used to living here?

403
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:21,346
If possible, can I treat you to a meal
before you leave?

404
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,746
Who said I was leaving?

405
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,786
Did Yao Zhiming say something?

406
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,187
Is he trying to drive me away?

407
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:31,586
No, you misunderstood what I was saying.

408
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,346
If there's nothing else,
I'll get back to work.

409
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:42,707
(Wanna drive me away? No way.)

410
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:59,427
Right, draw circles like this.

411
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:02,826
Yes, draw circles with your hands.

412
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,987
- Let it float.
- Chenghuan is tough.

413
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:07,187
But I can deal with her mom.

414
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:16,600
Ms. Liu.

415
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,187
Long time no see.

416
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:24,427
Why are you here?

417
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:25,467
How did you find me?

418
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:27,586
This square is open to the public.

419
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:29,387
Everyone can come.

420
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,907
Coming here isn't
against the law, right?

421
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,947
Liu Wanyu, you're quite clever.

422
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:35,987
You've found an Old Gentleman
as a dance partner.

423
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,586
Are you kidding? Get lost.

424
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:40,786
Come over here and talk.
Just leave when you're finished.

425
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:41,848
No problem.

426
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:44,187
Scared? Who's scared of you?
Come over here.

427
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,546
What is it? Spit it out.

428
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,506
Ms. Liu.

429
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:50,586
Stand there and talk.

430
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,586
Ms. Liu, we shouldn't be hostile.

431
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,947
I'm here to make a connection with you.

432
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:02,746
A connection? With someone like you?

433
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:04,867
Listen, there's no way for us
to make a connection.

434
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:07,467
It doesn't matter.

435
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,826
But it can happen to the children.

436
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:12,026
The children? What's happening?

437
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:16,227
Look at you, you're a mom.

438
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:20,586
Don't you know your daughter
and my son are in a relationship?

439
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,227
Do you need
to find a well-matched son-in-law?

440
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,427
The right one is right there.
Don't you realize it?

441
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:28,627
They are dating.

442
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:33,266
I think we should ask a fortune-teller
for advice first.

443
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,506
As for the wedding date,
it's set for next month.

444
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:41,427
The banquet will be held
at our own hotel to reduce costs.

445
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:45,227
And we'll decide on the invitation list.

446
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,026
Sir, what are you two talking about?

447
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:01,506
Mom, I'm in a meeting.

448
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,227
Calm down. Figure it out first.

449
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:13,187
Sir, how much longer to Botticelli?

450
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,786
About 20 minutes.

451
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:18,546
Drive faster, please. I'm in a hurry.

452
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,586
Be careful. Drive slower.

453
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:25,947
No, drive faster.

454
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:32,786
Next, please welcome Yao Zhiming,
the new president of East China Region,

455
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,707
to give a brief speech.

456
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:37,867
Welcome.

457
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:45,147
First of all, thank you all
for your companionship and support.

458
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:46,987
Actually, my original intention
hasn't changed.

459
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,907
My ideals and goals
have also remained unchanged.

460
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:56,907
That is to have our hotel stand tall
by the bustling Huangpu River

461
00:31:56,907 --> 00:32:01,387
to become the most dazzling pearl
by the river. Thank you.

462
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,867
Good.

463
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,346
Congratulations, Mr. Yao.

464
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:08,472
Congratulations, Mr. Yao.

465
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:10,040
Thank you.

466
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:27,786
Alright, that's all.
Go back to your work.

467
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,586
Ms. Liu, why are you here?

468
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:42,872
Please.

469
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,987
Is it because you wanted to be
in a relationship with Huan

470
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,387
that you allowed us to move
into the old Western-style house?

471
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:21,546
Are you the mouse
running around at home?

472
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:32,987
Yeah, Mrs. Mai,
I'm that mouse running around

473
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,176
at home.

474
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:46,746
But Mai Chenghuan and I are
in a serious relationship.

475
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,907
So are you dating?

476
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:59,026
It's huge. Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

477
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:05,387
That's because the two of us

478
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,267
aren't ready to tell you.

479
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:10,347
So when do you think you'll be ready?

480
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:14,626
I'm telling you.
As long as you live in this house

481
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,987
and you're not married,
I'll have the right to discipline you.

482
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:24,267
Yes, you should do that.

483
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:32,347
How about I discuss it
with Chenghuan later?

484
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,026
In your workplace,

485
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:46,226
there are so many beautiful girls.
Can you restrain yourself?

486
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,267
Can you?

487
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,106
What?

488
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:56,626
I mean, do you know what to do?

489
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:57,987
Yes, I do.

490
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:01,987
Mrs. Mai, my assistant is a man.

491
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:04,186
And these female colleagues

492
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,586
were Chenghuan's good friends.

493
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:11,226
I am open to supervision
at any time and any place.

494
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,186
You often stay up late, right?

495
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:19,586
Your life is quite irregular, isn't it?

496
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:22,467
This will certainly affect your health.

497
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:29,666
Yes, so whenever I have time,
I will work out.

498
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:33,787
I have indeed noticed it.

499
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:37,387
One more thing.

500
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:42,626
Huan's social status.

501
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:46,226
You know the threshold
of marrying my daughter.

502
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,586
I only accept the son-in-law
who can live in my house.

503
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:58,146
That's what I ask for.

504
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:12,146
Alright, I'll be watching you for years.

505
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,867
Let's see if you can wait that long.

506
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:17,506
I'll see what your real intention is.

507
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:22,307
Okay, I'll accept your supervision.
Trust me, Mrs. Mai.

508
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:26,706
I have to
go on a store inspection later.

509
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,267
Mrs. Mai, so...

510
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:31,387
Store inspection? I'll go with you.

511
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,347
I'll take the opportunity to learn.

512
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,747
Alright, please.

513
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,568
Please.

514
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:51,947
Yao, I have a back problem.

515
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:55,706
You need to be steady
when accelerating and braking.

516
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,787
Don't worry, Mrs. Mai. I will be.

517
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:00,696
Good.

518
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:55,546
Being a boss is quite tough.

519
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,106
But I have to say

520
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:02,546
a man should be a bit busy.

521
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:07,546
If you're busy,
you won't have the energy for trifles

522
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,347
and will focus on work.

523
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:13,747
Mrs. Mai, you've spent so much time
accompanying me around all day.

524
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:16,546
Actually, you have accepted me
in your heart,

525
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,387
but you don't want
to admit it so soon, right?

526
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,706
You're quite optimistic, aren't you?

527
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:31,947
Yao, let me tell you.
Being a boss is one thing,

528
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:33,546
and being a husband is another.

529
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:35,787
It's different, isn't it?

530
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:40,347
Yes, so now I need to go
and pick Chenghuan up from work

531
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,947
and be a good boyfriend.

532
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:48,706
That's more like it. Keep it up.

533
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:50,296
Yes.

534
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:57,827
I haven't agreed
that you two can be together.

535
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,546
Don't think you've persuaded me.

536
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,226
Regarding the two of you,

537
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:09,226
I'm going to say some serious words.

538
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:22,146
I have noticed that Ming is a good kid,

539
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:27,307
especially when he lives with us.

540
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:30,586
I think he has many merits.

541
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,186
You two are together.

542
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:42,387
But regarding your family,

543
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:44,146
and your dad, Yao Renfu,

544
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:50,787
he was in jail before.

545
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:56,506
To be honest,
if Huan enters such a family,

546
00:39:56,506 --> 00:40:02,747
I am not mentally prepared for this.
What should I do?

547
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,387
Mrs. Mai, I'm different from him.

548
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:11,226
Rest assured,
I will not give him any chances

549
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,586
to trouble Chenghuan or your family.

550
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:17,432
Are you sure?

551
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:18,520
I promise.

552
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:25,987
And if we consider getting married
in the future,

553
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:30,106
I will have a lawyer draft an agreement.

554
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:31,787
What agreement?

555
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:35,000
Firstly, Chenghuan's pre-marital assets
will be protected comprehensively.

556
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:38,787
Secondly, my properties,

557
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:43,186
including real estate, this house,
and savings will be transferred

558
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:45,106
to Mai Chenghuan.

559
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,827
No, you don't have to.

560
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:55,987
I was just expressing my concerns

561
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,747
to let you know.

562
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:01,226
If you do so, it'll make me so mean.
You don't have to.

563
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,387
Mrs. Mai, I will do this
even if you don't bring it up.

564
00:41:04,907 --> 00:41:07,387
Besides, you're right.

565
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,506
Since I was young,
maybe due to my family environment,

566
00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:17,506
I've always been a selfish person.

567
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:19,787
I don't know what a home is.

568
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,186
I don't know what love is.

569
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:27,546
I never thought about falling in love
with someone one day.

570
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:33,387
Since I met Chenghuan,

571
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:39,987
she's brought different colors
to my world

572
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:45,026
and made me look forward to the future.

573
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:51,867
And as I spend time with you,

574
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:58,026
I realize what home is
and what warmth is.

575
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:04,186
In my heart,
I have long regarded you as my family.

576
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:09,787
So I hope you can give me a chance

577
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:12,506
to love Chenghuan

578
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:18,226
and become part of your family.

579
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,427
You have told your mom?

580
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,347
You should have done this earlier.

581
00:42:39,947 --> 00:42:43,267
Chenghuan,
I have to criticize you for this.

582
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:47,506
How could you not tell your mom
about such a big thing?

583
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:53,947
You already know about this?

584
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,907
I've long seen the signs.
