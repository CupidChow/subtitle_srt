=Episode 30=

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,879
There will be retribution!

4
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,072
Liao Gang,
have you gone mad? Take him out.

5
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,000
Let go! I can walk.

6
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,344
Are you okay?

7
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,200
Everyone, I'll say it one last time.

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,080
Regarding the use of one's position
for convenience

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,679
and to seek benefits for oneself
and external companies,

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,519
I will never allow it.

11
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,479
Once discovered,
the one will never be hired again.

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,079
M-M-Miss Mai, we didn't know
about what Liao Gang did.

13
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,896
Right, we had no idea at all.

14
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:20,960
It's true.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,040
I know.

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,599
Mr. Shen, thank you
for choosing Botticelli.

17
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,199
I'll have He Dong go
over the subsequent matters with you.

18
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,400
Mr. Yao, thank you.

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,879
- Pleasant cooperation!
- You too!

20
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,919
(Liao Gang, what are you talking about?)

21
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,240
- (Shut up!)
- What are you watching?

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
(You think you are a good person?)

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,359
(Aren't you going to
call the police? Do it.)

24
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,160
This scene looks so familiar.
Let me think.

25
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,160
Does it remind you
of defeating Deshan at the bid?

26
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,584
(There will be retribution!)

27
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:19,640
(Liao Gang!)

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,479
What's going on?

29
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,720
Chenghuan, are you okay?

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
Yeah.

31
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,439
Let me have a look.

32
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,760
You're so hot and you say you're fine?
I'll take you to the hospital.

33
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,039
No need. I'm really fine.

34
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,439
Come on.

35
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,744
- No need.
- Come on.

36
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,112
Be good. Take it slow.

37
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I've said I'm fine, Yao Zhiming.

38
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,119
What's wrong? Still feeling upset?

39
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,640
Stop thinking about it.
You're sick and in the hospital.

40
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,720
Rest for now.

41
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,919
I just don't quite get it.

42
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
I don't think I've done anything wrong.

43
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
I just hope to do my job well.

44
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,599
I just want to be like Grandma

45
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,439
and be a leader that everyone likes.

46
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,999
But I can't do it.

47
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,039
Of course, you can't do it.

48
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,760
It's impossible to please everyone
with everything.

49
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,392
And not everyone is as nice as you.

50
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,352
I've long told you
that being a leader isn't easy.

51
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,264
You'll have to face
such situations a lot.

52
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,688
And you also have to lead your team

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
to victory.

54
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,504
But you've already done so well.
You didn't do anything wrong today.

55
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,019
I just began to understand you.

56
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,820
Now I realize why you had a serious face

57
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,339
every day when I first met you.

58
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,539
Come on.

59
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,219
You're friendly. You're so friendly.

60
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,380
So annoying. Go get me tissues.

61
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,019
My nose is almost running.
Didn't you see it?

62
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,219
Okay, Miss Mai.

63
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,264
Let me wipe it for you.

64
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,659
The world doesn't end without you.

65
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,016
But I would.

66
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,820
The world doesn't end without you.

67
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,979
But if you don't drink water,
your kidneys will.

68
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,624
Why are you copying what I said again?

69
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
And you even added some innovation.

70
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,060
Yao Zhiming,

71
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,219
you believe in me, right?

72
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,659
Of course I do, Miss Mai.

73
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,608
But first, shouldn't you rest
and recover from your illness?

74
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm on a business trip right now.

75
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,544
Why don't you stay
in the hospital for one more night?

76
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,620
I'll come pick you up to go home later.

77
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,220
No need, Mr. Yao. I'm already fine.

78
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,140
I just want to breathe some fresh air.

79
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,220
Okay, but don't sneak back to work.

80
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,220
Take a stroll and then go home early
to rest. Do you hear me?

81
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,100
Okay, Mr. Yao. Bye.

82
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,648
Duoduo?

83
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,380
Chenghuan!

84
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,260
Chenghuan, you're really different now.

85
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,176
You're a boss lady,
and you've changed a lot.

86
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,848
What about you?
How are things going at the apartment?

87
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,976
There have been some personnel changes,

88
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,920
and I'm out of a job now.

89
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,360
So, what are your plans now?

90
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,419
My family sees
that I haven't made it in Shanghai.

91
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,220
They're urging me
to go back home and get married.

92
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,580
But I really don't want to live
a life where I can see the end.

93
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,260
I really like Shanghai.

94
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,520
Every day is full of vitality.

95
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,296
Every day, something new happens.

96
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,779
I really want to stay.

97
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,860
Duoduo, it's been a while
since I took over Xing'anli,

98
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,500
and I've made some progress.

99
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,288
Right now, I'm in need of people.

100
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,419
Would you like to come

101
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
and join Xing'anli with me?

102
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,500
Really? Chenghuan, I...

103
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,260
But I'm afraid I'm not up to it.

104
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,419
I only worked
in the apartment property department.

105
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,659
I don't know much about hotels.

106
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,500
Everyone starts a new job

107
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,419
from scratch, just like I did.

108
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,819
And now I am doing just fine, aren't I?

109
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,140
I've worked with you,
and I know your capabilities.

110
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,580
Even I believe in you.
Why doubt yourself?

111
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,592
So why not give yourself
a chance and try it with me?

112
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,220
Thank you, Chenghuan.
I will definitely work hard.

113
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,500
I'll go all out for myself.

114
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,539
Get some more sleep

115
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,100
and don't be so quick to get up.

116
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,376
Mom.

117
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,620
Zao.

118
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:55,939
You're back.

119
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,819
Mom, a new dim sum shop
opened downstairs of our office.

120
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,740
I queued up for a long time
during my lunch break to get these

121
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,620
for you and Huan.

122
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,899
Okay. Huan is not feeling well.
She's sleeping upstairs.

123
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,380
I'll take it to her when she wakes up.

124
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:25,944
You try it.

125
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,059
Alright.

126
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:33,580
Tasty, isn't it?

127
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,819
Yes. Really tasty. You have one too.

128
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,256
Eat it.

129
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,220
Tasty, right?

130
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,768
Yes.

131
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,819
You haven't eaten yet, right?
I will cook for you.

132
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,380
I've got your favorite shrimp dumplings.

133
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,419
The shrimp are big and nutritious.

134
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,380
Take a seat and wait over there.

135
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,860
Make yourself a cup of tea.
You know where it is.

136
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,019
Just wait there.
I will get it done shortly.

137
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,500
It will be ready soon. Go have a seat.

138
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,299
Go.

139
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,539
It's still a bit hot.
Be careful when eating.

140
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,740
Let me get you some tissues,
in case your clothes get dirty.

141
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,460
Tasty, isn't it?

142
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes.

143
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Eat more.

144
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,032
Zao,

145
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,340
you didn't receive

146
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,860
enough attention from me
when growing up.

147
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,019
I often dismissed your efforts

148
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:12,472
and didn't consider
your feelings. I'm truly sorry.

149
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,592
But you never blamed me

150
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,500
and always smiled.

151
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,380
I really owe you an apology.

152
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,744
Mom, it's all in the past.
I don't hold onto it.

153
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,220
Wrong is wrong.
I won't make excuses for myself.

154
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,272
Mom, it's really okay.
It's all in the past.

155
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,220
But I promise
I will never do that again.

156
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,260
Eat, come on.

157
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,860
Zao, come back and live here.

158
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,779
You work so hard. You need
someone to take care of you.

159
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,136
Mom, don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

160
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,380
Now you see.

161
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,580
The house is bigger, but it's quieter.

162
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,019
Not like the old days in the old house.

163
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:39,740
The house was small,
but we lived together.

164
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,899
It was lively and happy.

165
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:51,320
Mom, I'm working on a very tricky case.

166
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,380
Once I'm done,
I will come back home to live.

167
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,140
Really?

168
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,200
Yes.

169
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,939
Don't lie to me.

170
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,019
Of course I won't.

171
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,380
You must come back.

172
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,500
Okay, I got it.

173
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,980
You go ahead with your business
and take care of your health.

174
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,699
But come back for meals often.

175
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,376
I will make you something good to eat.

176
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:13,464
Okay.

177
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,464
Eat it.

178
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,220
Don't cry anymore.

179
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,520
Eat.

180
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:48,100
(Work plan)

181
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,179
Huan, are you awake?

182
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,019
Mom, come in.

183
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,460
What do you want to eat?
I will cook it for you.

184
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,019
Look at you.
Why are you not listening again?

185
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,899
I told you to take a good rest.

186
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,580
And you started working.

187
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
I know, Mom.

188
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,820
I was in bed for too long,

189
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,499
so I wanted to get up and move around.

190
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:18,899
Okay then, I will ensure
your nutrition as support.

191
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,944
Look at the Anhui cuisine cookbook
you gave me.

192
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,820
Just say what dish you like,
and I will make it for you.

193
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,736
You're now learning to cook
from the recipe book.

194
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,659
Of course, I have to
keep up with your pace.

195
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,616
I'm studying hard.

196
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,939
I will not only learn
these traditional dishes,

197
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,380
but in the future, I also want
to learn Western dishes,

198
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,340
like steak, pork chop, fish steak, salad

199
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,739
and so on.

200
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,939
You're so trendy.
You also want to learn Western cuisine.

201
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,820
I'm a bit eager.

202
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,620
Tell me what you'd like
to eat today. I'll make it for you.

203
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:57,240
I will do a phased review
of your achievements.

204
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,340
No problem.

205
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,380
- This.
- This?

206
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
This is what I'm best at.

207
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,032
This one is very good,
just a bit complex.

208
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,179
A bit complex.

209
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,752
It's alright. I can do it.

210
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,140
Let's finish with this.

211
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,300
This one requires preparation.
How about tomorrow?

212
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,419
Alright, tomorrow.

213
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,020
I hyped up
my cooking skills a little bit.

214
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,219
You ordered all this food,
and it makes me kind of stressed.

215
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:24,020
I'm leaving now. Rest.

216
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,140
Got it.

217
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,140
How are you? Feeling better?

218
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,232
You asked me so many times.

219
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,699
I'm fine now. And you?
Is your work going smoothly?

220
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:50,380
Yes. I'm off to the airport now.
I'll see you tonight.

221
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,899
Aren't you supposed to be coming back
the day after tomorrow?

222
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,979
I am worried about you
and want to hurry back and be with you.

223
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,340
Are you that worried?

224
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,616
Hello.

225
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,459
Hello, Dong.

226
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,860
Alright. Hurry on your way.

227
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,179
Be careful. I'll wait for you.

228
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,419
Okay, bye.

229
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,464
Bye.

230
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,820
Mr. Yao, don't get wet
in the rain. I'd be worried.

231
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,419
What are you here for?

232
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:42,939
Who are you?

233
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:46,072
I am me. Who are you?

234
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,939
I am the owner of this house.

235
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,419
Impossible. The owner
of this house is Yao Zhiming.

236
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,179
I am Yao Zhiming's father.

237
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,140
Hold on. How can you
prove you are his father?

238
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,739
Don't just tell me. Show me!

239
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,340
Get him over, and you'll know.

240
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,300
You get out. You...

241
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,300
What are you doing? Get out!

242
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,699
- Go away.
- If you don't leave, I...

243
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,219
You get out of here. You can't sit here.

244
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:19,620
- Mom.
- Who are you?

245
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,979
- Who are you?
- He just came in like that.

246
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,060
Who are you?

247
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,219
H-H-He says he's Yao Zhiming's father.

248
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,499
You...

249
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:34,780
When I was seven or eight,
our family went bankrupt.

250
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,060
My dad was unable to repay debts,
so he left me and my mom.

251
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
I'm telling you. I will call the police.

252
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,620
Go ahead.

253
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,140
No. It's a misunderstanding.

254
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,424
Mr. Yao, my name is Mai Chenghuan.

255
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:53,176
I'm the daughter of Mai Laitian.
This is my mother.

256
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,300
Mai? My mom remarried your old man.

257
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,179
And now all of your family

258
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,020
live in our house?

259
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,340
Is he really Yao Zhiming's father?

260
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
I guess so.

261
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:14,904
But Yao Zhiming

262
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,459
allowed us to move in.

263
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,259
So now we're the owners of the house.

264
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:20,340
Impossible.

265
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,219
Zhiming. Yao Zhiming!

266
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,179
Mr. Yao, we're glad that you are here.

267
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,060
I'll go make you some tea.
Why don't we have a good talk?

268
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,020
Zhiming is on a business trip.
I'll call him and ask him to come back.

269
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,860
Mom, don't argue with him. Put it down.

270
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,340
Okay.

271
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
I'll be right back.

272
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,659
Zhiming, where are you now?
Your father is here.

273
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,060
Mr. Yao, is there anything else
you would like to eat?

274
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,060
Whatever good food you have
at home, bring it all out.

275
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,140
Is there any wine?

276
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,259
We got no wine.

277
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:23,064
Zhiming.

278
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,656
Zhiming.

279
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,259
Zhiming, can't you recognize me?

280
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,400
I've been missing you
in prison for so many years.

281
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,459
As soon as I got out,
I started asking around where you were.

282
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:45,459
When I knew you were in China,

283
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:47,419
I bought a red-eye flight ticket
right away.

284
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm telling you. I am not your son.

285
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,300
What do you want to do?

286
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:56,472
Zhiming, you...

287
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:58,580
- What are you doing?
- Yao Zhiming, calm down.

288
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,620
- Stay out.
- Don't pull me.

289
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,659
Go back.

290
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,300
- You...
- Yao Zhiming.

291
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,352
You...

292
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:11,580
So Yao Zhiming's father
has been to prison.

293
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,659
What crime did he commit?

294
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,780
I don't know.

295
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,419
How could you not know?

296
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,699
His mom... Your mom...

297
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,540
How is it my mom?

298
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,739
I've never met him.

299
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,776
Also, this is his family matter.

300
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,939
Don't pry into it. Let Zhiming
handle it himself. Remember that.

301
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,259
Zhiming, look what I've brought you.
Two bottles of good spirits.

302
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:47,060
It's the most I could get.

303
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,899
Let's have a good drink tonight.

304
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,939
Where are we going?

305
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,120
The airport.

306
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,860
I flew back
after sitting for over ten hours.

307
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,739
My butt has gone numb,
and you want to send me back.

308
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,699
I will buy you a first-class ticket.

309
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,580
You'll have a comfortable trip
back to Switzerland.

310
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,100
Yao Zhiming, you're trying
to send me to death

311
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,300
and you expect me to say thank you.

312
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,459
You are my own son,
my only family in the world.

313
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,020
You're aware that it's just you and me?

314
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,860
I was just stupid.

315
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,140
You know, just small stakes.

316
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,800
I never expected
to be sentenced for 15 years.

317
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,780
Small stakes? You were one step away
from running a casino at home.

318
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,300
I had no skills
and I had to raise a family.

319
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Haven't I spent
all these years behind bars?

320
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,640
The judge saw my good behavior
and allowed me to be released early.

321
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,739
Isn't it time for you to forgive me?

322
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,540
Why should I?
After all the bad things you've done,

323
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,060
now you want to start afresh?

324
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:18,840
Zhiming, I know
you need time to accept me.

325
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,580
I will fight for time for myself.

326
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,300
(Jiu Ji)

327
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,300
There's a tree in my house
bringing in wealth.

328
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,179
Today you will leave
without any money left.

329
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,264
Three of Characters.

330
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:23,380
Five of Characters.

331
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,219
This apartment
is about to be foreclosed on.

332
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,580
Yao Renfu, what did you say
when you married me?

333
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,820
What did you promise me?

334
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,100
You can sleep on the streets!

335
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,432
Are you okay? Do you need me?

336
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,659
(I'm fine.)

337
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:59,100
Regarding the vacancy
due to the dismissal of that employee,

338
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,820
do you have any thoughts?

339
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,659
We're already scouting candidates.

340
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:05,688
Miss Mai, do you have
any other requirements?

341
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:09,240
No, I don't. You are
the professionals. I trust you.

342
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,416
Just tell me when the interview begins.

343
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,300
Okay.

344
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,312
I've invited a very outstanding girl

345
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:19,340
named Qian Duoduo,
who is my former colleague.

346
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,899
I will send you her information later
for you to review.

347
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,100
All right, Miss Mai.

348
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:32,780
Is there anything else?

349
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,512
Miss Mai, we support you.

350
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,620
We think it was all Liao Gang's fault.

351
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,340
We followed Ms. Chen all the way.

352
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,739
Actually, when we saw you
taking over Xing'anli,

353
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,259
we were quite happy in our hearts.

354
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,060
The way you strive reminds us
of Ms. Chen in her early days.

355
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,939
Please take care of your health

356
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:57,939
as you're going to lead us
to fight a tough battle.

357
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,259
Thank you, I will.

358
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
I'm leaving.

359
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,459
Miss Mai, an old man
is acting sneakily at the door,

360
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,979
claiming that this hotel is his.

361
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:21,419
The security guard finds it
inappropriate to drive an old man away.

362
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,459
Do you have time to go check it out?

363
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,060
I'll go have a look with you.

364
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,860
Okay. Get back to your work.

365
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,739
- It's surprising
- Miss Mai.

366
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:35,860
that the business is good here.

367
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,219
Mr. Yao's father, Yao Renfu,

368
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,459
has been a wretch
and addicted to gambling.

369
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:41,976
Even Ms. Chen could do
nothing about him.

370
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,340
I know. I met him yesterday.

371
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:51,540
Hello, Mr. Yao.

372
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:54,659
Why is it you again?

373
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,179
Grandma made a will
before she passed away.

374
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,160
She entrusted Xing'anli to me.

375
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,008
You don't share
any blood relation with my mom.

376
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,952
How could you take over it?
Zhiming is the biological one.

377
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,140
If you have any objections to the will,

378
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,540
you may ask Yao Zhiming.
He's very clear about the whole thing.

379
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,860
Who knows what you did
to get him bewitched?

380
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,860
Anyway, I don't have
a place to stay right now.

381
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,259
If you don't return Xing'anli
to Zhiming, I won't leave.

382
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:24,140
I want the whole world to know

383
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,140
that you are a vicious woman
who snatches others' possessions.

384
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,060
Yao, what are you trying to do?

385
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,136
It's okay, Mr. Cui.

386
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,540
Mr. Yao, since you have nowhere to stay,

387
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,939
I will arrange a room for you.

388
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:38,540
We can talk about it later.
Is that okay?

389
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,259
This is more like it.

390
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,140
I am my mother's only child.

391
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,820
She's watching from heaven.

392
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,672
I know.

393
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,856
Feng, help Mr. Yao check in.

394
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:53,912
Okay.

395
00:30:53,912 --> 00:30:55,179
Just follow her.

396
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,459
We are in the final stage
of the evaluation.

397
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,728
Will such arrangements
cause any trouble?

398
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,300
I understand your concern, Mr. Cui.

399
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,939
But we can't just let him
wander the streets now, can we?

400
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,459
Could you please inform the staff

401
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,739
to take good care of him?

402
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:22,424
Don't let him wander
around the work areas.

403
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,219
As usual, I'll cover his room expenses.
Thank you for your effort.

404
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:40,020
Who is it? So rude. I'm coming!

405
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,620
Zhiming, you're here. Come in.

406
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,459
Grab your luggage and leave now.

407
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,659
Zhiming, what do I have to say
for you to believe me?

408
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:01,899
I've come back to sincerely apologize
and to make it up to you.

409
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,020
Sorry, I don't need it
because we're not close.

410
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,208
You need to apologize
and make amends to Grandma and Mom.

411
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,419
Zhiming, after all,
we are father and son.

412
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,820
Do you have to say
such things that hurt me?

413
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:25,860
Father and son? Yao Renfu.

414
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Have you ever fulfilled
your responsibilities as a father?

415
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:32,419
When I was a kid with you,

416
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,419
I slept every night

417
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,380
with the sound
of you playing cards or drinking.

418
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:43,020
Have you ever cooked me
a meal, even just once?

419
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,780
I can't choose who my father is.

420
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:54,380
But I can choose
whether to acknowledge him.

421
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,920
Fine, I won't force you.

422
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,739
It's my fault. I deserve the blame.

423
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,620
But parents always want
to do something for their children.

424
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,780
Do you want me to do anything for you

425
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,860
so that you'll have less hatred
towards me?

426
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,620
How about I win Xing'anli back for you?

427
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:23,860
Yao Renfu, I'm warning you.

428
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,020
Xing'anli was willed
to Chenghuan by Grandma.

429
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,300
Don't try to influence her.

430
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:31,832
Will you leave or not?

431
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,179
Don't drive me away.

432
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,776
It's been over ten years since we last
saw each other. I really missed you.

433
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:40,020
You won't leave, will you?

434
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:46,744
Give me your passport.

435
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,219
Yao Renfu, give me your passport.

436
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,704
Open the door.

437
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:59,580
I've torn it up and flushed it down.
Now what do you want me to do?

438
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,819
He Dong, come to Xing'anli now
and keep an eye on Yao Renfu.

439
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,259
Yao Zhiming, are you okay?

440
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,940
I'm fine. I'll get him
to move out as soon as possible.

441
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,339
He won't disturb you.

442
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,580
No, it's not a problem for me.

443
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,448
He is your father.

444
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,819
Have a good talk with him.
Don't start a quarrel.

445
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:42,179
He's not my father.
He doesn't deserve the title.

446
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,184
That's not right.

447
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,020
You gave me a scare. What's wrong?

448
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,339
I bought the wrong peas?

449
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,592
No. Yesterday, Huan seemed very anxious

450
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,540
about Yao Zhiming's dad's matter.

451
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:15,219
Anxious, was she?

452
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,819
She was, and then she ran out after.

453
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:20,819
It seems like she did run out.

454
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:21,848
It was strange, isn't it?

455
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,420
It was a bit strange.

456
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,219
Why?

457
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:28,540
Yeah, why would she do that?

458
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,339
I don't know.

459
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,656
I don't know, either. That's not right.

460
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,739
Ming, you're back.

461
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:45,859
Huan, you're back.

462
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:56,024
Zhiming.

463
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,304
Zhiming.

464
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:08,984
It really is a bit strange.

465
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,648
Strange.

466
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,739
But let me tell you.

467
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,259
It is Zhiming's family affair.

468
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,460
I know.

469
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,540
But Huan seems quite concerned
about it. She is meddling.

470
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,819
Huan... Tell her not to interfere
with others' family matters.

471
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,900
She is just too passionate like me.

472
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,140
Let's cook.

473
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
Already enough?

474
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:31,859
I'll go there to peel.

475
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,580
Maybe I should go take a look.

476
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,100
I just told you not to meddle.

477
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,020
Well... Let's cook.

478
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,259
Yao Zhiming.

479
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:57,259
(Getting angry makes you ugly.)

480
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:58,900
Yao Zhiming.

481
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:04,819
Yao Zhiming.

482
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:08,779
Yao Zhiming, come out.

483
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:12,339
Yao Zhiming, come out.

484
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,960
You're out.

485
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:25,420
Let's chat.

486
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,219
Stop it and let me have some space.

487
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,100
Yao Zhiming, don't be angry. Smile.

488
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,060
Yao Zhiming, don't be angry.

489
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:58,580
Yao Zhiming.

490
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,140
You finally smiled. Let's chat.

491
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,179
Alright, if you don't want
to talk to me,

492
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,179
I'll just climb up this pole now.

493
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,060
Okay, come on up.

494
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,568
Roger.

495
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,699
Yao Zhiming, I'm coming in.

496
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:38,859
Don't be unhappy.
Don't wear a gloomy face.

497
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,179
Smile.

498
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:48,699
Yao Zhiming, I just think

499
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,640
I can't make up for the things
that happened in the past.

500
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,540
But in the future,
I want to face everything with you.

501
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:00,219
Regarding your dad,
the situation is like this.

502
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:04,339
I can't just throw
him out onto the street.

503
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,339
Anyway, just a room.

504
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,020
If you don't want to see him,

505
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,659
I will ignore him in the future.

506
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,379
But if you want to talk to him,

507
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:18,620
I will provide space for you
and cooperate. Is that okay?

508
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,739
You don't understand. He's very cunning.

509
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:24,259
I'm afraid he'll cause you trouble.

510
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,620
Of course, I know he's cunning.

511
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:29,859
I'm not as good as you
in terms of business warfare.

512
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,219
But when it comes to dealing
with parents, I'm highly experienced.

513
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,219
I am sure I can handle your father.

514
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:44,060
Give me a smile. Give me a chance.

515
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,420
Smile.

516
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,219
Huan.

517
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,020
Huan. Why is there no one?

518
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:25,140
Ming, is Huan inside?

519
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,980
Does your mother know
about us being together?

520
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:31,339
Don't panic. I'll take care of it.

521
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,472
Hide this.

522
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,940
Ming, are you...

523
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,219
Huan, is he inside?

524
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:46,424
Mom.

525
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,420
Ming, are you okay?

526
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,060
After all, he's your father.
Take it slow.

527
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,819
Your father told us not
to meddle in others' family matters.

528
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,779
We don't understand the situation.
Don't be so enthusiastic.

529
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,219
Yeah, my dad is absolutely right.

530
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,580
My persuasion is of no use.
He's stubborn.

531
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,219
Fine, I don't want
to deal with your matters.

532
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,739
Mom, let's go eat. I'm hungry.

533
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:18,940
- Let's go.
- Eat...

534
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,940
Ming, come to eat.

535
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,739
Huan, have an ice cream.

536
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:02,620
You're still up, Dad?

537
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,259
Aren't you too? It's so late.

538
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,179
I saw you sitting here alone
for quite a while.

539
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,620
Have you encountered
something troubling?

540
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,540
No. It feels like just yesterday

541
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,339
you, Zao and I were having

542
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,020
ice cream together,

543
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,140
and now we're all living
in this old Western-style house.

544
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,339
Time really flies.

545
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,020
In the blink of an eye,
you two have grown up.

546
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,819
You have your own jobs
and your own lives.

547
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,259
And you've become
the owner of Xing'anli.

548
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,779
Naturally, your worries have increased.

549
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,259
