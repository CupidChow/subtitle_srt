00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:30,132
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:32,924
So today you want to know about

4
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:34,844
Deshan Home Furnishings'
recent production

5
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,525
- and the supply situation.
- You, come here.

6
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,004
Let me introduce you.

7
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:43,444
This is Miss Mai,
the secretary of Mr. Yao.

8
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,724
This is my son, Xin Jialiang.

9
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,004
Jialiang?

10
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:05,924
Do you two know each other?

11
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:07,325
Dad.

12
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,164
This is my girlfriend.

13
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,564
Sorry, Mr. Xin.

14
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,205
I'm here for work today.

15
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,044
Let's just talk about business first.

16
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,164
I...

17
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,764
don't quite understand.

18
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:35,125
Is Mr. Yao

19
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,604
too busy

20
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:38,965
to see me?

21
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,925
Or is he using you

22
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,805
to deal with me?

23
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:47,245
Mr. Xin.

24
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,925
I didn't know about
your relationship with Jialiang.

25
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:52,004
I just found it out.

26
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,805
So it's impossible
that Mr. Yao knows it.

27
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,444
He asked me to come today

28
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,365
to have an initial contact with you,

29
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,444
so that Yueda and Deshan

30
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:01,444
could make a close partnership.

31
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,764
We are very sincere.

32
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:08,564
I see. It's our fault.

33
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,405
It must be that our relevant person

34
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,764
did not make good contact with Mr. Yao.

35
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,085
It's our fault.

36
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,405
Well, from today on,

37
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,044
I'll handle all the work

38
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,205
between Deshan and you.

39
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:20,965
I'll tell

40
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:21,965
whatever Mr. Yao

41
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,044
wants to know.

42
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,044
Is it okay?

43
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,365
I will tell Mr. Yao about it.

44
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:27,844
Good. Well,

45
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:30,365
since Mr. Yao is busy with work today,

46
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:31,724
we can make an appointment another day.

47
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:32,724
Is it okay?

48
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,324
Then I'll see you out.

49
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:35,525
Thank you.

50
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,844
- This way, Mr. Xin.
- Okay.

51
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,004
Mr. Xin, take care.

52
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:45,205
Mr. Yao said he will visit you some day

53
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,564
to express his apologies.

54
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,004
Okay, I'll wait for him.

55
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:51,205
Take care, Mr. Xin.

56
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:52,965
Dad, you go ahead.

57
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,044
Goodbye.

58
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,844
Huan, Huan.

59
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,405
Huan, Huan...

60
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,844
Please listen to me, okay?

61
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:18,245
Actually, my dad just runs
an ordinary company,

62
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:22,045
and he's an ordinary
small business owner.

63
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:23,365
I...

64
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,165
That's it.

65
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:27,764
Xin Jialiang.

66
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:29,845
How long have we been together?

67
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,365
Of course, I know it.

68
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,564
Yesterday was our third anniversary.

69
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,404
Over these one thousand days,

70
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,524
your act like a Shanghai drifter

71
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,165
and a home designer.

72
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,925
Your parents are nearing retirement
back in hometown.

73
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:43,805
Get off me.

74
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:45,644
I want to ask you.

75
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,204
Which of these is real?

76
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,444
You said
you weren't used to Shanghai food,

77
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,365
so I learned to make dishes
from your hometown for you.

78
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:58,125
I stayed up all night saving up
for any pair of shoes you like.

79
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,285
You said the company wanted to fire you,

80
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,764
I made plans
and career summaries for you.

81
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,964
I helped you with interviews,
and asked my classmates to refer you.

82
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,444
I couldn't sleep all night
because of your future.

83
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:09,925
And now you're telling me,

84
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,204
you are a rich kid
and don't need to work hard.

85
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:15,925
Xin Jialiang.

86
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,764
You take me for a fool, right?

87
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,245
No, no.

88
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,324
Are you happy

89
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,605
fooling me around?

90
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:24,764
Huan.

91
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,245
I am really sorry about this.

92
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,444
I did have a bit of a cover-up

93
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,964
in the beginning.

94
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:34,204
But later I realized this mistake.

95
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,725
I've been looking for
a chance to tell you.

96
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,204
But I was afraid you'd be mad.

97
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,805
You don't have to tell me anymore.

98
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,764
Because I'm not going to believe

99
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:43,764
every word you say.

100
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:44,564
No, no.

101
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,605
You have to believe
what I'm about to say.

102
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,324
I really love you.

103
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,764
I swear I do love you.

104
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,324
Well, you go to work now.

105
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:58,165
Wait until dinner time at your house,

106
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,644
I will apologize to you

107
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,644
and explain properly.

108
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:01,764
Don't come over tonight.

109
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,764
Because I don't want to see you.

110
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,764
Huan, Huan.

111
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,925
It's just that simple

112
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:10,964
and especially clear.

113
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:13,444
Xin Jialiang is playing

114
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,165
the role of a poor person

115
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,165
to find his true love.

116
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,125
Honestly, if I were Mai Chenghuan,

117
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,045
I would be very mad. Let alone her.

118
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,605
How do you know Mai Chenghuan

119
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:26,725
isn't just playing along?

120
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,605
Mr. Yao, if you think so,

121
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,444
that's really cynical.

122
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,725
Go get her here.

123
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,725
Now?

124
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,045
I mean,

125
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:40,004
if Mai Chenghuan really

126
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,725
knows nothing about it,

127
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:43,084
then what?

128
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:44,245
It's none of my business.

129
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,764
As long as she has a relationship
with Xin Jialiang,

130
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:47,845
she's useful.

131
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:50,564
Impressive.

132
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:51,925
The two of them...

133
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:56,605
I'll go get her.

134
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:03,485
Chenghuan.

135
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:18,764
Come in.

136
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,084
Mr. Yao.

137
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:35,404
I just met Mr. Xin.

138
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,605
How's it?

139
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,564
This matter is somewhat weird.

140
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,764
Mr. Xin...

141
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:47,644
Mr. Xin is my boyfriend's father.

142
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,165
I just found it out today.

143
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,245
So did he.

144
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,245
So he thought

145
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:55,764
I'm using this relationship

146
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,365
to get the trust
of Deshan Home Furnishings,

147
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,964
and was somewhat wary of me.

148
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,925
Mr. Yao, I'm sorry to fail you.

149
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,204
It's not that serious.

150
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,485
Love relationship is a personal affair.

151
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,644
And you're only filling in today.

152
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,165
Don't overthink it.

153
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,365
About your job,

154
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:20,651
I will consider it.

155
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:40,531
Huan, where are you and Xin Jialiang?

156
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,132
I've shown my respect

157
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,651
and made six dishes and one soup.

158
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:45,996
Remind him

159
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,837
he owes me an explanation.

160
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,317
Huan, this time it's going to be tough.

161
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,756
Ask Jialiang to perform well.

162
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,837
It's better to come up with a plan

163
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,156
to put your mom

164
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:08,796
at ease.

165
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:09,597
Got it?

166
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,916
Okay, Dad. I got it.

167
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:27,756
You are back.

168
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:28,957
I'm back.

169
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,077
I'll do it.

170
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:32,597
Ms. Wang, pour me a glass of water.

171
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:33,717
Thank you.

172
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:34,756
Okay.

173
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:38,317
Today didn't go well?

174
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,117
He got a crush on the secretary

175
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,396
and made a mess.

176
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:45,957
Dad.

177
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,357
Don't call her the secretary.

178
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,437
She has a name,

179
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:50,477
Mai Chenghuan.

180
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,636
She's my girlfriend.

181
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,156
Water.

182
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,036
Jialiang.

183
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,396
Give me a day next week.

184
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:14,876
I'll take you to meet

185
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,117
the daughter of Ms. Zhang.

186
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,437
What are you going to do?

187
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:20,317
Jialiang.

188
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:23,192
You're going to take over from your dad.

189
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,156
Wouldn't it be better to find a wife

190
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,156
who could assist you?

191
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:27,837
Besides,

192
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,597
I'm not asking you
to break up with her right now.

193
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,957
You can be flexible.

194
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:32,756
Mom.

195
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,996
Be normal, okay?

196
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,516
Don't cause me troubles, okay?

197
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,916
I am concerned about you.

198
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:47,957
I love Mai Chenghuan,

199
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,636
and Mai Chenghuan loves me.

200
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,317
The two of us are so much in love

201
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,636
that no one can separate us.

202
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,357
Don't mention such things anymore.

203
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,156
Okay, Mom?

204
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,357
How can you talk to your mom like that?

205
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:01,916
So rude.

206
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,756
I'm not eating here tonight.

207
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:05,276
I have something to do.

208
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,156
It's urgent.

209
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,036
Whatever.

210
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,317
He is becoming more and more reckless.

211
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,557
That's because you spoiled him.

212
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:17,756
He's already 30 and still so rude.

213
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,756
Childish.

214
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:26,197
I'm back.

215
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:27,676
You are back.

216
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,837
Where is Xin Jialiang?

217
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,276
He has to work overtime today,

218
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,756
so he won't come.

219
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,756
He bought this for you

220
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,036
and asked me to bring it back.

221
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,916
I'll put it here.

222
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:50,916
See? I told you
that guy is not reliable.

223
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,197
I asked him to be reliable,

224
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,437
and he dares not come now.

225
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,357
He has to work overtime.

226
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:58,957
Didn't you say

227
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,597
young people should be ambitious?

228
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,396
The man who often works overtime

229
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,916
must be ambitious.

230
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,317
Alright, you ask him

231
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,036
why he has to work overtime.

232
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,557
Why today?

233
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:14,156
He's just fooling us around.

234
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:17,396
Alright. If he's not coming,
we can eat by ourselves.

235
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:18,796
All you know is eat.

236
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,796
Do you know what that means?

237
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,636
What do you know? Alright.

238
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:23,796
You're a peacemaker.

239
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,077
It's so obvious...

240
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:28,837
Let me tell you the truth.

241
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,317
He doesn't work overtime.

242
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,357
We had a fight,

243
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,357
so he's not coming.

244
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:35,437
Had a fight?

245
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:37,916
Is it serious?

246
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:41,036
Nothing.
We'll be fine in a couple of days.

247
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:43,396
Good. Very well.

248
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,357
The fiercer the fight, the better.

249
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:46,597
You could just break up.

250
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,557
It's perfect.

251
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,636
He showed his true colors

252
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:51,996
through the meal.

253
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,156
What do you like about him?

254
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:55,317
He has neither money nor a house.

255
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,237
What do you like about him?

256
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,036
Alright, enough.

257
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,197
You don't know anything.

258
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,197
Why do you keep telling her to break up?

259
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,117
Break up.

260
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,357
I've seen him through.

261
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,396
He is silly.

262
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,916
He is so poor,
and yet he acts like this.

263
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,437
He's ruined three years of my daughter.

264
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:13,357
Three years.

265
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,357
It's so long.

266
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,396
Oh my. I can't even think about it.

267
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,036
When I think about it, I'll get mad.

268
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,516
It makes my heart hurt.

269
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,477
Okay, come on.

270
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,396
Don't be mad.

271
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,117
Mom.

272
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,477
Actually...

273
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,717
Huan, I was wrong.

274
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:31,357
Huan.

275
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,916
Can you give me a chance to explain?

276
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,516
Xin Jialiang, what are you doing?

277
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:46,437
Huan.

278
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:48,996
I was wrong, really.

279
00:13:49,357 --> 00:13:51,036
It's all my fault.

280
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:52,717
I'll be honest with you.

281
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:55,357
My family

282
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,357
runs a home furnishings company

283
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,317
worth about a billion.

284
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:03,237
I live in the Cuihu villa community.

285
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:04,916
I have four properties in the city.

286
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,156
I have five more in my hometown.

287
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,756
Xin Jialiang, stop.

288
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:12,636
Worth billion?
You might make it go public.

289
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,796
Hello, Mrs. Mai. Hello, Mr. Mai.

290
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:17,357
Mrs. Mai.

291
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,957
Going public is very difficult.

292
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:21,636
I will

293
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,996
tell my dad about it.

294
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:25,756
And we'll both work hard.

295
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,396
- Huan.
- I will make it one day.

296
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:28,837
Is he telling the truth?

297
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,237
Of course not.

298
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:31,837
Huan, he is lying.

299
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,477
I have seen this online.

300
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:34,197
It's called

301
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,396
romance scam.

302
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,676
Inferior men pretend to be rich

303
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,237
and get the city girls.

304
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,916
Huan, sorry that I lied to you.

305
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:43,197
My bad.

306
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,916
Look, hear that?

307
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,477
He lied to you. Did you hear that?

308
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,996
Mom, he did lie to me.

309
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:49,957
But he didn't lie to me on this.

310
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,796
You rascal!

311
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,437
How dare you lie to us!

312
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,237
Do you want to die? Just wait.

313
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,117
Wait, mom.

314
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,916
Mom, what he said is true.

315
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,557
True? What?

316
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,317
Everything he just said is true.

317
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,516
He's indeed rich?

318
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,117
He's been with me so long

319
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:12,557
and lying to me.

320
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,317
He told me

321
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:15,837
he borrowed his car

322
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,276
and found it hard to get a job.

323
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,597
It all turned out to be a lie.

324
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,796
Mom, you are right.

325
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:23,156
He is just a liar.

326
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,237
Huan, don't be silly.

327
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:28,156
You have to get the point.

328
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:31,396
The point is he's been lying
to me for the past three years.

329
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,916
If I hadn't run into him at work today,

330
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,516
I would still be kept in the dark.

331
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,557
Mom, you are right.

332
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:41,996
I'm going down now
to make things clear with him.

333
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:45,117
Huan, listen to me.

334
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,156
Well...

335
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,516
I think...

336
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:49,756
T-Today...

337
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,557
H-He must have lied to you for a reason.

338
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,597
He is here to apologize now.

339
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:55,837
Right? You...

340
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,237
Kid, marriage is a serious matter.

341
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,036
You must be very careful.

342
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:02,557
- Don't do stupid thing.
- No, mom.

343
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,117
Wait, you...

344
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,756
I really love you.

345
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:07,996
- Really.
- Xin Jialiang.

346
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,796
Can you stop shouting?

347
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:11,276
Now you're disturbing others.

348
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:12,437
Leave now.

349
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,636
Don't listen to her. Don't leave.

350
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,117
Huan, listen to me.

351
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,996
Look how sincere he is.

352
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,317
With so many people around him,
he even doesn't care.

353
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,516
What does it mean?

354
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,717
He seems so pleasant to me today.

355
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:24,477
Look at him,

356
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,756
he's tall and pretty.

357
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,557
I really know I was wrong.

358
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,117
Listen to his explanation.

359
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,796
He's explaining.

360
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:33,117
Even though I lied to you,

361
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,357
I really love you.

362
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,516
Shut up!

363
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:45,957
Mom.

364
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,557
He's been pretending
to be poor all along,

365
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,717
asked me to top up
the game cards for him,

366
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:52,357
and repay the money for his loan.

367
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,156
He's been lying to me.

368
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,357
Wait, he's so rich,

369
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,756
but asking you to help him repay a loan?

370
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:58,676
Yes.

371
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,237
Did he pay you back?

372
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:02,957
He did pay back.

373
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,436
- Then it's nice.
- He couldn't do so.

374
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:05,956
Wait, Mom.

375
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,037
Get it straight.

376
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,557
Why did he lie to me?

377
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:12,156
He was afraid
that I would take his money.

378
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:14,636
Anyway,

379
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,077
let's get him in here today.

380
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,557
We can't let him
keep shouting down there.

381
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,317
Jialiang, come up.

382
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,317
I will help you.

383
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,837
No one can help him today.

384
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:24,156
If anyone does,

385
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,597
I'll get mad.

386
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:28,236
Huan.

387
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:29,757
Huan.

388
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:32,396
I'll convince her.

389
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:33,156
Alright.

390
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:35,956
What are you doing?

391
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:36,876
What are you doing?

392
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:44,956
Huan.

393
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:46,797
I feel like

394
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:48,757
I'm going to die.

395
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,597
During this period,

396
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,357
I can't eat

397
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:54,156
or sleep well.

398
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:56,557
I really love you.

399
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:58,916
I really do.

400
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,716
- Excuse me.
- Zao, you are back.

401
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:14,757
Everyone, sorry.

402
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:15,997
Sorry for disturbing you.

403
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:18,236
It's okay now. Just go back.

404
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:19,037
Go back.

405
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,557
Sorry, sorry.

406
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,277
Zao.

407
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:23,396
Wait, Jialiang. What's wrong?

408
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,517
You made such a big fuss.

409
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,517
Zao, help me convince your sister.

410
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:27,797
Hurry up.

411
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:28,476
Wait.

412
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,916
You had a fight with her?

413
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,117
Just a little misunderstanding.

414
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,676
Please. Just go.

415
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:34,557
Wait.

416
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,757
My sister has such a good temper.

417
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,277
If she ignores you,

418
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:40,357
you must have done something wrong.

419
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:43,037
Oh my.

420
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,757
You two are really

421
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,757
a family.

422
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:49,837
Huan!

423
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,757
Huan, I was wrong.

424
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,236
Can you be sincere?

425
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,557
You're causing a loud ruckus
in a public place, harassing women.

426
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,757
At the least,
it constitutes public disturbance,

427
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:02,557
with administrative fine.

428
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:05,396
At worst, you could be sued
for insulting women.

429
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:06,956
Do you have water?

430
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:07,997
I...

431
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:12,476
Hello.

432
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:13,476
Zao.

433
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,037
Just leave him and come up

434
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:15,916
for dinner.

435
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,196
Huan, I was wrong.

436
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,476
It's okay. I'm telling him the law.

437
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:20,597
Can you forgive me?

438
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:22,517
Hurry up. Just leave him.

439
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:25,956
I really know I was wrong.

440
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,916
Alright, Jialiang. I'm going up to eat.

441
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,156
Zao, Zao.

442
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,956
Don't leave me, Zao.

443
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:32,077
Zao.

444
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:37,876
Who hit me?

445
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:39,876
What's wrong with you?

446
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,676
You are so annoying.

447
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,597
You keep shouting.

448
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:44,956
Sorry, auntie.

449
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,837
Don't be mad.

450
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:48,916
But you do have a strong grip.

451
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,436
I can tell you're in good health.

452
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,636
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,797
Xin Jialiang, come with me.

454
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,517
What a mess.

455
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,317
I hope Jialiang can come up.

456
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,357
Otherwise, this meal

457
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,196
will be wasted.

458
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:18,797
Baby.

459
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,956
Here is the thing.

460
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:23,797
I didn't mean to do it

461
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:25,757
at first.

462
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,156
But my parents

463
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,117
were afraid

464
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:31,557
that I would be fooled,

465
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,357
so they asked me to do so.

466
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,117
Then do you mean

467
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,557
I would fool you?

468
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,716
No, no.

469
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:40,956
I feel bad

470
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,117
that I've been keeping it a secret.

471
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,357
I wanted to tell you
a million times in between.

472
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,277
Baby, don't be mad anymore.

473
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:50,077
I really,

474
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,156
really, really regret it now.

475
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:53,597
Xin Jialiang.

476
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,236
You have to promise me a few things.

477
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:57,156
No problem.

478
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,396
First,

479
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:01,676
I understand your concerns.

480
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,916
But since you can lie to me about it,

481
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,876
you might have lied to your family.

482
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:08,357
So I want you to tell your family

483
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,876
about me and my family,

484
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,916
so that they can
have a real understanding of me.

485
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,357
Okay.

486
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:15,876
I've told my parents about you honestly.

487
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,676
My parents, my dad in particular.

488
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,277
He really admires you,

489
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,557
thinking you're really nice,

490
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,037
indeed.

491
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:24,916
You did it again.

492
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:27,436
Second,

493
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:29,396
although you come from a wealthy family,

494
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,757
I hope that in the future,
we will work hard

495
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,077
to make money together,

496
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,876
not too dependent on your family.

497
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,997
Once you accept your parents' help,

498
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,117
they are bound to interfere in our life.

499
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,117
Understand?

500
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,236
Okay.

501
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:43,997
Third,

502
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,317
it's the most important one.

503
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,196
I hope there will be no lies
between us in the future.

504
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:52,797
You have to tell me everything.

505
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,797
We need to be honest with each other.

506
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:56,757
Can you do this?

507
00:21:59,037 --> 00:21:59,956
Yes.

508
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,597
I will never lie to you again.

509
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,597
Later...

510
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:10,597
Later...

511
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,837
I-I'll draft an agreement.

512
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,117
Then the two of us will sign it.

513
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,077
I'll sign my name

514
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:20,557
and put a seal on it.

515
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:23,716
Get off me.

516
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,277
You are really a fool.

517
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:31,636
When Ms. Zhou hit you,

518
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:32,676
why didn't you dodge?

519
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:34,916
Is your head hurt? Let me see.

520
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:37,916
I just knew it.

521
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,956
You still care about me.

522
00:22:40,997 --> 00:22:41,876
Xin Jialiang.

523
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,077
Forgive me.

524
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:46,797
Move.

525
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,117
(Yao Zhiming)

526
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,357
It's you mom again?

527
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:52,476
It's Mr. Yao.

528
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:56,636
Why is this guy calling you after work?

529
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:57,757
Keep silence.

530
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,077
I haven't secured my job yet.

531
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,037
Keep silence.

532
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:05,396
Mr. Yao, hello.

533
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:06,476
Mai Chenghuan.

534
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,077
Regarding your job,

535
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,396
I have decided.

536
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:13,236
Given your professional attitude

537
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:14,317
and not showing favoritism,

538
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,117
you can come back to work.

539
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,396
Really? Mr. Yao?

540
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:21,876
But you did make some mistakes.

541
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,196
So just as you said,

542
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,696
your bonus for this quarter

543
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,037
will be deducted.

544
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,636
I see. I accept it.

545
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,077
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

546
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,277
Good news?

547
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,277
Jialiang.

548
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:40,436
I've secured my job.

549
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:43,956
Be careful.

550
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,396
I told you

551
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,396
that guy won't fire you.

552
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,196
What are you doing?

553
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:52,997
Xin Jialiang, put me down.

554
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:54,037
Stop.

555
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,916
My baby has secured her job.

556
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,876
Let go of me. Put me down.

557
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,956
My baby has also forgiven me.

558
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:09,436
Dad, Zao.

559
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:11,757
What are you doing here?

560
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,597
I came down to throw out the trash.

561
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:15,476
I came out for some fresh air.

562
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:17,517
Is that so?

563
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:21,436
Alright then, let's go home.

564
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:22,396
Wait.

565
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,837
Well,

566
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:28,117
it's been a while
since I bought you ice cream.

567
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,557
Come on, I'll treat you to an ice cream.

568
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:31,277
Let's go.

569
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,716
Dad's treating us to ice cream.

570
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,464
(Wanjiayan Store)

571
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:39,837
I've paid.

572
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:41,196
Here, take it.

573
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:45,676
I still remember, when we were little,

574
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:47,997
you would buy us ice cream,

575
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,676
without letting our mom know.

576
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,277
This is so hard.

577
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,716
Fresh out of the fridge.

578
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:02,797
Sis,

579
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,797
did that Xin Jialiang bully you?

580
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:07,797
Of course not.

581
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,196
He doesn't dare to.

582
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:11,997
Besides, even if he did,

583
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,476
would you really sue him?

584
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,676
No. I would avenge for you.

585
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:18,597
Don't worry.

586
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:20,236
We had a good talk.

587
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,476
And he explained and assured me.

588
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:23,837
We are fine now.

589
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:29,476
Huan.

590
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:32,956
Tell me more about this Jialiang.

591
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:36,436
Though you two have been dating
for three years,

592
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:38,597
he has never visited us.

593
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,797
I really don't know him.

594
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:43,916
Dad.

595
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:46,956
Actually, Jialiang

596
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,676
is really lovely,

597
00:25:50,077 --> 00:25:52,037
completely different from me.

598
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:54,636
My life is boring.

599
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:57,517
While he has a wide range of hobbies.

600
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,117
He is good at designing

601
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,916
and photography.

602
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,757
He can be the leader in the game.

603
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:06,797
I remember one time,

604
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:08,997
he woke me up in the middle of the night

605
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,317
and said to take me to see the sunrise.

606
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,357
And then he picked me up

607
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:14,676
and drove me to see the sunrise.

608
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,196
I also have a wide range of hobbies.

609
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:19,997
I also have a lot of new things.

610
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:22,716
Are you jealous about it?

611
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:24,156
Fine.

612
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,997
I'll never get married

613
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:27,196
and stay home with you.

614
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:28,716
That's not necessary.

615
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:32,757
Well,

616
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,676
listen to me.

617
00:26:35,956 --> 00:26:37,797
Talk about getting along with people,

618
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,716
you need time

619
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,916
to get to know

620
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,716
a person well.

621
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,797
As a saying goes,

622
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:50,797
time reveals a man's heart.

623
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:55,876
Don't worry, Dad.

624
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:59,557
We have already talked it over today.

625
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,196
He promised me

626
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,277
that he will never lie to me again.

627
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:06,077
We want to be happy together.

628
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,876
I just don't want to have regrets.

629
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:10,997
The same goes for my work.

630
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,797
And the same goes for love.

631
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,956
I know.

632
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,837
Your mom is calling.

633
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:24,716
Hello.

634
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,396
Yu.

635
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:28,436
Have you seen our daughter?

636
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,357
Yes.

637
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:32,797
Has she made up with Jialiang?

638
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,317
Yes. Don't worry.

639
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:36,997
Yu, let me tell you.

640
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,876
I just saw

641
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,037
something I shouldn't have seen.

642
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,517
Do you think I will

643
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:43,236
get a stye tomorrow?

644
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:44,797
Hey, I...

645
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:46,476
She hung up.

646
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,236
Dad, this is how you deal with our mom?

647
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:51,077
I...

648
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,236
I shiver when I see her.

649
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:17,557
Deshan?

650
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,876
Why can't I click it?

651
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:25,757
Right.

652
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:34,077
This is a pretty big business.

653
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:42,168
Mom might be asleep. Keep it down.

654
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:42,757
Okay.

655
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:48,837
Mom.

656
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,716
Why are you peeking at my computer?

657
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:54,797
No, no. I didn't...

658
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,716
I checked it for you.

659
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:58,956
Jialiang didn't lie to you.

660
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,277
His family is so wealthy.

661
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:02,716
Indeed.

662
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:04,997
Time to sleep.

663
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:06,808
- And you peek at my WeChat?
- Time to sleep.

664
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,037
No, no.

665
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:10,117
Time to sleep. Hurry up.

666
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:11,837
Huan.

667
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:14,357
Don't be mad.

668
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:16,517
I'll tell her

669
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,196
not to do so again.

670
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:39,416
(Sales Department)

671
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,436
- Morning.
- Morning.

672
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:46,557
Chenghuan.

673
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,396
Are you alright now?

674
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:50,517
Mr. Yao asked me to come back.

675
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:52,557
That's great, impressive.

676
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:54,357
Don't worry about me. Let's go.

677
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,077
Okay.

678
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:02,117
Everyone, get ready.

679
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,876
We'll have a meeting
in the conference room in 15 minutes

680
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,476
to discuss this year's

681
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,396
May 20th event schedule.

682
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,156
You are still here?

683
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:25,916
Yes, I'm still here.

684
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:30,117
Alright, let's have the meeting.

685
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:32,077
Sure.

686
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:38,396
Two matters.

687
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:41,876
First, the disciplinary action
against Mai Chenghuan is revoked.

688
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,236
And she'll keep her position,

689
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,597
but her bonus
for this quarter will be deducted.

690
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,396
Second, it's April now.

691
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,557
The wedding season is coming up soon.

692
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:53,956
May 20th event
is important for Botticelli,

693
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,956
also the kickoff
for the wedding peak season.

694
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,396
Mr. Yao, then
Sales and Marketing Department

695
00:31:00,716 --> 00:31:02,357
will prepare the proposal right away.

696
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:03,156
No rush.

697
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,557
I'll give you one week.

698
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:08,077
Everyone has to come up with a proposal.

699
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,676
I'll get all the hotel departments

700
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,876
to vote on it.

701
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,317
Mr. Yao.

702
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:14,797
This is always a matter

703
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:17,797
of the Marketing Department.

704
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,476
There's no need to make the vote.

705
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,396
I hope Botticelli

706
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,476
can have more talents.

707
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,236
I

708
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,997
select the superior
and eliminate the inferior.

709
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,797
Mr. Zhu, are

710
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:33,797
your men incompetent?

711
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:35,037
Of course not.

712
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:38,357
Our department has talents
like Mai Chenghuan and Wu You.

713
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,597
They are our best people.

714
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,117
Very good.

715
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:46,396
The winner will

716
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,517
receive a special bonus

717
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:50,396
and two nights in an executive suite.

718
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,797
I look forward to your proposals.

719
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:02,277
You heard what Mr. Yao just said.

720
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,196
Open vote for proposals.

721
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:07,196
Everyone,

722
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:10,037
can our Marketing and Sales Department

723
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,436
keep the reputation?

724
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:13,476
As your leader,

725
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,077
can I keep my position?

726
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:18,156
It all depends on you.

727
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,557
Hurry up and go prepare the proposals.

728
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:11,037
It's good.

729
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,597
You all danced really well.

730
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:15,956
Well done.

731
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:17,956
Go have some water and take a rest.

732
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:18,916
Okay.

733
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,117
Ms. Liu, you really danced so well.

734
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:23,436
- Great, right?
- I was mesmerized.

735
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:27,196
Ms. Liu, there is something
I'd like to discuss with you.

736
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:27,916
Say it.

737
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:29,436
In next week's performance,

738
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:31,396
we have only one spot
for the lead dancer.

739
00:33:32,396 --> 00:33:33,676
I know it.

740
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:36,916
We finally decided on Ms. Zhou.

741
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:39,997
Why?

742
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,517
I choreographed this dance,

743
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,317
and organized the rehearsals.

744
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,117
Why did you decide on her?

745
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,396
Ms. Liu, calm down.

746
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,916
To be honest,

747
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,196
the costumes are

748
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:55,636
all sponsored
by Ms. Zhou's future son-in-law.

749
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,117
The costumes are really beautiful.

750
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,117
That alone,

751
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:59,876
we've beaten the other community.

752
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:02,396
We're a big team.

753
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,997
Ms. Liu, please be generous

754
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:05,956
and think big.

755
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,636
Future son-in-law?

756
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:10,117
Nothing is set in stone yet.

757
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,117
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

758
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,156
Ms. Zhou, you danced wonderfully.

759
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,716
I really thank you.

760
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:16,557
No need.

761
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:18,756
His family runs a clothing store.

762
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,636
You'll get a discount

763
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:20,957
if you go there.

764
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:22,477
Okay, we'll definitely go.

765
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,156
Then have a good rest.

766
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,356
(Moments)
I can't

767
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,796
unfold my fan well.

768
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,917
Yes. See.

769
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,196
See.

770
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:38,796
When you are free,

771
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,156
don't just check the Moments.

772
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:42,276
The Moments

773
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:43,397
is attractive,

774
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:45,236
but always looking down

775
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:46,877
is bad for your cervical spine.

776
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:48,437
It's not good.

777
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:56,517
Liu, in the Moments you just post,

778
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:58,437
is that your future son-in-law?

779
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:02,296
You are fast. I just posted it.

780
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:05,716
The two of them make a good match.

781
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:07,037
A good match, right?

782
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:08,517
A good match.

783
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,196
What does he do?

784
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:12,437
A designer.

785
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:13,796
A designer?

786
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:17,276
His family also runs
a home furnishing company.

787
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:18,917
Amazing.

788
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,917
He's tall, rich, and handsome.

789
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:22,276
You're really blessed.

790
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,397
Not really.

791
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:25,756
Yesterday,

792
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,716
I saw it in an official account.

793
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:28,836
It's said really well.

794
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,716
The successful parents

795
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:33,397
are not just about
how successful their children are.

796
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,397
The key is,

797
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,077
when you get old,

798
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:39,196
they can accompany and take care of you.

799
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:41,397
Nothing is set in stone yet.

800
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,077
They are just dating.

801
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,117
What if they break up?

802
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,236
So you have something set in stone?

803
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,236
Don't be mad.

804
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,356
Let me see your future son-in-law.

805
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:52,796
I'll show you the photo.

806
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:55,117
(Sales Department)
Chenghuan, don't you leave?

807
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,957
I almost got fired,
so I need to work harder.

808
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:00,077
Chenghuan, you're working so hard.

809
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:01,676
Then we are leaving.

810
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:02,957
Goodbye.

811
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:03,557
- Bye.
- Bye.

812
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:04,517
Bye.

813
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:07,416
(Concern factors of Chinese non-single group
for booking 520 love hotel/homestay in 2023)

814
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:32,917
Mom.

815
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,196
Huan, what are you doing?

816
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:37,597
I'm going to make
pork trotter soup for you.

817
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:39,517
Mom, I have to work overtime today,

818
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:41,236
so I can't go back for dinner.

819
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,196
Again?

820
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:46,156
Don't burn yourself out.

821
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:47,597
I know.

822
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,477
You're almost 30.

823
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,676
The face is starting to lose collagen.

824
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:53,796
You're going to get wrinkles.

825
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:57,437
Mom, I just took on a big project.

826
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:59,196
The leaders are all watching.

827
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:00,316
Leaders?

828
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:02,236
Your leaders are so mean.

829
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:03,676
It's not working hour now.

830
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:04,836
What time is it now?

831
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:06,557
Your marriage matters.

832
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:07,877
Let me tell you.

833
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:10,117
Your main task now

834
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,796
is to make more contact with Jialiang.

835
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,557
Got it?

836
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:13,756
Mom.

837
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:16,557
I should count on my own abilities,
not on marrying someone.

838
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,957
How is it possible

839
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:21,397
to depend on others in life
and expect respect from others?

840
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,597
I know that, too.

841
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:25,756
I agree with you.

842
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,997
But for a girl,

843
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:30,316
marriage is very important.

844
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:32,557
After you marry Jialiang,

845
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:34,756
his family will surely want you
to have children, right?

846
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:36,716
So you have to take good care
of your health.

847
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:37,716
Don't burn yourself out.

848
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:41,196
Alright, Mom. The leader is calling me.

849
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:42,276
I have to go.

850
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,037
I'm hanging up.

851
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,636
- Mr. Mai.
- Coming.

852
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,517
Come help.

853
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:51,437
Coming.

854
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:54,997
I can't see it clearly.

855
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:58,597
I told you to buy reading glasses,
but you refused.

856
00:37:58,877 --> 00:37:59,756
You regret it now?

857
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:00,917
I'm not wearing them.

858
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,397
They make me look old.

859
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:03,156
Hurry up.

860
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:03,836
Alright.

861
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,796
(Baby Liang)
(Baby, I've been waiting for you for 2.5 hours.)

862
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:31,997
(Are you still working?)

863
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,997
I've been waiting in line
for you all afternoon.

864
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:46,117
Have a taste.

865
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:47,316
What's it?

866
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:49,796
Be careful not to spill it.

867
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:52,756
Here.

868
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:57,517
Delicious.

869
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,437
Huan, your mom doesn't
hate me anymore, right?

870
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:06,997
Jialiang.

871
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:08,957
Actually, my mom

872
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,716
just wants the best for me.

873
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:15,156
So please stop judging her.

874
00:39:15,517 --> 00:39:16,676
She is nice.

875
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,437
What? Why would I

876
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:19,957
judge her?

877
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,037
I know.

878
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:25,756
If I want to be
Mai Chenghuan's good boyfriend,

879
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,397
I must be good to her family.

880
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:32,196
But you are also very important.

881
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:33,997
Here you go again.

882
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:35,917
I have a call.

883
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,397
Take this.

884
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:42,356
It's my mom. Keep silence.

885
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,196
Mom.

886
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:47,356
It's so late now

887
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:48,756
and you're still out.

888
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,756
Oh my. I've made
the pig's trotter soup for you.

889
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:53,957
Auntie, hello.

890
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,356
J-Jialiang, you're there.

891
00:39:58,356 --> 00:39:59,517
Huan

892
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:00,716
didn't even tell me.

893
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:01,597
Auntie.

894
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:05,716
Can I have dinner
at your house this weekend?

895
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,557
Of course.

896
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,156
Come anytime,

897
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,597
I always welcome you.

898
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:12,557
Well.

899
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,356
Jialiang, what do you want to eat?

900
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:15,356
Just tell me.

901
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:16,836
What do you like to eat?

902
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:17,676
Mom, Mom.

903
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,716
Well, I'm coming home right away.

904
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:20,676
Let's talk at home.

905
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:23,437
No, no. Don't rush. Take your time.

906
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,517
Take your time.

907
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:26,117
- I'm here...
- Got to go.

908
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:33,437
Are you really going?

909
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:35,477
You told me

910
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,437
to take this matter seriously.

911
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:40,437
Then, what do you suggest
I buy for your mom?

912
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:42,276
Maybe I buy her a bag.

913
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,356
My mom and my sister

914
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:44,716
just love buying bags.

915
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,037
No need.
Don't buy something that expensive.

916
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:48,477
Just buy

917
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,517
something that can show your sincerity.

918
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,117
Mr. Mai.

919
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:57,836
- Dinner.
- You scared me.

920
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:58,636
Dinner.

921
00:40:58,796 --> 00:40:59,756
What?

922
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:02,716
W-Why did you turn off the TV?

923
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:05,517
Jialiang is coming to our house
for dinner tomorrow.

924
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,836
Jialiang is coming for dinner?

925
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,397
So what?

926
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,397
What should we do?

927
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:13,077
Right.

928
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:14,517
Put all these messy things

929
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:16,077
in the drawer

930
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:17,796
to make the house look cleaner.

931
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:18,917
Right.

932
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,920
We need to put this camp bed away

933
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,276
to make the house seem spacious

934
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:23,917
and cleaner.

935
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:26,597
It's so late to do so.

936
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,077
Zao will be back tomorrow.

937
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,037
He's going to be upset
when he finds the bed put away.

938
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,836
He's a boy, not that sensitive.

939
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,037
Besides,
her sister's marriage is a big deal.

940
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,356
He will understand.

941
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:37,397
It doesn't matter.

942
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:38,957
Let me tell you,

943
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,517
Jialiang is still Jialiang,

944
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:43,557
but he's not the old Jialiang.

945
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:46,716
We have to tidy up the house,

946
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:48,477
and make it clean and presentable.

947
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,196
Got it?

948
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:51,676
Come on, honey. Come on, have a seat.

949
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,836
No. Just say it.

950
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:56,236
Look, Jialiang and Huan

951
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:58,356
have been dating for years.

952
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:01,276
He knows our family well.

953
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:03,796
Do you think
just tidying up and cleaning

954
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:06,557
will turn this dump into a villa?

955
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:13,437
Do it or not?

956
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:15,236
Do it or not?

957
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:15,836
Yes.

958
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:19,917
Call Zao

959
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,356
to come back early tomorrow morning.

960
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,597
Okay, got it.

961
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:24,077
Sweep the floor now.

962
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:25,276
Sweep it.

963
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:29,557
Be gentle.

964
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:32,037
Our house is in a mess.

965
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,957
If you don't clean it,

966
00:42:33,997 --> 00:42:35,877
you never know what's inside.

967
00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:39,397
Mr. Mai, what are you doing again?

968
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:43,437
What?

969
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:45,276
