3
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:52,548
Zhiming,

4
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:57,869
let's go home.

5
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,732
Ming, wait here for me a moment.

6
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:19,572
I'll cook something for you.

7
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,012
Yu, boil some water for me.

8
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:22,852
Got it.

9
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,651
Yu. Is the water boiled?

10
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,531
Yes.

11
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,172
What tea is this?

12
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:13,971
I don't know either.

13
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:17,132
It's a new tea from this year
that a friend gave me.

14
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,811
I haven't even had the heart
to drink it myself.

15
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:19,931
Put less tea in there.

16
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,012
That's about right.

17
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,211
Too much of it may cause insomnia.

18
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,491
He's already short on sleep.

19
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:24,371
A little less.

20
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:40,172
Zhiming,

21
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,651
this is the new tea from this year.

22
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,211
Give it a try.

23
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:06,931
Come here.

24
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,312
(Happy Birthday)

25
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,052
Happy Birthday, Zhiming.

26
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,811
Ming,

27
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:08,612
from now on,

28
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,331
we'll celebrate your birthday
at home every year.

29
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:18,092
Eat up.

30
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,016
(Happy Birthday)

31
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:40,811
Take it slow.

32
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,052
Eat slowly, Zhiming.

33
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,612
Have a good sleep tonight.

34
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,451
Regarding your father's matter,

35
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,652
He Dong and I have already
taken care of everything.

36
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:40,852
No need to worry.

37
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,011
If you need anything, tell us, okay?

38
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:51,811
By the way,

39
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,652
after last tasting event,

40
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,732
a lot of cigar suppliers

41
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,131
came looking to collaborate.

42
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,212
This is the sample Mr. Yao
finally chose.

43
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,212
I'll leave it with you as a keepsake.

44
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:24,788
My mom said,

45
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,307
after celebrating your birthday,

46
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,067
and you've eaten her longevity noodles,

47
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,548
from now on, you're her son.

48
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:40,627
Zhiming,

49
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:42,588
as long as you're willing,

50
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,667
my home is your home.

51
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,068
Rest early.

52
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:08,627
Good night.

53
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:10,588
Good night.

54
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:35,547
How's he going? Asleep?

55
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,828
Asleep. Don't worry.

56
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,068
Is he alright?

57
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:45,027
I was in too much of a hurry
when we got there today.

58
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,027
Once I got anxious,
I started to blabber.

59
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,308
Has this affected

60
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,427
the guests staying next door?

61
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:52,468
Did they make any comments?

62
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,588
Sorry about that.

63
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,108
Thank you, Mom.

64
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:05,627
Thank you.

65
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,507
It's so good to have a daughter
like you.

67
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:52,868
When I was little,

68
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,708
I swore I'd never forgive you.

69
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,348
Because you were the most selfish

70
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,948
and despicable person

71
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,108
I had ever met.

72
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,256
(Tomb of Father Yao Renfu,

73
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:14,068
I thought you would always
remain the same,

74
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,027
impossible to change.

75
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,787
But later I realized

76
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,708
it was me who never changed.

77
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,320
(Tomb of Father Yao Renfu,
Erected by Son Yao Zhiming)

78
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,507
In one's life, there are many regrets.

79
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,108
Some people will come,

80
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,068
and some will leave.

81
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,828
But Yao Zhiming,

82
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:57,907
I will always be with you.

83
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,588
I just feel it's a pity.

84
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:14,667
He has wronged many people,

85
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,068
but only I know

86
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:20,068
he has changed for the better.

87
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,348
It's not like that.

88
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,907
Grandma also saw it.

89
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:39,907
Thank you for being by my side

90
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:41,547
all this time,

91
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:42,988
through the hardest days.

92
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:45,468
The old Yao Zhiming has finally
returned.

93
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:46,468
I'm so happy.

94
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:49,907
Wait a moment.

95
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:53,228
Hello, Mr. Cui.

96
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:58,267
Really? No way.

97
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,188
Alright, I get it.

98
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,468
Okay, thank you, Mr. Cui.

99
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:09,308

for you.

100

Xing'anli has been rated
one of the top ten featured hotels.

101
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,627
Then I must extend my congratulations
to you, Miss Mai.

102
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:19,468
Let's go, I'll take you to Xing'anli.

103
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,348
But I just said I would have lunch
with you.

104
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:25,708
Work is most important,
and love is just a pastime.

105
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,667
How could I possibly
hold you back, Miss Mai?

106
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:29,868
Where did you learn
all these tricks from?

107
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,868
Alright, then I'll treat you tonight.

108
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,907
Let me, Miss Mai, make it up
to you properly.

109
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,348
You just focus on your work.

110
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,547
Come home for dinner.

111
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:38,387
I'll get it ready.

112
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,427
Okay.

113
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:41,108
Let's go.

114
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:43,468
Miss Mai is here.

115
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:44,267
Mr. Cui.

116
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:45,240
Miss Mai.

117
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,667
We've hung the plaques and are just
waiting for you to unveil them.

118
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,108
Then, let's do it together.

119
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:53,147
Alright, let's ask Miss Mai
to do the unveiling.

120
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:53,948
Unveil it.

121
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:54,667
This way, please.

122
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,188
Unveiling.

123
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,747
Let's count down together.

124
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:01,308
Okay.

125
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,147
- Here goes. Three, two, one
- Three, two, one.

is thanks to everyone's efforts.

131
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,108
So just now,

132
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,828
I have informed the finance department,

133
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,948
that shortly, they will distribute

134
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,507
the semi-annual performance bonuses
to everyone.

135
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,267

there are some red packets and cash
available for claiming.

137
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,427
Now for the most important part,

138
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,108
an extra

139
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,588

Let's go, go get the money.

143
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:45,267
Let's go.

144
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,348
Come on, Ziyu.

145
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:48,588
Wait a second, Chenghuan.

146
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,588
I have something to tell you.

147
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:52,348
What is it?

148
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,308
I'm leaving.

149
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:58,627
You, you're leaving for where?

150
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:01,787
I'm going back to Switzerland.

151
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:06,787
Is it because...

152
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,787
Is it about that thing with your mom?

153
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,147
No, Chenghuan.

154
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:13,988
I know

155
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,907
you wouldn't look down on me
because of my mom.

156
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:18,988
How could that possibly be?

157
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:24,348
But my mom did such a thing
to Xing'anli,

158
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,188
which has already been spread around
in the industry.

159
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:31,108
Her reputation is now ruined and
she can't find a new job.

160
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,988
As for her,

161
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,188
she regards her career as even more
important than her life.

162
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,387
She must be feeling terrible inside.

163
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:43,308
It just so happens
that I'm still studying.

164
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,747
So, I'll just take her with me back
to Switzerland.

165
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:50,828
Although my relationship with my mom
won't get any better.

166
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:54,348
But after all, she is my mom.

167
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,188
I certainly can't ignore her, right?

168
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,027
Ziyu,

169
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,068
it's because of me

170
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,427
that your mom ended up like this.

171
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,068
I am very sorry.

172
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,348
But since you've made your decision,

173
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:16,828
then I won't persuade you otherwise.

174
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:20,468
Anyway, if you want to return
to China after you graduate.

175
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,228
Xing'anli is always welcoming you.

176
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,027
Thank you, Chenghuan.

177
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:35,828
Alright.

178
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,348
Then I'll do as you said.

179
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:41,188
If I can't make it abroad,
I'll come back to you.

180
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,308
I also want to eat Ms. Liu's cooking.

181
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,708
No problem, come find me anytime.

182
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:48,828
It's a deal.

183
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:50,068
It's a deal.

184
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,508
Sorry, sorry.

185
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:24,907
Madam.

186
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:25,868
Buying groceries?

187
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,068
I heard from Ms. Liu

188
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,268
that you round down the price and
also give away free green onions.

189
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,308
That's right, that's right.

190
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:31,907
Giving away green onions, yes.

191
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:32,707
Alright.

192
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,828
What do you want? Here's a bag for you.

193
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:35,508
Okay.

194
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:44,627
Is this okay?

195
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,187
Okay.

196
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,147
I'll give you some extra green onions.

197
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:48,268
Good, thank you.

198
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:49,907
Here you go, sir.

199
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:50,627
Thank you.

200
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:36,227
Hey, find me an experienced chef
who makes house calls.

201
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,268
Make it quick.

202
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,308
Coming up.

203
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,947
Here come the glutinous rice balls.

204
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,308
All dishes are ready.

205
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,467
There's fish too.

206
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:04,548
Yao Zhiming,

207
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:07,147
this fish you made looks really good.

208
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:09,828
Nicely done
stir-fried loofah and edamame.

209
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,387
The heat was just right. Have a taste.

210
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,788
The bran dough looks the part,
very presentable.

211
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:16,707
Mom, taste your favorite
glutinous rice balls quickly.

212
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:18,348
Is it good?

213
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:20,947
It's made of yellow rice.

214
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:23,108
It's both glutinous and sweet,
delicious.

215
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,268
Mr. Yao,

216
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,748
this meal,

217
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,947
did you make it?

218
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,788
Zhiming, you're being too insincere,
aren't you?

219
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:36,068
I think these glutinous rice balls
are the only things you cooked yourself.

220
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,467
What are you talking about?
Of course, I made it.

221
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:43,627
Alright, alright, anyway,
it's Mr. Yao who's treating.

222
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,108
Then it's Mr. Yao who made it.

223
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,147
Mr. Mai, Ms. Liu,

224
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:50,748
Chenghuan, Chengzao,

225
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:53,868
a lot has happened to me
during this time.

226
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:57,667
Fortunately, I have you all by my side,

227
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,588
accepting me,

228
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,828
tolerating me,

229
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,147
and healing me.

230
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,627
I want to say thank you to you all.

231
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:07,387
A thousand words

232
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,268
are all in this meal. Thank you.

233
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:16,108
Ming, no need to say thank you.

234
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,627
Look, since you came to this family,

235
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,268
you have also brought us
so much joy, right?

236
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:22,348
How great we are now.

237
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,868
Look, flourishing families.

238
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,227
- How happy!
- Exactly.

239
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,907
Don't be polite with us.

240
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,707
Why are you stirring emotions
when all is well?

241
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,987
Since we are dining together today,

242
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,427
let me share some good news too.

243
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:37,268
The selection of the top ten
featured hotels,

244
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:39,788
Xing'anli has been selected.

245
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:40,888
Congratulations.

246
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:45,588
Then let me also share some good news.

247
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:49,227
I've been promoted to
President for the East China Region.

248
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,788
- So Mr. Yao is the biggest now.
- The East China Region.

249
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:55,588
What region is the East China Region?

250
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:59,187
The East China Region is surely bigger
than Huangpu District.

251
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:00,828
Six provinces and one city.

252
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:02,427
Is that big?

253
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:03,788
I've heard of it.

254
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:07,707
Look at the kids.

255
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,187
Each of them has developed so well,
so accomplished.

256
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,227
I suddenly feel like a weight
has been lifted off.

257
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:16,348
It seems like there's no burden anymore.

258
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:19,147
So, now that I have so much free time,

259
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,707
what meaningful thing should I do?

260
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,667
When I retire,

261
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,748
how about I take you traveling?

262
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:28,387
Yes. Where would you like to go?

263
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,788
I'll sign you up for a tour group.

264
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,947
One-stop service,
saving time and effort.

265
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:34,627
No, no more.

266
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,348
You just got us

267
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:37,987
a health check package.

268
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:38,868
It costs quite a bit.

269
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:39,868
Don't spend any more money.

270
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:40,828
Spend money sparingly.

271
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:41,947
Health check package.

272
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,387
What health check package?

273
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,227
When did you go for the health check?

274
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:47,788
Did it. Did it a long time ago.

275
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,068
Yes. Checked.

276
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,987
Right, checked.

277
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,187
Don't just sit there. Eat.

278
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:56,868
Exactly.

279
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,748
Waiting for you to start, Mom.

280
00:21:58,748 --> 00:21:59,707
Come on, eat.

281
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:01,147
Raise your glass.

282
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:01,828
Okay.

283
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:02,627
Any words?

284
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:06,947
Wishing our whole family
happiness and joy.

285
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,907
Happiness and joy.

286
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:04,348
These flowers are beautiful, right?

287
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,828
They were planted by Zhiming.

288
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,387
I've put them here for you.

289
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,348
Grandma,

290
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:16,108
it's been a long time
since I talked to you.

291
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,748
I have some good news for you.

292
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,868
Xing'anli has been rated as
one of the top ten featured hotels.

293
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,227
I haven't let you down, have I?

294
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,068
However,

295
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,467
Mr. Yao is no longer here.

296
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,828
Zhiming was sad about this
for a long time.

297
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:36,947
But later I managed to cheer him up.

298
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:41,627
My dad and mom also treat him
as their own son.

299
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:45,427
He's no longer all alone now.

300
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:49,268
Oh right,

301
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:52,788
tonight he's also prepared
a large table of dishes.

302
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,508
It's like he's officially joined
the Mai family.

303
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:57,828
Grandma,

304
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:00,227
don't worry,

305
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,028
Xing'anli and Zhiming,

306
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,627
I'll take good care of them for you.

307
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:09,227
My career is now on the right track.

308
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:13,387
I'm also being understanding and
tolerant with my mom.

309
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,667
And I have Zhiming by my side.

310
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,268
I'm truly very happy.

311
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,348
I'm grateful for everything I have now.

312
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,667
Grandma,

313
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:26,467
I just missed you.

314
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:31,627
Be well up there in heaven.

Hello? Who is that?

320
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:01,947
Hello, may I ask if this is
Ms. Liu Wanyu?

321
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,227
Here is the health examination center.

322
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,667
The health examination center?
Has my report come out?

323
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,467
We are calling to inform you

324
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,947
that your health examination electronic
report has been sent via WeChat.

325
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:13,387
The computed tomography scan shows

326
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,467
that there is a relatively large shadow
in your lungs.

327
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,707
Please remember to promptly have
a follow-up exam at the hospital,

328
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:18,788
to avoid delay of condition.

329
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:20,828
Lungs,

330
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,268
having an issue?

331
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:26,748
Sorry, the health examination center
can only perform preliminary checks.

332
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,427
Madam, you should hurry

333
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,227
and go to the hospital
to be more assured.

334
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:34,108
Okay, okay.

335
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:35,947
Thank you.

336
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:14,268
(From the examination results,)

337
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,828
(there is a shadow in your lungs.)

338
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:20,068
We initially suspect it to be a tumor.

339
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,828
Have you felt unwell recently?

340
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,868
Such as chest tightness or coughing?

341
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,947
Yes, a little.

342
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,828
How is your appetite?

343
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:33,427
It's fine.

344
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:36,427
Well, discuss with your family

345
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,947
and arrange for an examination surgery.

346
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,108
So we can make a further diagnosis.

347
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:51,707
Isn't that Yu?

348
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:53,227
Yu.

349
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:55,588
Yu.

350
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:56,508
What happened to her?

351
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:58,147
Why is she ignoring us?

352
00:26:58,308 --> 00:26:59,187
Why is she ignoring us?

353
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:00,467
Ms. Zhou, do you know what's wrong?

354
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:02,548
I don't know.
She must have something in her mind.

355
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,632
(What are the symptoms of lung cancer?)

356
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:51,192
(Cough, fever)

357
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:58,716
(Lung cancer is difficult to treat
and it torments the children.)

358
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:53,427
Mom, we're back.

359
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:56,667
Why are the lights off?

360
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:58,427
Yes.

361
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,508
I'll go and turn it on.

362
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:06,268
Fell asleep?

363
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:07,907
Why are you lying here?

364
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:09,467
It's nothing.

365
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,868
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

366
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:13,108
Yu,

367
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,348
why isn't dinner ready? What happened?

368
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:16,828
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,348
My stomach suddenly hurt this afternoon.

370
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:23,467
Then I fell asleep on this sofa.

371
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:26,108
When I woke up, it was already dark.

372
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,308
I haven't even made dinner.

373
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,508
How are you feeling now?

374
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:32,227
I'm fine now. I'll go make it.

375
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:33,947
No, no, I'll do it.

376
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,028
Don't move.

377
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:37,667
Then let's make it simple tonight.

378
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,627
Okay, okay.

379
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:42,108
It's okay.

380
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:43,227
Mom.

381
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,028
Tell me the truth.

382
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:47,108
What's really going on with you?

383
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:50,308
I'm fine. I'm good.

384
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:52,508
It's just a bit of a stomach ache.

385
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,028
Really?

386
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,268
It's nothing.

387
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:03,627
This afternoon, lying on the sofa,

388
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,707
I thought about your matters
for a long time.

389
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,227
What matters of ours?

390
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:15,028
Ming,

391
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:18,627
you and Huan are not young anymore.

392
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,068
One's thirty, the other forty.

393
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:24,748
It's time for you to get married.

394
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:27,868
Once you're married,

395
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:29,907
have kids sooner.

396
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,227
For a girl,

397
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,147
having children early

398
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,707
leads to a quicker recovery.

399
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:37,907
What's more,

400
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:40,627
look at me and your dad.

401
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:42,508
We're still young.

402
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,508
We can help look after the children.

403
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:48,108
You can go be busy with your careers.

404
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:51,387
Ms. Liu, this rounding up of yours...

405
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,907
You've rounded up quite a bit.

406
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,907
I'm only thirty-two.

407
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,348
It's coming soon, almost there.

408
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,627
Mom, you scared me to death just now.

409
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,828
I thought something serious
had happened.

410
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,467
Don't worry about Zhiming and me.

411
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:07,748
We're not in a hurry.

412
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:09,868
Your health is like this now.

413
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,947
Can you still go with my dad
to the tour group tomorrow?

414
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:13,467
Yeah, is that okay?

415
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:22,108
I should be able to.

416
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,467
That's good, that's good.

417
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,667
I'll take you out for good fun,

418
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,707
to relax.

419
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:32,828
Why don't you go upstairs
and lie down for a bit?

420
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,548
I'll call you when I'm done.

421
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:35,828
Right, take a lie down.

422
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,748
Okay, then I'll go upstairs and
lie down for a bit.

423
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:39,028
Go take a lie down.

424
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:42,548
Are your legs not good either?

425
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:43,748
It's fine. Everything's quite good.

426
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:45,227
Can you make it upstairs by yourself?

427
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:46,707
I'm going upstairs now.

428
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:47,548
Okay.

429
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,108
I'm forty?

430
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:55,508
Why not say fifty?

431
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,308
Stop it.

432
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:04,508
Yu.

433
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:07,907
Look, how about this vest?

434
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:11,147
Cool, right? I'll take it.

435
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,467
You're not feeling well?

436
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:36,508
You're not feeling unwell, are you?

437
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,508
Let me tell you.

438
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:42,308
If you go on and on,

439
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,548
sounding like a high-pitched trumpet,

440
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:48,028
I actually feel that all is quiet
in the world.

441
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:49,707
Like you are now,

442
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:51,907
silent and not saying a word,

443
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,348
why do I feel a bit scared?

444
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,147
You're really okay?

445
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,108
I'm okay.

446
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:00,508
What's up?

447
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:02,907
Are you cursing me?

448
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:03,828
No, no.

449
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,348
Feeling tired, I sit down for a while.

450
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:08,427
Dancing during the day made me tired.

451
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,268
I'm going to sleep now.

452
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:12,707
Go to sleep.

453
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:14,707
I'll do the tidying up.

454
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,828
Mom and Dad, I've got everything
ready for you.

455
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:52,828
But if anything comes up,
give me a call.

456
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,828
It's just a few days.

457
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:58,268
We'll be back soon.

458
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,308
The guide just sent me a WeChat message,

459
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:01,748
saying that the coach bus

460
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:03,667
will get to the entrance of the longtang
in a moment.

461
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,748
It's right on our way.

462
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:06,268
We're leaving now.

463
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,748
Okay, take care.

464
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:09,788
Mom.

465
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:12,907
Why didn't you say goodbye to me?

466
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:18,308
We're leaving now.

467
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,467
Do you feel that my mom

468
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:27,708
is a bit strange?

469
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:33,107
Yes, a little.

470
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,308
Maybe it's because

471
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:37,708
Ms. Liu has been busy for so many years

472
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:39,748
and suddenly she has nothing to do.

473
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:41,348
She might not be used to it.

474
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:45,348
That's possible.

475
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,107
After we finish our work,

476
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:49,308
let's spend some time with them.

477
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,748
Let's go. I'll drop you off at work.

478
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:54,547
Where to?
I'm not going to Xing'anli today.

479
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,467
I'm not that busy at Xing'anli.

480
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,308
Instead, Mao will have the second trial
coming up soon.

481
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:02,228
I want to go over and see
if there's any way I can help.

482
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:04,868
Only if they win the lawsuit,

483
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:07,067
can our family truly be reunited.

484
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:12,467
I think,

485
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:16,027
you are about to take over

486
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:18,507
your mom's mantle.

487
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:20,107
You think?

488
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:22,868
Right, then I'll soon become
the little Liu Wanyu.

489
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:24,027
Are you scared?

490
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:27,907
Oh no, then I'll be Mr. Mai.

491
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:29,228
You're little Mai Laitian.

492
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,107
I'm little Liu Wanyu.

493
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:35,148
This family's vicious cycle.

494
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,107
Is there anything you like?

495
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:44,547
This.

496
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:48,828
Have some coffee and take a break.

497
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,868
How many times have you watched it?

498
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:52,507
I'll review it one more time.

499
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:55,348
This Song Huaimin is determinedly
appealing.

500
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:56,907
Not sure what he's up to.

501
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:58,467
You've worked so hard.

502
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,027
Need me to give you some support?

503
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:01,907
Huan.

504
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:03,708
Busy woman, Miss Mai.

505
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,427
How do you have time to come here?

506
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,348
The hotel selection has ended.

507
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:09,668
It's time for me to let go and
let the team grow.

508
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:10,907
I'm just sneaking in some time

509
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,228
to check on my best friend
and my brother.

510
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,828
Huan, rest assured. We are confident.

511
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:20,268
Xing'anli has replaced with a new team
of legal consultants.

512
00:36:20,268 --> 00:36:22,708
I have asked them to help you
sort out the evidence.

513
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:27,067
The lawyers from Xing'anli can even
handle domestic affairs?

514
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:28,708
They're just to provide some assistance.

515
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,387
Thank you, Huan.

516
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:31,828
No need to be polite with me.

517
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:34,107
However, there's one thing I need
to remind you.

518
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,427
After the lawsuit is over,

519
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:38,067
your need to tell our parents

520
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,628
the relationship between you two.

521
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:43,427
Zao,

522
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,308
I think mom has changed quite a bit
for us lately.

523
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:48,027
As long as you talk to her properly,

524
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:49,708
I believe she can accept it.

525
00:36:50,587 --> 00:36:51,467
Understood, Huan.

526
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,427
Mao and I are planning to do the same.

527
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,148
As long as you know what you're doing.

528
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:01,308
Dingding is calling me.

529
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:03,107
Hello, sweetheart.

530
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:06,628
Mom, my dad beat me.

531
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,027
Don't cry. Don't cry.

532
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,828
I will come right away.

533
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,587
What happened?

534
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:14,027
That scoundrel Song Huaimin
beat Dingding.

535
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:15,348
I need to go right away.

536
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:16,308
Mao, wait a moment.

537
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:18,228
The second trial is about to begin.

538
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,507
It's very strange for Song Huaimin
to beat the child at this time.

539
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,228
Calm down. I'll go with you.

540
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:23,828
Exactly, calm down.

541
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,067
I'll go with you guys.

542
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:26,507
Then let's go.

543
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:27,547
- Don't rush.
- Let's go.

544
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,868
Mao, remember, don't act rashly.

545
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:37,148
We'll wait for you at the door.

546
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:38,507
If anything happens, just call us.

547
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:41,067
Zao.

548
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,507
Coming.

549
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:59,268
I said I was coming. Why still knock?

550
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,507
Dingding.

551
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:04,907
What are you doing?
I'm telling you, he isn't home.

552
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,628
Dingding.

553
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:08,507
- I've already told you. He isn't home.
- Dingding.

554
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:09,748
I'm telling you not to barge in.

555
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,947
That's room. I have things in there.

556
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:13,268
Where's he then?

557
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:14,348
The child?

558
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,148
He has been sent to my mom's.

559
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,148
Why did you send him to your mom's?

560
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,228
He was missing his grandma.

561
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:21,947
I'll go there to find him.

562
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:22,907
Don't go.

563
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,907
The second trial hasn't been judged yet.

564
00:38:25,027 --> 00:38:27,668
I still have custody of the child
for now.

565
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:29,228
You're not qualified. You know that?

566
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:30,668
What gave you the right to beat him?

567
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,268
I'm his father. He is my son.

568
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,708
It's my natural right to discipline him.

569
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:34,748
Are you sick or something?

570
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,228
You're the one who's sick.

571
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,587
Why are you always keeping eyes
on my child?

572
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,507
You're still young.
You can still have children.

573
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,148
Don't you have a boyfriend?

574
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,107
What's wrong? Is your health failing?

575
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:45,708
Or is it his health that's failing?

576
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:47,387
You...

577
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:52,547
I...

578
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,348
What's wrong?

579
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:55,828
Do you have any humanity?

580
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:56,708
Why don't I?

581
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,067
Are you fit to be a father?

582
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,107
How am I not fit?

583
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:00,148
And you bring backup.

584
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,507
Let me tell you.

585
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:03,348
My home is under surveillance.

586
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:04,907
Everything has been recorded.

587
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:06,628
You won't get away with this.

588
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,987
Song Huaimin, you lost the first trial.

589
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,308
So you're acting like a cornered dog.

590
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:11,907
You're trying to pressure Mao

591
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:13,067
to act rashly,

592
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,828
to make everyone think
she's emotionally unstable,

593
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:16,628
all to fight for the custody rights,
right?

594
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,547
Let me tell you.
Don't even think about it.

595
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:19,188
You...

596
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:19,868
What?

597
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:20,907
Song Huaimin,

598
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,268
if only you put some thought
into the child,

599
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:24,868
things wouldn't have come to this.

600
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:25,868
I'm telling you.

601
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:28,748
We will certainly win the second trial.
Just wait.

602
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,228
Just wait. See you at the second trial.

603
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:57,868
Yu, what's wrong?

604
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:00,467
Are you feeling unwell?

605
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:04,027
I don't want to play anymore.

606
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:06,067
I don't want to play anymore.

607
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:09,148
Listen to me.

608
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:13,067
You've just stayed at home too long.

609
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,308
So you're not used to being out.

610
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:16,107
Are you?

611
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:18,268
It's okay.

612
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,268
I want to go home and cook for them.

613
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,427
You...

614
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,868
You really are a hard worker.

615
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:30,308
Let me tell you.

616
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:32,027
Our daughter, our son,

617
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:33,788
they've both grown up.

618
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,828
And they both have their own careers.

619
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:37,387
If you're not home for only one day,

620
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:38,648
they would be starved?

621
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:44,027
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

622
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:44,788
It's not that.

623
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,387
It's not like that.

624
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,467
I miss them.

625
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:52,268
Let's go home.

626
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,868
Fine. If you don't want to play anymore,

627
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:58,947
then we won't do it.

628
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:02,308
We'll get off at the next stop.

629
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:06,188
I'll rent a car and turn back, okay?

630
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,907
Alright, alright. Don't cry.

631
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:20,668
Thank you both for your help today.

632
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,587
But you really did a great job today.

633
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:25,067
It was truly impressive.

634
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,947
However, you really impressed me today.

635
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,668
With your temper,

636
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:33,427
you managed not to hit him today.

637
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:35,148
That's really impressive.

638
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,668
If it were the old me,

639
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:40,348
not slapping him
would've been letting him off easy.

640
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,628
But before the lawsuit is settled,

641
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,148
for Dingding's sake and for Zao' sake,

642
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:48,067
I must bear even
the greatest grievances.

643
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,308
Once we win the lawsuit,

644
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,587
watch how I'll deal with him.

645
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:53,828
Mao.

646
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,668
You've really changed a lot.

647
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,387
Isn't it the courage you gave me?

648
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:08,067
What did I just see?

649
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:08,868
That's too horrible.

650
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:10,427
Can you two not show affection
in front of me?

651
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,427
What are you doing?

652
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:13,348
My scalp is tingling.

653
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:18,748
I...

654
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:21,268
I arranged for Mr. Zhang
to come to our house today.

655
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:22,628
Let's prepare well.

656
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:24,828
Our whole family will work together,

657
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:26,387
to give Song Huaimin

658
00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:27,587
a big surprise.

659
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,788
Thank you.

660
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:32,828
You go hug Zao.
