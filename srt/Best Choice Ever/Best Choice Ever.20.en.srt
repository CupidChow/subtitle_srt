(Xing'anli Hotel Cluster,)

4
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:35,811
owned by Ms. Chen Shuzhen,
was built between 1930 and 1938,

5
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,011
located at the junction
of Jianhua South Road

6
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,651
and Fuyang Road

7
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,052
in Xuhui District.

8
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,852
Its property rights shall be entrusted

9
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:44,811
to JinCheng Law Firm

10
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:46,132
for ten years.

11
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,651
After ten years,

12
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:50,772
the property rights shall be transferred
to Ms. Mai Chenghuan.

13
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,692
And Xing'anli shall be owned
by Ms. Mai Chenghuan.

14
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,451
(During the ten years,)

15
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:57,492
the management rights will be enjoyed
by Mai Chenghuan,

16
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,932
and profits and losses are to be borne
and enjoyed by herself.

17
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,451
(Miss Mai.)

18
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,692
(Ms. Chen Shuzhen
has instructed my law firm)

19
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,572
(to hold the property rights
of Xing'anli on her behalf)

20
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,891
for a term of ten years.

21
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:10,091
After ten years, the property rights
will be transferred to you.

22
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:11,091
Therefore,

23
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,131
you now can fully enjoy

24
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,892
(the management rights)

25
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,012
(of the Xing'anli Garden Hotel.)

26
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,851
Turns out Ms. Chen owned Xing'anli.

27
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,932
How come we knew nothing about it?

28
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,292
Why did she give it to Huan?

29
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,251
(There is a letter for Mr. Yao.)

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,976
(Please pass it on for me.)

31
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:43,531
So, do you still want to confess to her?

32
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,411
Speaking of Mai Chenghuan,

33
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,492
should I see her as your future wife

34
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,172
or a competitor?

35
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,571
Boss, calm down.

36
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,531
Anyway, it already happened.

37
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,411
We have to face reality.

38
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,212
Let's go and relax.

39
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:27,292
(You're very much
like your grandfather.)

40
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:29,571
(He always had the best strategies)

41
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,371
and never missed a beat in business,

42
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,612
seeking to maximize benefits
in everything.

43
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:38,571
I think being a decent person
is just like cooking.

44
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,052
If you only seek

45
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:42,772
instant benefits,

46
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,212
then the cooking loses its soul.

47
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,811
The diners won't be willing

48
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,851
to pay for the dishes.

49
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,064
(Zhang Peisheng)

50
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:55,932
Eric.

51
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:59,371
I hear Mai Chenghuan has Xing'anli now.

52
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,371
Is this your so-called plan?

53
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,292
This is what Grandma wanted.

54
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,584
I must remind you

55
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:07,932
that you don't have much time left.

56
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:11,992
Don't forget what you promised me.

57
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:24,691
Boss.

58
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,092
Well,

59
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,532
should I book tickets back
to Switzerland right now?

60
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,532
If you want to go back,
I won't stop you.

61
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,732
Now Mai Chenghuan has Xing'anli.

62
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:35,891
It's already done.

63
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,131
We don't have to stay here anymore.

64
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,172
How come you still have the mood
to fish here?

65
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,891
Grandma didn't leave Xing'anli to me.

66
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,532
I made a wrong judgment.

67
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,131
She told me to learn from Mai Chenghuan
and taught me

68
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,492
that human touch
is more important than benefits.

69
00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:58,932
Looking back now,

70
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,412
Grandma was always thinking of me.

71
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,092
It's fine.

72
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,312
After all, I have worked for you
for so many years.

73
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,052
But this is the first time
you failed, right?

74
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,092
It's no big deal.

75
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,612
Well,

76
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,532
we just need to think clearly
about what to do next.

77
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:17,972
Keep waiting.

78
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,331
Waiting?

79
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:22,331
Since I was wrong,

80
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,612
I will try again.

81
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,612
Mai Chenghuan is my reference for that.

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,412
I have to find a way

83
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,732
to take back Xing'anli from her.

84
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:44,771
Boss.

85
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,480
You are so far-sighted.

86
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:49,771
Fishing and doing business

87
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,412
share the same principle.

88
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:56,492
I admire you so much.

89
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:06,315
(Xing'anli Garden Hotel Blueprint)

90
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:12,371
(Don't numb yourself with work anymore.)

91
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,532
(Let's go visit Grandma
together tomorrow.)

92
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,451
Actually, when you smile,

93
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,292
you look quite handsome.

94
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,451
Finally,

95
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,571
(Convenience Services)
the day of demolition comes.

96
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,811
But the compensation
for demolition is getting less.

97
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,211
I heard that we could be resettled

98
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,092
in the same area after demolition.

99
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,811
How could that be?
Think about our location.

100
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,412
The developer will suffer a huge loss.

101
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,811
It seems

102
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,492
we have to make a choice
between the two.

103
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,492
We move to the suburbs.

104
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,211
Get the resettlement housing.

105
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,172
Or we take the demolition compensation.

106
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:57,492
This bag is really expensive.

107
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,211
Is my house

108
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,131
worth over two million yuan?

109
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,972
But with that money,

110
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,172
you can't buy a good house
in the city center.

111
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:10,011
The location
of the resettlement housing is not good.

112
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,052
We're in a dilemma.

113
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,412
Yeah, we are.

114
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,451
We have to move
to the rural edges of the city.

115
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:21,251
Don't mention it.

116
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:24,691
So, have you made a choice?

117
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,412
I've thought about it.

118
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,412
We should move to the suburbs.

119
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,092
The resettlement housing is best for us.

120
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,092
But I think the suburbs are too far.

121
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,211
I don't want to move there.

122
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,811
If we take the demolition compensation,

123
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,451
it's just over two million yuan.

124
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,612
We can't buy

125
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,811
a good house with that
in the city center.

126
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:48,052
It's okay. Huan has money now.

127
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,131
Plus the demolition compensation

128
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:51,092
we will get,

129
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,571
we can afford a house
in a good location.

130
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,211
If that's the case,

131
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,811
we need to rent a place

132
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,211
before buying one.

133
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,292
Why?

134
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:05,172
Isn't it good to live
in that old western-style house?

135
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,092
We've paid the rent.

136
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,852
And it's so close to Huan's place.

137
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,852
Maybe she'll move in one day.

138
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:12,612
Come on.

139
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,691
The old house is owned
by Yao Zhiming now.

140
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,612
That's not a big deal.
After all, we are family.

141
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,092
Besides, there are many bedrooms.

142
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,891
Those rooms will be dusty

143
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:23,811
if they're always empty.

144
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,691
Houses are meant to be lived in.

145
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,972
Actually, Yao Zhiming is quite pitiful.

146
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,331
He's always dressed up in public,

147
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:34,331
but he lives in a big empty house

148
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:35,811
without a single soul to talk to.

149
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,652
Isn't he pitiful?

150
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,052
Now he can live with us.

151
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,172
The more, the merrier.

152
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:41,971
Besides,

153
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:43,971
I can cook

154
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,292
and clean the house for him.

155
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,731
- I can take care of him.
- Mrs. Mai.

156
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:47,451
Mr. Mai.

157
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:48,652
Have you decided yet?

158
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,211
Are you opting for resettlement housing
or demolition compensation?

159
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,012
We're still thinking about it.

160
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,811
Anyway, we don't really care.

161
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,571
The old western-style house
we're living in is good.

162
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,851
Mai, let's go home and pack up.

163
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,211
Don't flaunt your wealth.
Keep it low-key.

164
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,971
Don't show off.

165
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:05,932
Got it.

166
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:06,851
You might get robbed.

167
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:07,532
Come on.

168
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,611
Again.

169
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,611
Watch out and don't kick me.

170
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,292
Again.

171
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:14,971
Just hit.

172
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,091
Even if you're tired to death,

173
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:17,412
you still can't

174
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:18,652
think of a solution.

175
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:20,971
Again.

176
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,772
Boss, do you want
to hear something important?

177
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,451
Speak, but it better be useful.

178
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:28,611
It must be useful.

179
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,211
Chenghuan's family is going
to be relocated.

180
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,571
To the suburbs.

181
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,372
Don't you understand?

182
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:36,811
The suburbs.

183
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,252
As I know about Chenghuan's mom,

184
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,772
she will be unwilling to move
to a place in the suburbs.

185
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,172
At this point,

186
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,091
if you

187
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,172
trade the western-style house

188
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:47,412
for Xing'anli,

189
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,292
it will meet their urgent need.

190
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:58,811
Where are you going?

191
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,611
You forgot to compliment me
on this idea!

192
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:17,091
What's wrong with you? You seem down.

193
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,691
Are you dumbfounded

194
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:19,971
by a windfall?

195
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,851
I'm pondering over something

196
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,172
that I found particularly strange.

197
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,132
What is it?

198
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,132
That day,

199
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,611
when the lawyer read the will,

200
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,491
Yao Zhiming heard

201
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,571
that I inherited Xing'anli.

202
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:36,611
But his expression

203
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:38,772
was very odd.

204
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:39,892
Logically speaking,

205
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,211
if he found out Grandma owned Xing'anli,

206
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:44,811
he should be surprised

207
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:46,811
or puzzled.

208
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,611
But he made me feel

209
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:53,012
that he had known it all along.

210
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,292
I'm not surprised.

211
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,012
He has been working
in the hotel industry.

212
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:57,211
How could he not know?

213
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:59,571
Maybe he came back just for Xing'anli.

214
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,971
So much has happened.

215
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:07,292
I don't even know

216
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,611
which of his words are true.

217
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,772
Hello. Yes.

218
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,811
Okay, thank you.

219
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:21,491
What's the matter?

220
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:24,372
The lawyer asked me

221
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,211
to handle the hotel handover now.

222
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,611
It's a huge thing.

223
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,091
Take me for a tour.

224
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:37,691
Let's go.

225
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,211
Come on. Take me with you.

226
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,132
Miss Mai,
I just showed you around the hotel

227
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,772
that you'll take over and manage.

228
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,811
You can look over the related documents.

229
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:53,971
After confirmation,

230
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:56,012
we can proceed
with the handover formalities.

231
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,372
Thank you.

232
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,451
We want to walk around by ourselves.

233
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:01,892
I will contact you later.

234
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,052
Okay, keep in touch.

235
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:04,052
- Thank you.
- See you.

236
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,611
This is Grandma's deep love for you.

237
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,091
I often accompanied Grandma to eat here.

238
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,772
But I never knew she owned Xing'anli.

239
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,292
If I could trade this place

240
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,012
for Grandma's rebirth,
that would be great.

241
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,971
I know you must feel upset now.

242
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,691
It must be hard for you to face this.

243
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:35,211
But

244
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,451
since Ms. Chen has entrusted
this place to you,

245
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,892
it means she trusted you.

246
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,971
So, cheer up.

247
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,451
You can do it.

248
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,892
Fulfill her wish.

249
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,571
Miss Chenghuan, you're back.

250
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:54,372
Mr. Cui.

251
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,491
I'll just let you guys talk.

252
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,052
Anyway, I've been there.

253
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,611
I gotta go now.

254
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:05,292
See you.

255
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:10,331
Mr. Cui.

256
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,292
Grandma owned Xing'anli.

257
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,811
Why have you never mentioned it
to me before?

258
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,892
Ms. Chen instructed me

259
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:20,451
not to tell you about this too soon.

260
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:22,611
Grandma...

261
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:25,652
Why did Grandma
hand over such a large hotel

262
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,252
to me?

263
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:29,372
I'm not clear about why.

264
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:32,412
However, I can take you to a place.

265
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:33,811
Please follow me.

266
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,372
This is Ms. Chen's office in Xing'anli.

267
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:52,412
She used to handle things here.

268
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,811
Ms. Chen valued Xing'anli

269
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,772
and she valued the staff even more.

270
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,851
For decades,

271
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,211
she's been looking after us.

272
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,892
And we have shared happiness and woe

273
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:04,811
with her.

274
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,811
To be frank,

275
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,052
Chenghuan,

276
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:09,372
to my mind,

277
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,652
I've long considered Ms. Chen
as my family.

278
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,211
Grandma is affectionate.

279
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:19,252
She ran Xing'anli
with the concept of a family.

280
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,772
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

281
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,292
Thank you for your trust in Grandma

282
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,292
and your assistance.

283
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,811
My trust in her didn't come easy.

284
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:35,132
I learned it from the old employees.

285
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,331
Back when Ms. Chen

286
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:39,892
took over Xing'anli,

287
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:42,412
everyone didn't have
much confidence in her.

288
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,571
They thought

289
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,052
she was just a pampered young lady

290
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,811
(Accounting Document Cover)
and knew nothing about hotel management.

291
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,451
But she learned while doing business.

292
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:54,491
Eventually, she led us
through many challenges

293
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,372
and turned Xing'anli

294
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:59,052
into what it is today step by step.

295
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,811
So staff with some seniority

296
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,012
trust her very much.

297
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,416
Now,

298
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,372
she has handed Xing'anli over to you.

299
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,851
And we will fully support you.

300
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,772
Take a look. I won't disturb you.

301
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,491
Here's the key.

302
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,292
Call me anytime if you need anything.

303
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:21,971
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

304
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,892
(When you feel down,)

305
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,892
eat properly.

306
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,412
We are friends over meals.

307
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,892
Then I'll just enjoy the meal.

308
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:03,772
Your hard work

309
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,052
may not be rewarded immediately.

310
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:08,932
But don't get discouraged.

311
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,491
Because you never know

312
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,211
when your good fortune will arrive.

313
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,491
Grandma.

314
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,892
You must hope

315
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,772
that I can stay true to myself

316
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,731
and choose my own life,

317
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,811
right?

318
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,440
Chenghuan, are you in there?

319
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:56,971
Come in.

320
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,812
Chenghuan.

321
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,211
I'd like to talk to you.

322
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:10,852
Sure.

323
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,051
Please enjoy.

324
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,932
On the day the will was announced,

325
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,812
to be honest,

326
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:33,771
I was a bit surprised.

327
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,011
To be honest,

328
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,531
I was also very surprised.

329
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:41,691
Chenghuan.

330
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,172
To be realistic,

331
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,892
is there perhaps another way?

332
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,291
Let's exchange inheritances.

333
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:57,652
Your family can live

334
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:59,172
in Grandma's house

335
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,612
and lead a happy life.

336
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,451
I will take over Xing'anli.

337
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,211
I guarantee that Xing'anli will

338
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,172
steadily overcome the current situation.

339
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,051
I want to ask you a few questions.

340
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,372
I hope you can answer me honestly.

341
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,251
Of course, go ahead.

342
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,691
You came back for Xing'anli
in the first place, didn't you?

343
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,572
Yes.

344
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,932
You went on a trip with us
to the mountains

345
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,092
because you tried to persuade Grandma

346
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,652
to hand over Xing'anli to you, right?

347
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:35,731
Yes.

348
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,412
You are concerned about my life

349
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:41,572
and help me with my work.

350
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,092
Is it your attempt

351
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,652
to make a good impression on Grandma

352
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:48,892
to get Xing'anli?

353
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,251
It was true at first.

354
00:18:58,652 --> 00:18:59,612
But not later on.

355
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,892
There are many reasons.

356
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,332
For example,

357
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,812
your coffee is priced

358
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,612
at 50 yuan, which is not cheap.

359
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,491
But the coffee beans used

360
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,172
are of high quality.

361
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,132
The profit is minimal.

362
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:24,372
And there's the maintenance cost
for such a large lawn.

363
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,092
It costs tens of thousands a month.

364
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,812
There's also the maintenance
of the building facades.

365
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,932
That's a lot of money.

366
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,691
And that's just external expenditure.

367
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,771
The biggest challenge

368
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:39,291
is team management.

369
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:44,332
Grandma has been supporting Xing'anli
out of her own pocket.

370
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,691
She was generous and tolerant to staff.

371
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,412
She has brought together a large family.

372
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,251
But her way of management

373
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:56,531
will only result in deficits.

374
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,172
I'm not doubting your ability.

375
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,211
But I think

376
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,691
taking over and managing this hotel

377
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,572
is very challenging for you.

378
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:12,664
What you said

379
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:15,332
makes sense.

380
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,211
But have you ever thought about it?

381
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,251
Even so,

382
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,211
Grandma still entrusted Xing'anli to me.

383
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:25,092
Why is that?

384
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:27,451
I have thought about it.

385
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,011
But I don't know why.

386
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,971
That day at the cemetery,
you invited me to dinner.

387
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,332
Is it related to Xing'anli?

388
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,011
No, it's not.

389
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,372
It seems

390
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:50,612
you still can't be honest

391
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,852
with me.

392
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,291
Since that's the case,

393
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,491
I have nothing more to say.

394
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,132
Oh, right.

395
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:01,332
Grandma left you a letter
on the day the will was announced.

396
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:03,172
You left in such a hurry

397
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,372
before we could give it to you.

398
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:06,051
Read it.

399
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:08,451
I have to go.

400
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,412
(Zhiming.)

401
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:42,612
(I think you must be surprised)

402
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:45,011
(at my arrangement.)

403
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:48,412
(You will think I am biased.)

404
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:51,892
(In fact, to me,)

405
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:55,372
(you are equally important.)

406
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,531
(Chenghuan is diligent and aspiring.)

407
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:04,451
(Yet she always lacks an opportunity
to prove herself.)

408
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:08,172
(I never worry about your career.)

409
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:10,731
(But you have been abroad
since you were young.)

410
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:15,372
(You have experienced the fickleness
of the world.)

411
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:19,372
(I'm sorry that we didn't have
much time for each other)

412
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,731
(and I'm not attentive enough to you.)

413
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:22,932
(Therefore,)

414
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:26,172
(I chose to hand over
the management of Xing'anli)

415
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:27,971
(to Chenghuan)

416
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,932
(and left the old house to you.)

417
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,572
(I'm not trying to make things
even better.)

418
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,412
(I just want to make up for regrets.)

419
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,771
(I hope you won't live
like a rootless duckweed,)

420
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,372
(always trying to seek advantages
and avoid disadvantages.)

421
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,211
(You should know
that the human touch matters most)

422
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:54,092
(between people.)

423
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:56,451
(This is how you)

424
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,892
(lead a warm)

425
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,812
(and delightful life.)

426
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:13,572
Grandma.

427
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,011
You have left me
with a difficult problem.

428
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:32,760
(Summary of Revenue and Expenditure)

429
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:41,971
Yao Zhiming was right.

430
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:47,572
(Accounting Document Cover)
The business of Xing'anli is not good.

431
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,172
I can't believe you.

432
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:05,691
How could you tell Chenghuan

433
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:07,892
that you feared
that she would suffer from setbacks?

434
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,291
So what?
Telling the truth is against the law?

435
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:12,332
My dear boss.

436
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,491
After such a long time,

437
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,932
do you still not know Chenghuan well?

438
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,211
She has just become independent
from her family

439
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:20,172
and has finally had an opportunity
to prove herself.

440
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:21,731
You told her

441
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:23,491
that you were worried about her.

442
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,412
But in fact,
you threw cold water on her.

443
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,731
So what's the difference
between you and her mother?

444
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,251
Zou.

445
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:57,812
Do you think

446
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:01,011
Eric is very restless now?

447
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:03,011
I thought

448
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,291
that Mr. Yao only
cared about his interests

449
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,011
and was resolute in his decisions.

450
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,731
But recently, he seems to have changed.

451
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,451
He became somewhat hesitant.

452
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,011
I have underestimated Mai Chenghuan.

453
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:21,652
She is quite capable indeed.

454
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,208
She won over Ms. Chen

455
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,372
and Yao Zhiming.

456
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:29,691
But I think she's too green

457
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:32,291
to manage Xing'anli.

458
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:34,932
Ms. Zhang.

459
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:36,812
You should drink less.

460
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,011
So are we...?

461
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,291
Fine.

462
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,852
Give Xing'anli a gift.

463
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,892
Let her recognize the reality sooner.

464
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,132
Be careful.

465
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:15,332
How come you're back?

466
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:16,011
Let me help you.

467
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:16,812
Come on.

468
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:18,771
Okay.

469
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,412
Is that okay?

470
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:22,852
Yes, this position is quite good.

471
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:24,932
If you didn't come back,

472
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,211
I couldn't do it.

473
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,332
Alright.

474
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:29,051
Done.

475
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:33,691
Our little Zao has grown up.

476
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,892
He can help me with everything now.

477
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,771
Mao, I don't want
to be your little brother anymore.

478
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:42,211
So what do you want to be?

479
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:44,531
Be careful.

480
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:46,971
- Are you okay?
- It scared me.

481
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:47,691
I'm fine.

482
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:51,932
Song Huaimin.

483
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:53,932
No wonder you didn't answer my call.

484
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,132
So you were busy dating.

485
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,291
You...

486
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,412
Isn't this Chengzao?

487
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:02,211
Mao, how did you hook up

488
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,771
with your bestie's younger brother
after divorcing me?

489
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,451
Watch your mouth.

490
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,011
Chengzao.

491
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:09,771
You've graduated, right?

492
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,051
Do you have a job?

493
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,092
I'm a lawyer.

494
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:14,211
It's none of your business.

495
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:16,728
Your shop

496
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,892
is well decorated.

497
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,852
It seems you have learned a lot from me

498
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:22,852
when we were together.

499
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:24,251
How about this, Mao?

500
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:25,812
If you come back to me,

501
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:27,011
I promise

502
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,092
to let you do your own brand.

503
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:32,812
Do you think I'm a fool?

504
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:34,011
Do I want to come back

505
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,412
so you can keep copying my designs?

506
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:37,572
I never copied.

507
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:39,011
You have your inspiration,

508
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:40,771
and so do I.

509
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:44,812
Song Huaimin, you really are shameless.

510
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:47,291
I have exposed your true face online.

511
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,652
You still have the nerve to come here?

512
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:50,211
What do you want?

513
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,652
Actually, your posts online

514
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,572
don't affect me much.

515
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:56,051
Just today,

516
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,251
the jewelry brand seeking
to collaborate with you

517
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,572
also came to me.

518
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:01,572
They even inquired

519
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:02,971
about you specifically.

520
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,612
Are you threatening me?

521
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,892
We have already gone our separate ways.

522
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:10,172
Why don't you get it?

523
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,691
Connections matter in this circle,

524
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:13,812
not the work.

525
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,172
And look at you right now.

526
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:16,172
After leaving me,

527
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,652
do you really want
to spend your life selling these things?

528
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:23,092
Mao is very outstanding.

529
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,332
And she'll get better and better
after leaving you.

530
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:26,971
As for you,

531
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:28,852
you copy her work.

532
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:30,812
I think it's you who can't leave her.

533
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,051
Dingding should call him

534
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,251
Uncle Chengzao, right?

535
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:39,812
Or maybe

536
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,132
"stepdad"?

537
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:45,011
Delete the photos.

538
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,092
I won't.

539
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,451
Delete the photos.

540
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,332
Get away from me!

541
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,652
I didn't push her hard.

542
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:53,051
Are you okay?

543
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,092
As a lawyer, you just hit me.

544
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,172
I'll call the police!

545
00:28:57,251 --> 00:28:58,172
Go ahead!

546
00:28:58,251 --> 00:28:59,412
I have cameras all over here.

547
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:00,612
Let's see who started it.

548
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:01,691
I'm warning you.

549
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,332
If you come to harass her again,

550
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,652
I'll risk my career

551
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,132
to ruin and disgrace you.

552
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:11,051
Good for you.

553
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:12,572
Mao.

554
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,491
I came here to discuss
collaboration with you.

555
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,092
But now,

556
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,812
you two,

557
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,011
wait and see.

558
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:25,892
Get out of here!

559
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:27,852
Are you okay?

560
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:29,332
Are you hurt?

561
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:30,971
I'm fine.

562
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:33,372
I just strained my back.

563
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,412
Here.

564
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,011
Is your back alright?

565
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:38,092
It's fine.

566
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,572
I'm okay. I can walk by myself.

567
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,812
I'm so pissed.

568
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:45,652
Let me check your hand.

569
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:46,812
My hand is alright.

570
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:49,092
How can it be alright? It's swollen.

571
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,011
Come and have a seat.

572
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,771
I'll get some ice for you to apply.

573
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:53,731
Wait a moment.

574
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:02,572
Listen,

575
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,612
he's just a scumbag.

576
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:07,011
Is it worth risking your career
to handle him?

577
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,011
I can do anything for you.

578
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,491
No, that's not what I mean.

579
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,451
I can handle these things myself.

580
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:22,932
Just stay out of this, little boy.

581
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:24,491
I'm not a little boy.

582
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,011
I want to be someone
who can protect you.

583
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,251
I don't want you
to manage such a big shop,

584
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,132
and pack and arrange
delivery by yourself.

585
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:37,412
I don't want to see you
stay up all night,

586
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:38,812
working on drafts after closing time

587
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,731
with no one to remind you to eat.

588
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,332
And I can't see you face the harassment
from Song Huaimin alone.

589
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,412
Mao.

590
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:48,892
When I first met you,

591
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:50,612
you were a carefree girl.

592
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:53,691
I hope you can always remain carefree.

593
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,812
Mao.

594
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:15,892
I like you.

595
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:20,011
From the moment I met you,

596
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,051
I've liked you.

597
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:24,852
It's been ten years.

598
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:27,652
My feelings never change.

599
00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:32,172
How old were you back then?

600
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,172
Did you even know what that meant?

601
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,771
When I just returned
to Shanghai to study,

602
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:46,251
because of my accent,

603
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:48,412
I was mocked by my classmates.

604
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:51,132
So during that period,

605
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,291
I became silent and uncommunicative,

606
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:56,092
refusing to talk with anyone.

607
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,691
It was you who taught me Mandarin
over and over again,

608
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:03,612
telling me that I didn't need
to cater to others.

609
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:07,812
It was you who were always there for me,
encouraging me.

610
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:10,531
So from that moment on,

611
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:14,132
I was sure that I like you.

612
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:31,172
Mao.

613
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:33,572
So,

614
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,372
can I be the one

615
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:39,852
who protects you?

616
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:48,612
I...

617
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,291
I need to go downstairs
to check on the goods.

618
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:07,691
You should go back early.

619
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:31,531
Does it smell good?

620
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:32,611
Of course.

621
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,944
- Smells good.
- Smells good.

622
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,451
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

623
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:36,451
Zao.

624
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,171
Zao.

625
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:37,651
Look.

626
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:38,852
It smells so good.

627
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:40,852
It's a big meal.

628
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,131
Huan is back.

629
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:47,892
Huan.

630
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:52,091
Mom.

631
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,456
Huan.

632
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,568
Huan.

633
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,051
It's me.

634
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,171
You were laughing.

635
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,772
Why is it you?

636
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:05,212
I heard your laughter on the stairs.

637
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,372
Did you dream

638
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:08,412
that our daughter came home for a meal?

639
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,932
I thought it was Huan.

640
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,651
You're so annoying
for waking me up from my dream.

641
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:16,131
Let me tell you.

642
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,200
Right now, I'm thinking

643
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,412
that if Huan could come back home,

644
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:24,292
I would be willing to cook many dishes.

645
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:25,772
Alright, get up.

646
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:26,971
It's time for breakfast.

647
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,412
- Get up.
- I'm not eating.

648
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:31,732
I want to continue the dream.

649
00:35:35,372 --> 00:35:36,376
Ms. Chen.

650
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,232
Thank you.

651
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:41,171
Thank you for letting us live
in such a big house.

652
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:42,772
If you could hear me,

653
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,171
please keep my whole family

654
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:46,692
safe and healthy.

655
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:47,971
Keep my husband safe

656
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,732
on the road.

657
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,171
May Zao's work go smoothly.

658
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,131
May Huan make a fortune.

659
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:55,732
Make a big fortune.

660
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:57,772
Make a big fortune?

661
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,812
That depends on Huan's own efforts.

662
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:01,372
I know.

663
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:02,412
May...

664
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,571
Wanyu.

665
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,451
Sis.

666
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,892
- I heard you inherited a large fortune.
- It's my sister.

667
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:19,732
Tell me about it.

668
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,051
Yes, not much.

669
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:25,171
The point is Huan inherited a big hotel.

670
00:36:25,772 --> 00:36:26,571
Sis.

671
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:29,332
I haven't told anyone else about this.

672
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,531
I haven't even told our brother
or any fellow villagers.

673
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,571
I've only told you.

674
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:34,212
Don't tell others.

675
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,252
Alright, goodbye.

676
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,292
Goodbye.

677
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:44,491
Hello.

678
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,171
Sis, Chenghuan inherited a big hotel?

679
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:50,531
You are so well-informed.

680
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:52,171
Sis just told you, right?

681
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:53,971
Listen.

682
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,491
The timing wasn't right
when you came last time.

683
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,932
It was so embarrassing.
I am really sorry.

684
00:36:59,732 --> 00:37:00,932
Next time you come,

685
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,332
I will check you in at Xing'anli

686
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,892
and take you for a good tour
around the Shanghai Bund.

687
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:06,892
Hey,

688
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,212
don't tell others about this.

689
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,971
After all, I have to keep a low profile.

690
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:13,531
Alright.

691
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,892
Okay, goodbye.

692
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,252
Yu.

693
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,451
Is this how you keep a low profile?

694
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:22,971
I think you just can't wait
to tell the whole world.

695
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:24,772
If Huan finds out,

696
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:26,171
she will definitely be angry.

697
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,571
What's there to be angry about?

698
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:28,971
Good news

699
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:30,392
should be shared.

700
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:31,692
Fine.

701
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:32,491
Mai.

702
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:35,000
Boss Mai.

703
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,971
How am I a boss?

704
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:41,011
We are now bosses in Shanghai Bund.

705
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,531
We have a big hotel

706
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,171
in the center of the city.

707
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:45,491
That's incredible.

708
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:46,372
Please.

709
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:47,571
Let me make it clear.

710
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,971
Huan is the boss,

711
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,091
not us.

712
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,336
Huan is our daughter.

713
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:54,971
Doesn't that mean we're bosses too?

714
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:56,571
Are you a fool?

715
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,692
Alright.

716
00:37:57,892 --> 00:37:59,332
I've been thinking about it.

717
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:01,892
I wonder

718
00:38:01,932 --> 00:38:03,732
how their food is.

719
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:08,252
I feel different now than last time.

720
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,372
Of course, our status is different.

721
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:15,332
Should we tell Huan about our coming?

722
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,332
It's not proper to barge in.

723
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,812
What does it matter?

724
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,571
We're just here to have a look.

725
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,971
It won't disturb her.

726
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:24,372
Welcome.

727
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:26,171
Thanks.

728
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,292
You go ahead.

729
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:29,292
No.

730
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,372
You go ahead.

731
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,091
If I go ahead and Huan sees us,

732
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:33,531
she'll think I'm leading you in.

733
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,252
If I go ahead,
it means I'm leading you in?

734
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,332
But it was your idea to come.

735
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:37,971
You...

736
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:46,412
Yu.

737
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,171
You've ordered four dishes.
You want to order more?

738
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:51,772
Don't call me Yu.

739
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:53,051
Call me darling.

740
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:55,812
Darling.

741
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:05,011
What are you noting down?

742
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:07,252
Problems.

743
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,312
What problems?

744
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,772
Don't forget

745
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,011
why we came here, okay?

746
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,011
We're here to find issues for Huan.

747
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:20,932
Ms. Liu, your dishes.

748
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:22,571
Thank you.

749
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:23,491
Bran dough.

750
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:25,372
Sweet and sour ribs.

751
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,971
It's a hot dish. Why is it served first?

752
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,852
It should be served later.

753
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,611
You like sweet and sour ribs.

754
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:35,971
Try this.

755
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:37,528
Come on, have a taste.

756
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,372
Oh, my.

757
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:43,852
It's too sweet.

758
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,531
Get the Head Chef here.

759
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,611
Well,

760
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:50,051
you might not be accustomed to it.

761
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,571
Cui, go get him here.

762
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:53,451
Go ahead and bring him here.

763
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:54,212
Well...

764
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,531
- Fine.
- Go.

765
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,212
You try it.

766
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:00,011
Have a taste.

767
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:07,852
Mr. Cui, what's up?

768
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:10,212
Chenghuan, are you busy?

769
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,131
Is it convenient for you
to come to Xing'anli now?

770
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:15,491
Has something happened?

771
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,451
Not really.

772
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:20,171
Your mom is here.

773
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:22,451
I'll be right there.

774
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,571
Head Chef.

775
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,412
The sweet and sour ribs you cooked

776
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:35,692
are too sweet.

777
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,772
It's cloying.

778
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,372
- Just leave it.
- Authentic local dishes

779
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,571
must be sweet

780
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:43,011
to taste good.

781
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:44,451
I've been a cook for over 30 years.

782
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:46,772
When my master brought me here,

783
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,651
sweet and sour ribs tasted like this.

784
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:52,332
Locals have to queue up for it.

785
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,372
May I have your name?

786
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:55,611
Why should I tell you?

787
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,971
My name is Sugar,
as sweet as the sweet and sour ribs.

788
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:01,372
Mr. Sugar, let me tell you.

789
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,611
You are indeed behind the times.

790
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,611
In the service industry,

791
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,212
you must be customer-centered.

792
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:07,011
You have to be flexible.

793
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:08,372
If the diners are old,

794
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:09,852
don't put so much sugar in it.

795
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:11,491
It's not good for their health.

796
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:12,812
If the diners are young,

797
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:14,971
they have a sweet tooth,
so you can add more sugar.

798
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,372
This way, the business will thrive.

799
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:17,971
- Different amounts of sugar.
- Make way, please.

800
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,672
Different diners need
different amounts of sugar.

801
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:20,372
- That's it.
- Just stop.

802
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:20,971
Mom.

803
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:21,732
Mr. Li.

804
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,292
Mr. Li, what's going on?

805
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:24,772
Cui, I'm telling you.

806
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:25,971
I am not flexible.

807
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:27,011
I only know how to cook.

808
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:28,292
I don't care about anything else.

809
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,292
I'm not one for words.

810
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,292
Huan, here's the thing.

811
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,692
Today, we came

812
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:35,531
to help you find issues with Xing'anli.

813
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:37,091
I'm quite shocked

814
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:39,372
because I've found many issues.

815
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,051
Take the sweet and sour ribs
for instance.

816
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:43,091
This dish is too sweet and cloying.

817
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:45,131
- You ate the same dish I cooked.
- You...

818
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:46,292
He's not modest.

819
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,451
Mr. Li, here's the thing.

820
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:49,772
It's a misunderstanding.

821
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:51,051
My mom means well.

822
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,692
My mom makes

823
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,651
hot sweet and sour ribs,

824
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:56,611
while you make cold sweet and sour ribs.

825
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:57,611
She didn't know about that.

826
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,171
It's a misunderstanding.

827
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:00,932
Sorry about that.

828
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,772
A hotel provides comfortable rooms.

829
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,332
It should also serve good food.

830
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,171
I'm good at cooking.

831
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:09,651
I can help you with catering.

832
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:10,171
Mom.

833
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:12,292
Please don't interfere with my work.

834
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:12,812
Wait.

835
00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:15,096
How can you handle such a big hotel
by yourself?

836
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:17,464
Mom, you don't know how to run a hotel.

837
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,892
The notice for our house relocation
has already been issued.

838
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:24,892
Let's move out of the old house asap.

839
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,292
I will buy you a new house later.

840
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,011
Okay, we'll move as soon as possible.

841
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,091
You shut up.

842
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,651
If we move out...

843
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,451
Mom.

844
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,491
Grandma has left Xing'anli to me.

845
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:38,611
The old house was left to Yao Zhiming.

846
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,812
If we continue living in that house,

847
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:42,131
it would be inappropriate.

848
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:43,451
We have to move eventually.

849
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,932
Let's go home.

850
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:47,491
No rush.

851
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:50,451
My notebook.

852
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,732
I've noted down the issues
with the hotel.

853
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:55,292
Take a look when you have time.

854
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:55,892
Let's go.

855
00:42:55,892 --> 00:42:56,932
