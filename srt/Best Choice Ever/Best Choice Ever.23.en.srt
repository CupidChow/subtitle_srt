=Episode 23=

3
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:39,875
Ms. Zheng,
the driver is already downstairs.

4
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,634
Alright, we're leaving right away.

5
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,570
Ms. Zheng, are you available right now?

6
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:50,171
I'm about to catch a flight.
Is there something urgent?

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,531
May I take ten minutes of your time?

8
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,971
Then make it quick, please.

9
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,490
Ask the driver to wait for me.

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,091
Okay.

11
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,891
Sorry to take your time, Ms. Zheng.

12
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:03,210
Chenghuan, actually,
I've made it clear on the phone.

13
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,770
This time our business cooperation

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,531
has already been settled
with Botticelli.

15
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,290
How about we look for another chance
in the future.

16
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,850
Ms. Zheng, my visit this time

17
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,730
is not for that.

18
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,051
Last time I overheard you on the phone,

19
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,130
saying there seemed to be some issues
with the wedding venue and timing.

20
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,570
I wonder if the wedding venue
has been decided.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,651
Not yet. If it really doesn't work out,
we'll have to reschedule.

22
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,931
Then would you consider our hotel?

23
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,290
You mean Xing'anli?

24
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,251
Yes.

25
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,211
Actually, I noticed during my last visit
to your office

26
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,130
that you particularly like
the Shanghai style, the retro style.

27
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,730
This matches the style of Xing'anli

28
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,890
perfectly.

29
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,130
So I was thinking maybe

30
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,771
you also appreciate this style
for your wedding.

31
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,371
I do have a special fondness
for this style.

32
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,811
So is my mother.

33
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,531
She likes the afternoon tea
at Xing'anli.

34
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,130
That's great.

35
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,251
In fact, apart from
accommodation and dining,

36
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:53,531
the garden in Xing'anli

37
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:55,331
was maintained
by my grandma and her team

38
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:56,890
with years of dedicated care.

39
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,491
And the century-old Shikumen villa

40
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,811
at the back

41
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:01,170
is also very distinctive.

42
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,130
Most importantly,

43
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,651
there has never been
a public wedding in Xing'anli.

44
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,450
If you are willing to,

45
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,531
you will be the first one

46
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,371
to host a wedding in Xing'anli.

47
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:12,730
Frankly speaking,

48
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,331
choosing the wedding hotel
has been troubling me.

49
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:18,610
But, although I like the style
of Xing'anli,

50
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,371
as a wedding venue, it still is...

51
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,130
Ms. Zheng,

52
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,690
I won't take any more of your time.

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,290
This is the wedding plan
I've made specifically for you.

54
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,130
You can take a look on the way.

55
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,730
Then how about this?

56
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,850
When I return from business trip,

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,251
I'll visit Xing'anli.

58
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,450
That's great.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,491
You are welcome in Xing'anli
at any time.

60
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,890
What would you like to drink today?

61
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,730
Anything is fine.

62
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,371
Anything? Then let's have something
simple. Americano?

63
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,371
Okay.

64
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:58,971
Okay.

65
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,450
Well,

66
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,051
the wedding of Ms. Zheng
is just a one-time job, isn't it?

67
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,170
What's your plan
after it's all finished?

68
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:15,170
Let me ask you something.

69
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,531
What comes to mind
when you think of Capella?

70
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,930
Expensive.

71
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,930
When you think of the Peace Hotel,
you think of history.

72
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,410
Then, when you think of Xing'anli,

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,730
what do you think of?

74
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:26,891
Weddings?

75
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,531
Exactly, weddings.

76
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,531
And a wedding brings
not only the banquet,

77
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,331
but also accommodations and catering,

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,250
even many embedded brands.

79
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,290
Your idea is pretty good.

80
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,131
When I got married,

81
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,211
in such a big city as Shanghai,

82
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:45,691
I couldn't find a hotel
that I was satisfied with.

83
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:47,730
Either the food was not made with care,

84
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,691
or it was full of overpriced dishes,

85
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,730
all flashy and ostentatious.

86
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,290
Then there was the venue, decorated
in a particularly tacky manner,

87
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,290
seeming quite cramped.

88
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,250
It wouldn't do.

89
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,451
So, what I'm doing

90
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,730
is a small opening with a grand vision.

91
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,331
I want to make the first big splash
for weddings at Xing'anli.

92
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,131
In the future,

93
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:05,531
as soon as the locals think of weddings,

94
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,050
the first hotel that'll come to mind
will be my Xing'anli.

95
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:09,131
I think that'll work.

96
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,930
There's not much I can help you here,

97
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,091
but I can certainly provide
enough coffee.

98
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,930
How come you can't help me?

99
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:21,131
You can offer me some practical help.

100
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,250
What kind of practical help?

101
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,131
Your hands.

102
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,850
Mao,

103
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,531
I promised Ms. Zheng to make

104
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,170
a comprehensive customized plan for her.

105
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,290
As you know,

106
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,050
the jewelry accessories
for the wedding dress are important.

107
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,170
Ms. Zheng likes independent brands.

108
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:38,331
The clothes she wears

109
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,331
are some botanical brands
we've never heard of.

110
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,971
And her husband is an artist.

111
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,651
I think big brands

112
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:46,250
mostly wouldn't catch their eye.

113
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,250
Now I can only rely on you, Mao.

114
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,891
Got it. It seems like I have to do it.

115
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,211
Alright, leave it to me.

116
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,170
When is the deadline?

117
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,131
No rush. I'll come get it tomorrow.

118
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,730
Tomorrow?

119
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,331
You really are my bestie.

120
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:04,250
Tomorrow?

121
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:06,331
Is that okay?

122
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,651
Alright.

123
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,810
Okay.

124
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,050
I knew it.

125
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:14,531
Mao, you are the best!

126
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:29,971
What is this? What did I draw?

127
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,250
That's not right.

128
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,891
I can't draw it.

129
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,050
What's wrong?

130
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,370
I don't have time to attend to you.

131
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,651
Make yourself at home.

132
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,730
What is this drawing?

133
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,331
Your sister took on
a wedding customization,

134
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,451
and she handed the jewelry design
over to me.

135
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,490
Tight deadline, heavy task.

136
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,170
I can't let her down, can I?

137
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,531
How should I draw it?

138
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,930
Stop drawing.

139
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,691
If I don't draw, will you?

140
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,930
Let's go.

141
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:29,971
Where to?

142
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,370
Change the environment
and look for inspiration.

143
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,410
It's raining so heavily.

144
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,050
Did you bring me out
to find inspiration or get drenched?

145
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,771
I want to go back.

146
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,730
Can you give me the time of one song?

147
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,850
This is my reserved song.

148
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,730
Especially good. Give it a try.

149
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,410
I'll do it myself.

150
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,050
Wait a moment.

151
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:25,771
Not bad.

00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,370
If you are willing to,

186
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,650
your wedding can be held here
when the time comes.

187
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:03,971
Huan.

188
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,890
It's pretty good.

189
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,610
You've come just in time.

190
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,971
Ms. Zheng, let me introduce to you.

191
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,730
This is my friend, Mao Yongxin.

192
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,971
- Hello, Ms. Zheng.
- She's a jewelry designer.

193
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,770
She has her own independent brand.

194
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,650
I asked her

195
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,451
to design your wedding jewelry.

196
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,971
Yes, Ms. Zheng. I must show you.

197
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,730
After Huan told me about you,

198
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,931
I think pearls should be chosen
for the main ornament.

199
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:25,931
Please take a look.

200
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,571
Because pearls symbolize health

201
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,971
and pure love.

202
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,890
I'll embellish it with some diamonds

203
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,650
and platinum for the match.

204
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,051
When it's finished,

205
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:36,250
it will look even better.

206
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,171
Chenghuan,

207
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,250
the big event of my life

208
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:53,650
is in your hands now.

209
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,490
Ms. Zheng, you mean

210
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:00,490
you're entrusting your wedding
to Xing'anli?

211
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,331
To be honest,

212
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,291
I've started to look forward to it.

213
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,411
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

214
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,250
We will definitely not disappoint you.

215
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,650
Mr. Cui,

216
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,211
please take Ms. Zheng to our kitchen

217
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,130
and select some of
our signature afternoon tea treats.

218
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,130
You can have a taste on your way back.

219
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,411
Please tell me which one you like.

220
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:18,490
Then we can use that for the wedding.

221
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:19,691
You really understand me.

222
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,250
I hate wasting time the most.

223
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,691
Ms. Zheng, this way please.

224
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,971
Thank you.

225
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,331
She likes it.

226
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:29,850
The first order.

227
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,490
We made it.

228
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,490
We are awesome.

229
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,010
I think

230
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,451
Ms. Zheng quite likes the jewelry
you designed.

231
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:46,051
Are you kidding?
Don't I do the best independent designs?

232
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:48,971
Zao.

233
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,530
Why are you here? Didn't you go to work?

234
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,211
Well,

235
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,730
it's your big day.

236
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,451
I came to cheer you on.

237
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,250
Wait a second.

238
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,610
What's up with your hair?

239
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,091
Why have the same style as Yao Zhiming?

240
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:05,931
Where did you get it?

241
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,650
Stop. I went to see a client today.

242
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,091
That's very important.
So I tidied up a bit.

243
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,850
Really? What kind of client?

244
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,850
Well, Huan, why don't you go ahead
and get busy?

245
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,250
It's okay. I'm not busy.

246
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,411
It's fine. You can go ahead.

247
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:23,530
I'm really not busy.

248
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,451
Not busy?

249
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:31,451
Really not busy.

250
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:43,130
I am busy.

251
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:45,091
Yes, I am busy.

252
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,331
I'll go check on the dining hall.

253
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:49,530
I'll go with you.

254
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,171
No need. Stay here.

255
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,130
Zao, take good care of Mao.

256
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,650
See you.

257
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,250
You actually came here?

258
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,451
What if your sister finds out?

259
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,610
She'll know as she does.

260
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,890
She'll know sooner or later anyway.

261
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,610
Let's go. Come on.

262
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,931
What is this?

263
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,571
Open it and see for yourself.

264
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,571
Well,

265
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,971
Chenghuan really has something
in her mind.

266
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,250
(Xing'anli Hotel Wedding Invitation)

267
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,091
When she can't compete
in business reception,

268
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,890
she quickly secured Ms. Zheng's wedding.

269
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,331
Just something she would do.

270
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:39,451
Don't worry what she'd do.

271
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,250
What now? Are you going to the wedding?

272
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,850
Of course. It's a joyous event.

273
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,291
What about the cash gift?

274
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,250
Of course, it's on you.

275
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,091
Why did I bother to ask?

276
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:03,650
It's really nice.

277
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,891
Ms. Zheng, the jewelry really suits you.

278
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,050
It looks really beautiful
when paired this way.

279
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,211
Thank you, Chenghuan.

280
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,651
It is truly memorable today.
I'm very happy.

281
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:13,770
As long as you're satisfied.

282
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,371
If you're ready,

283
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,090
we can now head to the lawn.

284
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,290
Then let's go.

285
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,250
This way.

286
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,891
Let's go.

287
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,770
Mr. Cui, the bride has gone to the lawn.

288
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,931
Please prepare the cold dishes.
They can be served now.

289
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,451
I'm going down right now.

290
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:32,770
Congratulations.

291
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:36,651
You're late with the congratulations.
The bride has already left.

292
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,290
It's you I'm congratulating.

293
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,371
Precise differentiation.

294
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,770
Your mind works fast, doesn't it?

295
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,530
If you're congratulating me,
shouldn't you show it somehow?

296
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,050
Sure.

297
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,131
Then I'll treat you to meals more often
in the future.

298
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,131
Okay.

299
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,530
Speaking of meals, I have to thank you.

300
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,570
Thanks to the meal
you treated me to last time.

301
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,891
It gave me a great idea.

302
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,290
I never thought
that the lawn at Xing'anli

303
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,931
could look like this.

304
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,851
If Grandma could see it,

305
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,050
she would definitely be happy.

306
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,050
Yes, indeed.

307
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,851
I heard from Sherry,

308
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,891
your boss gave you
a very important task.

309
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,090
It's related to Xing'anli, right?

310
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,250
I can manage it.

311
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,931
If it really is related to Xing'anli,

312
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:28,530
don't worry about me.

313
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,490
Just be at ease and do your job well.

314
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,050
Why are you taking photos of us?

315
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,570
Sorry, Miss Mai.

316
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,891
The lighting is quite good

317
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,971
and your outfits really match well,

318
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,770
so I couldn't help but take a photo.

319
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:50,451
Is that so?

320
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,931
Let us have a look.

321
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,008
Everyone,
you can stop what you're doing.

322
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:11,651
Take a break and have some watermelon.

323
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,490
Come on.

324
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,770
It's for everyone.

325
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,010
Come on, it's time for watermelon.

326
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,010
Miss Mai's brought watermelon.

327
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,171
Come on, everyone can enjoy it.

328
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,691
- Thank you, Miss Mai.
- Come on.

329
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,490
- Thank you, Miss Mai.
- Not at all. It's for everyone.

330
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,810
Come on, it's time for watermelon.

331
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:23,891
Come on. Have some watermelon.

332
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,290
There's more.

333
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,971
Eat up. There's more.

334
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:27,931
Have some more.

335
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,891
The guests have left.
Why are you still here?

336
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,891
I want some watermelon too.

337
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,611
I'll cut another one for you.

338
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,330
Mr. Cui, let me do it.
You can have a rest.

339
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,131
Watch your hands.

340
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,090
Want some watermelon?

341
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:01,090
Why aren't you eating?
Do you dislike my knife skills?

342
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:02,530
Or you think this one isn't tasty?

343
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,131
No, that's not it.

344
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,330
I'm just curious about something.

345
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,050
When you eat watermelon,

346
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,330
do you always
start with the middle part?

347
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,691
Of course, how else would you eat it?

348
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,651
The middle part is the sweetest,

349
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,810
and it's a ritual in eating watermelon.

350
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,570
When I was young,

351
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,691
my dad would bring home
a big watermelon.

352
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,250
Then my mom would cut it
from the middle,

353
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,050
half each for my brother and me.

354
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:30,090
We would eat
until our bellies got so big.

355
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:33,611
When I was little,

356
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,490
if I started with the middle
of the watermelon,

357
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:37,971
I would get a beating

358
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,931
and be called selfish.

359
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:43,971
But now,

360
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,371
it's different.

361
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,611
Someone else will prepare it

362
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,810
and bring it over to me.

363
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,530
Now, no one calls you selfish anymore.
Go ahead and eat.

364
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:13,451
Is it sweet?

365
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:15,891
Help yourself.

366
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,570
It's really sweet.

367
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,770
Why do you keep shooting
from the same angle?

368
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,250
I want to see if it's good.

369
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,050
Later.

370
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,411
- Let me see.
- Nope.

371
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,290
Great photographer,
you've worked hard today.

372
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:02,211
Come on.

373
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:07,211
Tasty.

374
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:08,931
I'll have one myself.

375
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,570
I spilled it on my shoe.

376
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,330
Stop.

377
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,730
I'm all flustered.

378
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,770
Aren't these accessories
mainly for everyday wear?

379
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,730
It's pretty nice.

380
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,851
Really? Are you serious?

381
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:22,570
Really.

382
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,371
Let me see.

383
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,691
It looks quite natural.

384
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,530
Not bad, right?

385
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:29,656
It's good.

386
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,050
Huan.

387
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,651
Tired, aren't you?

388
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,971
I'm fine.

389
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,371
Where's Mao? Why didn't she come today?

390
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,931
She took on a job
and was quite in a hurry.

391
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,770
I had no idea about it.

392
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:02,171
You know better than I do now.

393
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,050
Huan, did the wedding go well today?

394
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,971
Quite well.

395
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:21,411
Your hairstyle today...

396
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,530
Met clients again?

397
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,971
Yes, exactly.

398
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,330
The same one as last time.

399
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,810
Pretty good.

400
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,611
By the way, Huan.

401
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:35,411
You mentioned that house
you went to check on last time.

402
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,810
Mom and Dad liked it a lot.

403
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,611
But Mom still wants to ask you in person

404
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:40,971
what kind of layout they should choose.

405
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,451
I'm okay with any. Let them decide.

406
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:45,010
If they like it, just buy it.

407
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,131
So they can be at ease sooner.

408
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,010
Okay.

409
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,931
Then, Huan, you get some rest.
I'm leaving.

410
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,530
Zao,

411
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:00,490
actually I wanted to tell you.

412
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,810
You're handsome with this hairstyle.

413
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,490
Keep it up.

414
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,290
Laitian,

415
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,810
time to go.

416
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:29,730
Still making tea? Come on.

417
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,090
Get changed. We need to go now.

418
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:32,851
I'll make you some black tea.

419
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:34,090
Shouldn't we go in the afternoon?

420
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,171
It's still early now.

421
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:36,131
Let's go early.

422
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,290
What if others buy it first?

423
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,451
Hurry, hurry.

424
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,010
You can drink it when you come back.

425
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,171
- Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.
- This...

426
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:42,730
Morning.

427
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:45,171
Yao,

428
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,530
I want to tell you something.

429
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,891
Today, we

430
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:50,371
are planning to buy an apartment.

431
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,050
If we choose the right one,

432
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:54,411
we might move out of here.

433
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,010
Then we won't have to
trouble you anymore.

434
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,131
Here's the situation.

435
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:59,611
Huan is providing the money

436
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,330
to help us buy a place downtown.

437
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,371
Mr. Yao,

438
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:05,611
in the past few days,

439
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:07,810
we really caused you trouble.

440
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,651
Thank you.

441
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:11,211
Don't mention it.

442
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,330
Hurry up.

443
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,250
Turn it off.
You can drink it when you come back.

444
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,330
- This is...
- Turn it off.

445
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,651
It's always at a crucial moment...

446
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,931
In today's brief morning meeting,

447
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,530
I want to say a few words to everyone.

448
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,010
Through everyone's concerted efforts
these days,

449
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,691
our wedding debut

450
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,131
was very successful.

451
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,010
Thank you all.

452
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,010
I believe you all have guessed already

453
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,611
that we will develop
the wedding business in the future.

454
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:42,250
Therefore, your current positions

455
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,411
as well as responsibilities

456
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,971
will all undergo corresponding changes.

457
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,411
Later, I will select
an on-site wedding planning company

458
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:51,131
to help us become more standardized.

459
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:52,570
So currently,

460
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,730
the wedding department

461
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,411
will be temporarily managed by Mr. Cui.

462
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,131
Next, you can volunteer yourselves

463
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:00,451
to take on this challenge.

464
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:01,891
Does anyone want to give it a try?

465
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:03,971
Well...

466
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,810
Boss.

467
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:06,730
Liao Gang, do you want to give it a try?

468
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:07,931
I want to resign.

469
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,411
Resign?

470
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,770
- Boss.
- Boss.

471
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,451
- Us too.
- Us too.

472
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,810
Liao Gang, what nonsense
are you talking about?

473
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,810
And you two. What are you doing?

474
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,851
I'd like to hear your reasons.

475
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,090
Then

476
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:24,810
I'll be frank.

477
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,010
This wedding customization business

478
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,090
is highly volatile.

479
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,050
In the end,

480
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,651
it may not be profitable.

481
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,931
We were doing well working
at the hotel originally.

482
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,050
And now?

483
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,810
Just like an old ox,

484
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,971
- Right.
- having to work overtime every day.

485
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:42,530
Not to mention the heavy workload,

486
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,090
the salary is still the same as before.

487
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,010
Exactly.

488
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,411
You mentioned

489
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,611
the bonus.

490
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:49,651
I've inquired about it too.

491
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:52,530
It seems we won't get it
until the end of the year.

492
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,050
We can't wait that long.

493
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,411
So we want to resign.

494
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:56,371
No problem, right?

495
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:56,891
Exactly.

496
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:58,171
Indeed, there is no bonus yet.

497
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,810
Now we even lost our days off in lieu.

498
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,290
Right?

499
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,770
A lot of work for little pay.
What's the point?

500
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,730
We won't make money at the cost
of our lives.

501
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,010
Exactly.

502
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,010
Isn't it?

503
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,611
How do we do it?

504
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,730
Okay, no problem at all.

505
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,211
This industry

506
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,971
is inherently free and transparent.

507
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:17,530
If anyone wants to leave,

508
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,730
I will not stop you.

509
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,010
I believe in the potential of Xing'anli.

510
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,171
I also believe
that the remaining colleagues

511
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:24,810
share the same thoughts as me.

512
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,232
We are comrade-in-arms.

513
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,411
When faced with issues,

514
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,010
we can discuss and solve them together.

515
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,411
We won't quit easily.

516
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,211
We've just fought
a very beautiful battle

517
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,171
and found out footing.

518
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:40,570
The most difficult times have passed.

519
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,131
Next,

520
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,010
in your salaries,

521
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:46,171
you will see my commitment.

522
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,211
For those who want to leave,

523
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,411
if you have a better place to go,

524
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:51,651
I'll gladly part with you.

525
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:52,856
I also wish you

526
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,851
better development than at Xing'anli.

527
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,490
So much for the meeting.
We're dismissed.

528
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,730
Gang, what should we do?

529
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,891
Chenghuan.

530
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:18,171
Mr. Cui, it's okay.
You don't need to comfort me.

531
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,770
I understand it all.

532
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,131
Actually they don't really
want to leave.

533
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,371
They are just questioning me.

534
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,931
But I also know
that the matter of salaries

535
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,530
must be put on the agenda immediately.

536
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:30,931
After all, for us,

537
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,770
the most crucial thing now
is to keep our crew.

538
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,931
Although the poisoning incident
has been clarified,

539
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:40,451
it still caused some impact

540
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,611
on our guests,

541
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,131
leading to our income last month

542
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:45,371
not being as good as before.

543
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,851
The first wedding

544
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,971
was also earning a reputation at a loss,

545
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,530
just to make a bit of a name.

546
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,651
As for the next investments,

547
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,770
we've just taken out another loan
from the bank.

548
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:56,530
But where can we

549
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,371
get so much money in a short term?

550
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,290
Mr. Cui.

551
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,411
I can fill the public account
with the money

552
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,090
for our new apartment.

553
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:11,290
No, this won't do.

554
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,090
You're taking the money
for your apartment

555
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,371
to raise our pay.

556
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:15,810
I'm absolutely against it.

557
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,931
It's because
I didn't manage my team well.

558
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:18,851
I should take the blame.

559
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:20,770
Mr. Cui, don't say that.

560
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:23,371
Since I've already taken over
from Grandma

561
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,810
to manage Xing'anli,

562
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,651
it's my responsibility.

563
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:28,171
I must face it,

564
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:29,810
and must also solve this issue.

565
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:33,891
Mr. Cui, don't worry.
Let's think of a solution together.

566
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,730
Mr. Yao, this is Cui.

567
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,891
Although I am an employee of the hotel,

568
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,131
I'm still your elder, after all.

569
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,651
I venture to give you a piece of advice.

570
00:29:58,411 --> 00:29:59,851
As for the ownership of Xing'anli,

571
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,250
even if you are dissatisfied,

572
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,971
it was Ms. Chen's decision.

573
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,090
You have to accept it.

574
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:06,611
Could you not press Chenghuan too hard?

575
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,090
What's the matter?

576
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,050
You're relentlessly pursuing Xing'anli,

577
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,250
and the employees here
are clamoring for a raise.

578
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,211
Chenghuan plans
to pay everyone's salaries

579
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:17,371
with the money for her apartment.

580
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,691
I got it.

581
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,730
(Today, we are planning
to buy an apartment.)

582
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,131
If we choose the right one,

583
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,730
we won't have to trouble you anymore.

584
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,810
Huan is providing the money

585
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,451
to help us buy a place downtown.

586
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,371
Where are you going, Mr. Yao?

587
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:44,010
This is our main type of house model.

588
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,770
Is your sister really not coming today?

589
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,730
Mom,

590
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,131
Huan is really busy with work.

591
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:53,770
She can't make the time these days.

592
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,371
But she said,

593
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:56,651
if you find something you like,

594
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,730
go ahead and make the decision.

595
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,770
She has no objections.

596
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,010
Well...

597
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,250
She must be busy.

598
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,010
It's fine if she can't come,
as long as we feel her good intentions.

599
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,371
Hello, Huan.

600
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,730
Zao,

601
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:21,971
I want to tell you something.

602
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,570
Has something happened to Xing'anli?

603
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,371
Nothing has happened. It's just that...

604
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:30,451
Xing'anli has recently encountered
some financial issues.

605
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:33,010
Could you discuss with Mom and Dad

606
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,010
and see if we can
postpone buying the apartment?

607
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,770
I know Mom and Dad
would definitely be disappointed.

608
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,371
Right now,

609
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:42,931
I indeed am facing some difficulties.

610
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,330
But tell them

611
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,770
I will definitely help them
buy an apartment later.

612
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,050
Once I deal with these matters at hand,

613
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,570
I will explain it to them
when I get home.

614
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,131
Huan, I know you.

615
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,770
You must have your difficulties,

616
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,851
right?

617
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,171
As for Mom and Dad,

618
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,171
don't worry, I'll talk to them.

619
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:04,810
Thank you, Zao.

620
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,971
Why? Why not buy it then?

621
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,851
She didn't even give us any reason.

622
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:19,010
Look at her now.

623
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,451
She won't come.

624
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:22,131
She doesn't consult me about anything.

625
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,651
I thought if we bought an apartment,

626
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,971
you all could come back home.

627
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:27,770
Well, that's fallen through again.

628
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,211
Wanyu, Huan must have her difficulties.

629
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,371
We need to understand and respect her.

630
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:33,931
Haven't I respected her enough?

631
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,770
She changes her mind every day.

632
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,371
Today, we can't buy the apartment.

633
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,211
Tomorrow, the old house
is not available.

634
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,770
Always making me anxious.
I can't even sleep well.

635
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,810
Mom, I also asked Huan.

636
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,851
But she also said,

637
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:47,131
it's not that we wouldn't buy it.

638
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,451
We'll just buy it later.

639
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,371
She didn't say not to.

640
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:51,770
Who can still believe her?

641
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:52,931
I'm telling you,

642
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,090
I don't want to rent an apartment.

643
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,211
I don't want it.

644
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:56,290
I'm not going anywhere.

645
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,010
I'll go back to my old house.

646
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,411
Let the rice cooker explode again.

647
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,611
Let the fridge leak again.

648
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,611
- Mrs. Mai.
- Let my feet...

649
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,691
Mr. Mai.

650
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,131
What are you doing here?

651
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:07,171
I came to pick you up.

652
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:11,290
The rent you paid hasn't expired yet.

653
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,611
Then just stay there for now.
We can talk about other things later.

654
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:17,050
Let's go. We're going home.

655
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:17,570
Okay.

656
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,211
Let's go.

657
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,451
Thank you.

658
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,330
And room cleaning.

659
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,010
I've mentioned it many times before.

660
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,010
- Our towels need to be sorted out...
- Huan.

661
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:26,730
You can go ahead.

662
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:31,411
How is it, Zao? Are Mom and Dad okay?

663
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:32,971
Mom and Dad have been settled in.

664
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,530
I want to ask you,

665
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,770
what exactly happened at Xing'anli?

666
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,050
There's nothing to worry about.

667
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,530
It's just that right now,

668
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,611
it's hard to have the best of both.

669
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:47,371
Don't I know you well?

670
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,931
If you had other choices,

671
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,211
you definitely wouldn't do this.

672
00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:53,171
By the way,

673
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:56,211
Yao Zhiming came to pick up Mom and Dad.

674
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,810
He even made sure
they'd live in that old house.

675
00:33:58,891 --> 00:33:59,770
Yao Zhiming?

676
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,171
Why did he go there?

677
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:03,770
I don't know.

678
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,171
But he came just in time.

679
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,251
Yao Zhiming

680
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,130
keeps helping us over and over again.

681
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,210
Does he have feelings...

682
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,371
You have been quite talkative lately.

683
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,610
Have you eaten? If not,
I'll take you to the dining hall.

684
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,610
Let's go.

685
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,371
Haven't gone to bed yet?

686
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,130
Is it because of the apartment?

687
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,371
Are you still angry?

688
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,650
I believe

689
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,570
Huan must have her difficulties.

690
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,170
She must have encountered some issue.

691
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,971
Perhaps Xing'anli

692
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:02,371
is just waiting to use the money.

693
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,771
You see,

694
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,771
as Huan's parents,

695
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,771
we should be more understanding of her.

696
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:11,331
Don't you think so?

697
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,210
If she has difficulties,
she should tell me.

698
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:19,811
She doesn't tell me anything,

699
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,251
becoming more and more distant from me.

700
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,771
She's just afraid

701
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,971
that you'd worry about her.

702
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:29,251
Besides,

703
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:31,411
even if she told you,
you couldn't conjure up the money

704
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,731
to help her.

705
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,530
I can't indeed.

706
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,610
But if we move out,

707
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,451
we still need a place to live, right?

708
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,411
So we would have to rent a place.

709
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:42,570
That requires money for the rent,

710
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,251
and the agency fees.

711
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,971
Isn't that another large sum of money?

712
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:49,210
Doesn't that mean
we're even less able to move out?

713
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,971
But

714
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,530
Yao really surprised me.

715
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,170
Actually, he's a pretty good kid.

716
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,811
Yes.

717
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:11,570
He's just a boy, alone.

718
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,811
Actually, it's not easy for him.

719
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,010
Quite pitiful.

720
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,251
Let's be nicer to him.

721
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,291
Mom,

722
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:11,731
I want to talk to you
about our new house.

723
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:15,650
You scared me to death.

724
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,811
You could have just greeted me.
Why did you poke me?

725
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,210
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you going inside?

726
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,451
I'm just

727
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:25,851
strolling around.

728
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,891
And you?

729
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,570
You just came back from running?

730
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:39,971
I heard from Zao today.

731
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,130
Why did you
suddenly go to the sales office?

732
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,210
Mr. Cui called me

733
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,650
and complained to me a lot.

734
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,411
Mr. Cui, he really shouldn't have...

735
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:52,971
You don't have to worry.

736
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,130
This...

737
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,610
Just pretend he never called you.

738
00:37:56,891 --> 00:37:57,851
Don't worry,

739
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,610
I will definitely come up
with a better solution

740
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,451
to get my parents to move out
as soon as possible.

741
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:02,331
It's okay.

742
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,130
Do you think taking over Xing'anli

743
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,771
and having your parents live in my house

744
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:07,851
would be too much?

745
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,210
I just feel

746
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,291
people like me

747
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:15,851
who just got a sudden windfall

748
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,411
shouldn't repeatedly

749
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:18,731
accept help from others.

750
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:20,690
But Tang Sanzang

751
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,690
also needs Sun Wukong
to help fight monsters.

752
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,451
This analogy you're making...

753
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,130
So that makes you a monkey?

754
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:31,090
If you prefer, I can be Zhu Bajie?

755
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,050
Zhu Bajie does resemble you.

756
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,891
Alright, no more joking around.

757
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:41,851
Thank you for today.

758
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,731
This is our newly developed milk tea
from Xing'anli.

759
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,251
Consider it a thank-you gift.

760
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,891
I don't want it.

761
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,731
Why? You dislike it?

762
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:51,490
Yep.

763
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,891
How would I know
if it's for your mom or for me?

764
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,931
Then how should I thank you?

765
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:02,851
Tomorrow, come fishing with me.

766
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:04,971
Fishing with you?

767
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,771
I didn't quite understand
the guidebook you gave me last time.

768
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,971
I need you to personally
instruct me on-site.

769
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,050
How am I supposed to instruct you?

770
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,291
I bought that book online.

771
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,170
Well, I don't care.

772
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,291
I'll pick you up at nine o'clock
tomorrow morning.

773
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:14,690
(Miss Mai.)

774
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,891
(The photos I took last time are ready.
I will send them to you.)

775
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:32,792
Mao.

776
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,210
Hello, Huan. What's up?

777
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,570
Yao Zhiming

778
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,331
has asked me to go fishing
with him tomorrow.

779
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,851
That's quite a move.

780
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:41,210
He's trying to win you over.

781
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,891
So, are you going?

782
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:45,891
I'll go. Why not?

783
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,490
I really want to see

784
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:49,251
what big moves
he still has up his sleeve.

785
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:50,490
Tell me if you need anything.

786
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:54,170
Mrs. Mai.

787
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:55,891
What are you doing here?

788
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:57,090
I'm waiting for you.

789
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,451
Waiting for me?

790
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:01,130
Thank you for being so generous today

791
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:04,130
and for letting us stay in this house.

792
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,050
There's no need to thank me.
It's only right.

793
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,090
Shall we add each other on WeChat?

794
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:11,451
WeChat?

795
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,530
Yes. If we add each other on WeChat,

796
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,170
you can tell me what you like to eat

797
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,570
and what you need at home

798
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,811
in advance.

799
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,570
And I'll have it all sorted
before you come back.

800
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:22,210
Okay, but I don't have my phone
with me right now.

801
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,800
I'll have Mr. Mai forward it
to you in a bit.

802
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,368
Okay.

803
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:26,891
I also wanted to ask you

804
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:29,050
if you have a girlfriend.

805
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,650
I haven't considered that yet.

806
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,690
You should think about it.
You're not getting any younger.

807
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,771
There's another benefit
if we add each other on WeChat.

808
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:40,952
Do you know what it is?

809
00:41:40,952 --> 00:41:42,130
What?

810
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,050
Make a guess.

811
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:47,851
After we add each other on WeChat,

812
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:49,690
I can send photos of good girls

813
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,650
to you to choose from.

814
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,050
You see if you like them.

815
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:53,851
- Mrs. Mai.
- I'll...

816
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:54,650
Well...

817
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,331
Thank you, but I really don't need it.

818
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,931
Young man,
it's time to consider about it.

819
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,291
Go to sleep early.

820
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:01,931
Okay.

821
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:04,050
Don't forget to approve my request.

822
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:05,650
I'm off to bed.

823
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,050
What's the matter?
What are you looking at?

824
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,090
It's nothing.

825
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:31,610
Then let's go.

826
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,530
Let's go.

827
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:34,130
Huan.

828
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:36,690
Dad.

829
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,592
Huan.

830
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:39,931
Where are you guys going?

831
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,170
Zao, you're here too.

832
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,650
You...

833
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,872
It's weekend. Dad don't work today.
I'm going fishing with Dad.

834
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,891
Mom isn't coming too, is she?

835
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,090
How would your mom go fishing?

836
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:53,490
Fear of sunburn.

837
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:57,050
