00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:30,008
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:32,619
Mr. Mai and Mrs. Mai.

4
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,819
This restaurant has
special dishes every day.

5
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,060
I'll go and take a look for you.

6
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,739
Yes, this restaurant has
a minimum charge requirement.

7
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:40,780
Most people order set menus,

8
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,500
but they don't have the Donghai
yellow croaker in the set menu,

9
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,860
which is my brother
and mother's favorite,

10
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,660
so we'll just order a la carte.

11
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh right, Chenghuan,

12
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,580
would you mind ordering the dishes?

13
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,580
Okay, I'll go and order.

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,099
Huan, I'll go with you.

15
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,060
Huan.

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,739
Don't take to heart what she says.

17
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,300
Pregnancy makes her stupid.

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,580
Her mind isn't functioning well.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,899
They have many special dishes every day

20
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,100
and let's order all of them.

21
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,260
No, you don't need to do that.

22
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,140
That won't do.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,260
Our family places great
importance on this meal.

24
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,179
- Hello.
- Hello.

25
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,300
Can I see the menu?

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,140
Thank you.

27
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,459
Take a look.

28
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,939
Huadiao wine-steamed crab.

29
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,219
Everyone, let's dig in.

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,020
Okay.

31
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,659
I'd like to say a few words.

32
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,420
Well,

33
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,739
today is the first meeting
between our two families.

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,059
Thank you, Mrs. Xin,

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,499
for putting so much effort in it

36
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,899
and booking such a nice restaurant.

37
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,260
Look, it's so beautiful outside.

38
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:00,980
This must be quite expensive.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,860
I, I humbly represent myself,

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,499
no, our whole family,

41
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,580
and extend our

42
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,659
sincere gratitude to you.

43
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,739
Not at all, you're too kind.

44
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,140
- Cheers, together.
- Of course.

45
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,260
Come on.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,580
Thank you. Come on.

47
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:32,619
Mai Chenghuan is the apple
of both her mother's and my eye.

48
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,020
She's been smart and sensible
since she was little.

49
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,020
She never fights
or scrambles for anything.

50
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,739
She has a nice character.

51
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,059
So the greatest wish

52
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:47,659
of her mother and me is for Huan

53
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,820
to be happy and joyful.

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,140
You have a daughter too, right?

55
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm sure you would understand

56
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:58,140
our feelings.

57
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,380
Come on.

58
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,380
I'll toast to you again.

59
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,020
Thank you.

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,459
Don't drink that much.

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,140
Okay.

62
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,620
Come on, let's dig in.

63
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,180
Okay.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,820
Dig in.

65
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,140
Come, have a taste.

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,020
This restaurant is really good.

67
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,419
Mrs. Xin,

68
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,700
her father and I

69
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,620
are not that capable.

70
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,380
We're just an ordinary family.

71
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,779
But our daughter Huan

72
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,700
is truly a good child.

73
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,740
Having lived to my age, I've seen

74
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,979
very few children as good as her.

75
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:46,099
She's mature and never makes us worry.

76
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,820
Do you know why we named

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,620
her Chenghuan?

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,779
Because we wanted her
to always stay by our side.

79
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,260
But I know

80
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,620
that when a girl grows up,

81
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,060
she will get married.

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
It's hard to let go, really.

83
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,140
After she marries into your family,

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,740
she will be your daughter.

85
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,140
I will entrust her to you then.

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,339
Come on, let's eat.

87
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,020
Come on.

88
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,659
It will get cold soon.

89
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,459
Let's dig in.

90
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,020
Mr. Mai and Mrs. Mai.

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,380
Rest assured.

92
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,299
I will definitely be good to Huan.

93
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,940
I will make her happy.

94
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:23,859
- Jialiang is a good child too, right?
- Yes, yes.

95
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,580
I wish you and Huan happiness.

96
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,979
- Come on.
- Alright. Mr. Mai.

97
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:32,459
Hey.

98
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,140
Slow down.

99
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,140
Mr. Mai.

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,299
Red wine should be savored slowly.

101
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:39,099
This isn't your old yellow wine.

102
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,180
Your downing it in one gulp
doesn't look very good.

103
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,380
Jiali, you are the younger generation,
aren't you?

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,659
You can't criticize
your elders like that.

105
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,899
Let me tell you,

106
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,659
even if you're right,
you're already half wrong.

107
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,180
Mrs. Mai.

108
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,060
This is a democratic society

109
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,180
where everyone is considered equal.

110
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,620
In our family,

111
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,219
if our mom and dad do something wrong,

112
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,380
Jialiang and I can point it out.

113
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,380
Of course,

114
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,659
there might still be some small families

115
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,260
who prefer something like

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,979
'What the parents say goes'.

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,060
It's understandable.

118
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,299
Steamed big yellow croaker.

119
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:24,459
Thank you.

120
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,180
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, please have a taste.

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,979
This is their special
and it's delicious.

122
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:31,979
Try it, try it.

123
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,459
Come on, eat up, eat.

124
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:41,779
Come on, have a taste.

125
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,380
Thank you.

126
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,260
What's the matter? Are you okay?

127
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,140
Go get some water.

128
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,659
Here you go.

129
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,260
I'm fine, I just coughed.

130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,620
Dad.

131
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,260
I choked.

132
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,979
Slow down, slow down.

133
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,219
- Jialiang.
- Be careful.

134
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,859
You're a grownup now.

135
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,180
You can't be anxious like some people.

136
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,060
I'm sure you know

137
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,219
how to eat this fish.

138
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,779
It's to be eaten like this.

139
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,740
Such a delicious fish

140
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,500
shouldn't be wasted.

141
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,339
What's your problem?

142
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,299
They know how to cook a fish dish.

143
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,859
I've heard

144
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,620
that even the tail
of this fish is very tasty.

145
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:25,620
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, come on.

146
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,219
Would you like to try it?

147
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,260
Although the fishtail has less meat,

148
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,740
the meat is very tender.

149
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,820
In Shanghai, we have a famous dish

150
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,260
called 'Braised in Brown Sauce'.

151
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,260
I'll try the taste of this fishtail.

152
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,659
Sis, leave the fishtail for me.

153
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,180
Eating fishtails brings smooth sailing.

154
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,140
I've recently graduated
and am looking for a job.

155
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,659
Guys, please humor me.

156
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,500
Mrs. Xin.

157
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,659
What are your thoughts

158
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,020
on Jialiang and Huan's wedding?

159
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,620
We are all parents of the new era.

160
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,539
Let the children decide for themselves.

161
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,620
Letting the children decide?

162
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,059
How will that work?

163
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,740
As parents, we should help them
with the arrangements.

164
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,939
Mrs. Mai, do you have any ideas?

165
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
You can share them.

166
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,260
I don't have many ideas.

167
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,100
Well,

168
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,500
her father has relatives
and friends in Shanghai,

169
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,500
and my hometown is in Anhui.

170
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,460
So I would like to have a nice wedding

171
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,100
in Anhui as well,

172
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,860
letting all the relatives and friends
know that my daughter

173
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,100
is getting married.

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,059
That's what I thought.

175
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,020
Mrs. Mai, this is what I think.

176
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,299
Huan and I also don't want
to be gawked at like monkeys.

177
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,100
We want to have a Traveling Wedding.

178
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,659
Take a trip around the world.

179
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,299
No way.

180
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,020
She's my only daughter.

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,020
You can't just take
her on a trip as her wedding.

182
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,659
I will not agree to that.

183
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:31,419
Hello.

184
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:32,980
- Hello.
- I'm looking for the Xin family.

185
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,899
Please wait a moment.

186
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,220
This way, please.

187
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
That's true.

188
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,460
When I got married,

189
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,460
I also invited all my relatives
and friends to Shanghai.

190
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,260
We booked a five-star hotel,

191
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,699
inclusive of meals and accommodation.

192
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:50,620
Nowadays,

193
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,100
these high-end hotels

194
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
provide quite good wedding services.

195
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
But you have to pay enough money

196
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,179
to have a respectable

197
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,299
and decent ceremony.

198
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,100
That's true.

199
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,059
For Jiali's wedding,

200
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,299
from the wedding dress to the banquet,

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,100
we handled everything ourselves.

202
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,380
We're not thinking

203
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,899
about grand hotels or things like that.

204
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,819
But her dad has relatives and friends,

205
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,380
right?

206
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
And we have next-door neighbors,

207
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,860
like Mrs. Zhou and Mrs. Wang.

208
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,980
I also have my friends

209
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,340
in the dance group

210
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,899
and the square dance group.

211
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,299
These people all together

212
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,659
would take several tables, I guess.

213
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:33,539
Some six or seven tables.

214
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,899
Yes, at least six or seven tables.

215
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,460
Of course, we can discuss

216
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,299
how and where to hold
the wedding in Shanghai

217
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:42,699
and how much to spend on it

218
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,419
when the time comes.

219
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,460
However,

220
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,659
the wedding back in Anhui, my hometown,

221
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,579
must be well organized.

222
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,059
I must let everyone know

223
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,020
that my daughter is getting married
with pomp and splendor, right?

224
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,140
But rest assured about the money.

225
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,620
We will pay for it ourselves.

226
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,620
Mrs. Mai.

227
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,380
Those who associate with our family

228
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,460
are all people of status.

229
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,380
When the two families gather for a meal,

230
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
there will be entrepreneurs and workers,

231
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,380
bosses and drivers,

232
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,819
ladies and aunties
from the square dance.

233
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,179
At that time,

234
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,740
it won't be just a matter
of eating fish properly.

235
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,980
Of course, it would be okay
with our guests.

236
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,059
But I wonder if the guests
invited by your family

237
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,980
feel uncomfortable.

238
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,620
Will you stop?

239
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,179
Sir, it's this room.

240
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,860
Jiali.

241
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,220
You need to learn from our Chenghuan.

242
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,020
You speak without manners
at such a young age

243
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,340
and are a snob as well.

244
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,020
You...

245
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,860
That's enough.

246
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,020
Who is being a snob?

247
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,419
Enough. Shut up.

248
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,380
Excuse me. Squid on fire.

249
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:55,980
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mai.

250
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,020
Please don't be angry. She...

251
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,460
It's probably because of her pregnancy.

252
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,779
I'm sorry.
Please don't stoop to her level.

253
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,059
But to tell you the truth, Mrs. Mai.

254
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,140
The wedding

255
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,260
you mentioned isn't the same
as what I had imagined.

256
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,899
Being surrounded and
fussed over by a bunch of elders

257
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,860
does feel...

258
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,059
What?

259
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,100
It feels very awkward.

260
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,059
I don't want my wedding
to be like a flea market.

261
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,380
Xin Jialiang, what is
that supposed to mean?

262
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,059
Rich people are considered human,

263
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,899
and poor people are fleas?

264
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,460
That's not what I meant.

265
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,299
It's not.

266
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,179
I understand.

267
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,419
You mean matching social class.

268
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,620
I've never thought about marrying
into a wealthy family.

269
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,460
From the very beginning,

270
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,020
I thought Xin Jialiang and I were
a good match of ordinary families,

271
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,380
with equal status and mutual benefit.

272
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,899
But I didn't expect
Xin Jialiang to lie to me.

273
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,659
He has always concealed
his family background.

274
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,380
If Xin Jialiang hadn't begged me

275
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,659
to forgive him,

276
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,179
this meal wouldn't have happened.

277
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,419
Up until now,

278
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,419
I don't feel that our family is
reaching out of our league.

279
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,500
I believe marriage is
about two families sitting down,

280
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,260
and discussing matters

281
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:12,819
that need to be discussed.

282
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
This is a normal thing.

283
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,860
Besides, we were invited

284
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,059
to today's meal.

285
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,899
You didn't have to do it
if you didn't want to.

286
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,380
But since you did it,

287
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,860
why would you say insulting things

288
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,220
and judge people with prejudice?

289
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,860
I think this meal
was a mistake from the start.

290
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,620
This meal

291
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,020
is something we can skip.

292
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,899
And this marriage

293
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,220
is also something we can call off.

294
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,260
Mom, you see?

295
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,059
They simply look down on our family.

296
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,260
They want face and dignity.

297
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,980
We can give what we can afford,

298
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:10,299
but if not, then we might as well
find someone else.

299
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:13,260
- Shut up, will you?
- With Jialiang's status,

300
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,059
he can easily find any girl he wants.

301
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,460
He will be married.

302
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,659
Are you sick?

303
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,460
Listen to that.

304
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,500
Xin Jialiang, listen to your sister.

305
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,579
From the moment you walked in,

306
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:25,419
I didn't hear

307
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,579
one single good word
come out of your mouth.

308
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:28,860
You're rich,

309
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,380
but so what?

310
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,460
Look at the conditions Chenghuan has.

311
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,579
They're right there.

312
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:34,299
Her conditions

313
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,220
would draw long lines
even in the People's Park.

314
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,699
Let me tell you, Jialiang.

315
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,819
If you marry Chenghuan,

316
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:40,980
you will be lucky.

317
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,779
Yes, yes.

318
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:42,779
Mrs. Mai.

319
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,740
Let's all calm down first.

320
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,899
Shouting and screaming, so uncultured.

321
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,260
- Stop it, will you?
- I'm uncultured?

322
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:50,699
I'm uncultured?

323
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,260
What about you, acting all sarcastic

324
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,659
and unruly? Do you call that cultured?

325
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm sarcastic?

326
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,059
Look at your family status and ours.

327
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,059
Do you really think we can

328
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,539
really sit down and eat together?

329
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,419
What status do you say we have?

330
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,140
I'll tell you.

331
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,899
We are of the working-class status.

332
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,140
We live by the work
of our diligent hands.

333
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,419
Take a look.

334
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,819
Look closely at these hands.

335
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,419
They are the hands
of the working people.

336
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,699
I don't even want to eat with you.

337
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:14,899
- Let's go, Mr. Mai.
- Mrs. Mai.

338
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,340
- Let's go.
- Zao, help me stop them.

339
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,699
- Let's go home.
- I'm really sorry.

340
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,419
Mr. Mai, I'm sorry.

341
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,620
Huan, Huan...

342
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,740
Step aside. We'll talk about it later.

343
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,299
Huan.

344
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,100
Mom, this family is too bizarre.

345
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,059
Jialiang.

346
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,260
Do you really want to be
related to such a family?

347
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,579
You're unbelievable.

348
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,819
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

349
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,779
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mai.

350
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:33,939
Mrs. Mai, please calm down.

351
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:34,980
Mr. Mai, I'm sorry, so sorry.

352
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,659
Mrs. Mai.

353
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,779
Dad, Mom, you go back first.

354
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,659
I'll have a word with Xin Jialiang.

355
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,100
What's there to talk about?

356
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,179
Mrs. Mai, please calm down.

357
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Mai. Sorry, Mrs. Mai.

358
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,740
Zao, please take good care
of them for me.

359
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,100
Huan, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

360
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,380
I didn't think things
would turn out this way.

361
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,980
My sister was out of line.

362
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,100
You, you must apologize
to Mrs. Mai for me.

363
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,380
Also, I didn't mean
anything by what I said.

364
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,340
I just wanted to make
our wedding a bit more special.

365
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,179
- I didn't look down upon...
- Don't talk nonsense now.

366
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,059
Xin Jialiang.

367
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,899
I've clearly seen your
family's attitude today.

368
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:10,179
Did that look like we were
supposed to be engaged?

369
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,020
And you, stop saying sorry.

370
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,819
Apologies won't solve any problems.

371
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,260
If our two families

372
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,860
cannot reach a consensus

373
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,220
and respect each other as equals,

374
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,659
then the two of us

375
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,100
can simply call things off.

376
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,620
Huan, it's not that serious.

377
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,819
There must be a way to fix things.

378
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,100
Don't talk to me anymore.

379
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,579
Xin Jialiang.

380
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,860
I think we should take some time

381
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,779
and calm down for a while.

382
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,779
Huan, don't do that.

383
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,740
I don't want to calm down.

384
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,340
Hello, this was left
by a gentleman just now

385
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,500
designated to you.

386
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,899
Thank you.

387
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:57,699
(Yao Zhiming)
Why would

388
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,659
a leader give such a valuable gift

389
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,779
to a female subordinate?

390
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,059
Why would he?

391
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,220
How would I know?

392
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,819
Xin Jiali, what's your problem?

393
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,379
What were you doing?

394
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,339
Speak if you know how to,

395
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,059
but if you don't, just shut up, okay?

396
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,379
Why would I shut up?

397
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,740
Xin Jialiang, listen to me.

398
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,900
You better cut ties with that
alleyway princess at once.

399
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,660
Look at what their family is like.

400
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,579
Take a look in the mirror
to see what you're like.

401
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,260
- I...
- Enough.

402
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,420
Jialiang.

403
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,420
You should reconsider

404
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,180
about you and Chenghuan.

405
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:49,900
Hello?

406
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,740
Mr. Yao.

407
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,220
Why did you

408
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
give me a gift today?

409
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,460
It's not from me.

410
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,420
It was from Ms. Zhang Peisheng.

411
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,379
Ms. Zhang?

412
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,220
How to deal with it is up to you.

413
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,260
Also, actually,

414
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,099
no one cares about your dignity.

415
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,220
They only look at your actual strength.

416
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:16,900
Thinking about marrying
into a wealthy family

417
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,619
and putting on airs at the same time

418
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,099
like the way you are now

419
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,020
will make you suffer.

420
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:49,859
Jialiang.

421
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,940
Why were you that harsh?

422
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,420
You've driven your sister
away with anger.

423
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,900
Pregnant women shouldn't get angry.

424
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,379
My words were harsh.

425
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,059
What about hers?

426
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:09,859
By the way,

427
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,220
who gave you this name card?

428
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,260
I've been asking, but you never said.

429
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,980
What's there to say about it?

430
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,700
A male superior of Huan.

431
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,900
He even gave Huan an expensive watch.

432
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,059
Who knows what his intention is.

433
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:34,819
Have some tea?

434
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,779
Let me pour you some boiled water.

435
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:43,619
Honey.

436
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,020
Shall we watch some TV?

437
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,339
Do you want to watch
Shaoxing opera or a TV drama?

438
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:50,779
They looked down on us.

439
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,420
We don't want to marry them either.

440
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:53,980
She picks on us,

441
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,420
and we're choosy too.

442
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,980
What's so great about them?

443
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,500
The whole family is no good.

444
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,460
Xin Jialiang has no

445
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,779
sense of responsibility whatsoever,

446
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,859
always hemming and hawing.

447
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,779
What did Huan see in him?

448
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,980
And his sister,

449
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:09,900
what's her name, Li something?

450
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,779
Xin Jiali.

451
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,180
You sure remember it well.

452
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,379
Xin Jiali, that potbelly,

453
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,260
with such a mean face.

454
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,900
Being a parasite herself,

455
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,579
and yet she looks down
upon us common folks.

456
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,460
She...

457
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,260
You know what?

458
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,220
In the beginning,

459
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,980
she asked our Huan to order the dishes.

460
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,460
Do you know why she did that?

461
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,779
She was trying to put Huan in her place.

462
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,859
Outrageous. Way out of line.

463
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:34,980
We indeed have no money,

464
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,180
but what's wrong with that?

465
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,260
We are short of money,
but they are short of morals.

466
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,059
Yes, all lacking.

467
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:41,139
You lack too.

468
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,539
What do I lack?

469
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,660
You lack sense.

470
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,859
Why didn't you help me out back there?

471
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,460
You left me to babble alone
in front of their whole family.

472
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,619
Now you're talking.

473
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,420
You made me the bad guy all alone.

474
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,779
Now you're getting heated.

475
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,220
Mom, don't be angry.

476
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,299
You didn't eat anything.

477
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,660
Have some noodles.

478
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,500
Did you find a job?

479
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,059
I'm still working on it.

480
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,619
Alright, keep looking.

481
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,220
You need to find

482
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,900
a good job soon

483
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,819
and then study hard and work hard.

484
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,139
This way, your salary
will go up, you know?

485
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,059
You must learn some skills, child.

486
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,379
The more you learn, the better.

487
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,260
Don't be like your father,

488
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,260
who only knows how to drive.

489
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,299
He has no other skills,

490
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,500
and people look down upon him.

491
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,460
You must work hard.

492
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,900
Work hard, and then work harder.

493
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,339
Push on, and then push harder.

494
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,260
Make big money

495
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,339
and bring glory to the Mai family, okay?

496
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,260
I know, Mom.

497
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,299
Hey, are you mad?

498
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,420
I wasn't criticizing you.

499
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,460
I was just teaching our son

500
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,500
to work hard

501
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,420
and used you as a negative example.

502
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:57,660
I mean...

503
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,420
Mom, Chenghuan has come back.

504
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,460
I'm back.

505
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,299
You're back.

506
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,859
How was your chat with Jialiang?

507
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,660
Not bad.

508
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,460
What did you talk about?

509
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,819
Did you guys mention

510
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,260
what to do with the upcoming wedding?

511
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,500
Does he have any ideas?

512
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,700
Mom, I don't think

513
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,779
we should get married.

514
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,460
Huan.

515
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,460
Listen to me.

516
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,260
You need to stay calm.

517
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,779
I know

518
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,020
that their family is not good,

519
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,180
but Jialiang is still good to you.

520
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,299
You are marrying Jialiang,

521
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,139
not living with his family.

522
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:46,859
Right?

523
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,460
Besides, you have been
together for three years.

524
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,420
It's not easy. Cherish it.

525
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,059
Mom, you saw it today.

526
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,500
If my happiness

527
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,579
has to be exchanged
for the dignity of the whole family,

528
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,579
making you suffer with me,

529
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:03,260
I would rather not get married.

530
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,220
Well,

531
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,460
I've thought about this.

532
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
They are just unwilling

533
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,900
to let our poor relatives
attend the wedding.

534
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,059
Fine. We won't attend it.

535
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,500
When the time comes, I will pay

536
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:16,660
and I will handle it.

537
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,299
We'll invite
all the relatives from Anhui,

538
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,660
and gather all the neighbors,
uncles, and aunts in Shanghai

539
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,980
all together.

540
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,299
We'll host a splendid event in Shanghai.

541
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:26,940
Mom.

542
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,099
These are two different things.

543
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,700
Besides, a grand wedding
doesn't guarantee happiness.

544
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,299
Back then, my dad was poor
and had nothing.

545
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,660
But you still married him, didn't you?

546
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,579
That's not the same.

547
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,020
Also,

548
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,260
I also had standards back then.

549
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,339
Your dad and I also had a wedding,

550
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,180
showing all relatives and friends.

551
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,299
This means being taken seriously.

552
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,460
It's different.

553
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,500
Here we go again.

554
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,020
Huan, listen to me.

555
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,619
You don't have to worry
about this matter.

556
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:58,180
Rest assured.

557
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,460
I will take care of it all.

558
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:00,940
When the time comes, you and Jialiang

559
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,900
just need to attend the wedding...

560
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,740
Okay, go ahead, please.

561
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,779
But let me tell you,

562
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,020
I won't be attending.

563
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Because this wedding
is not what I wanted.

564
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,420
I...

565
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,379
The dumplings I made for you today

566
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,980
are comparable to what
Mrs. Mai usually makes for you.

567
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,460
One shrimp in each dumpling,

568
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,660
with plenty of filling.

569
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,539
Mao.

570
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,059
I finally understand it now.

571
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,220
Marriage is the union of two families.

572
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,020
Bumps and frictions,
grievances and conflicts

573
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,260
are all common.

574
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,260
In plain terms,
it's a game of give-and-take.

575
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,619
It's not too late for you
to realize it now.

576
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,139
You always realize things before I do.

577
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,339
My family and Xin Jialiang's family

578
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:12,740
are so different in status.

579
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,379
The Xin family looks down on me so much,

580
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:18,099
and my mom, on the other hand,
expects so much from me.

581
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,339
As the eldest daughter,
I should filially

582
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,500
fulfill her wishes,

583
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,339
but this time my mom

584
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,900
really made me feel
that she is too much.

585
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,180
Aren't all moms
in their generation the same?

586
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
All their lives,

587
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,900
they sacrifice themselves
for their husbands and children.

588
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,500
And ultimately,
they pin their hopes on us,

589
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,819
expecting us to fulfill their dreams.

590
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,379
My mom does place all her hopes

591
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,859
on me.

592
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,379
She has no confidence in my father

593
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:54,420
and she feels that only I
can make her proud.

594
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,500
As if only my happiness

595
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,859
can satisfy her sense of accomplishment.

596
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,339
Actually, now that I think about it,
I got a bit carried away too.

597
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,339
I shouldn't have said
those things to her.

598
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,299
Even though she carries her resentments,

599
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,299
ultimately, she still hopes
for the best for me.

600
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:16,819
Come on, eat the dumplings.

601
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:19,500
(Baby Liang)

602
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,299
Baby,

603
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,740
today my sister and my mom went too far.

604
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,220
Sorry, don't take it to heart.

605
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,220
Baby, have you gotten home?

606
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,779
I miss you.

607
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,779
Baby, don't be angry.

608
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,299
Can you forgive me, please?

609
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:37,579
Xin Jialiang is such a
Monday morning quarterback.

610
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,220
What's the use of apologizing?

611
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,579
He has no sense
of responsibility whatsoever.

612
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,020
He's not worthy of you.

613
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:47,460
When we ate there today,

614
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,260
he was always equivocating.

615
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
If only he would stand up
and say a word,

616
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,339
things wouldn't
have escalated this much.

617
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,059
Alright, you've had a long day.

618
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,420
Eat the dumplings,

619
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,139

Let me tell you.

674
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
It's indeed hard
to find a job these days.

675
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,379
You have to keep a level head.

I went to interview
at a big firm the other day

680
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,339
and I was actually hired.

681
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,980
They notified me
to go for an internship.

682
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,020
(Internship Notice from Fangyuan Law Firm)

683

Fangyuan Law Firm.

That's a big law firm.

685
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:42,700
Yes.

686
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,579
That's quite impressive.

687
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:44,180
Right.

688
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,379
Your parents must be so happy.

689
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,099
You should send them a message quickly.

690
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:50,020
Tell them now.

691
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,260
What's this face again?

692
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,779
They are already worried
about my sister's wedding affairs.

693
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,859
I'll tell them later.

694
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,139
An internship invitation

695
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,579
is not an official job offer.

696
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:10,660
So I think

697
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,779
it's best to be sure
before saying anything.

698
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,579
What's wrong with an internship?

699
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,379
Though it's said that
all beginnings are hard,

700
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,779
once you get the job position you like,

701
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,740
won't you then be like a fish in water?

702
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,379
It's okay.

703
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:29,539
I'm happy for you.

704
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,579

705
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,180

Why?

720
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,980

722
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,936

- Chenghuan.

723
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,579
- In a fight with your mother-in-law,
- You're drunk.

724
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,460
- whom does your husband side with?
- Sit down.

725
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,859

Zao.

731
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,059

732
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,819
It wasn't easy, you know.

733
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:46,900
It wasn't easy for her.

734
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,339
Chenghuan, I know.

735
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,420
My attitude towards our mom today
wasn't...

Zao.

737
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,859
In the future,

738
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,619
if you ever meet a girl you like,

739
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,660
you must treasure her.

740
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,099
He knows that.

741
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,819
No matter what kind of girl you like,

742
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,379
I will support you.

743
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:07,180
Okay, alright.

744
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,020
You know that, right?

745
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:10,379
Do you?

746
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,339
We should go now.

747
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:13,020
Okay.

748
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,619
That's about it, yeah?

749
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:15,779
Don't you have plans tomorrow?

750
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,339
- Let's go.
- Come on. Let's go home.

751
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,420
- Let's go.
- Home, let's go home.

752
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,819
Hello everyone, me again, Mai Chenghuan.

753
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,619
Life offers few chances to be drunk.

754
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,779
So I am very happy today.

755
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,740
I'll cover all the drinks for everyone.

756
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,139
All on me, Mai Chenghuan.

757
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,740
No, no, no.

758
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,180
Let's go. Time to go home.

759
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,460
- Let's go home.
- Not at all.

760
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,579
She's kidding. She's drunk.

761
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:39,740
She's drunk. Never mind her.

762
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,180
Everyone, have a good time!

763
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,880
Goodbye, goodbye.

764
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,460
Come on, have some grapes.

765
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,180
Oranges.

766
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,740
Chenghuan is with Mao.

767
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,940
Chengzao is picking them up.

768
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,420
She can stay out.

769
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,420
I'm still angry.

770
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:15,139
You talk as if you

771
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,980
don't care or worry,

772
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,900
but in fact, you're more
anxious than anyone.

773
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,180
What's the use of worrying?

774
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,420
Our daughter has grown up

775
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:25,819
and her wings are strong.

776
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,139
- She dared to talk to me like that.
- Alright.

777
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,020
Don't be angry now.

778
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,059
Don't be angry.

779
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,660
Remember, anger harms the body.

780
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,020
You know?

781
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,020
You...

782
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:03,500
Good morning, Mom.

783
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,740
Morning.

784
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,219
Wh-when did you get back?

785
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,860
I came back last night.

786
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:15,739
Zao said you were

787
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,500
staying at Mao's place.

788
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,340
I came back later last night.

789
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,099
Mom.

790
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,139
What I said to you
yesterday was a bit harsh.

791
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,259
Sorry about that.

792
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,739
Did you get drunk yesterday?

793
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,659
Do you still have a headache?

794
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,099
Mom.

795
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:00,099
I know

796
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,940
you always mean well to me.

797
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,420
I understand it all in my heart.

798
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:11,420
At the end of the day,

799
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,420
we're holding you back.

800
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,659
I don't like what you just said.

801
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:23,619
As the daughter of the Mai family,

802
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,420
I'm praised wherever I go.

803
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,179
I have that confidence.

804
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,020
Don't say that anymore.

805
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,380
Come on, Mom.

806
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,059
I've made breakfast for you and my dad.

807
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:36,860
Have a taste.

808
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,739
It's so pretty.

809
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,579
Look.

810
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,219
So pretty.

811
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,219
Try it.

812
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,020
Huan.

813
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,059
I often nag at you,

814
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,139
but that's how mothers are like,
you know.

815
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,699
When you become a mother yourself,

816
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,460
you'll understand me.

817
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,579
For how long can I

818
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,900
nag at you like this?

819
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,699
Then I'll keep you company
for a few more years

820
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,179
so you can nag me more.

821
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,820
What nonsense is that?

822
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Of course, I hope you'll marry early

823
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,020
and have children early.

824
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,179
You see, I'm still young

825
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,619
and I can help you.

826
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,300
Mom.

827
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,739
You've worried about so many things

828
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,179
for me since childhood.

829
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,619
For this matter alone,

830
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,780
I want to handle it myself.

831
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,619
I promise

832
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:37,900
to give you a satisfactory answer.

833
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,619
Is that okay?

834
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,900
Come, Mom, look at this.

835
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,300
Do you like them?

836
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,980
I got you earrings.

837
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,940
If you wear these to the dance,

838
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,259
you'll absolutely outshine everyone.

839
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,380
Even Mrs. Zhou won't be your match.

840
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,020
They're so pretty!

841
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,460
They must have cost a lot, right?

842
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,219
Don't spend money recklessly.

843
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,380
No, your goddaughter Mao

844
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,579
gave me a discount.

845
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,219
Double filial piety, do you like them?

846
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,340
They are nice.

847
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:10,340
Also,

848
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,699
I made you a cake.

849
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,179
Remember to eat it.

850
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,940
I have to get changed and go to work.

851
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,420
Aren't you eating?

852
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,860
No, it's specially made for you.

853
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,460
Love you, Mom.

854
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:56,500
Our daughter made it for me.

855
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,179
Let me have a taste.

856
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,020
No way.

857
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,860
She made it especially for me.

858
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,619
Our daughter is so filial.

859
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,860
Of course.

860
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,980
She's our daughter.

861
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:09,699
It smells so good.

862
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:10,619
You can have a smell.

863
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:11,860
Smells good, right?

864
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,619
Yes.

865
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:14,020
I'll give you some to eat later, okay?

866
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,420
Then, you must do as I say.

867
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:17,579
Look.

868
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,300
Last night, I thought over and over
and came up with a plan.

869
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,219
What plan?

870
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Go to your mother.

871
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,579
For what?

872
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:24,579
To ask for her help.

873
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,139
Think about it.

874
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,099
Huan always visits her

875
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,699
whenever she's free.

876
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,420
And your mother also likes her a lot.

877
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,900
So I am thinking

878
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,780
maybe we should let your mom

879
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,219
help out with Huan's dowry,

880
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,420
and we can pay her back

881
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,500
when we have money.

882
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,020
I won't go. You can go.

883
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,219
How did you come up with that idea?

884
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:46,579
What's wrong with that?

885
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:48,139
I told you to plead with your mother.

886
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,619
It's just a small favor, just...

887
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,820
Make it nice and clear, will you?

888
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:54,020
She is not my biological mother.

889
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,219
Besides, we've all been living
our separate lives for decades.

890
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,099
How do you expect me to...

891
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,816
I'm late. I have to go now.

892
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,820
Let's talk later.

893
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,380
Why are you like this?

894
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,900
Quick to run away when there's trouble.

895
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,579
If you don't go, I will.

896
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,139
Hello.

897
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,642
(30% off)

898
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:54,020
Hello.

899
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,820
Hello.

900
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,059
Hi, excuse me.

901
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:59,340
Where is the lady here?

902
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,340
The old lady just went
to Xing'anli for afternoon tea.

903
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:04,500
With whom?

904
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,539
She went by herself.

905
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
She went alone by herself?

906
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,860
You guys are so bold.

907
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,940
You just

908
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,340
let her go out alone at such an old age?

909
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,820
What if something happens
when she's crossing the road?

910
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,500
I'll complain about your nursing home.

911
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,300
No, Madam.

912
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:24,619
She goes every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

913
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:29,579
What is your relationship with her?

914
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,619
You don't seem to visit her often.

915
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,820
Of course, I'm a relative.

916
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,860
I don't come often because I'm busy.

917
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,820
Very busy.

918
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,900
What place did you mention just now?

919
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,539
Xing'anli Garden Hotel.

920
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:45,500
Xing'anli.

921
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,579
Okay.

922
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,219
How do I get there?

923
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,940
Turn left after exiting,
and it's just two blocks away.

924
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:52,739
Okay, okay.

925
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,259
Put this away nicely, okay?

926
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,579
Okay.

927
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,059
Tell her my last name is Liu.

928
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,139
Ms. Liu, got it.

929
00:40:59,139 --> 00:40:59,900
Put it away nicely.

930
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,500
Okay.

931
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,099
Grandma.

932
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:15,659
Shall I do it instead?

933
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,380
When eating crab,
you must dismantle it yourself.

934
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,300
Helping someone else dismantle a crab

935
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,139
will ruin a friendship.

936
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,860
You must be busy with work, right?

937
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,259
It's okay.

938
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,659
I'm used to it.

939
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,820
The kitchen staff here

940
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:38,500
are veterans.

941
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:40,380
Look,

942
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,880
bamboo shoot soup with fresh
and pickled streaky pork.

943
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,460
Astonishingly fresh.

944
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:45,699
It's to replenish you.

945
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:52,300
Grandma, actually the bowls and cutlery

946
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:54,099
with chips here

947
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,739
can all be replaced.

948
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,619
They aren't suitable for guests anymore.

949
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,940
Also, I think it's necessary

950
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,340
to change the style of this place.

951
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,059
If you need it,

952
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,539
I can find a designer.

953
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,579
I accept the cutlery advice.

954
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,219
Later,

955
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,780
I'll have Cui do an inventory

956
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,020
and replenish with new ones.

957
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,219
As for the environment,

958
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:18,860
I have emotional ties to this place.

959
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,099
I think let's keep it that way.

960
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,619
Nowadays, many time-honored brands

961
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,739
have gone fashionable and international

962
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,380
to appeal to young people.

963
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:29,900
I, on the other hand, think

964
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,300
Xing'anli has more charm.

965
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,659
Don't go for those.

966
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:35,860
Yes.

967
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,619
Grandma, I understand

968
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,980
what you said.

969
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,980
You've just returned to the country.

970
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,420
Focus on doing your job well.

971
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,380
You don't need to visit me
every now and then.

972
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:49,099
From a professional standpoint,

973
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,420
I think you can entrust the management

974
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:54,940
and take Xing'anli to the next level.

975
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,139
