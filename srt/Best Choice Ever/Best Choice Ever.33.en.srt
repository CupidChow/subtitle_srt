3
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:35,763
Mrs. Mai, what are you making today?

4
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,683
Today's dish

5
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:40,323
is crucian and tofu soup.

6
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:42,483
Listen.

7
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:43,964
After cleaning the fish,

8
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:46,724
fry it on both sides

9
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,524
until it's golden.

10
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:50,244
Then add hot water,

11
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,244
boil it on high heat,

12
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,364
and stew it on low heat later.

13
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,164
Cut the tofu into small cubes

14
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:56,244
and put them in.

15
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:57,364
Stew it

16
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,563
on low heat.

17
00:01:58,563 --> 00:01:59,563
The soup

18
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:01,524
will be milky white

19
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,483
and very fresh.

20
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:06,043
Do you know what the greatest benefit

21
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,283
of this dish is?

22
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,364
What?

23
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:09,563
Increasing breast milk.

24
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:11,924
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:14,123
Increasing what?

26
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,003
Increasing...

27
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,964
Well,

28
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,764
they were increasing milk distribution
on the street.

29
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,163
Right, distributing milk.

30
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,283
Right.

31
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,644
I'll distribute it. No, I mean,
I'll make it.

32
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,204
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, please take a rest.

33
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,603
Can you handle it?

34
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:30,843
I can, no problem.

35
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,163
You can just wait.

36
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:33,524
You've learned this?

37
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:34,163
I've learned it.

38
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:35,044
- Really?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,044
Okay, then.

40
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,204
Make sure to fry it thoroughly.

41
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,003
Both sides should be golden yellow.

42
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,163
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,764
And you must use boiling water.

44
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,563
Okay, okay.

45
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,283
Okay.

46
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:46,283
Take your time with it.

47
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,163
Alright.

48
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,003
It's odd.

49
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,163
You do look quite cute in this.

50
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,524
Can you manage to cook this dish?

51
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:03,764
Crucian and tofu soup.

52
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:05,723
What's so hard about it?

53
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,883
The first step should be...

54
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:12,723
To boil water. Right.

55
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,764
How did you come up with the idea
to cook this dish today?

56
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:24,764
This dish is amazing.

57
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:27,204
You'll know about it in the future.

58
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,204
In the future? About what?

59
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:33,804
This dish can increase...

60
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:37,163
Increase...

61
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:40,524
Milk distribution.

62
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:48,764
Milk distribution?

63
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,163
A child can't eat that much.

64
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,764
It's fine. If he can't eat it,
then you'll eat it.

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,204
Do you think I'm not fat enough?

66
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:06,204
Mr. Mai,

67
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:09,123
you were really awesome
in the courtroom just now.

68
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,443
Luo Mingli didn't even

69
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,764
get to say anything at all

70
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,084
before you beat him so easily.

71
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:16,524
Wait a moment.

72
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:20,803
Hello.

73
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,684
Okay, got it.

74
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,403
What's wrong?

75
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:32,964
Song Huaimin wants to appeal.

76
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,163
He...

77
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:41,483
Let him.

78
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:42,803
Let him appeal.

79
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:45,084
Anyway, we won the first trial.
We're not afraid of the second.

80
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:51,084
But it will be a while
before we can get Dingding back.

81
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:55,884
It's fine.

82
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:57,764
Good things take time.

83
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,884
It's really comfortable like this now.

84
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:15,004
We can finally eat the meal
prepared by the kids.

85
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:15,923
Comfortable?

86
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:16,603
Comfortable.

87
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,403
It should have been like this long ago.

88
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,363
Haven't I told you?

89
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,483
Let go.

90
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,124
Tell them whatever you want to eat.
Don't be shy.

91
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,363
I know.

92
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,403
If Zao brings a girlfriend here,

93
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,923
then it's perfect. I'll feel content.

94
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,363
Then call him.

95
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:39,483
Call him now?

96
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,283
Right.

97
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:41,524
No, don't.

98
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,803
What if he's busy?
Let's not disturb him.

99
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:48,483
Zao is the least
afraid of being disturbed.

100
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:49,524
You don't believe it?

101
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,524
Call him a few times.

102
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:53,084
Maybe he'll come back.

103
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:54,764
- Call him now?
- Come on, call him.

104
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:57,644
Okay.

105
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:05,403
My mom.

106
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:08,803
Hello, Mom.

107
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:12,004
Zao, I have good news.

108
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:14,324
Your sister has started dating.

109
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:16,684
Really?

110
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:20,363
Fancy finding by sheer luck.

111
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,483
He's right under our noses.

112
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:27,124
Guess who it is? Yao Zhiming.

113
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:30,324
It seems you are quite satisfied.

114
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,803
Of course.

115
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,324
Your dad is also quite satisfied.

116
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,324
Zao, I was thinking,

117
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,964
maybe you could come home this weekend?

118
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,403
The whole family could get together.

119
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:40,803
Mom,

120
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:43,204
I might not be able to make it
this weekend.

121
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:44,764
I still have some work to do here.

122
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:48,363
That's okay.
You should get to do your work.

123
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:51,004
No matter how busy you are with work,
take care of yourself.

124
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:53,363
Make sure you're getting
proper nutrition.

125
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:54,884
I got it.

126
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,204
Okay. Wait a minute.

127
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,524
You have to start dating now.

128
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:02,764
You promised me

129
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,403
to find a girlfriend soon.

130
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:05,723
I got it, Mom.

131
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,124
Did I hear someone next to you?

132
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,483
Who are you with?

133
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:12,603
A colleague.

134
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:18,843
Mom, I have something to do.

135
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:19,884
I'll talk to you later.

136
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,204
Do your things. I'm hanging up now.

137
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:24,603
He's busy.

138
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,043
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

139
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,960
(Work Card)

140
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,422
(Recorder)

141
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:41,043
Mr. Zou,

142
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,684
what on earth does Ms. Zhang want to do?

143
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,884
Miss Mai has been good to me.

144
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:49,564
She even helped to mend the relationship
between me and my son.

145
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,324
If I repay kindness with ingratitude,

146
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,644
then I'd be heartless.

147
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,163
I've already told you,

148
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,764
there's really nothing going on.

149
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:59,283
It's just that my niece really
wants to meet her idol.

150
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:00,684
Really, it's nothing.

151
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,444
This is the money you gave me last time.

152
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,243
I didn't bring all of it with me.

153
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,084
I'll give it to you next time.

154
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,243
You've spent quite a bit?

155
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,764
I will pay you back.

156
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:22,843
Mr. Yao.

157
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:24,363
You have

158
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:25,723
already accepted the money,

159
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,603
and it's been over a week.

160
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:28,964
If you really want to repay,

161
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:32,523
give me the principal plus 20% interest.

162
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:33,883
Isn't that usury?

163
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:34,804
Mr. Yao.

164
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:36,243
You can't say that.

165
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,164
Are you truly naive, or just pretending?

166
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,444
If it's not convenient for you,

167
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:43,883
I'll call Mr. Yao.

168
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,723
No.

169
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:49,843
Please don't call him.

170
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,003
Have some tea.

171
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:19,896
(Work Card)

172
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:44,152
(Zhiming, Zhang Peisheng is gonna
make a move against Xing'anli.)

173
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,723
(Why should I?)

174
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:53,603
After doing so many bad things,

175
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:56,003
you think you can

176
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:57,883
atone for your sins that easily?

177
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,564
If you really want to change

178
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:02,123
and get closer to him,

179
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:04,243
then show him your sincerity.

180
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,883
Then just have a meal together.

181
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:07,044
You have nothing to lose.

182
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:09,084
Mr. Yao, he'll go.

183
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,643
To get along with children,

184
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,523
you have to respect each other.

185
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,243
If you want the joys of a family,

186
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:16,363
well,

187
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,444
then you, as a parent,
need to act the part.

188
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,243
Don't just act on your temperament.

189
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,483
(Otherwise, isn't it just making trouble
for the kids?)

190
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,164
Sorry about that, sir.

191
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:18,404
We have a short circuit.

192
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,204
It'll be fixed shortly.

193
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,204
What happened?

194
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:21,843
How can such a hotel suddenly
have no power?

195
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:22,603
Sorry, sir.

196
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:23,763
We have a short circuit.

197
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,044
It's will be fixed shortly.

198
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,164
We're in the middle of a meeting.
This is causing much trouble.

199
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,404
My apologies, sir.

200
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:30,243
The power just went out.

201
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,404
The air conditioning, appliances,
and internet are all down.

202
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:34,363
Why did this suddenly happen?

203
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,164
Have you found the fault?

204
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,603
I've sent the maintenance staff
to investigate.

205
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,643
The wiring in our hotel
is extensive and complex.

206
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,804
This area is undergoing
municipal maintenance recently.

207
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:45,164
Everything stopped at once.

208
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,643
You have no idea
where the problem actually lies.

209
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:49,564
Inspection and repair are underway now,

210
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:50,883
and they all require time.

211
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:51,924
So what should we do?

212
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:53,404
The hotel guests can be appeased.

213
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,523
But the delegation is already
on the way.

214
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:58,044
Ziyu.

215
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,003
Have you picked up the delegation yet?

216
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,603
Yes, I have. What's the matter?

217
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:04,003
There is a fault with the hotel's
power system right now.

218
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:06,084
I need you to help me stall a bit.

219
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:07,603
Okay.

220
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:09,643
I can have the driver take a detour
around the Bund.

221
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:12,404
But at most, we can only stall for
about fifteen minutes more.

222
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,804
That means we only have half an hour

223
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,243
before we arrive at Xing'anli.

224
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,883
Thank you. Let's try our best.

225
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,924
If it's still not fixed by the time
the delegation arrives,

226
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,843
our hotel's reputation will be ruined.

227
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,404
Mr. Cui, can the maintenance staff
hurry up?

228
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,404
They're already expediting it.

229
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:38,284
Mr. Yao?

230
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,444
It's sabotage.

231
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,044
Mr. Yao.

232
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,684
What do you mean by that?

233
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,723
Go check if there is someone

234
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,684
wearing a work card with blue lanyard.

235
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:54,164
Perhaps it can help you
find the location of the fault sooner.

236
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:56,804
Mr. Yao, what are you talking about?

237
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,164
I'll explain it to you later.
Go look for that person first.

238
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:01,483
Okay.

239
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:02,204
Mr. Cui,

240
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:04,523
go find the security right now.

241
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,363
Have them pinpoint the source
of the accident.

242
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,204
And,

243
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:09,444
find this person.

244
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:11,044
Alright, let's go.

245
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,284
I'll go with you.

246
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,643
Mr. Yao, please come in for a moment.

247
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,003
I need you to explain this.

248
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,763
What's the deal with the work card?

249
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:30,684
It's... It's Zhang Peisheng.

250
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,643
She said she could help me
get Xing'anli back.

251
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,204
I agreed in a moment of indiscretion.

252
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,003
But the more I thought about it,
the more I felt something was wrong.

253
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,084
Then she started threatening me.

254
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:43,804
Out of fear, I agreed to get her
the work card.

255
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,404
But I was wary.

256
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,883
I replaced the lanyard of that work card

257
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,603
(with a blue one.)

258
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,603
(I'm thought that if something happens,)

259
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,003
you can find the culprit.

260
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,003
And

261
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:56,003
I recorded her secretary threatening me.

262
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,243
Chenghuan,

263
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,564
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,804
I didn't expect to cause you
such trouble.

265
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,603
Now is not the time to assign blame.

266
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:11,723
Let's find a way to solve the problem.

267
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,204
Chenghuan.

268
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,723
Chenghuan, we've found it.

269
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,804
The line was indeed sabotaged
from the inside.

270
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,883
I've organized people
to make emergency repair.

271
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,483
Due to the extensive damage,

272
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:26,204
it will take about one hour.

273
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,404
Although that man hasn't been found,

274
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,603
we've checked the CCTV
and called the police.

275
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,924
I heard from Ziyu

276
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:35,243
that the delegation will arrive
in fifteen minutes.

277
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,603
Fifteen minutes... One hour....

278
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:42,003
That means we need to
stall for 45 minutes more.

279
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,044
That won't do.

280
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:44,523
The delegation's information

281
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:46,003
was submitted early in the morning.

282
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,603
We have already made the room cards.

283
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:50,363
The front desk has no reason
to stall that long.

284
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:52,483
Chenghuan,

285
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:54,404
what should we do?

286
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,204
If Zhiming finds out,
he'll definitely be mad at me.

287
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:00,204
Mr. Yao,

288
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,603
let's prepare another cigar and red wine
tasting salon

289
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:05,763
for the guests. How's it?

290
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,483
We can talk to them about
the history of Shanghai

291
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,123
and the stories of Xing'anli,

292
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:11,603
just like last time.

293
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:12,804
I...

294
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:14,804
Can I do it?

295
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:16,843
Do you still trust me?

296
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,243
Mr. Yao,

297
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:20,964
do you consider me as your family?

298
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:22,603
Or rather,

299
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:25,204
do you consider Xing'anli
as your own home?

300
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,643
Of course.

301
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,284
That's great. I feel the same.

302
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,204
Then let's introduce our home

303
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:34,603
to everyone, shall we?

304
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:36,843
Good, then

305
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,804
I'll go prepare.

306
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,044
Mr. Cui.

307
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,003
After the delegation arrives,
please escort them to the garden.

308
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,003
Mr. Yao and I will greet them.

309
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:48,723
And

310
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:51,123
notify me immediately
when the power is restored.

311
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,404
Okay, I'll arrange it.

312
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:53,044
Thank you.

313
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,204
(Not bad.)

314
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,643
(Everyone, this way, please.)

315
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:00,404
Watch your step.

316
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,404
The air is also very good.

317
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,483
Yes, the environment is nice.

318
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,684
Everyone is welcome to look around.

319
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:06,964
Everyone, this way, please.

320
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,044
Miss Mai, our General Manager.

321
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:11,164
Hello.

322
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:13,804
Hello, everyone.

323
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:14,924
Hello.

324
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:17,843
I am Mai Chenghuan,
the General Manager of Xing'anli.

325
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:20,363
Welcome to Xing'anli Hotel.

326
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:21,924
Before checking in,

327
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:25,603
we have organized
a special welcome ceremony for you all.

328
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:28,684
Today, we have invited a special guest,

329
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:30,324
Mr. Yao Renfu.

330
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,883
He is a long-time proprietor
of Xing'anli,

331
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:34,804
and also my family.

332
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,363
Today, everyone will enjoy red wine
with cigars

333
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,804
while listening to him
recount the tales of Xing'anli

334
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,804
and the history of these old buildings.

335
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:45,523
Mr. Yao.

336
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,723
Come on, this way, please.

337
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,204
- Over here.
- This way, please.

338
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,003
Come on.

339
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:54,243
Everyone may take a seat.
Please feel free to be seated.

340
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:03,763
Hello everyone, my name is Charles.

341
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:06,283
You can call me Charles Yao.

342
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,803
I am a standard Shanghai

343
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,364
Old Gentleman.

344
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,483
In 1925...

345
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:17,043
No, I went to Switzerland
more than 25 years ago.

346
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:18,523
If you ask me,

347
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:21,644
what I've missed the most
all these years abroad,

348
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:23,364
it is home,

349
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,644
my Xing'anli.

350
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,364
The Xing'anli of those days

351
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,644
was a well-known time-honored brand
far and wide.

352
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,283
Look at those old houses behind you.

353
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:35,124
These old houses are even older
than I am.

354
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,164
Let's get back to the point.

355
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:45,404
Mr. Yao has really been fantastic today.

356
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,684
Yes, back to his own home,

357
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,684
it must be the most comfortable
and natural.

358
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,884
It's said that the burning ash
is white as snow,

359
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,444
and the tobacco roll is like a cigar.

360
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:44,964
Chenghuan.

361
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,964
The circuit is restored.

362
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:48,723
That's great.

363
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,043
Alright, everyone.

364
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:56,364
I grew up here.

365
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,763
My son also grew up here.

366
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:00,844
Do you see that tree?

367
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:04,404
It was planted by my son
back in the day.

368
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,003
It even has his height marked on it
for each year.

369
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,083
In my 20 years abroad,

370
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,003
not a day went by

371
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,003
that I didn't miss my hometown.

372
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:15,604
Therefore,

373
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,523
I hope that everyone present

374
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,003
will come and visit often in the future.

375
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,003
Come and see.

376
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,204
Come and experience it.

377
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:22,204
I wish everyone

378
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,884
a wonderful stay here.

379
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,243
Later, when you check in,
you can have a taste.

380
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:32,803
Miss Mai,

381
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:35,003
you've really done a great job
with the event.

382
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:37,604
We're all looking forward to
the upcoming itinerary.

383
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:38,763
Thank you.

384
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:41,964
I'll have them take you in to check in.

385
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:42,604
Okay.

386
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,604
Duoduo.

387
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,204
This way, please, everyone.

388
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,323
This way, please.

389
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,043
Come this way.

390
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:47,844
Everyone, this way.

391
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:48,644
Come this way, please.

392
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,323
I'll take everyone to check in.

393
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:57,803
Miss Mai, I did okay today, didn't I?

394
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,644
Outstanding.

395
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:05,924
If it hadn't been for you today,

396
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,404
it surely wouldn't have gone
so smoothly.

397
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:08,723
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

398
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:12,124
I'll go take care of the guests.

399
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:13,124
I'll come to find you later.

400
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:26,884
Yao Renfu.

401
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:30,003
Yao Renfu!

402
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,523
- Zhiming.
- What are you trying to do?

403
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:35,803
Do you feel
you haven't harmed me enough?

404
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,124
Do you also want to harm Mai Chenghuan?

405
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:37,964
No.

406
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,243
Why did you contact
Zhang Peisheng privately?

407
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:42,323
- Let me explain.
- I don't want to hear it.

408
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:44,043
You will never change.

409
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,523
You're always like this.

410
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:47,083
Why?

411
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,124
I once had a little bit of hope for you.

412
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,164
Now I feel you truly don't deserve it.

413
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:57,483
For your entire life,

414
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:00,164
you can't do anything good.

415
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:02,444
It's not like that, son.

416
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,684
Don't call me that.

417
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,444
Do you know what the biggest misfortune
of my life is?

418
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,644
It's being your son.

419
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,283
Zhiming!

420
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,483
Don't blame him anymore.

421
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:22,604
If it hadn't been for him today,

422
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:24,364
this event wouldn't have gone so well.

423
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:26,884
Let's take care of business first.

424
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,083
Go find Zhang Peisheng.

425
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,723
Yao Renfu,

426
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,884
I'll come back for you later.

427
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:50,444
Chenghuan is back.

428
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,283
Ms. Peisheng.

429
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,684
Ms. Zhang, long time no see.

430
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,003
Do you need me for something?

431
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,043
Aren't you receiving important clients
for a tourism festival?

432
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:11,924
Aren't you busy?

433
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,644
Busy, yes.

434
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,083
Busy putting out fires.

435
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:19,803
Your hotel has just started.

436
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:21,404
You don't have much experience.

437
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,483
Accidents are inevitable.

438
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:26,803
Why not consider
collaborating with Yueda?

439
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:29,003
Ms. Zhang,

440
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:32,204
the food poisoning incident at Xing'anli

441
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,964
was orchestrated by your man, right?

442
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:38,043
What are you talking about?

443
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:39,803
Ms. Peisheng,

444
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:41,924
I'm very grateful to you

445
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:43,644
for referring me to Botticelli

446
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,604
when I graduated from university.

447
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:47,644
During those seven years,

448
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,644
I've learned how
to treat clients sincerely

449
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,924
and create the hotel
like it's my own home.

450
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,204
Later on, my grandma also taught me

451
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:58,083
to treat each partner with sincerity.

452
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:01,204
I've brought this philosophy
to Xing'anli.

453
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:02,523
I'm very fortunate.

454
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:04,924
I've gained a group of lovely friends.

455
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,444
They've also made Xing'anli their home.

456
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,844
In my most difficult moment,

457
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:10,444
they offered a helping hand.

458
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,124
I didn't pursue
your previous malicious slander

459
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:14,763
on Xing'anli

460
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:15,803
and the competition.

461
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:16,924
But this time,

462
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,523
you took advantage of my family

463
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,884
and caused trouble
at my most important reception event.

464
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:24,684
You have crossed my bottom line.

465
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,684
So this time,

466
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,563
I can't forgive you anymore.

467
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:34,776
There were problems
with your reception event.

468
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:37,272
What's the use of coming to me?

469
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,644
How did you know
there was a problem with my event?

470
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:44,083
Not only did the delegation
check in smoothly,

471
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:45,763
but they also had

472
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,803
a pleasant story sharing session.

473
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,644
Do you know who the speaker was?

474
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:56,003
Yao Renfu, Mr. Yao.

475
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,083
Zou Nan, come in for a moment.

476
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,283
He can't make it anymore.

477
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,320
Ms. Zhang Peisheng,

478
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,644
we suspect you of abetting the damage
to others' property.

479
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,924
Your assistant Zou Nan is suspected
of extortion.

480
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,124
We've asked him to assist
with the investigation.

481
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,723
Now please come with us.

482
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,744
Do you have any evidence?

483
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,083
The work card my dad gave you

484
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,723
is actually different from
the ones for Xing'anli.

485
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:31,884
The police have found the person
who damaged the circuit.

486
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,323
He has confessed to everything.

487
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:34,844
There's more.

488
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,960
When Zou Nan threatened my dad,

489
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:41,523
my dad recorded it.

490
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:45,043
Although my dad isn't great,

491
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,083
he's not stupid.

492
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:49,563
Ms. Zhang, please come with us.

493
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,323
I can cooperate with your investigation.

494
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,043
Just wait a moment.

495
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,644
Let me get my things in order.

496
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:03,204
Otherwise, it will be chaos.

497
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:04,283
No need to arrange anything.

498
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:05,684
I've taken over

499
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:08,083
your work,

500
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:08,884
Ms. Zhang.

501
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:14,803
Please.

502
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:42,003
Zhiming,

503
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:44,803
those words you said to your dad today

504
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:46,884
were a bit too much.

505
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,243
If Mr. Yao hadn't been there today,

506
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,644
there's no telling
what would've happened.

507
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:56,803
What does that mean?

508
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:58,523
Your dad

509
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,964
helped us find the person
who caused the damage.

510
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,124
He also helped us buy some time.

511
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:04,803
You've misunderstood him.

512
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,243
He was also used by Zhang Peisheng.

513
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:15,043
I know,

514
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:16,824
when you were little,

515
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,204
you were hurt a lot.

516
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:21,404
These wounds

517
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,684
are not something
that can just be simply forgiven.

518
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,204
He indeed wasn't a good father.

519
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:29,283
But after so many years,

520
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:32,003
he has also paid the price
for his actions.

521
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,604
He has also recognized his mistakes.

522
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:36,884
I can tell

523
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,323
that he's trying hard

524
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,043
to change this time.

525
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:44,404
He wants to

526
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,763
make up for the love

527
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,003
you once missed.

528
00:26:49,563 --> 00:26:51,164
He also wants to find the home
he once had.

529
00:26:52,884 --> 00:26:53,684
Zhiming,

530
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:55,523
do you want to

531
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:57,723
give him another chance?

532
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,040
Mr. Yao.

533
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:24,644
Yao Renfu.

534
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:31,964
Where did he go?

535
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:37,083
He must have bought them for you.

536
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:45,604
I'll give him a call.

537
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:49,644
Don't worry.

538
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:01,560
(Zhiming)

539
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,644
(You will never change.)

540
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,124
(You're always like this.)

541
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,644
(I once had a little bit of hope
for you.)

542
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:10,523
(Now I feel you truly don't deserve it.)

543
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,204
(For your entire life,)

544
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,844
(you can't do anything good.)

545
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:27,832
(Zhiming)

546
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,803
It's alright. Don't worry.

547
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,644
Maybe he just went out for a walk
and will be back soon.

548
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,803
He must be afraid I'm gonna scold him,

549
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:56,803
so he doesn't dare to answer the phone.

550
00:28:57,323 --> 00:28:58,884
I'll give him a call.

551
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:07,604
Mr. Yao.

552
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:12,604
Mr. Yao, where are you?

553
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:14,404
I...

554
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,164
Mr. Yao, you don't need to be afraid.

555
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:18,924
The matter has been resolved.

556
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:21,124
The person extorting you
has been caught.

557
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:23,364
But Zhiming said

558
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,204
he'd come back later for me.

559
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:28,763
You actually believe what I said?

560
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:31,164
Zhiming?

561
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:39,043
It's fine now. Come back.

562
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:42,003
What did you say?

563
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,844
I said it's all right. Come back.

564
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:51,844
Okay, I'm coming back now.

565
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,164
Where are you? I'll come to pick you up.

566
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,164
No need. I'll be there soon.

567
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,083
Okay.

568
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:07,364
I plan to

569
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,563
apologize to him in person later.

570
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:14,404
I called the car.

571
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,323
One second. I'm just across the street.

572
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:40,164
Are you the family of Yao Renfu?

573
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:42,003
Yes, officer, we are.

574
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:43,483
He's under resuscitation.

575
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:44,924
Okay, thank you.

576
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,844
Don't worry.

577
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:51,283
Officer,

578
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,844
what's the situation now?

579
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:55,803
Still not sure. Wait for the doctor.

580
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,083
Then, how long has he been in there?

581
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:02,003
Almost an hour now.

582
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,164
Thank you.

583
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,964
Don't be nervous. It's going to be okay.

584
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:08,364
Don't be nervous.

585
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:09,684
How is it?

586
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:11,404
He was in serious condition.

587
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:12,723
We've done our best.

588
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:15,043
Sorry, but we couldn't save him.

589
00:31:25,364 --> 00:31:27,164
The driver responsible
has been detained.

590
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,803
If necessary, we will ask for
your cooperation in the investigation.

591
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,964
These are his personal belongings.

592
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,243
You can take them after signing.

593
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:09,364
Our condolences.

594
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:22,924
Zhiming.

595
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:25,684
Zhiming, you...

596
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,444
Don't scare me, Zhiming.

597
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:31,204
Zhiming.

598
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:38,003
Zhiming.

599
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:45,404
Zhiming.

600
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:47,323
Please wait a moment.

601
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:48,803
There are still some procedures.

602
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,043
I-I'll do it.

603
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,163
Son,

604
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,603
look what I brought you.

605
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,244
Two bottles of fine wine.

606
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:42,244
It's the last of my savings.

607
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:44,964
We, father and son,
must have a good drink tonight.

608
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:05,080
(It's the real deal this time)

609
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,244
(Where did you buy this?)

610
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:11,603
It looks fake at a glance.

611
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:14,483
Waiter!

612
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:17,284
Hello, what do you need?

613
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,483
Bring the liquor I've stored.

614
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,003
Okay.

615
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,952
(It's the real deal this time)

616
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:39,003
(He indeed wasn't a good father.)

617
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,083
But after so many years,

618
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,804
he has also paid the price
for his actions.

619
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:46,404
He has also recognized his mistakes.

620
00:35:47,683 --> 00:35:48,683
I can tell

621
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,123
that he's trying hard

622
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,844
to change this time.

623
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,284
(So, I've come back)

624
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,724
(to apologize to you sincerely.)

625
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:05,523
What if you could forgive me?

626
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:13,924
Zhiming, are you alright?

627
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,464
(Zhiming)

628
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:51,364
Zhiming, all matters at the hospital
have been settled.

629
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,284
If you need anything, just call me.

630
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,844
I'll be right outside.

631
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:27,643
Hello, is this Mr. Yao Renfu?

632
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:29,764
I'm from a wealth management company.

633
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:31,844
I currently have a very good
investment project.

634
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:33,123
Would you like to know more?

635
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:38,456
Hello? Mr. Yao, are you listening?

636
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:40,324
Mr. Yao?

637
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:42,483
He's dead.

638
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:04,683
Who is this?

639
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:05,724
It looks like Huan.

640
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:06,643
It's Huan, isn't it?

641
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:11,404
Huan.

642
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:13,724
Huan.

643
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:15,563
Huan.

644
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,364
Huan.

645
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:17,764
Huan.

646
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,163
Why are you sitting here?

647
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:21,123
Fell asleep?

648
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:23,884
You've been here all night?

649
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,003
Get up first. Come on, get up.

650
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,163
Quick, get up.

651
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,163
Where's Zhiming?

652
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:32,964
Sleepy?

653
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,324
- Where's Zhiming?
- He's inside.

654
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,284
How is he doing?

655
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,964
He wanted to be alone for a while.

656
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,123
So I didn't go in and disturb him.

657
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,043
No, that's not okay.

658
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,404
How can he stay alone?

659
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:49,444
And for so long?

660
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,324
He hasn't come out?
Hasn't eaten or drunk anything?

661
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:52,603
No.

662
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,764
This is serious. He must be very upset.

663
00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:57,444
After all, they are father and son.

664
00:39:57,444 --> 00:39:59,844
What if he suddenly can't get over it
and do something?

665
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:01,603
No, I have to call him out.

666
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:02,324
Knock on the door.

667
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,123
Wait a minute.

668
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:07,483
Ming.

669
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:10,683
Ming, open the door. It's me.

670
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,404
Please open the door.

671
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,043
There's no sound.
Could something have happened?

672
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,643
Ming!

673
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:21,364
Ming, it's me. Please open the door.
Are you there?

674
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:22,444
Ming!

675
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:23,483
Bang it!

676
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:24,884
Mom, I have a room card.

677
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,884
Right, the room card.

678
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:28,844
This way.

679
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:37,924
Ming.

680
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:40,964
Are you alright?

681
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,844
I will get some water for you.

682
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:52,964
Ming,

683
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:56,083
I'll get you something to eat, alright?

684
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:01,924
Ming,

685
00:41:03,884 --> 00:41:05,884
I know you're sad.

686
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,244
But those of us who are alive

687
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:11,924
must continue to live our lives well.

688
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,444
We should eat and drink
when it's time to do so.

689
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,404
You can't go on not eating or drinking

690
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:17,324
like this.

691
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:19,083
We are worried about you.

692
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:27,884
I want to be alone for a while.

693
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,123
Alone?

694
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,123
That won't do.

695
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:32,324
It's too dangerous to be alone.

696
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,244
You might starve to death.

697
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:34,163
Go back with me.

698
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:35,563
Eat something. Live your life.

699
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,324
Be good, Ming.

700
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:37,804
- Yu.
- You...

701
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:46,964
Zhiming,

702
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,364
look at you now.

703
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,083
If you don't eat or drink,

704
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:53,964
your body will break down.

705
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:58,003
You're still young.

706
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:01,884
There are so many things waiting
for you to do.

707
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:04,364
How about this?

708
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:06,643
If you won't eat or drink,
our whole family

709
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:08,523
will also do the same

710
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,043
and keep you company, alright?

711
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:13,083
We won't disturb you either.

712
00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:13,844
Yu,

713
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,724
we'll wait at the door.

714
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:19,324
If he doesn't eat, we won't eat either.

715
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,924
If he doesn't drink,
we won't drink either.

716
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:24,643
