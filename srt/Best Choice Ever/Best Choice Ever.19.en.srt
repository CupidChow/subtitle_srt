=Episode 19=

3
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:35,236
Chenghuan.

4
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:37,444
Thank you.

5
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:40,643
What's the matter? You seem so happy.

6
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,604
I'm not telling you. It's a secret.

7
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:47,643
Zhiming,

8
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:52,244
I've asked Cui to prepare some dishes
at Xing'anli tonight.

9
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:53,884
During my stay in hospital,

10
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:56,203
Chenghuan and you have done much.

11
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,044
Are you almost here?

12
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,524
(Grandma,)

13
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,444
(the cheongsam customized
for you is ready.)

14
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,684
(I'll go pick it up right now,)

15
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,003
(and come over later.)

16
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:16,963
Mr. Xu.

17
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:18,643
You're here.

18
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:21,004
I've prepared it for you.

19
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:24,963
Come, take a closer look.

20
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:26,844
I'll get you a box.

21
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:27,923
Thank you.

22
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:08,203
Laitian.

23
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:09,844
Hurry up.

24
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:10,643
Coming.

25
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:13,203
Call Zao and tell him not to be late.

26
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,284
I have messaged him on WeChat.

27
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,044
Let's go.

28
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:15,803
Okay.

29
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:16,444
Let's go.

30
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,204
The rooms and dishes
have all been arranged by Ms. Chen.

31
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:43,204
She gave special instructions and
arranged everything.

32
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,683
The lawn. It's big, right?

33
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,563
Next time, invite Mrs. Zhou and others
to dance here.

34
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,243
- Right.
- They must be very happy.

35
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:51,724
- This way, please.
- A place to dance.

36
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,323
Okay.

37
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,923
Why is the emergency equipment out?

38
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:54,883
Right.

39
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,764
It seems to be pushed over from there.
Let's take a look.

40
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,204
The patient has lost vital signs.

41
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,164
Notify the family.

42
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:02,404
Okay.

43
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,883
Hasn't it only been a few days?

44
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,644
Right.

45
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:06,936
She passed away.

46
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,764
- Right.
- Just a few days.

47
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:09,683
The family has arrived.

48
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:35,099
(In deep mourning for Ms. Chen Shuzhen)

49
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:03,243
(Grandma,)

50
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,323
(your cheongsam is ready.)

51
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:28,803
Grandma.

52
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,923
I've brought you the dancing shoes.

53
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:39,404
Didn't you love dancing the most?

54
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:43,003
I had thought

55
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,323
that you could teach me how to dance.

56
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:48,483
But it's okay.

57
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,883
Take these shoes with you.

58
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:52,683
When getting there,

59
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,644
you can keep on dancing.

60
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:57,164
Go get ready.

61
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:57,724
Okay.

62
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,644
Miss Mai,

63
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,044
it's about time.

64
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,803
Friends and relatives
of Ms. Chen Shuzhen,

65
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:26,243
thank you all for gathering here today.

66
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,483
Grandma passed away at a ripe old age,

67
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:30,284
which is considered a happy funeral.

68
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,524
Grandma loved smiling
when she was alive,

69
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,923
and didn't like crying.

70
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:37,603
So today,

71
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,764
all of us who are gathering here

72
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,563
must not be sad.

73
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:44,044
Let's cheerfully

74
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,683
send Grandma off for her final journey.

75
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:49,484
Miss Mai,

76
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:52,563
Ms. Chen wanted me to share some words
with everyone.

77
00:08:59,203 --> 00:08:59,884
Hello everyone,

78
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:02,443
I'm Ms. Chen Shuzhen's attorney.

79
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,563
Ms. Chen Shuzhen,
as the protagonist of today,

80
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,884
also has some words to say to everyone.

81
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:09,644
Before she passed away,

82
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,723
she recorded a video and gave it to me,

83
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,884
hoping that at the future funeral,

84
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,524
she could make her final farewell

85
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,404
to everyone in this way.

86
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,843
Hello everyone,

87
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,164
this is a trick I learned

88
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:40,244
from watching videos online.

89
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,044
I'm a person

90
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,683
loving to try new things most.

91
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:49,284
Now I can use it
to say goodbye to everyone.

92
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:51,404
When it's played at my funeral
in the future,

93
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,364
that will be quite novel.

94
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,764
My greatest ability

95
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,244
is to bring together

96
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:02,004
a group of strangers,

97
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,004
and make all of us friends

98
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,683
and family.

99
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:09,083
I told my granddaughter

100
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,644
that human was born alone,

101
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:18,004
but when people come together,
they are no longer alone.

102
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,923
Today, I see that everyone
is bustling with excitement.

103
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,603
I am very happy.

104
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,004
As for myself,

105
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,644
I have lived a life that's worth it.

106
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,563
With so many people loving me,

107
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,284
I am very satisfied

108
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:35,923
and also very fortunate.

109
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:39,524
But there's no banquet
that doesn't end eventually.

110
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,083
After all,

111
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,284
I have to leave one day.

112
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:46,603
But as I think,

113
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:50,244
I'm not truly leaving you all,

114
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:54,004
and I will accompany you in another way.

115
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:56,723
In a few decades,

116
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,443
perhaps we can

117
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,884
meet in heaven.

118
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,923
I still have a few words to my family.

119
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,603
Laitian,

120
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,723
we've been mother and son for a while.

121
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,764
But I feel

122
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,923
that you are not
as charming as your father was.

123
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:22,563
I wonder

124
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,083
if you have given all your love to Liu.

125
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,843
That's not bad either.

126
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:30,563
A man who loves his wife

127
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,164
is blessed.

128
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:35,284
Liu,

129
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:37,484
you must learn to be relaxed.

130
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,683
The children are all grown up.

131
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,004
Giving them more space

132
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,603
is your lesson to learn.

133
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:45,603
Chengzao,

134
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,083
I haven't taken care of you much.

135
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,764
But I know

136
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,284
that you are a filial child.

137
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,764
Boys should be confident.

138
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,164
You are also my pride.

139
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,284
Zhiming,

140
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,923
my dear grandson,

141
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,644
if there's a chance,

142
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:12,164
please convey a message to my son

143
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:15,004
that I'm leaving.

144
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,644
I've taken care of his son

145
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,203
for him.

146
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,563
Tell him to take good care of himself,

147
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,683
and not to become a burden

148
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,884
to others when he gets old.

149
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:32,443
And you.

150
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,323
I've already brought you
into the Mai family.

151
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,284
At least you have a family now.

152
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:45,963
Don't wander around all day
like a stray cat.

153
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,004
That makes others worry.

154
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,124
Chenghuan,

155
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,884
my dearest little granddaughter,

156
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:21,443
I guess that during these past few days,

157
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:24,364
you have been very strong,

158
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:29,083
and you probably didn't
even get any sleep.

159
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:33,203
You have held my funeral very well,

160
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,484
and made good arrangements
for the family.

161
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,404
Even for Zhiming,

162
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,044
you have comforted him as well.

163
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:45,723
I always taught you

164
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:47,764
to be independent.

165
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,364
Only with independence,

166
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:51,484
can you have more options.

167
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,443
You've learned well,

168
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:56,004
and I'm very pleased.

169
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:58,764
I've nothing left to teach you,

170
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:00,404
but,

171
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,404
I still have a few words

172
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:03,963
to tell you.

173
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,644
Living a life without relying on others

174
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,164
is great,

175
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:13,963
but is also very hard.

176
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:18,323
So when you're tired, it's okay to rest,

177
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,404
and it's okay to cry if you want to.

178
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,923
Be kind to yourself,

179
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:25,244
and take care of yourself.

180
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:27,723
And remember,

181
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,244
I will always be your confidant.

182
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,723
Anytime, anywhere,

183
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:34,803
I'll always be with you,

184
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:37,723
blessing you.

185
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:43,603
Alright,

186
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,723
that's all I want to say.

187
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,203
Come one, have some of this.

188
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,563
Go ahead.

189
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:40,803
Mom,

190
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,884
if you care about Huan,
you need to let her know.

191
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:43,644
Go ahead.

192
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,803
Come on, I'll go with you.

193
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:55,923
Huan.

194
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:17,443
I'm fine.

195
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:48,843
Huan,

196
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,563
you've been tired for several days.

197
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,323
Come home today.

198
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,963
Let's have a meal together,
and you can have a good rest.

199
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,403
Dad, Mom,

200
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,083
I want to go

201
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,244
to Grandma's nursing home

202
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:22,603
and take a look.

203
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:24,843
You may go home.

204
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:53,803
Birth, aging, sickness, death,
and unrequited love.

205
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:57,123
Life is a long journey for everyone.

206
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:59,004
When getting heartbroken,

207
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:00,724
just take it as a fall

208
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,484
outside the door.

209
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,603
Don't be disappointed in yourself.

210
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:09,284
And don't let those who look down on you

211
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,363
get the better of you.

212
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,924
We're not afraid of crying.

213
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,204
But,

214
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,363
we have to cry for something worthwhile.

215
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,643
After the pain and the tears,

216
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,684
isn't it just fine
to get up and move on?

217
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,123
Rest assured.

218
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:28,204
I will always

219
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:30,563
support you.

220
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,123
It's the two of us.

221
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,163
Make sure to keep wearing it
from now on, okay?

222
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,284
I will definitely wear it.

223
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,044
I will definitely wear it.

224
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,964
I love it so much.

225
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,083
Look, how about this tree?

226
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,643
It looks a bit strange.

227
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:27,960
This tree

228
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,872
was planted in the spring you left,

229
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:35,083
when you cried and insisted on
planting it with me.

230
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:38,363
Look, it's grown so tall now.

231
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:12,843
Grandma.

232
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:16,563
Grandma.

233
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:21,204
Grandma,

234
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,843
where did you go?

235
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:28,044
I've been looking for you
for so long, Grandma.

236
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:33,444
I have come

237
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:37,403
to say goodbye to you.

238
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:47,924
Grandma,

239
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:51,924
I still want to do many things with you.

240
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,843
I don't want to say goodbye yet.

241
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,403
Silly girl.

242
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:01,964
When people

243
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,964
are born,

244
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:08,323
they have to face this new world alone.

245
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,524
And when they die,

246
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:13,284
they have to say goodbye alone too.

247
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:17,363
Humans are born alone.

248
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:21,524
We're not related by blood.

249
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:24,044
But,

250
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:28,204
I have accompanied you for a while.

251
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:31,323
It's our destiny.

252
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,044
Grandma,

253
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:38,563
even if we're not related by blood,

254
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,163
you are still my grandma.

255
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:45,044
Of course.

256
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:48,964
I have been contented

257
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:52,363
my whole life.

258
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,484
Regarding life and death,

259
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,803
I have no regrets.

260
00:24:58,323 --> 00:24:59,524
The way ahead,

261
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:02,444
you will have to walk alone.

262
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:06,083
Are you ready?

263
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,244
I am not ready.

264
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:14,484
Grandma,

265
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:17,083
please don't go, okay?

266
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,204
Silly girl,

267
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,803
there's no banquet
that doesn't end eventually.

268
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,524
I'm saying goodbye to you.

269
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,044
Consider it as a farewell.

270
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:35,643
Grandma.

271
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:37,284
I should go now.

272
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:54,444
Grandma.

273
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:04,284
Grandma.

274
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,563
Grandma.

275
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,204
Grandma.

276
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,643
Grandma.

277
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:28,244
Grandma.

278
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:21,563
Grandma's flowers have all wilted.

279
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,244
Mai Chenghuan,

280
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:29,764
thank you
for arranging the farewell ceremony,

281
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,363
letting Grandma leave with dignity.

282
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,603
Why do you thank me?

283
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,004
She is your grandma,

284
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,883
and she is also my grandma.

285
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,323
I just feel it's all of a sudden,

286
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,204
so I can't adapt to it for the moment.

287
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,044
I always feel
like Grandma is still here.

288
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:58,004
She is still eating crabs in Xing'anli,

289
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:00,643
and says to me,

290
00:28:01,843 --> 00:28:02,883
"Huan, let's go."

291
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:06,803
"I'll buy you
a dress and leather shoes."

292
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,244
When making the cheongsam,

293
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,444
you told me something
about Grandma.

294
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,004
Today, I also want to tell you

295
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,284
a few memories of Grandma

296
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,484
I had when I was little.

297
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,524
When I was seven or eight years old,

298
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,204
my family's business failed
and went bankrupt.

299
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:42,044
My dad had no money to repay debts,

300
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:44,724
and he ran away,
leaving my mom and me behind.

301
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:47,484
For many years after,

302
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,204
people often came to the door
demanding debts and causing damage.

303
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,964
Go find that bad guy who owes you money,
if you can.

304
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:01,004
Go find that bad guy who owes you money.

305
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,204
What does it have to do with us?

306
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:03,123
What are you doing?

307
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,044
Don't take anything.

308
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,244
How can we live if you take everything?

309
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,323
My mother couldn't repay the debts.

310
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:17,883
So she took me and fled
from place to place.

311
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:21,363
From one boyfriend's place

312
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:23,883
to her next boyfriend's place.

313
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:25,244
Let's go.

314
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,724
Are you waiting for your dad
to pay off the debts?

315
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,244
I felt like trash,

316
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,244
being kicked around.

317
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:36,924
But in order to live,

318
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:39,764
there was no other way.

319
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:49,004
My grandma showed up
at the critical moment.

320
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:50,843
She gave us a hand.

321
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:53,843
I remembered it very clearly.

322
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:58,004
She took a plane
for more than ten hours.

323
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:00,724
She was wearing high heels

324
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:02,484
and sunglasses,

325
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:04,843
with her hair done up high.

326
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:10,244
She took out a thick envelope
from her purse,

327
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:11,803
and told my mom

328
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:14,563
to pay off the debts first.

329
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,044
She said that hiding was not a solution

330
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,163
and I still needed to study.

331
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,163
My mom thought she had met a savior.

332
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:26,083
Just as she was about to get closer,

333
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,643
Grandma said something to her.

334
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:35,684
You should know what Grandma would say.

335
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,083
Complaining is also useless,

336
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:41,244
while one's matters

337
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:42,484
have to be handled by oneself,

338
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:44,643
and self-reliance is the most important.

339
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:47,123
About this,

340
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,083
Grandma has said to my mother
for countless times.

341
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,123
Yes, that's the one.

342
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,643
Then Grandma took me out for a big meal,

343
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,323
urging me to study hard,

344
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:03,603
and saying that she would bear

345
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,643
my tuition and living expenses.

346
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,284
Seeing how excellent you are now,

347
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:14,843
Grandma must be very gratified.

348
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,323
In fact, I've always blamed her.

349
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:27,123
I blamed her
for not disciplining her son properly,

350
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,403
and for watching my family
heading towards the abyss.

351
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:36,004
although she was capable.

352
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:40,204
Do you still

353
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,044
blame Grandma now?

354
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,123
I did before,

355
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:49,924
but then I came to realize,

356
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:53,403
if it weren't for Grandma's guidance
at that time,

357
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:56,883
I wouldn't have worked so hard
and persevered until today.

358
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,444
I'm very grateful to grandma,

359
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,204
and I have a lot of respect for her.

360
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,004
I also miss her a lot.

361
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,044
She was my only family in this world.

362
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,484
But from now on...

363
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:22,603
From now on,

364
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:25,044
Grandma will always be with us.

365
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,004
She is watching us from heaven.

366
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,163
As long as we often think of her,

367
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:38,684
Grandma will always be there.

368
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,643
Help me get info on the apartment owner
downstairs. I'm late.

369
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,444
Okay, right away.

370
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:28,444
Chenghuan, given what happened
in your family,

371
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:30,163
you don't need to rush all at once

372
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:31,964
back to the normal workload.

373
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,163
Slack off properly sometimes.

374
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,123
Consider it as a break for yourself.

375
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,204
Rest assured. I'm alright now.

376
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:41,524
Don't worry about me.

377
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:43,924
Then I'm relieved.

378
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:45,004
I'm going to work now.

379
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:45,724
Go ahead.

380
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:01,123
Hello, He Dong.

381
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:01,924
Chenghuan,

382
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,204
is it convenient for you to come
and check on my boss?

383
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:07,684
Recently, he's been working
around the clock

384
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,163
for over half a month now.

385
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:10,804
I've asked him to take a good rest,

386
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:11,804
but he didn't listen.

387
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:13,404
I really don't know what to do.

388
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,044
Don't worry.

389
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,603
I'll go check on him after work today.

390
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:17,044
Okay.

391
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:18,603
Bye bye.

392
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,123
Boss,

393
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:38,563
can you please take a good rest
and get some sleep?

394
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:40,203
Otherwise, you'll get a headache again.

395

(Ibuprofen Sustained-Release Capsules)

396
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:04,563
Come in.

397
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:17,444
It's so messy. Let me help you tidy up.

398
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,643
No need. Just leave it as it is.

399
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:43,524
Don't numb yourself with work anymore.

400
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:46,683
Let's go see Grandma together tomorrow.

401
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,884
By the way,

402
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,123
when you smile,

403
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:55,804
you look quite handsome.

404
00:36:58,924 --> 00:36:59,643
I'm leaving.

405
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,563
(The tomb of the late ancestor
Yao's wife, Chen Shuzhen)

406
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:34,643
Grandma, we've come to see you.

407
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:37,324
We brought all the snacks you loved,

408
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:39,324
drunken crab and butterfly pastries.

409
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:40,924
Are you delightful?

410
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,243
You look gloomy.

411
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:51,283
Grandma would be angry
when seeing you like this.

412
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,563
Grandma visited me in a dream yesterday,

413
00:37:58,563 --> 00:37:59,844
telling me many things.

414
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:02,283
Want to know what Grandma said to me?

415
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:03,444
What did she say?

416
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:05,884
Grandma said,

417
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,964
because you didn't sleep well,

418
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,123
she couldn't

419
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,563
come to find you in your dreams.

420
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:15,896
Grandma, Mai Chenghuan is so bored.

421
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,656
(The tomb of the late ancestor Yao's wife,
Chen Shuzhen)

422
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,763
Even though Grandma has left you,

423
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,404
you still have us.

424
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:32,163
If you want to eat steamed rice balls
or noodles with pork chop in the future,

425
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:33,844
just tell me. I'll take you there.

426
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:37,524
I'm telling you,
dietary therapy is very effective.

427
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,844
Before, I missed Grandma a lot.

428
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,804
When I was very sad,

429
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:45,283
I'd eat these things at midnight.

430
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,044
I didn't care about getting fat.

431
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:49,723
Eventually, I got through it.

432
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:50,723
Chenghuan,

433
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,364
there's something I need to tell you.

434
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:57,563
Excuse me.

435
00:38:57,563 --> 00:38:58,163
It's fine.

436
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,444
Hello.

437
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,603
Excuse me, is that Mai Chenghuan?

438
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:05,884
Yes, and you are?

439
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,004
I'm the attorney
representing Ms. Chen Shuzhen.

440
00:39:08,163 --> 00:39:09,844
We met at the memorial service.

441
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,524
May I ask what this is regarding?

442
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:15,203
I have a will from Ms. Chen Shuzhen,

443
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,484
and you are required
to visit our law firm tomorrow.

444
00:39:17,484 --> 00:39:18,603
Me?

445
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:19,643
Yes.

446
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:21,603
Okay, thank you.

447
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:25,964
Grandma's attorney

448
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,404
told me to go to the law firm tomorrow.

449
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:30,444
It's about Grandma's will.

450
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,824
They could've just called you.

451
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:34,243
Why do they need to involve me?

452
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:36,004
Isn't it normal to call you?

453
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:37,683
You're also Grandma's family.

454
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,884
You seem so calm.

455
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:42,004
Aren't you afraid that Grandma
would leave me the good stuff?

456
00:39:42,324 --> 00:39:43,603
Grandma loved you so much.

457
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,004
It was right if she left it to you.

458
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:50,083
You just mentioned you had something
to tell me. What is it?

459
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:53,563
How about

460
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,640
we visit the law firm

461
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,664
and have a meal tomorrow?

462
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:57,804
And then I'll tell you.

463
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:00,964
Not a big deal. Why all the secrecy?

464
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:02,203
Alright then.

465
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:15,643
Thank you.

466
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:22,524
Chenghuan really did it, didn't she?

467
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:24,484
I've been calling for days,
but you didn't come.

468
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,603
As soon as she talked to you,
you are here.

469
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:29,924
Seriously,

470
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:33,004
after so much time,

471
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:35,804
aren't you planning
to take your relationship to next level?

472
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,844
Never mind.
I won't ask about these things.

473
00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:44,524
Let's discuss business.

474
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,484
The inheritance will be announced
tomorrow.

475
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:48,844
After you get Xing'anli,

476
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:50,603
are you going back to Switzerland?

477
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:29,804
Then let's begin.

478
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:35,256
This will was drafted
by Ms. Chen Shuzhen

479
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:36,804
personally.

480
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:39,083
The most recent change was made

481
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:42,683
on the morning of the day
when she passed away.

482
00:41:55,203 --> 00:41:56,484
Ms. Chen Shuzhen

483
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:58,683
has left all her jewelry

484
00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:00,563
to Liu Wanyu,

485
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:02,563
in gratitude for Liu Wanyu's

486
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,283
contributions to the Mai family.

487
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:08,964
Ms. Chen Shuzhen has allocated
all the funds in her account

488
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:11,283
to be inherited by Mai Chenghuan.

489
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,243
Under Ms. Chen Shuzhen's name,

00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:22,243

00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:26,763
including the attic balcony
and property rights of the garden,

493
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:29,083
will be inherited by Yao Zhiming.

494
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:32,964
Under Ms. Chen Shuzhen's name,

495
00:42:33,123 --> 00:42:36,804
built from 1930 to 1938,

00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:39,004

and Fuyang Road, Xuhui District,

00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,044
the Xing'anli Hotel Group

499
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:46,364
is a property independently owned
by Ms. Chen Shuzhen,

500
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,163
and its property rights are to be held
by JinCheng Law Firm,

501
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:50,123
on her behalf,

502
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:51,444
for a period of ten years.

503
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,760
Upon the expiration of ten years,
