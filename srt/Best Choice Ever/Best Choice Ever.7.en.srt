=Episode 7=

3
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,529
You've just returned home.
Just focus on your work.

4
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,490
You don't have to often visit me.

5
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,210
From a professional standpoint,

6
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,529
I think you can entrust someone
with the management

7
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,049
of Xing'anli to make it
to the next level.

8
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,249
Who can I entrust?

9
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:49,529
Me, your grandson.

10
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,329
And Mai Chenghuan.

11
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,329
I'll work with her.

12
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:58,169
We both do it together.

13
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,689
It's a win-win cooperation.

14
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,090
Zhiming, you don't know
what a family means.

15
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,809
Try this.

16
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,210
Grandma, eat less crab.

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,729
Crabs are cold in nature

18
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,009
and not good for your health.

19
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,009
If I were young,

20
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,210
I would be willing to eat less

21
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,569
to live a healthy life.

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,050
But I am over 80.

23
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,129
I don't care
if I'm keeping a healthy lifestyle.

24
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,729
Here, have some.

25
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:39,210
It goes with the vinegar.

26
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,249
Okay, and there's one more thing.

27
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,210
I've found

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,450
some top private medical facilities.

29
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,450
I plan to get you a membership.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,890
If you don't feel well,

31
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,849
their medical staff will diagnose you.

32
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,490
A membership?

33
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:59,569
No need to cost your money.

34
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,770
It's necessary.
Otherwise, I can't focus on my work.

35
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,729
It is well worth the money.

36
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,610
A membership? Insurance?

37
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,808
You swindler.

38
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:26,610
Grandma. Mom, what happened?

39
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,849
Your mom hit my grandson.

40
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,888
Your grandson?

41
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,632
Hi.

42
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,370
Mr. Yao?

43
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,729
You know each other?

44
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,809
Mom, this is my new boss, Mr. Yao.

45
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,370
My name is Yao Zhiming.

46
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,770
I'm Grandma's grandson.

47
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,289
Grandma, I didn't know about this.

48
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,330
Are you alright, Mr. Yao?

49
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,770
Do you need to apply some ice?

50
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,849
Why do you have ice in your bag?

51
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,570
I heard that my mom hit someone,

52
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,529
so I bought it at a convenience store.

53
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,169
Use it to make the swelling down.

54
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,729
Take a seat.

55
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,450
Grandma, you must have been startled.
Have an orange.

56
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,130
Liu, why are you so impulsive?

57
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,130
Chenghuan is more sensible than you.

58
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,609
No, let me explain.

59
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,450
Mom, this is what I was thinking.

60
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,169
I thought he was a bad guy,
doing a pyramid scheme.

61
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,169
I was worried about you.

62
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,409
I tried to protect you.

63
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,770
I'm really sorry, Zhao.

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,890
Never mind, but I'm Yao.

66
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,289
Yao.

67
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:31,010
I've been wanting
to introduce him to you.

68
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,169
But Zhiming was worried
it might cause you trouble.

69
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,650
So, he didn't let me do that.

70
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:49,010
Liu, are you here for something?

71
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,690
No, nothing.

72
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:57,690
Mom, Huan has visited you

73
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,369
on behalf of my whole family.

74
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,210
Today, I'm here to tell you
the good news.

75
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,169
Huan is getting married soon.

76
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,250
- Where's the ring?
- I took it off.

77
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,609
What? Why?

78
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,010
- Why?
- Huan.

79
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,570
Is your fiance the guy who went on
a blind date behind your back?

80
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:24,810
Mom, it's not Xin Jialiang's fault.

81
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,770
We met Xin Jialiang's family yesterday.

82
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,810
Mom, don't bother Grandma with this.

83
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,289
It's okay. Let me finish.

84
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,690
Xin Jialiang's family really upset me.

85
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,929
They have their noses in the air.

86
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,770
They know my family doesn't have money.

87
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,609
So, they aren't satisfied with Huan.

88
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,810
It makes me so mad.

89
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,289
She's my only daughter.

90
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,010
I don't want others to look down on her.

91
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,210
Mom.

92
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,409
You can give her more dowry.

93
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,250
Yes, exactly.

94
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,130
But I can't afford to do that.

95
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,969
Mom, I know you like Huan.

96
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,570
You know, marriage is a big deal.

97
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:22,289
Could you help her with her wedding?

98
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,130
Enough, Mom. When will you understand?

99
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,810
It's not
about whether Grandma can help or not.

100
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,969
They look down on us

101
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,969
no matter what we do. Do you understand?

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,609
Huan, let's go out
to enjoy the sunshine.

103
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:56,650
Sorry again, Yao.

104
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,330
Grandma, my mom doesn't mean to be rude.

105
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,890
Please don't blame her.

106
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,169
She's just anxious about my marriage.

107
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,010
You have to be calm
and think carefully about it.

108
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,570
You have to know what you want.

109
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,650
I kind of don't know what to do.

110
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,849
Jialiang and I were
in a stable relationship.

111
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,690
I thought
that if the two of us worked hard,

112
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,729
we could live a happy life together.

113
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,849
But I realized I was too naive

114
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,369
when our families met.

115
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,290
Marriage is the integration
of two families.

116
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,050
The two families
have different opinions,

117
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,009
with so many conflicts from the start.

118
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,330
There will be more difficulties
in the future.

119
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,290
Do you have the courage to face them?

120
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,450
I do, but I'm not sure if Jialiang does.

121
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,009
Grandma, I feel increasingly

122
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,330
that Jialiang has changed.

123
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,930
So, what can I do for you?

124
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,330
Grandma, you don't need to help me.

125
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,290
I must resolve this matter on my own.

126
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,369
When I was young, I had the disease.

127
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,210
You paid for my treatment.

128
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,249
And you took great care of me.

129
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,729
I am very grateful.

130
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:46,849
Now that I've grown up,

131
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,729
I want to make a better life
for my family on my own.

132
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,129
This is what I have been striving for.

133
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,170
I have never thought of soaring high
by marrying someone.

134
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:01,210
But I'm in between my mom and Jialiang.

135
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,410
I don't know what to do.

136
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:14,729
Huan, this bracelet has fine quality.

137
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,849
I've worn it for most of my life.

138
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,489
Today, I give it to you.

139
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,729
No, this is too precious.
I can't accept it.

140
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,769
My mother gave this to me.

141
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:31,609
I tell you the same words
she said to me.

142
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:37,609
Huan, whether you get married or not,

143
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:40,330
there's the possibility
of regret in the future.

144
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,609
You have the right to regret it.

145
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,729
But you must know

146
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,729
what you really want.

147
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,009
What's your trash?

148
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,930
Hazardous waste, Auntie.

149
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,969
Auntie? Who's your auntie?

150
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,249
I'm not related to you.

151
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,489
I tell you once more.

152
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,810
My name is Yao Zhiming.

153
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,050
I'm Ms. Chen Shuzhen's grandson.

154
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,170
I'm related to her through blood.

155
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,369
So what?

156
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,489
Why have you disappeared for years?

157
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,729
Who knows if you're lying?

158
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,410
Maybe you're an imposter.

159
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,729
Although I lived abroad,

160
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,769
I stayed in touch with Grandma.

161
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,889
So, what are you back for now?

162
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,009
To trick her into buying insurance.

163
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,330
You really are an insurance salesman?

164
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,849
You have no conscience.

165
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:17,810
Are you trying to fool your own grandma?

166
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,129
Listen, she doesn't have much money.

167
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,129
And she's my family.

168
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:25,290
I can't let you cheat her.

169
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,009
How do you know she has no money?

170
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,969
Perhaps she doesn't like
to show off her wealth.

171
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,930
I knew it.

172
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,690
You're not a good man.

173
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,249
Look at you.

174
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,450
You have ill intentions.

175
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,369
I warn you.

176
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,210
She doesn't have much money.

177
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,009
She just has her retirement pension.

178
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,489
After paying the bunk fee and meal fee,

179
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,889
she has little money left.

180
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,170
Don't try to get money from her.

181
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,410
She has no money to buy insurance.

182
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,530
(Do they not know
about Grandma's true situation?)

183
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,930
How old are you?

184
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,570
Are you married?

185
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,210
Do you have children?

186
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,369
How can you be Huan's leader?

187
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,530
You have so many questions about me.

188
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:17,889
Are you going to set me up?

189
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,290
No girl wants to be your girlfriend.

190
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:24,530
What happened?

191
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,609
I'm telling you.

192
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,450
I just offended him
to protect your grandma.

193
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,530
Be careful of him.

194
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,969
He doesn't seem like a good person.

195
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,009
Enough, Mom.

196
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,450
If you go on like this,
I will lose my job.

197
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,410
He didn't scrape off the fish scales.

198
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,450
Time to cook the meal.

199
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,889
Yu, you're back.

200
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,009
You came back so early.

201
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,729
I bought a carp.
Do you cook, or should I?

202
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:57,769
I'll cook.

203
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,050
I don't trust your cooking.

204
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,090
Leave it to me.

205
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,530
You didn't scrape off the fish scales?

206
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,930
Remember to ask the vendor to do it.

207
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,369
How come you two came back together?
Where have you been?

208
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,330
I went to see Grandma with Mom.

209
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,330
Her grandma gave her a bracelet.

210
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,170
Show it to Dad.

211
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,609
Look.

212
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,969
It looks expensive.

213
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,930
Mom, it's Grandma's most precious thing.

214
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,170
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

215
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,410
I will cherish it.

216
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,930
Why did you bother her?

217
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,170
What's wrong with that?

218
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,810
I have to think about Huan's dowry.

219
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,690
Haven't I told you?

220
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,304
- Wait for the demolition compensation.
- My foot.

221
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,729
That's going to take forever.

222
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,489
I'm tired of hearing it.

223
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,930
We can't let Huan get married
without her dowry.

224
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:56,930
Enough, Mom.

225
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,369
I know you are worried about me.

226
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,889
But getting married is my own business.

227
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,969
Let me decide on my own, okay?

228
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,530
Huan, take a rest.

229
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:12,930
When the meal is ready,
I'll let you know.

230
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,849
Alright, I will cook.

231
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,530
I'm going to change my clothes.

232
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:41,769
Grandma, I will arrange a better place
for you to live.

233
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:43,649
And I'll hire someone to look after you.

234
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:46,769
No need. It's quite good living here.

235
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,969
Keep this card
and buy whatever you like.

236
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,090
I know you're not short of money.

237
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,050
I just want to do something for you.

238
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:03,290
I lack nothing.

239
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:07,489
Chenghuan has taken good care of me
over the years.

240
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,090
Is Chenghuan doing well at work?

241
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,969
Yeah, she works very hard.

242
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,889
I have to tell you.

243
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,450
You mustn't boss her around.

244
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,369
Although you are not related by blood,

245
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,410
you have to treat her like your sister.

246
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,050
You must take good care of her.

247
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,849
I know you came to see me for something.

248
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:42,450
This is my assessment for you.

249
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,930
Grandma, I visit you out of concern.

250
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,489
Good.

251
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,330
Get along well with Huan.

252
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,810
I will do as you say.

253
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,369
- Chenghuan.
- Mr. Zhu.

254
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,970
I'll give you an important job.

255
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,849
Mr. Yao is in a meeting
in the banquet hall on the first floor.

256
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,570
I need you
to hand him an important document.

257
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,530
- Right now?
- Yes.

258
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,530
Do I need to relay any message
to Mr. Yao?

259
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,169
No, you don't have to say anything.

260
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,369
I have a family matter to deal with.

261
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,290
There's an activity
at my son's school today.

262
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,290
Originally, my wife would join it.

263
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,530
But she suddenly can't make it.

264
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,570
So I have to go instead.

265
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,490
Otherwise, I should personally
deliver it to Mr. Yao.

266
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,010
It's fine. Leave it to me.

267
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,209
You can buy Mr. Yao a cup of coffee.
I'll reimburse you.

268
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,490
No, I'll take care of it.

269
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,169
- I'll reimburse you.
- Bye, Mr. Zhu.

270
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,290
What important mission?
Isn't Mr. Yao downstairs?

271
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,369
Mr. Zhu left out the documents.

272
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,770
He asked you to take the fall.

273
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,770
Alright, stop gossiping
behind the boss' back.

274
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,490
Besides, I want to join the meeting.

275
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,530
I'll buy you a coffee.

276
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,929
Your proposal was so flashy.

277
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,409
When do you plan to hold a wedding?

278
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,770
How about I give you a discount?

279
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,970
You help me boost my performance.

280
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,609
No problem. Help me tidy the table up.

281
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,169
My app shows that I have booked a room.

282
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,449
If you don't arrange a room
for me within ten minutes,

283
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,090
I'll complain about you to your manager.

284
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,449
I am sorry, madam.

285
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,730
There might be an issue
with the booking system.

286
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,770
I do not see your booking information.

287
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,929
Currently, the business rooms
are fully booked.

288
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,050
I am sorry, madam.

289
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,330
Didn't you hear me?

290
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,570
I'll say it again.

291
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,250
If you don't arrange a room
for me within ten minutes,

292
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,770
I'll let your manager fire you.

293
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,970
Even so, I can't help.

294
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,689
- Please stop filming.
- What?

295
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,129
- Thank you.
- Watch your manner.

296
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:46,929
I'm going to expose you.

297
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,530
How unprofessional you are.

298
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,090
- Madam.
- This is the Botticelli Hotel.

299
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,330
Madam, I am Mai Chenghuan,

300
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,129
the manager of the Marketing
and Sales Department.

301
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,290
I'm at your service.

302
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,010
Mai Chenghuan?

303
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,730
You must resolve this issue.

304
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,290
Otherwise, I will expose you

305
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:08,570
and let the netizens see
how your hotel makes ill-gotten money.

306
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,369
I fully understand your feelings.

307
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,609
I guess you must have just returned
from abroad.

308
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,570
You must be exhausted
from the long-haul flight.

309
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,090
If I were in your shoes,
I would be very angry too.

310
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:21,770
I haven't returned for over a decade.

311
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,010
The first hotel
I chose upon returning was Botticelli.

312
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,010
And such a frustrating thing happened.

313
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,330
I understand you.

314
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,250
Madam, I have an idea.

315
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:32,250
Take a rest for a moment.

316
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,129
I'll offer you a fruit platter.

317
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:36,090
Then I will immediately fix the problem.

318
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,330
Let me help. This way, madam.
Carry the luggage.

319
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,570
Listen, I've been filming.

320
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,129
Don't you try any tricks.

321
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,090
I was told
there were no available rooms.

322
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,770
I'd like to see how you get me a room.

323
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,810
I will resolve it right away.

324
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,369
Are there any rooms available now?

325
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:56,169
Our hotel has been
hosting conferences recently.

326
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,609
I guess the Room Division
made a mistake.

327
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,530
We have no available rooms now.

328
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:01,810
Do you have a solution?

329
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,209
Right away, madam, please wait.

330
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,609
Just a moment, please.

331
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,090
Mr. Yao, Mr. Zhu asked me
to give it to you.

332
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,730
And as you have already seen,

333
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,250
it is quite urgent now.

334
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,010
I have an impertinent request.

335
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,010
Could you offer up your executive suite?

336
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,689
That's not appropriate.

337
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,770
Okay. It's urgent. Here.

338
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,290
Thank you. I will have them
take care of your belongings.

339
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,090
That's quite selfless of you.

340
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,129
It will be resolved.

341
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,010
Mr. Yao has given his room to the guest.

342
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,649
Let the room service staff tidy it up.

343
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:47,409
Take good care of Mr. Yao's belongings.

344
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,250
- I see, Chenghuan.
- Madam, it's already fixed.

345
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,609
I just got permission from my boss.

346
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,530
He also just returned home.

347
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,129
So, he has empathy for your situation

348
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,770
and approved an executive suite for you.

349
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:04,570
- Are you satisfied with this solution?
- It's fine.

350
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,689
Without Chenghuan's help,
you would have been in big trouble.

351
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:08,810
Thank you for your understanding.

352
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,010
It may take a while to tidy up the room.

353
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,409
I'll accompany you for a while.
This way, please.

354
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,730
- Chenghuan, you're back.
- Chenghuan.

355
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:40,409
- Chenghuan.
- Mr. Zhu.

356
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:45,010
Didn't I ask you
to deliver the materials to Mr. Yao?

357
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,050
How come you upgraded the room instead?

358
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:50,649
Was that your idea?

359
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:53,050
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhu.

360
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,209
It was urgent at the time,
so I handled it on my own.

361
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,810
Well done.

362
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,649
That guest wrote a promotional article.

363
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,810
It made the front page
of the review website.

364
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,152
And she specifically thanked you.
Take a look.

365
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:13,656
(To the leaders of Botticelli )

366
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,169
You've saved us a substantial amount
in marketing expenses.

367
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,369
Mr. Zhu, you ought to thank Mr. Yao.

368
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,449
If he hadn't given his room
to the guest,

369
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:25,810
I wouldn't have been able to fix it.

370
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,050
Mr. Zhu, I think
you can advise the Room Division

371
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,050
to improve the room booking process.

372
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,290
Chenghuan, we can do them a favor.

373
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,810
But we shouldn't
meddle in their business.

374
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,609
If I intervene,

375
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,530
that's not appropriate.

376
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,169
Mai Chenghuan was right.

377
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,209
If every employee cares

378
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,689
about the company's development
as she does,

379
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,530
our hotel will grow better.

380
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,050
You're right.

381
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,929
I'll go and talk to the Room Division.

382
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,160
I gotta go.

383
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,010
Mr. Yao, thank you for today.

384
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:09,530
If you're free after work,

385
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,889
I would like to buy you a coffee
to express my gratitude.

386
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,369
Sure, see you after work.

387
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,750
Thanks.

388
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,330
Mr. Yao, your coffee.

389
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,290
Give it a try. I'm a regular here.

390
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,369
The coffee is really good.

391
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,209
- How is it?
- Not bad.

392
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,929
Actually, if you want to thank me,

393
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,250
can you accompany me
to visit Grandma on Saturday?

394
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,409
On Saturday? I'll be having tea
with Grandma in Xing'anli.

395
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,129
You often accompany her to Xing'anli?

396
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,169
Yes, Grandma is a regular there.

397
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,929
She loves their tea and pastries.

398
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,104
She goes there often.

399
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,010
You have a good relationship
with Grandma?

400
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,169
Of course, she watched me grow up.

401
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,609
But you two aren't related.

402
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,689
Does that matter?

403
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,970
Mr. Yao, no offense.

404
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,209
But you're her grandson.

405
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:46,570
After all these years,

406
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,609
why hasn't anyone
from your family come to visit Grandma?

407
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:57,409
My Grandpa had someone else
after marrying Grandma.

408
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,530
And Grandma decisively got a divorce.

409
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,330
So Grandpa took my dad
and me abroad to do business.

410
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,169
Grandma has never talked
to me about her past.

411
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,330
She always seems so gentle, resolute,

412
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,449
and optimistic.

413
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,169
I never knew she had such experiences.

414
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,570
Yeah, I was young at that time.

415
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,409
There wasn't much I could do.

416
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,730
If you have time on Saturdays,

417
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,570
- let's visit Grandma together.
- Sure.

418
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,490
Tastes good.

419
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,970
Wake up.

420
00:26:58,689 --> 00:26:59,730
Wake up!

421
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,010
What's wrong with you? I fell asleep.

422
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,770
- Emergency.
- What is it?

423
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,889
Give these to Xin Zhishan tomorrow.

424
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,409
- Who?
- Xin Zhishan, Jialiang's Dad.

425
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:17,090
I've never met him.

426
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,250
I don't know him. Why should I see him?

427
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,609
Mai Laitian.

428
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:23,369
Did you do anything
for your daughter's wedding?

429
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:24,369
Think about it.

430
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,970
You're being evasive to help.

431
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,730
Anyway, this is a top priority.

432
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:33,929
If anything goes wrong
with such an important matter,

433
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:34,929
you'll be fully responsible.

434
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,209
Why is it my responsibility?

435
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,889
Fine, I will do it.

436
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,730
What should I say to him?

437
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:47,689
Let me tell you...

438
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,250
You scared me!

439
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,570
You're sitting on my foot.

440
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,689
Stay still.

441
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,810
He missed the meeting with us last time.

442
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,010
You put the feelers out

443
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,730
to see what he thinks
about his son's wedding.

444
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,290
Visit him to represent our sincerity

445
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:08,570
and improve relations
with them. Understand?

446
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:09,816
Yeah.

447
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,889
Don't sleep.

448
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,250
Think about what to say carefully.

449
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,330
Got it.

450
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,408
Do the gifts look good enough?

451
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:25,970
Yep.

452
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,730
Take a look at them, okay?

453
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:30,970
It's okay?

454
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,050
Yes, it's fine.

455
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

456
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,530
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I don't.

457
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:08,449
If so, I can't let you enter.

458
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,129
Please make an exception.

459
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,010
I am a friend of your boss.

460
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,849
You still need to make an appointment.

461
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,770
I really have something very important.

462
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,090
I'll share some of these pastries
with you if you do me a favor.

463
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,409
No, you have to make an appointment.

464
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,889
Please do me a favor.

465
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:28,449
No, you can't do this.

466
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:30,530
Otherwise, I'll have to call security.

467
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:33,929
Why are you so stubborn? It's important.

468
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,129
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:36,369
- What's the matter?
- Mr. Xin.

470
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:39,129
- What happened?
- This guest claims to be your friend.

471
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,330
But he doesn't have an appointment.

472
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,609
You are Jialiang's father, right?

473
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,530
- I'm Mai Laitian, Chenghuan's father.
- Who?

474
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,929
When we met with your family,

475
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,889
you couldn't make it,
so you didn't know me.

476
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,810
I came specifically to visit you today.

477
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,409
You are Mai Chenghuan's father?

478
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,889
- Yes.
- Mr. Mai.

479
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:08,570
Mr. Xin, you have an appointment
with Mr. Yao of Yueda.

480
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,129
Mr. Mai.

481
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,952
Give me your number
and I'll make an appointment for you.

482
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:14,970
Sorry about this.

483
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,970
Yueda? Are you going to meet
with Yao Zhiming?

484
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:22,689
Yeah, do you know him?

485
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,849
I know him very well.

486
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:26,209
To be frank,

487
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:29,250
I am currently his driver.

488
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:34,449
I'll give you a ride.

489
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,010
I am just about to go to the company.

490
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,250
Okay, please.

491
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,810
- Please.
- Let's go.

492
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,050
- Mr. Mai.
- Okay.

493
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,490
Mr. Xin.

494
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:50,970
There was a misunderstanding
during our meeting.

495
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,889
I guess Jialiang's mother has told you
about it.

496
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,889
It's my wife's fault.

497
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,730
She's short-tempered and inarticulate.

498
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:07,010
So, there was a minor friction.

499
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:08,810
I am truly sorry.

500
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,810
I feel that Jialiang and Huan

501
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,409
still have feelings for each other.

502
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,649
My wife has thought it through.

503
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,810
She thinks that the children's happiness
is the most important thing.

504
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:29,530
About the wedding banquet,

505
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,849
we can discuss it again.

506
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,730
Mr. Mai.

507
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,689
Have you been driving
for Mr. Yao for a long time?

508
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:47,730
I used to drive for Ms. Zhang Peisheng.

509
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,290
Mr. Yao has just returned home.

510
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:55,050
So, Ms. Zhang temporarily assigned me
to work for Mr. Yao.

511
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,409
It means Mr. Yao
and Ms. Zhang trust you a lot.

512
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,250
To be honest,

513
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,530
Mr. Yao is somewhat a relative of mine.

514
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:14,250
Mr. Mai.

515
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,849
Regarding our children's marriage,

516
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,970
we should not interfere too much.

517
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,570
As long as they are happy, right?

518
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,250
You came back so early today.

519
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,609
Don't have to socialize tonight.

520
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,290
Let me get you water.

521
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,810
When you met with the Mai family,

522
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,330
did someone come over to present a gift?

523
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:01,970
Yes, a pair of watches.

524
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:05,010
- It's Yao...
- Yao Zhiming.

525
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,449
Yeah. Yao Zhiming. What's wrong?

526
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,929
He is the new Operations Director

527
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,849
in charge of the bidding process.

528
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,490
Importantly, he's a relative
of the Mai family.

529
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,929
If we maintain this relationship well,

530
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:25,970
the bidding will go well.

531
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,970
We had a terrible time with them.

532
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,090
Exactly.

533
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,929
So what should we do now?

534
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,609
You think of a way

535
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,409
to smooth things over
with the Mai family.

536
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,449
As long as the bidding can be completed,

537
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,090
it's okay to let them get engaged.

538
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:55,849
Okay, I understand.

539
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:00,490
Alright, don't worry. I'll handle this.

540
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:02,490
I'll warm up soup for you.

541
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:13,249
(Zhu Baoqiao)

542
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,329
(Are you asleep?)

543
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,609
I won't talk about work at home.

544
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,898
(Delete)

545
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,570
This is your desk.

546
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,129
Thank you, Tian Feng.

547
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:43,209
I'm not a graduate
of a prestigious university.

548
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,329
So, I came mentally prepared.

549
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,169
I believe I can become permanent
through my own abilities.

550
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,129
I also believe
that I can gain favor with the boss.

551
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:57,209
Where there's a will,
there's a way. Keep it up.

552
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,609
- It's me.
- Chengzao, this is Mr. Liu.

553
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,410
You follow his work arrangements.

554
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,450
Mr. Liu, this is your intern.

555
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:06,410
- Okay.
- You can do it.

556
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:08,410
So, what did he say?

557
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,809
(WeChat QR Code)

558
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:17,649
Alright, I will be there this afternoon.

559
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,209
Mr. Liu, my name is Mai Chengzao.
I am an intern.

560
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,370
I hope we can work well together.

561
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,689
Which school did you graduate from?

562
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,090
(Resume)
This university has a Law Department?

563
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,410
I am surprised.

564
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,649
Has our law firm
lowered its hiring standards?

565
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,609
Mr. Liu, when I was at school,

566
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,970
I had an average score
of over 90 in all subjects.

567
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:48,769
And I received
national professional awards.

568
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:52,169
It's okay to start at a lower level.
Just work harder.

569
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,850
Come with me to get some materials.

570
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:55,329
We will meet clients this afternoon.

571
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,129
Mrs. Mai, why are you so late?

572
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:30,392
You're so early.

573
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:39,890
- Zhang, follow that lady ahead.
- Okay.

574
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:58,129
Let me take a look at the asparagus.

575
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,609
It's 15 yuan per jin.

576
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,490
- How much?
- 15 yuan.

577
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,209
Too expensive. I'm your regular.

578
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:08,090
I'll have to peel them. 10 yuan?

579
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,289
That's a hard bargain.

580
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,530
You can't haggle like that.

581
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,930
- I think I can.
- That won't do.

582
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,450
- Give me two bunches.
- Sure.

583
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,249
Mrs. Xin?

584
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,410
How come you are here?

585
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,329
Mrs. Mai, what a coincidence!

586
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:29,689
I was just about to visit you.

587
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,649
I want to learn
to make hot sauce with you. Can I?

588
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,930
Of course, you can.

589
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,970
Do you need any help?

590
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:46,450
No. Your clothes are silk, right?
They're expensive.

591
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:49,169
Besides, it's white.
Don't get them dirty.

592
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,209
Mrs. Mai.

593
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,970
Jiali was too rude last time.

594
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,850
I didn't discipline her well.

595
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:04,729
But Jialiang's Dad and I like Chenghuan.

596
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,809
She's intelligent,
sensible, and considerate.

597
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:12,010
I rarely see girls

598
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,289
as considerate as her.

599
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:20,649
Yes, I'm proud of my daughter.

600
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,649
She's very sensible.

601
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,570
We have set her up many times before.

602
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,410
And many
of her blind dates are good men.

603
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,490
But somehow,

604
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,530
Huan likes Jialiang.

605
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:41,809
But the thing is, my family is ordinary.

606
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,689
We're not a match for your family.

607
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:48,329
What makes you say that?

608
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,649
Your home is cozy and warm.

609
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,129
Today, I've come to realize

610
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,570
why Chenghuan can make me feel pleasant.

611
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:02,649
That's because she grew up
in a warm and lovely home.

612
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,169
Though I have a big house,
I'm often alone.

613
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,689
I always feel totally empty.

614
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,809
Once Chenghuan marries into my family,
my home will be warmer.

615
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:19,609
Don't just stand there.

616
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,209
If you don't mind, take a seat.

617
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,930
No, I want to

618
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,050
see how you do it. I want to learn.

619
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,570
Take some rest.

620
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,970
Won't you cut the pork skin off?

621
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,850
No, don't cut it.

622
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,689
The pork skin is all that matters.

623
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,450
After it's cooked, it'll be chewy.

624
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,649
- Do you eat duck's gizzard and livers?
- Yeah.

625
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,570
Put this in,

626
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,530
and the taste will be better.

627
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,649
And the dried shrimps.

628
00:39:57,129 --> 00:40:00,890
Remove the fishy flavor,
and keep the water.

629
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:04,129
- Take a rest.
- I'm just learning.

630
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:14,490
- Have some water. It's been purified.
- Thank you.

631
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,129
The weather is getting hot.

632
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,410
Mrs. Mai.

633
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:29,890
I have something else important to say.

634
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,729
About the children's wedding?

635
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,010
We have a lot to do for the wedding.

636
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,729
Let's find time later
to discuss it thoroughly.

637
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,289
We need to find a way
to get the best of both worlds,

638
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,729
making our families
and relatives feel pleasant.

639
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,010
I know you are reasonable.

640
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,410
We both put our heads together

641
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,890
and try to find a perfect solution.
What do you say?

642
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:01,850
- Yes.
- Jialiang's Dad told me

643
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:06,249
that you know Mr. Yao Zhiming
from Yueda Group.

644
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:09,769
I've heard Mr. Yao is not easygoing.

645
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,850
Exactly.

646
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:16,490
I mean, he's difficult to deal with.

647
00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:20,570
He grew up abroad.

648
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:24,010
He doesn't know
how to get along with people.

649
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,450
He always looks cold and distant.

650
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:32,050
And he's very mean.

651
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,050
What a coincidence.

652
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,930
To be honest,

653
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:41,970
my company has been a partnership
with Yueda Group.

654
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,970
Mr. Yao is in charge of the bidding.

655
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:47,809
But we're not familiar with him.

656
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,930
Jialiang's Dad said

657
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,329
Mr. Yao is sort of mysterious.

658
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,930
We failed to find a chance to meet him.

659
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,649
I've heard
that he's looking for new suppliers.

660
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:00,809
Jialiang's Dad
and I have been worried about this.

661
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:06,169
After all, the Yueda Group is one
of our most important clients.

662
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,570
I don't know

663
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,329
about business.

664
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,850
Let me put it this way.

665
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,649
We have been cooperating
with Yueda for many years.

666
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,649
The furniture we sell

667
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,769
is ordered and made
according to Yueda's requirements.

668
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:30,370
If this deal falls through,

669
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,689
we will suffer a great loss.

670
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:38,530
Jialiang and Chenghuan
are getting married.

671
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,850
After Chenghuan marries into my family,

672
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,689
I can't lower the quality of her life.

673
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:54,289
I have to talk to Huan's dad about it.

674
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:56,930
I almost forgot.

675
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,129
