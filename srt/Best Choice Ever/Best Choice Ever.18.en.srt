=Episode 18=

3
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,691
Grandma. Are you feeling uncomfortable?

4
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,252
Grandma, are you alright?

5
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,972
I'm so worried about you.

6
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,972
Doctor, how is my grandma doing?

7
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:51,652
Her heart is not functioning properly.

8
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,784
She needs
to maintain good living habits,

9
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:57,131
sleep and get up early, and keep calm.

10
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:59,691
She should be fine.

11
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,400
She can be discharged
after staying for a few days.

12
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,096
Thank you.

13
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:07,992
Grandma, it's all my fault. I shouldn't
have kept you up so late last night.

14
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,728
As old houses, the people will age.

15
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:18,691
It's normal to fall sick.
Don't blame yourself.

16
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,812
Who will come with me
to get the medical report?

17
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:23,131
I'll go with you.

18
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:25,171
I'll go and get the report.

19
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:32,011
Grandma, you take some rest,
and I'll stay by your side.

20
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:38,092
Zhiming, let me ask you something.

21
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,731
Is what Ms. Zhang
from Botticelli said true?

22
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:50,520
Yes.

23
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:55,812
I am indeed working with her.

24
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:02,212
Honestly, I returned home for Xing'anli.

25
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:09,492
What if I have objections?

26
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:13,571
Then I will follow your wishes

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
and modify the plan
until you are satisfied.

28
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,611
What if I'm just not satisfied?

29
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:27,652
Grandma, I think I can do my best

30
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,812
to make you satisfied.

31
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,812
But if all of this comes
at the cost of your health,

32
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,772
I'll give up because it's not worth it.

33
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:50,851
How do you calculate this?

34
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:57,691
You are good at calculation
when it comes to benefits.

35
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,252
Because I was really scared just now.

36
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,451
I don't want to experience
that feeling again.

37
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:17,212
So you rest well,
and nothing else matters.

38
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,652
I seem to find something new from you,

39
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,931
which has never been found.

40
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:30,652
What is it?

41
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,811
Human touch.

42
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,931
Mom, dad, this way to the second floor.

43
00:04:58,648 --> 00:04:59,736
Dad.

44
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:01,528
Chenghuan.

45
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,212
How is Grandma?

46
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,731
She's fine and already awake.

47
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,800
The doctor said
her heart was not functioning properly.

48
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,851
It's an age-related illness.
She will be fine after some rest.

49
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:28,371
What a relief.

50
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:32,772
I'll take you up.

51
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:33,784
Okay.

52
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:37,332
You ask Huan what happened to her leg.

53
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,680
Why don't you ask?

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,772
Just do what I said.

55
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,411
Okay. Huan.

56
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,972
Your mom asked me to check on your foot.

57
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,532
My foot is fine.
I just sprained my ankle.

58
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,132
Sprained your ankle?

59
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:57,051
Dad, did you come in such a hurry
that you didn't buy anything?

60
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,652
I'll go buy some fruit.

61
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:01,688
Huan, I'll go. You take our mom
and dad to see Grandma.

62
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:03,851
Come on. I hold you up.

63
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,051
You carry her on your back.

64
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,168
No need.

65
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,491
It's right up ahead. We're almost there.

66
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,931
Grandma, my parents are here.

67
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:16,652
Ms. Chen, Mr. Yao.

68
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,731
Ms. Chen, are you alright?

69
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:24,212
Sorry, we came in such a hurry
that we didn't buy you anything.

70
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:27,332
I am fine. Don't worry.

71
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,692
Is your house renovation finished?

72
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:37,611
Well, it's sort of done.

73
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,491
Dad, how is the fridge
I bought for you working out?

74
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,931
The fridge is working fine.

75
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,611
I heard that the renovation workers
faced a slammed door.

76
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,212
It's not a long-term solution
to the problem.

77
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:01,491
Dad, let me rent a house for you.

78
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:04,811
The point is your mom

79
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:08,291
has lost sleep lately.

80
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,731
So, she hasn't figured out a plan
for this yet.

81
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:15,851
Who told you I lost sleep
and hadn't figured it out?

82
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:19,491
I sleep very well. I fall asleep
as soon as my head hits the pillow.

83
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:27,772
Grandma, I bought you some fruit.

84
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,332
Thank you, Zao.

85
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,491
I'll put it here.

86
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:41,411
Liu, the demolition fell through,
but you still have to move on.

87
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:47,051
The sooner your house is renovated,
the sooner you return to normal life.

88
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,291
It can't happen, Ms. Chen.

89
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,384
Now, my home is not what it used to be.

90
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:57,212
My daughter whom I've raised
for 30 years wants to cut ties with me.

91
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,851
Without a home, my life can't go on.

92
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,931
Who cares about the house?

93
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,092
Anyway, we have that house to live in.

94
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:10,491
Even so, have you thought of Zao?

95
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,851
After he graduates and starts working,
he doesn't even have his room.

96
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:19,224
Do you want him
to always sleep on a camp bed?

97
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,811
Grandma is right.

98
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:27,012
Zao, let's find short-term housing
tomorrow.

99
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:32,491
No need. Even if you do,
I won't move in.

100
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,052
After all, you are my family.

101
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:45,452
Although I always tell you not
to rely on others,

102
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,092
given the current situation,

103
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:52,472
others will judge me
if I don't lend a hand now.

104
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,328
I have an antique western-style house.

105
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,731
It's big enough for your family of four.

106
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,011
An antique western-style house?

107
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:11,932
An antique western-style house
in Shanghai?

108
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,092
That's great.

109
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,891
Ms. Chen, that's very kind of you.

110
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,731
Grandma, you don't have to help us.

111
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:27,972
Ms. Chen, you've helped us a lot.

112
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:31,092
How can we
shamelessly trouble you further?

113
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,452
We're not troubling her.

114
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,412
We really need her help.

115
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:38,332
As Ms. Chen said,

116
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:42,891
she hopes
our family of four can live together.

117
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,771
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

118
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:56,491
Huan, we'll wait for you to come home
and move together.

119
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,851
I won't be living there.

120
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:10,212
Chenghuan, you haven't seen your mom
for such a long time.

121
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:14,616
Even if you don't live there,
you take them to see it.

122
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:19,611
The keys are in the drawer
of the nursing home.

123
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,252
(Lane 1100)

124
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,771
Lane 1100. Here we are.

125
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:54,932
It's incredible to have a house here.
How much will it cost?

126
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:56,952
Is Grandma so wealthy?

127
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:58,611
I don't know.

128
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,611
Lane 1100. Here it is.
And No. 9. It should be inside.

129
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:05,412
Let me tell you. Celebrities
of Shanghai used to live in this place.

130
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,932
Your dad has a house here.

131
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,452
Nonsense.
If my dad left me a house here,

132
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:11,731
I would not be a driver.

133
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:31,731
Oh my, Ms. Chen is too generous.

134
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,412
I never thought
we could own such a good house.

135
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,092
This house belongs to Grandma, not us.

136
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:44,412
Dad, if you decide to move in,

137
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,131
I'll get the renovation workers
to work on our house.

138
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:48,771
Okay.

139
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,491
Don't be silly.

140
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,292
Now that we have such a big house,

141
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,972
why should we renovate that house?
Isn't that a waste of money?

142
00:11:55,651 --> 00:12:00,611
Huan said Ms. Chen let us
stay here temporarily.

143
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,131
She is helping us
get through a difficult time.

144
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,131
Yes, mom,
we're just staying temporarily.

145
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:11,251
I know.
I'm not that stupid and clueless.

146
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,611
Don't just stand here.
Let's go in and have a look.

147
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,891
Alright, let's go inside.

148
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:20,531
Dad, I'm not going.
You guys go in and look.

149
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,172
Grandma is in the hospital.
I need to rush back to accompany her.

150
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,972
You go ahead.

151
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:32,851
Huan, if you need anything
or want something to eat, just call me.

152
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,212
I know, dad.

153
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,851
Zao, let's go.

154
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,371
Just call you?
I don't think she will tell you.

155
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:13,531
Zao, you check out the kitchen

156
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,692
to see what else is needed
and we can get it from home later.

157
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay.

158
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,531
Come on. Have a seat. Don't stand there.

159
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,692
Come and take a seat.

160
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:48,332
She ignores me,
but I can't help caring about her.

161
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,256
After all, she is my daughter.

162
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:54,011
Poor thing.

163
00:13:56,212 --> 00:14:00,491
Perhaps you owe her in this life.

164
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,131
What are you talking about?
What do you want me to do?

165
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:05,131
I beg her to come back?

166
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,412
I didn't ask you to beg her.

167
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,651
But I think whatever we do,

168
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,651
we have to pay attention to the ways
to do it.

169
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:22,491
I've noticed that Huan has lost weight.

170
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:28,664
Yeah, after all, she can't eat
or sleep well outside the home.

171
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:33,651
Indeed, there's no place like home.

172
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:34,972
At home, there's mom.

173
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,052
I have a good idea.

174
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,092
Spit it out.

175
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,680
Let's invite Ms. Chen over for meals.

176
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:49,851
If Ms. Chen comes back,

177
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:53,176
Huan will have to come with her, right?

178
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:58,328
After two meals, she'll be back.

179
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:03,932
I refuse.
Sounds like I'm begging her to be back.

180
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:07,448
You don't have to beg. I'll do it.

181
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:32,731
Zhiming, don't you have anything
to ask me?

182
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,936
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised.

183
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:43,771
But you said it.
You take charge of your own affairs.

184
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:48,332
I know what I'm doing.

185
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:54,092
Grandma. I'm back.

186
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,856
Yao Zhiming, you've had a long day.

187
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,011
Hurry back and have some rest.
I will be here.

188
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:01,052
So, are they okay?

189
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,491
Pretty good. My mom is quite satisfied.

190
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,092
Grandma, Chenghuan is here
to accompany you.

191
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:13,452
Don't worry.
I'll look after Grandma. Your coat.

192
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:26,011
Chenghuan, I lived in that old house
when I married Zhiming's Grandpa.

193
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:30,872
Too many sad things happened
in that house, so I didn't tell you.

194
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,531
Don't blame me for keeping it from you.

195
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:39,731
Grandma, that is your house.
You can deal with it as you wish.

196
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,771
It's just because of my relationship
with my mom.

197
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,651
I have to rely on your house to mediate.

198
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,400
I feel somewhat guilty about it.

199
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:04,491
Alright, I've paid you
six months' rent upfront.

200
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,531
Once our house is done,
I'll let my parents move out.

201
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:17,251
Huan, your independence
is a good quality.

202
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:21,412
But you always use your strengths
to face everything.

203
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:25,771
Over time, your strengths
will become weaknesses.

204
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,291
Grandma, it is said
I should be independent at 30.

205
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,652
So, I have to be independent on my own.

206
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:37,240
I hope you remember not to be tough
in front of your family.

207
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:42,616
Family should
share each other's burdens.

208
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:48,571
Sometimes, one needs to rely on others.

209
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:52,491
Otherwise, how will people get close
to each other?

210
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,731
Independence is certainly important.

211
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:00,571
But if you exhaust yourself,

212
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:04,692
what good is it
to be independent from everyone?

213
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,412
Grandma, I've kept it in mind.

214
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:16,452
Let me show you the progress I've made.
Lighten the mood.

215
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:22,612
Look, this is a promotional clip
I shot for Mao.

216
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:26,612
Hello, guys! I am Mao Yongxin,
an independent jewelry designer.

217
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:30,904
Today, I'll introduce new products
that I will launch soon.

218
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:35,172
First, this is particularly distinctive
and my favorite one.

219
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,612
Not bad, right?

220
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:39,531
This little ball is made
from a special material.

221
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:42,091
It's made from recyclable materials.

222
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:45,932
So I made its color especially vibrant
and suitable for summer.

223
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:48,972
Actually, the idea behind the design is

224
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:52,331
that as a woman,
there are many roles to play in life.

225
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,612
But no matter when
or what difficulties we encounter,

226
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,491
we should always stay true to ourselves.

227
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:02,771
This is what you taught me.
The people must live for themselves.

228
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:09,731
In exchange,
you teach me this new trick.

229
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,331
I've practiced it myself.

230
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,968
But my shooting is not as good as yours.

231
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,892
No problem, but Ms. Chen Shuzhen,

232
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,212
you need to sleep now. It's too late.

233
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:22,488
I'll teach you tomorrow.

234
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:27,892
Alright, you're teasing me, young lady.

235
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:30,412
Time to sleep.
The doctor has already said

236
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,291
that you couldn't stay up late
with a bad heart.

237
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,400
- Okay.
- Lie down.

238
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,731
Alright.

239
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:47,736
Sleep now.

240
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:08,452
Boss, Ms. Chen has been hospitalized
at this critical moment

241
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:10,488
and she suddenly let the Mai family live
in her house.

242
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,811
Does it mean her intention
to divide her property?

243
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,531
Has she mentioned Xing'anli to you?

244
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,972
Grandma asked me
if I was determined to get Xing'anli.

245
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,452
Of course. Did you do resolutions?

246
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:31,771
What are you looking at me
like that for?

247
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:35,771
Didn't you return from abroad
for Xing'anli?

248
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:39,224
Do it quickly, get promoted,
and return to headquarters.

249
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,412
Aren't these your own words?

250
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:46,291
Grandma is my only family in this world.

251
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:50,811
She's sick in the hospital.
If I still think about Xing'anli,

252
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:54,412
would that be appropriate?
Am I a kind person?

253
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,491
No.

254
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,852
No, I-I didn't mean that.

255
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:07,051
I mean,
Grandma hasn't said anything yet.

256
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,652
Don't waver now, okay?

257
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,412
Take care of Grandma first.

258
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:18,488
(Shanghai Jiahui International Hospital)

259
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:23,652
Freshly made butterfly pastries.

260
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:27,172
Grandma, you're looking well today.

261
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:28,331
Mr. Yao is here.

262
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:29,496
Mr. Cui.

263
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:37,331
Chenghuan is live streaming with Mao
and won't return until the afternoon.

264
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,212
I'm not looking for her.

265
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:44,331
I'm talking to Cui.

266
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:48,531
Yes, it's been a while
since I've seen Chenghuan.

267
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,892
I actually miss her.

268
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,452
Ms. Chen, your order is ready.
I have to go.

269
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,412
Let me know if you need anything else.

270
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:59,011
Thank you, Cui.

271
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:06,731
Grandma, I've told you many times.

272
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:09,571
Don't eat such sweet pastries.

273
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:12,892
And crabs are so cold in nature.
Do you care about your health?

274
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,331
I'm in charge of my health.

275
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:18,372
I'm your guardian,
so I'm also in charge of it.

276
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:22,331
You choose between crabs and pastries.

277
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:26,972
I'll choose crabs.

278
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,612
You can only have one.

279
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:33,132
Yao Zhiming,
one crab is not enough for me.

280
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,212
I don't care.

281
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,571
Alright, just one crab.

282
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:40,692
I almost forgot the important matter.

283
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:47,132
Zhiming, I've looked at the proposal
Ms. Zhang gave me last time.

284
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,051
It's feasible.

285
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,652
But I have one problem with her plan.

286
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:55,652
She plans to put Xing'anli
under Botticelli's name,

287
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:59,372
going for chain management,
with a complete change of staff.

288
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:04,612
I cannot agree.
Do you have a compromise solution?

289
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:09,652
Grandma, let me explain.
As an international hotel group,

290
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,412
it has its staffing standards.

291
00:23:14,212 --> 00:23:17,331
I know you put your career
before everything.

292
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:23,372
Family changes made you
distrust affection from a young age.

293
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:28,291
You believe more in the security
money brings you.

294
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:33,452
But I want to remind you
that Xing'anli is my home.

295
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:39,251
Cui and others worked

296
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,571
with me through the hardest times.

297
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:46,212
All the staff at Xing'anli
are not outsiders.

298
00:23:46,212 --> 00:23:49,272
They are my family, just like you.

299
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:55,896
I understand, Grandma. I get your point.

300
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:58,051
How about this?

301
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:02,652
I will do everything possible
to keep all the staff.

302
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,132
Can I trust you?

303
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,692
I give you my word.

304
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,892
You can ask Mai Chenghuan to oversee me.

305
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,571
That way, you'll be at ease.

306
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:16,811
You've learned much from Chenghuan.

307
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:19,291
When you reach my age,

308
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,852
it will be a delight for you

309
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,372
to have some loyal friends.

310
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,251
Okay, I'll eat one crab.

311
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:40,312
One crab can't be enough for me.

312
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:45,011
Can I eat one more?

313
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,720
No way. I can't satisfy you.

314
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:53,972
If you ask for anything else,
I promise to fulfill it.

315
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:01,172
How about you buy me a new cheongsam?

316
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:05,571
It's nice to wear a beautiful cheongsam
when I am discharged, right?

317
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:07,132
No problem.

318
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:10,936
Okay.

319
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,291
Hello, guys. I'm Mao Yongxin,
a jewelry designer,

320
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,251
the person in charge of Cloud Jewelry,

321
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:20,652
and the ex-wife
of the renowned designer Song Huaimin.

322
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,771
Today,

323
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,932
I will clarify Song Huaimin's defamation
against me

324
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:27,896
and his lies.

325
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:30,011
The truth is actually the opposite.

326
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,091
Ever since I married him,

327
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:36,372
he's often blackmailed me
into being his ghostwriter.

328
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,331
And then?

329
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:40,811
Evidence.

330
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:45,571
I'll show you explosive news directly.

331
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:47,892
After all, everyone is here
for the disclosure on Song Huaimin.

332
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:50,520
Do you guys want
to know first how Song Huaimin

333
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,731
tricks his students
into working for him for free?

334
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:56,372
Or do you want to know first
how he steals my design drafts?

335
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:57,452
Guys, have a look.

336
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,652
This is the first video.

337
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:03,692
She accused me of copying her designs.

338
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,731
She should take it as a compliment.

339
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,932
No matter what it takes,
you make her shut up.

340
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:12,011
Okay, next evidence.

341
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,291
Honey, I've taken on two new projects.

342
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,932
Can you draw the design drafts for me?

343
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:19,091
When our child starts school,

344
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:22,132
I will help you launch your own brand
in the circle.

345
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:23,251
The third one.

346
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:25,011
Stop it.

347
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,132
You can't do it
during the live streaming.

348
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:30,051
I have to release all the evidence
to completely take him down.

349
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:34,251
It'll be a waste
to expose them in a day.

350
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:37,051
You need to expose some
during live streaming every day.

351
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:39,771
Just like watching a TV series.

352
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,652
Exactly. And remember

353
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:44,452
that Song Huaimin is a public figure
with 1.6 million followers.

354
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,692
He can hire people to rate you one star.

355
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,051
He can also hire people
to disrupt your live streaming

356
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,692
and slander you before you clear it.

357
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,811
Bring it on. I'll start a two-way fight.

358
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,011
I am the victim.
How can he discredit me?

359
00:26:56,011 --> 00:27:00,291
No, you might feel good momentarily,
but it will overshadow your livestream.

360
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:03,571
Remember, the main purpose is
to officially announce your brand

361
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,892
and use the traffic to monetize.

362
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:09,811
Yeah, I know, but it's too difficult.

363
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,331
Mao, take your time.
Let's walk through this again.

364
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,424
You can do it.

365
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,912
Come on. Let me walk through this again.

366
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,216
- Come on!
- Come on!

367
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,811
Hello, guys. I'm Mao Yongxin,
a jewelry designer,

368
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,212
the person in charge of Cloud Jewelry,

369
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:32,251
and the ex-wife
of the renowned designer Song Huaimin.

370
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:36,731
Song Huaimin, you said
I couldn't do anything without you.

371
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:39,811
Look, I've made my own brand,

372
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,251
and I've also designed many accessories.

373
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:45,811
They're very beautiful and special.
Can you do that?

374
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:50,091
Alright, if you want to know more gossip
about Song Huaimin,

375
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,972
come to my livestream room tomorrow.

376
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:55,692
I have much gossip for you.

377
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:58,132
Chenghuan's friend is quite interesting.

378
00:27:58,132 --> 00:28:01,531
Zhiming, teach me how to send her gifts.

379
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:04,811
(Gifts for Mao's live streaming)
Just tap the one you want to send.

380
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,852
Send an expensive one.

381
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,892
Okay, let's go with this one.

382
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:20,216
Not bad, you have over 100 viewers
in your first live stream.

383
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,251
(Live Streaming Data Platform,
126 viewers)

384
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:22,331
That's really good.

385
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:23,771
Not that good.

386
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,972
Over 100 viewers for the first time.
It's good enough.

387
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,331
Yeah, it's pretty good.

388
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:33,251
I think it's great.
At least people placed orders, right?

389
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:35,011
Thank you, guys.

390
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,011
Without you,
I wouldn't even know how to do it.

391
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:38,452
What would you like for lunch? My treat.

392
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:41,011
Come on. Think about it.

393
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:44,731
I'm good with anything.
You decide, Huan.

394
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:49,212
I won't join you. I have to go back
and eat with Grandma.

395
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:51,251
But you have to reward me.

396
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:54,051
You lend me new accessories to wear.

397
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:57,132
Mai Chenghuan,
just take whichever you like.

398
00:28:57,132 --> 00:28:58,132
Hurry up. Do as you like.

399
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:01,011
Come on. You only got a few orders
in one live stream.

400
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:03,652
You'll spend more than you earn,
wasting your efforts.

401
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:06,251
That's alright. I'm taking my time.

402
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:10,132
I gotta go. Zao, you're free, right?

403
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:13,692
If so, you have a meal
with Mao. I have to go.

404
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:14,771
Take care.

405
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,291
- Bye.
- Bye.

406
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,452
Bye.

407
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:21,612
How did the livestream go?

408
00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:24,892
What are you doing here?

409
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,811
It went quite well.

410
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:39,091
You didn't come all this way just
to ask me that, did you?

411
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,892
I would like to ask you for a favor.

412
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:55,531
Here we are.

413
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,452
You sure? Should we go to the shop
Grandma frequently visits?

414
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,852
You should just ask Grandma.
Why come to me?

415
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:07,011
Grandma says she likes anything I buy.

416
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,011
I'm leaving.

417
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,491
Today, Grandma made a decision
that has had a profound impact on me.

418
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:18,892
I want to buy her a cheongsam
that will please her.

419
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:23,091
I know you know Grandma
better than I do.

420
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:24,932
So I'll take your advice.

421
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:30,091
Okay, seeing how sincere you are,
just follow me.

422
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:35,771
This tailor shop has been open
for decades.

423
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:37,972
It's run by an experienced tailor
in Shanghai.

424
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:41,176
My neighbors bring expensive fabrics
here to be made into clothes.

425
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:44,852
Grandma will
like the ready-to-wear clothes here.

426
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,811
I hope so.
Otherwise, I'll complain to Grandma

427
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:49,212
that you tricked me.

428
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,571
Got it, Mr. Yao.
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

429
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,296
Mr. Xu.

430
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,312
Mr. Xu.

431
00:30:57,944 --> 00:30:58,972
You're here.

432
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:00,291
Yeah.

433
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:06,771
Is this your boyfriend?
He's very handsome.

434
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:09,852
I've made clothes all my life,
and I've never seen a man

435
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:13,571
with such a good proportion
of shoulder and head.

436
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,091
Just as your mom said,

437
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:19,172
such a son-in-law is great.

438
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:25,400
Mr. Xu, the one
my mom talked about isn't him.

439
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,412
Hello, I want to tailor-make a cheongsam
with the best and most expensive fabric.

440
00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:31,892
Take a look inside.

441
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:39,372
You were so picky just now,
but you changed your mind so quickly.

442
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:42,372
Mr. Xu has a sharp eye.
I believe he will do a good job.

443
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:47,571
Chenghuan, the New Chinese Style suit

444
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:51,972
is suitable for young people.
You don't have to wear cheongsam.

445
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:54,932
No, Mr. Xu, I'm here not for me.

446
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:55,992
It's for my grandma.

447
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:58,372
- I'll give you the measurements.
- Okay.

448
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:00,731
- I'll pick out the fabric.
- Okay.

449
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,091
The quality of the fabric is determined
by its price.

450
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,932
We have the Zhengjuan fabrics.

451
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:09,491
I'll take the Zhengjuan fabrics.

452
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,852
Ordinary silk fabrics will do.

453
00:32:11,692 --> 00:32:13,652
Whose advice should I take?

454
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,892
Grandma is a practical person.

455
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:21,291
She likes to wear comfortable clothes,
so silk fabrics are good enough.

456
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,392
Silk fabrics will do.

457
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:27,291
Okay. What style do you want?

458
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:31,051
The flat-cut and single-piece design.
It's simple with smooth lines.

459
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,132
Grandma will surely love it.

460
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:36,372
And there are different closures.

461
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,496
Have a look and choose it.

462
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:42,571
I know this. Carefully dressed women
love double-breasted cheongsams.

463
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:44,932
The square front piece will do.

464
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:48,291
Alright, you guys chat.
I'll prepare for it.

465
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,304
Okay.

466
00:32:55,771 --> 00:33:00,251
Mr. Yao, Grandma looks delicate
and pursues the quality of life.

467
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:03,972
But she had a tough life.
She has a strong personality.

468
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,972
Mai Chenghuan, are we talking
about the same Grandma here?

469
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:13,811
Of course, Grandma and Grandpa were
in a twilight romance.

470
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:18,892
But before she met my grandpa,
Grandma was widowed for decades.

471
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:21,251
One time she was so sick
that she almost died.

472
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,972
She signed her own operation agreement.

473
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:27,212
Later on, she pulled through.
You didn't know that, did you?

474
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:31,132
Grandma never told me about that

475
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:35,011
until we became very close.
So the square front piece is perfect.

476
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:41,560
Chenghuan, you are what you wear.

477
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,491
I have heard what you said.

478
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,452
I've never met your grandma,

479
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:49,688
but I bet she must be an energetic

480
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:51,731
and tasteful lady.

481
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:55,320
Thank you, Mr. Xu.
I'll tell Grandma about it.

482
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,452
She will surely be delighted.

483
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,172
Okay, tell me about your Grandma's
basic information.

484
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,811
Alright, her height is 1.62 meters.

485
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,731
Her shoulder width is 37.

486
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:04,852
37.

487
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:06,172
Waistline is 75.

488
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,531
75.

489
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:10,211
Okay, here are the rest
of the specific measurements.

490
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,812
- Mr. Xu, take a look.
- Alright.

491
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:12,852
Okay.

492
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:24,091
Why are you looking at me?
You pay the deposit.

493
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:27,852
No rush.

494
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,852
Mr. Xu, Mr. Yao is very picky.

495
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,680
When you finish it,
please wrap it nicely.

496
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,171
No problem.

497
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:43,131
It hurts.

498
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:44,812
I haven't even touched you yet.

499
00:34:45,372 --> 00:34:48,131
No, I'll do it myself.

500
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:51,292
Don't move. Leave it to me. I can do it.

501
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:58,131
Ouch.

502
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,192
Any better?

503
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:01,772
Yeah, better.

504
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:06,892
What's wrong? Are you allergic
to the material of the earrings?

505
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:11,412
No, I've tried them
for customers too many times.

506
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:14,812
Removing them and putting them on
over and over caused inflammation.

507
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,611
If you have many customers again,
let my sister help.

508
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:19,372
Four ears share the risk.

509
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:22,691
Huan would beat you if she heard that.

510
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,691
I haven't finished yet.
I'll get pierced too.

511
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,611
Once I'm done, there will be six ears.

512
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:29,932
That's not okay. I don't want you
to get your ears pierced.

513
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,536
I like what you look like now.

514
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:49,772
Would you like something to drink?
I'll get it for you.

515
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,691
I'll do it myself.

516
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:57,972
What am I thinking about?

517
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:18,852
I'm running late. I have to go.

518
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:20,772
I'll help you clean up when I get back.

519
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:24,011
Mr. Yao doesn't have fixed work hours.

520
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,571
Why do you go to work this early?

521
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:28,932
Have you forgotten
that Ms. Chen is discharged today?

522
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,131
I have to go to the hospital first
to pick up Ms. Chen.

523
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:34,691
Moreover, we are now living
in Ms. Chen's house.

524
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,452
We should at least show our gratitude.

525
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:41,848
Ms. Chen is about to be discharged,
but Huan hasn't come home yet.

526
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,011
Are you her dad?

527
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:46,531
You don't seem to be worried at all.

528
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:49,292
I give you advice,
but you don't listen to me.

529
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,252
You don't want to compromise yourself
with your daughter.

530
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,892
Think about Ms. Chen.

531
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,732
She can't directly help us
make up with Huan,

532
00:36:56,732 --> 00:37:00,011
but she lent the house to us
to take Huan back.

533
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,211
Whether Huan comes back or not,

534
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:05,972
we should be clear
about Ms. Chen's kindness.

535
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:09,332
Yeah, I'm well aware of her kindness.

536
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,332
Ms. Chen is a good person.

537
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:16,131
Remember the time
when Huan fell ill as a child?

538
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:17,852
Without Ms. Chen's help,

539
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:21,412
Huan would have
suffered the after-effects.

540
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:27,732
It's not just that.
When my dad was paralyzed,

541
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,531
Ms. Chen took care of him
and kept him clean

542
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:33,091
and comfortable,
so my dad never developed bedsores.

543
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:36,412
Exactly, but you still have complaints
about Ms. Chen.

544
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:40,332
The two of them were
in a twilight romance back then.

545
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:43,051
They were so old and came together.

546
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,332
I couldn't stand the gossip
from the neighbors.

547
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:50,131
And even my dad wanted to give up.

548
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:56,812
Guess what?
Ms. Chen bore all the gossip alone.

549
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:00,972
Ms. Chen really had a hard time.

550
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:02,011
Right.

551
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:05,852
I have an idea.

552
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,412
- What is it?
- If Ms. Chen lives there alone,

553
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,691
she might as well live with us, right?

554
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,531
We will take good care of her.

555
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:18,892
When you pick her up today,
why not just bring her here directly?

556
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:20,171
We live together.

557
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:24,571
When she's here,
I can cook for her and take care of her.

558
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,332
If Huan knows she's here,
she'll definitely come home.

559
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:30,932
Yu, that's very kind of you.

560
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:34,252
If Ms. Chen and Huan come back,

561
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:38,051
our family will be happily reunited.

562
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:41,624
And we'll dine together
at this large dining table.

563
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:45,372
You can show off your cooking skills.

564
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:46,531
I gotta go.

565
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:49,852
Don't forget.

566
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:58,171
If Ms. Chen really comes,
I'll be nervous about my cooking skills.

567
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:09,432
(Huan)

568
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:12,651
Hello?

569
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,892
Dad, did you receive the roses?

570
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:21,080
Yeah, Huan, you're so thoughtful.

571
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,056
Luckily, you thought of it,
or I wouldn't have known what to send.

572
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:28,011
Roses suit Grandma.
She'll definitely like them.

573
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,691
Huan, let me tell you good news.

574
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:36,852
Your mom plans to bring Grandma
back to that western-style house.

575
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,611
That way, we can all live together.

576
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,892
Look, Grandma will come home.

577
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:46,252
Shouldn't you consider moving back home?

578
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:53,691
I'll think about it. Dad, I have to go.

579
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,712
Okay.

580
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,972
Ms. Chen, please sign here.

581
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:06,744
Ms. Chen.

582
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,011
Mai.

583
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:11,571
Hello, this is...

584
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:14,812
He's a lawyer. I just had something
to discuss with him.

585
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,051
I won't disturb you.

586
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:19,211
Okay, thank you for coming.

587
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,280
I'm leaving.

588
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,932
- See you.
- See you.

589
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,592
Mai, what brought you here?

590
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:28,211
I heard you would be discharged today.

591
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:32,171
Chenghuan asked me
to give you these roses.

592
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,611
She said the roses suit you.

593
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:41,772
Chenghuan has a sharp eye.
Roses with thorns are just like me.

594
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:49,332
You lent us your house to live in.

595
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:52,812
Yu and I are especially grateful.

596
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:57,131
So before I came, Yu told me

597
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,852
to take you straight back home.

598
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:05,131
If we live together,
we can look after you.

599
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:10,520
I appreciate your kindness,
but I've gotten used to living alone.

600
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:14,091
And my living habits are different
from yours.

601
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:18,011
So there's no need to live together.

602
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:21,211
Okay, we'll do as you say.

603
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:26,892
Should I take you to the nursing home?

604
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:30,932
No, Zhiming will pick me up later.

605
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,091
He picks you up?

606
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:39,091
Mai, if you want to help,

607
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:42,732
you bring Liu
and Chengzao to Xing'anli tonight.

608
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,691
I've booked a table
and invited Chenghuan and Zhiming.

609
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:51,252
Our family hasn't dined together yet.

610
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:54,932
Alright, we'll be there tonight.

611
00:41:55,772 --> 00:41:57,691
I'm leaving then.

612
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:59,832
Okay, take care.

613
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:00,892
See you.

614
00:42:00,892 --> 00:42:02,691
Thank you for coming to see me.

615
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:21,656
Chenghuan, thank you
for the flowers you gave me.

616
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:25,932
I've reserved a table
at Xing'anli for tonight.

617
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:30,732
I've ordered your favorite crab buns.
You must come.

618
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:37,252
Okay, no problem, Grandma.

619
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,224
Grandma, has my dad picked you up yet?

620
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:45,211
I asked him to go back.
Zhiming will pick me up.

621
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,011
Alright, no problem.

622
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:53,211
I've prepared a mysterious present
for you tonight.

623
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:57,211
Okay, see you tonight.
