00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,440
Chenghuan.

4
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:35,988
Mr. Yao approved your revised edition

5
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:38,749
of the wedding tender.

6
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,468
This is the revised approval document.

7
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:46,068
You file it back.

8
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,229
Okay, I'll do it right now.

9
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,348
No, no rush.

10
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,949
I'm going out with Mr. Yao.

11
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,496
You go and have a lunch first.

12
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:56,789
There are many good restaurants

13
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,628
selling spicy food downstairs.

14
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,548
Eating spicy food is stress-relieving.

15
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:03,669
Mr. Yao and I won't be back
until after 3:00 PM.

16
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:04,789
- He Dong.
- Listen.

17
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,216
Mr. Yao.

18
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,512
How dare you tell her to skip work.

19
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,640
No, I'm helping you retain the talent.

20
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,949
Ever since she started working here,

21
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,868
has she ever left work before 9:00 PM?

22
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:21,988
If you keep this up,

23
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,588
you will not retain capable staff.

24
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:25,028
I think you're about to lose your job.

25
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,828
Alright, you arrange it.

26
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,568
Go and eat.
There's no rush to get it done.

27
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,868
You try the spicy hot pot. I'm off.

28
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,352
(Jialiang)

29
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,789
Hide here for a bit.

30
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,389
We're starting in a while. Stay focused.

31
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:15,064
Get ready.

32
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,708
You're here.

33
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,708
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,229
Get in the car.
I'll take you to a place.

35
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,148
I have told you.

36
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:29,708
Let's not meet
until you've thought it through.

37
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,428
We both need time to cool our heads.

38
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,708
I've already dealt with it.

39
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,069
Let's go. I have a surprise for you.

40
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:37,069
What have you done?

41
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,840
Get in the car.
I have a surprise for you.

42
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:41,828
Can't believe you.

43
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:45,688
What are you doing?

44
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,109
Sir, please do not honk the horn.

45
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,109
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that.

46
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,789
Xin Jialiang, you're crazy.

47
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:54,936
- Get in the car.
- No way.

48
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:57,828
If you get in, I won't honk.

49
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,389
Stop. I'll get in the car, okay?

50
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,268
Okay. Sorry about that.

51
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,308
You're so rude.

52
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:22,029
Huan, take a look at this house.
Do you like it?

53
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:25,948
Is this the house

54
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,576
you expect to have?

55
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,229
It has a good location, near the subway,
and a great view.

56
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:35,868
My Dad knows we're getting married,

57
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,469
so he bought this house for us.

58
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,480
If you like it,
I'll transfer the ownership to you.

59
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,388
You can decorate it as you like.

60
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,848
I have no problems
and will listen to you.

61
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,440
We've talked about this before.

62
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,269
If our parents help us,

63
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:54,392
they will interfere in our lives.

64
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,469
Besides, this is between the two of us.

65
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,109
We will buy our own house on our own.

66
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:03,128
Huan, we have to be realistic.

67
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,988
Houses in Shanghai are so expensive.

68
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,988
The two of us can't afford it.

69
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:10,909
We need a place to live
when we get married,

70
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,920
a space that belongs to both of us.

71
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,560
We shouldn't have to scrimp
or lower our quality of life

72
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,469
just because we're getting married.

73
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,628
Look at the scenery. Come on.

74
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,628
Huan, come on. Take a look.

75
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,868
Look at this scenery.
How nice the view is.

76
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,669
See, there's a lake over there.

77
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,029
After a tiring day at work,

78
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,508
I'll accompany you
for a walk by the lake.

79
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,948
If you want to lose weight,

80
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:43,909
we will use the fitness equipment

81
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,508
over there to exercise, okay?

82
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,428
The scenery is quite beautiful.

83
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,269
My parents have never lived
in such a good house.

84
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,988
They will have a chance.

85
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:57,752
Huan, just think about it.

86
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:00,229
When you have a big house,

87
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:03,109
you won't have to share one bathroom

88
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,229
with your parents and Zao.

89
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:07,789
When you're writing in the room,

90
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:12,109
Mrs. Mai won't push the door
and enter anymore.

91
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,789
Huan, if you don't like this house,

92
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,584
I'll ask my Dad to change it.

93
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,909
Pick one you like.

94
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,880
Jialiang, your Dad gives me this house

95
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,080
because he wants me
to help with the bidding, right?

96
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,068
It's good if you can help.

97
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,936
After all, Deshan will surely be ours.

98
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,428
After we're family,

99
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,269
we should help each other
and live harmoniously.

100
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,149
That's what being a family is all about.

101
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:55,628
Sorry, but I can't help
with the bidding.

102
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,388
And I won't take this house.

103
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:02,109
The printer is broken.

104
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:05,988
Can come over now to fix it?

105
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,068
I need to print a contract
for Mr. Luo this afternoon.

106
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:12,188
Please hurry.

107
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:14,872
(Party B, Mai Chenghuan)

108
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,909
Mai Chenghuan?

109
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,548
Mai Chengzao and Mai Chenghuan?
Your names sound similar.

110
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:22,829
Mai Chenghuan is my sister.

111
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,960
(Prenuptial Agreement,
Party A, Xin Jialiang)

112
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,920
(Party B, Mai Chenghuan)

113
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,868
Huan, don't be mad.

114
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:38,029
Zao, what's up?

115
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,109
Okay, I see. I gotta go.

116
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,068
Zao has worked at the law firm, right?

117
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,912
What happened? Did someone bully him?

118
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,748
Do you need me to help him?

119
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:00,792
Zao is fine.

120
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,349
But what's this
about a prenuptial agreement?

121
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,909
What? What prenuptial agreement?

122
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,388
Xin Jialiang, I can't believe you.

123
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:19,352
You help my brother
get a permanent position.

124
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,188
And you give me a house
to help you with the bidding.

125
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:25,548
At the same time, you want
to sign a prenuptial agreement with me.

126
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,888
You give me a house

127
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,428
to help you make connections
in business.

128
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,949
Yet you're wary of me and using me.

129
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,508
No, that's not true.

130
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,349
I-I really didn't know about it.

131
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,028
I didn't know about it.

132
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,832
Xin Jialiang, I know your family's money
doesn't grow on trees,

133
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:46,388
but I'm with you

134
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,109
not for your money.

135
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,628
Yes, I know.

136
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,448
Now, you did it behind my back

137
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,069
and even got my Mom involved,
putting me in a difficult position.

138
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,229
Have you considered how my family feels?

139
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,829
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

140
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,988
What sort of people do you take me for?

141
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:05,949
Aren't you insulting me?

142
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:08,408
Huan, calm down.

143
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:11,748
There must be a misunderstanding.

144
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,949
Well, my Mom...

145
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,349
Sometimes, she acts
the way she does business.

146
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,949
She made a mistake.

147
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,148
It's always your Mom.

148
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:23,748
Can you stop talking about your Mom?

149
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,189
I'm marrying you, not your Mom.

150
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,829
Huan, I really didn't know
about the agreement.

151
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:33,748
Huan, can you confirm with Zao again?

152
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,788
Why is it so hard to get married?

153
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:47,349
Yeah, I feel the same.

154
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,616
Why is it so hard?

155
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:55,349
Xin Jialiang, you tell your parents

156
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,048
I won't accept this house.

157
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,148
I also will not help with the tender

158
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,829
or sign the prenuptial agreement.

159
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,208
Please don't mix marriage
with interests anymore.

160
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,429
Huan.

161
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,148
What's going on?

162
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,189
It makes the face look bigger.

163
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,312
Why don't you listen to me?

164
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:17,944
Enough.

165
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,256
Like this.

166
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:30,684
♪Dust wanders everywhere
under the light♪

167
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:38,456
♪Sitting in the empty room,

168
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,424
Actually, in the Xin family,

169
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:47,868
the only places where a woman can shine
are the kitchen and the garden.

170
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,549
There won't be any other places.

171
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:02,616
♪Always searching for happiness♪

172
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,104
Zao.

173
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:13,709
What did Xin Jialiang say?

174
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,549
I'm off work now. I'll come find you.

175
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,469
Okay, see you then.

176
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:26,200
♪Everyone has a life of their own♪

177
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm so mad about this.

178
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:37,949
They asked you for help and wanted you
to sign the prenuptial agreement.

179
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,856
How could they do this?
It's so insulting.

180
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,628
Huan, I can't let anyone hurt you.

181
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:48,408
A house by the Huangpu River costs
at least tens of millions.

182
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,528
But the business between the Xin family
and Yueda is worth over that number.

183
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,288
Each gift has a price.

184
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,784
Zao, don't tell our parents
about the agreement.

185
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,952
I fear they will overthink
and make a fuss.

186
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,160
I got it.

187
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:21,592
Huan, will my work
at Fangyuan cause you trouble?

188
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,908
No, you don't need to worry about that.

189
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,788
Just focus on your work.

190
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,456
Now, the relations
between the two families are stiff.

191
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,229
I have thought about it.

192
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:45,268
If both families can't respect
and tolerate each other,

193
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,549
there will be problems
even if we get married.

194
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:53,464
If Jialiang can figure it out,
he will know

195
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,872
that the best choice
for both of us is to let each other go.

196
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,388
Anyway, it's not too late

197
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,109
to realize it, isn't it?

198
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:17,549
I should learn from you
about your mentality.

199
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,189
Who says that my endeavors end here?

200
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,988
Maybe I'll even become a boss
in the future.

201
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,429
Yeah, there's still a long way to go.

202
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,268
Huan, if you really become a boss,

203
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,189
I'll be the little brother to a boss.

204
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:49,349
Zao, this is your first job.

205
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:51,352
I'm sorry to get you entangled

206
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,008
in such a mess.

207
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,628
Don't worry about me.

208
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,648
I'm tough,
and doing great at the law firm.

209
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,109
If anyone gives you a hard time,

210
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,709
or if you are unhappy, you must tell me.

211
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,868
No need to suffer.

212
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,189
Okay, don't worry. If I'm bullied,

213
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:11,868
I will make a scene at the firm.

214
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,264
Mom.

215
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,748
Hello, Mom.

216
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:24,349
Huan, come home quickly.
I have good news.

217
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,148
We're back.

218
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:30,189
Let's eat.

219
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:34,589
Such a big meal.
Mom is still cooking in the kitchen.

220
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,589
What's the good news?

221
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,549
Here it is.

222
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,148
Mom, what's the big news?

223
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,028
You even cooked fish.

224
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,829
I have great news.

225
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:47,508
Our house is going to be demolished.

226
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:48,829
- Really?
- Zao.

227
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,028
- Bring the dish.
- Okay.

228
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:53,628
Our family's fortunes
have finally turned around.

229
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:56,189
Whatever I wish for comes true.

230
00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,148
The demolition of this old house
we have lived in

231
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:04,949
for decades will earn us millions.

232
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:08,109
Your dad and I have been worried
about your dowry money.

233
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,400
Now, it's all settled.

234
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,028
We will give up the resettlement house
and take the demolition compensation.

235
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,628
Mom, who told you about the demolition?

236
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:20,949
Our neighbors are talking about it.

237
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,908
Rumors are not reliable.

238
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,148
- This time, it's true.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,709
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

240
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,628
Mom, I hear we don't have to relocate.

241
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:33,656
Yes, I know that.

242
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,908
Our house is in a good location.

243
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,400
You can even feel the breeze
from the Bund.

244
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:42,868
But if we don't relocate,
we'll have to spend millions.

245
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,309
We don't have that kind of money.

246
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,776
Your Dad and I have discussed it.

247
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,016
We're going to buy a house in Qingpu.

248
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,448
It can save us over a million.

249
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,888
Qingpu? That's a distant suburb.

250
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,429
If we can't live in the same location,

251
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,232
let's buy a second-hand apartment
in the city.

252
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,668
Zao has to go to work every day.

253
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:07,189
And he often works overtime.

254
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:08,829
If he lives in the suburbs,

255
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,512
the commute will take two
to three hours. It's exhausting.

256
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:15,028
I know living in the city is better.

257
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:16,829
It's convenient for Zao.

258
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,469
And you'll want kids
after getting married.

259
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:20,949
- It'll be easier for me to take...
- Mom.

260
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,829
It is too early to talk about that.
Right now, just think of you and Zao.

261
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,776
I have savings.
No need to worry about me.

262
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:30,069
Don't I know how much savings you have?

263
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,388
Anyway, it's decided.

264
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:35,148
Buy a house in Qingpu.

265
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:40,109
Your Dad can take Zao
to the subway station.

266
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,388
As long as there's a subway,
it's convenient.

267
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,748
Besides, by subway,
you won't get stuck in traffic.

268
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:49,592
And it's not bad for a young man
to endure some hardships.

269
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:53,388
I'm okay with it. Don't worry about me.

270
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,984
Anyway, home is
wherever mom's cooking is.

271
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:01,748
Well said. Come on.
Let's toast to our wonderful life.

272
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:03,148
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

273
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,248
Cheers.

274
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,232
Mom.

275
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,749
Jialiang, you're back. Dinner is ready.

276
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:16,388
I'm not eating. I have no appetite.

277
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,388
What's the matter?

278
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:21,349
What's up with the prenuptial agreement?

279
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,589
Am I really your son?

280
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,589
Why is it so difficult
for me to get married?

281
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,948
Can't you just leave me alone?

282
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,228
Jialiang, are you stupid?

283
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,888
Mom and I did it all
for your own good, alright?

284
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,589
I knew it had something to do with you.

285
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,468
You are married.
Can't you manage your own home?

286
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:40,789
Stop setting me up, okay?

287
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,668
Jialiang, how can you talk
to your sister like that?

288
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,148
Am I wrong?

289
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,269
Don't be always scheming.

290
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,069
If you have the time,
you should look after your daughter.

291
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,349
Don't always leave her
with the nanny, okay?

292
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:54,668
You think I want to meddle?

293
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,628
If I don't, you'll be fooled.

294
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:57,628
None of your business.

295
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,668
Fine, and just a head's up,
you will get cheated.

296
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,148
- Stop it.
(- No worries.)

297
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,148
Alright, sit down.

298
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,589
(- You tell Yao Zhiming)
- Jialiang.

299
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:05,708
(that I'll be there tomorrow.)

300
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,468
(- I won't sit.)
- Fine, I gotta go.

301
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:12,228
Come on. Dinner is ready.

302
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:18,468
Stay. Are you arguing?

303
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,388
No, we're not. Jialiang.

304
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:27,749
She wants Chenghuan
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

305
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,269
Chenghuan was so aggrieved
that she cried.

306
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:33,228
No, Mai Chenghuan is pretending.

307
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:34,468
She said she doesn't want anything.

308
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,468
I just did as she said.

309
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:36,948
Dad, you listen to what she's saying.

310
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,688
Do you know about it?

311
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,568
It's normal for a rich family
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

312
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:57,468
Are you silly? We finally managed
to use the connection with Mai Chenghuan

313
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,388
to make Yao Zhiming relent.

314
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,468
Are you trying

315
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,188
to embarrass Yao Zhiming
with that agreement?

316
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:07,029
I can't believe it.

317
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,789
Why do I work so hard to do business

318
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,349
and make money?

319
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,309
I do it all to give you a good life.

320
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:16,228
Can you not cause me trouble?

321
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:22,668
Why are you getting so angry?

322
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,228
All I want is

323
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:26,428
to protect our home.

324
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:28,029
I don't want my son to suffer losses.

325
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,029
You're so foolish and short-sighted.

326
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:40,549
Can you not meddle in my affairs?

327
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:51,864
One, two, three, four.

328
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:56,628
Yu, the food in the fridge has gone bad.
I'll throw it out.

329
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,648
Don't. You're being wasteful.

330
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,549
I'll eat it with the porridge.

331
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:02,908
It's incredibly delicious.

332
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:05,976
How many times have I told you
not to eat leftover food?

333
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,349
It's not good for your health.

334
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,868
No big deal. I've eaten it for decades
and I'm in great shape.

335
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:15,509
What if the news
about the demolition is fake?

336
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:16,829
It won't be.

337
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,628
If it's true, I won't have to worry
about Huan's dowry.

338
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:23,269
How about we go to Qingpu to see houses?

339
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,428
Okay.

340
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:28,309
We have lived in this old
and small house for decades.

341
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,868
I've had enough of living here.

342
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,628
It's all my fault.

343
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:39,064
I can't make money and make you suffer.

344
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,624
Why do you blame yourself?

345
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,864
You do no wrong.

346
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,428
As you know, I was born in a small

347
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:51,228
and poor village,
wishing to stay in Shanghai.

348
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:53,589
I'm lucky enough to marry you.

349
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:58,789
We're living a happy life
with Huan and Zao.

350
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:00,628
I'm very content.

351
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,829
But...

352
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:07,029
Anyway, Huan can enjoy a better life.

353
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,789
Huan can fully enjoy her life
after getting married.

354
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,908
Actually, our life is quite alright,

355
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,749
a relatively comfortable life.

356
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,749
After we get the compensation
for the demolition,

357
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:28,664
we'll buy a house with three bedrooms
and two living rooms in Qingpu.

358
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:30,829
Really?

359
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:31,864
Yes.

360
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,428
My goodness, I am so excited.

361
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,668
It's just a bit far from Huan's home.

362
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:43,589
Yes, it's a bit far,
but the house is big.

363
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,349
I don't want you to live in the suburbs.

364
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:48,829
You live here.

365
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,549
Don't be silly.

366
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,789
I'm serious. I want everyone
to live a good life.

367
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,528
I can't enjoy my life while you suffer.

368
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:03,864
I have good news.
I've been promoted and got a raise.

369
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,269
Don't have to worry about me.

370
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,228
Even if I get married,

371
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,628
I won't need you
to prepare the dowry for me.

372
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:13,188
You must listen to me this time, Mom.

373
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:16,952
We buy a second-hand house
in the city center.

374
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,672
If the money is not enough,
I'll take out a loan.

375
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,628
We'll buy a house with three bedrooms.

376
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:24,888
Zao has been living
on the balcony for so many years.

377
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,749
It's time for him
to have his own bedroom.

378
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,829
Dad, Mom, you named me Chenghuan,

379
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:38,228
hoping I could live a happy life.

380
00:22:38,948 --> 00:22:40,029
But if my happiness is built

381
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,708
at the cost of your happiness,

382
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,228
I won't be happy.

383
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,224
I want our whole family to be well.

384
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,840
It's settled. Time to sleep.

385
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,468
(Zhu Baoqiao)
(Just a gesture. I await good news.)

386
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,868
Mr. Xin, I've missed my chance
to meet you twice.

387
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,309
I'm really sorry about that.

388
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,668
Thank you. I have to be sorry too,

389
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,589
but I'm not used to drinking coffee.
I drink tea.

390
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:57,269
No problem. I've prepared it for you.

391
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:02,552
Thank you. I can tell you're attentive.

392
00:24:03,148 --> 00:24:04,269
I should be.

393
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:10,072
Actually, what to drink is a matter
of personal preference.

394
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:14,648
Sometimes, I fear

395
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:17,069
you don't like Deshan's taste.

396
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:23,640
I understand.
I hope we can work well together.

397
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:26,148
I hope so.

398
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,868
Here's one thing

399
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,628
about the tender process...

400
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,668
The process will be handled
as it should be.

401
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:37,048
I believe Mr. Xin can do it.

402
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:41,784
Moreover, since Chenghuan
and your son are about to get married,

403
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,752
we're practically a family.

404
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,989
That makes sense.

405
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,989
But after spending more time together,
we'll be closer.

406
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,829
And we will be a true family, right?

407
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:54,948
- Yes.
- Come on.

408
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:55,992
- Come on.
- Come on.

409
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,668
Mr. Yao.

410
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:07,228
Deshan is serious about the bidding.

411
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,789
The new products are already
on the production line.

412
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,868
And the supply cycle will be shortened.

413
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:16,792
I see. Chenghuan, you see Mr. Xin out.

414
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,728
Alright, bye, Mr. Yao.

415
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,569
- Alright, bye, Mr. Yao.
- Bye.

416
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,824
- Looking forward to our cooperation.
- Looking forward to it.

417
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:26,749
This way, please.

418
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,069
- This way, please.
- Alright.

419
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,789
I've troubled you this time.

420
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:49,349
Not at all, Mr. Xin,
it's part of my duties.

421
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,288
Just call me Uncle.

422
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:55,192
In the workplace, it's appropriate
to call you Mr. Xin.

423
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,549
About the prenuptial agreement,

424
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,188
I just knew about it.

425
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,029
Actually, Jiali has no ill intentions.

426
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,228
She is a bit naive.

427
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:15,228
I guess she is experiencing baby brain.

428
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,628
Come over to my house
when you have time.

429
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,388
I'll ask Jiali to apologize to you.

430
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:23,448
Mr. Xin...

431
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,628
I'm expecting Deshan to win the bid.

432
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:36,468
But the premise is
that Deshan must rely on its strength

433
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:37,948
and your conscience in doing business.

434
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:42,228
I don't want to take credit.
I hope you can understand. Take care.

435
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,829
Prenuptial agreement?
They think highly of themselves.

436
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,920
Think about it. At the bidding event,

437
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:03,668
if you expose the evidence

438
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:06,428
that Deshan has bribed the executives
of Yueda for years,

439
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,388
will you put Chenghuan

440
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:12,148
in an awkward predicament?

441
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:16,749
It's not fair for her at all.

442
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:20,408
He Dong, did you come here
to do charity or to make money?

443
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:24,349
I'm trying to persuade you
to reconsider it.

444
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:26,908
Our target is Dennis.

445
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:31,228
We don't necessarily have to use Deshan.

446
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,072
I just feel sorry for Mai Chenghuan.

447
00:27:34,908 --> 00:27:36,856
Do you have to give her a hard time?

448
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,589
Don't you know me?

449
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,468
It didn't matter if you're alone.

450
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:46,269
Now anyhow, she's sort of your sister.

451
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,789
The point is, Chenghuan is very capable

452
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,388
at work.

453
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,269
You give her a job,

454
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,256
and she will get it done in time.

455
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:57,912
It is hard
to find a serious employee like her.

456
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:03,512
I believe that if she marries
into the Xin family,

457
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,628
it will be really bad for her.

458
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,948
She better work with me.

459
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:10,712
Alright, do as you wish.

460
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,776
Don't let others know
about the kickback list.

461
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:18,468
Especially, no one can know
it came from Mai Chenghuan.

462
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:25,228
So, you are soft-hearted.

463
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:30,264
I knew my boss could not be heartless.

464
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,349
Are you finished? Get out.

465
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,392
Hello, everyone.

466
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,309
(Green Home Concept)
I'm Xin Jialiang, Chief Designer of Deshan.

467
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:51,589
We have proposed a new concept.

468
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:53,656
The concept of green home.

469
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,032
It refers to environmental protection
and sustainable development.

470
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,936
Green home includes two meanings.

471
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,829
The home interior decorations,
furniture, and appliances are

472
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,352
under the state of natural conservation,

473
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,928
providing people-oriented services

474
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,568
and a convenient and healthy lifestyle.

475
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:24,056
Thank you.

476
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,789
I think he has a good point.

477
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,824
Thanks for his speech.

478
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:35,628
And thanks to every supplier
in the bidding today.

479
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:38,948
Next is the bid evaluation.

480
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:42,868
Please move to the rest area
to wait for the bid opening, Thank you.

481
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:58,708
As you can see,
Deshan has competitive advantages.

482
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:03,228
And it has been cooperating
with us for many years.

483
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:07,349
I think we know how to choose.

484
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,624
Before the formal voting,

485
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,568
I have documents for you to read.

486
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:35,672
Assistant He.

487
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,868
What is that?
Why didn't I know about it?

488
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,428
Nothing. Don't ask anymore.

489
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,269
I believe after you read this,

490
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:52,829
you will make the right decision
for the company.

491
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,509
Mr. Yao, it's time to open the bid.

492
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,428
I'll go inform them to come in.

493
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:07,896
No need. I'll have He Dong do it.

494
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:11,549
You go to my office
and get the sample of the contracts.

495
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,008
I've already done it
and placed them on their desks.

496
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:17,269
You go and get the lunch coupons.

497
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:20,349
I have already given them.

498
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:31,512
(Green Home Concept)

499
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:48,028
(Voting results)

500
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,428
He Dong, what happened?

501
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:57,428
Just don't ask for now.

502
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,829
Sorry for keeping you all waiting.

503
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:02,908
Please go to the banquet hall.

504
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:04,908
We will continue with the bid opening.

505
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:05,912
He...

506
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,064
Your favorite.

507
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:16,152
Business first.

508
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,468
Mr. Xin, something seems off.

509
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:25,029
You're just too nervous.
It's almost a sure thing.

510
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,240
Sorry to have kept everyone waiting.

511
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:32,708
Based on the principle
of justice and equity,

512
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,520
we'll choose the best supplier.

513
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:37,388
Now, I have the final result.

514
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:42,584
Next, I will announce the winner is

515
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,829
Tianhe Home Furnishing. Congratulations.

516
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:48,440
Yes.

517
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,104
Honorable judges, my company has been

518
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:09,789
in collaboration with Botticelli.

519
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,109
Our proposal and bid document

520
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:19,148
are open and transparent.
You've seen it.

521
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:22,829
And our price is
within a reasonable range.

522
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,628
What is the reason for replacing us?

523
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,160
Mr. Xin, you look at this kickback list.

524
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,468
A kickback list? Really?

525
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:40,152
(520 Gift Pack Kickback List)

526
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:46,148
Mr. Dennis, won't you say something?

527
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:07,228
Xin Jialiang,
why is a kickback list attached

528
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:11,549
to the supply quotation?

529
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:17,400
Kickback list? I don't know.

530
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,192
You don't know?

531
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,029
I told Huan

532
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,509
about the discount.

533
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:29,389
I-I don't know.

534
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,389
You really are my good son.

535
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,869
I really don't know about it.

536
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:45,708
Guys, who can verify the authenticity
of this kickback list?

537
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,268
As I know, Mai Chenghuan was

538
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,708
in charge of the 520 activity.

539
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,589
And she's Mr. Yao's secretary, right?

540
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,616
Mr. Xin, Mai Chenghuan is my secretary.

541
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,880
But she wasn't
when the 520 activity took place.

542
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:10,828
Miss Mai, please step forward.

543
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:28,308
I'm here, Mr. Xin.

544
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:33,176
Everyone, there's one thing
you might not know.

545
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:38,308
Miss Mai is my son's girlfriend.

546
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:44,429
Jialiang likes her very much.

547
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:47,348
With Miss Mai's pillow talk,

548
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:50,469
Jialiang lost his mind

549
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:53,029
and did something stupid.

550
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:57,308
Miss Mai, well played.

551
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,184
You used your boyfriend
to get a lower price

552
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,768
and achieve what you wanted.

553
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:11,188
Mr. Xin, I was
in charge of the 520 activity.

554
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,668
Regarding the discount, I negotiate
with Mr. Wang.

555
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:17,708
It has nothing to do with Jialiang.

556
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,416
You know well how you negotiated it.

557
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:22,869
But I really admire your tactics.

558
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:26,869
On one hand,
you slash the price with Deshan.

559
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,509
On the other,
you fabricate this kickback list.

560
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:32,989
What exactly are you up to?

561
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,069
It's not like that. I...

562
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,708
Enough, no need to argue.
No matter what,

563
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:41,589
because of this kickback list,
Yueda doubts

564
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:44,088
Deshan's supply prices
from the past three years.

565
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,429
The Audit Department will scrutinize
the kickback list and see

566
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,509
whether there are any murky dealings
between Deshan and the top of Yueda.

567
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,029
Alright, meeting adjourned.

568
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:03,389
Wait a moment. I have a report to make.

569
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,228
Yueda exposed the base number
of this tender.

570
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,308
I request to seal the bidding.

571
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
(Botticelli 2023-2024 Home Supplies Vendor
Tender Base Number)

572
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,348
Jialiang, I don't know what's going on.

573
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:23,589
I don't know about the kickback list.

574
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:26,308
I didn't expose the base number.
You have to believe me.

575
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:28,348
Huan, I believe you.

576
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:33,080
But it was sent via your email.

577
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,228
Think about it. If I disclosed it
to Tianhe Home Furnishing,

578
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:37,429
why was it reported by Zhu Baoqiao?

579
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,520
Xin Jialiang.

580
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,228
Your girlfriend is quite tricky.

581
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:47,708
She and her boss

582
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,628
set you up.

583
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,628
It's so embarrassing. Get out of here.

584
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,389
Mr. Xin, Jialiang.

585
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:00,760
Jialiang.

586
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:12,429
Chenghuan, Mr. Yao is looking for you.

587
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:28,348
Mai Chenghuan, you explain this to me.

588
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:31,188
How come Tianhe Home Furnishing
received your email?

589
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:34,628
I didn't send the email.
I don't know about it.

590
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:36,429
Someone must have stolen my email.

591
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:39,800
You don't know
or you don't dare to admit it?

592
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,096
I didn't do it. Why should I admit it?

593
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,029
Calm down.

594
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:48,228
I'll ask the IT colleague right now.

595
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:55,989
Mr. Yao, I want to ask you
about something.

596
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:00,029
What's the deal with the kickback list?

597
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:08,869
You ask me about that?

598
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:12,504
I got it along with the base price list.

599
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,109
Check it out on your phone.
You're welcome.

600
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:20,628
Mr. Wang sent the base price list to me.

601
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,148
I forwarded it directly to Assistant He.

602
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,756
(520 Gift Pack Kickback List)

603
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:45,029
I let you negotiate
because I think highly of you.

604
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:50,148
Mr. Yao has officially transferred you
to be his senior secretary.

605
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:52,344
From now on, report directly
to him for anything.

606
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,989
You don't have to do the rest.
Just make sure the event goes well.

607
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:08,429
So, after I finished
negotiating the base price,

608
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:12,348
you told me not to get involved
with the pricing anymore.

609
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:16,109
And at that time,
you saw the kickback list, right?

610
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,509
From beginning to end,
you've been using me.

611
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:30,308
You promoted me
and let me in charge of the tender

612
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,888
to make Deshan lower its guard,

613
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:36,109
so you can find evidence of kickbacks.

614
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:43,268
Everything you did was
to get rid of Deshan.

615
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:44,376
Am I right?

616
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:52,788
Deshan is just a supplier.
It's not worth it for me to do this.

617
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:59,096
Mr. Dennis, won't you say something?

618
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,828
So, it's to get rid of Dennis.

619
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:15,628
In short, from start to finish,

620
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:21,869
I'm just your pawn to bring Deshan
and Dennis into the game.

621
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:24,632
Am I right?

622
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,949
You tell me what to do.

623
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:39,708
I am the director of Yueda Group.

624
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:43,188
With such crucial evidence appearing,

625
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:45,509
should I still consider your feelings?

626
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:49,308
I used you as my pawn?

627
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:52,628
Fine, what do you think you are?

628
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:57,109
Are you an employee of Yueda Group
or a supporter of Deshan?

629
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:11,308
Yes, you are right.

630
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,589
I got it wrong.

631
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:17,788
I just thought

632
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:23,549
you really had high expectations
of me at work.

633
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,549
So, I was grateful.

634
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:34,348
I thought
that we looked after Grandma together,

635
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:37,148
so, we're kind of family.

636
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:41,268
I thought we could be honest
with each other.

637
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,788
But today, I finally realize

638
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:55,268
that there are no friends
or relatives in the workplace.
