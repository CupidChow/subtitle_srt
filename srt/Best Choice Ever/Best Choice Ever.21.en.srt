(Dust in the corner of the restaurant.)

5
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:02,413
Ms. Chen.

6
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,172
Chenghuan, here's the situation.

7
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,093
I got a business deal with a tour group,

8
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,732
but there's an issue with the hotel
and they can't accommodate us anymore.

9
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:12,373
I was wondering if you might have

10
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,212
a suitable hotel to recommend.

11
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:17,612
What do you think about Xing'anli?

12
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:20,652
The time-honored brand
that sells butterfly pastries, right?

13
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,452
Yes, that's it.

14
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:23,652
Okay.

15
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,013
But we need to check in within two days.

16
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,332
Will there be enough rooms available?

17
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:28,052
Rooms...

18
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:30,612
There should be enough rooms.

19
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:32,813
I'll go and confirm that for you.

20
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,932
That would be great.

21
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,133
Thank you, Chenghuan.

22
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,973
I'll send you the information right now.

23
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,973
Alright, Ms. Chen. No problem.

24
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:41,813
Goodbye, Ms. Chen.

(Senior Tour Group Reception Plan)

28
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,373
Come in.

29
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:30,693
Chenghuan.

30
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:33,892
It's late. Still working overtime?

31
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:36,293
Mr. Cui, it's fine.
You may get off work.

32
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,332
I'll lock the door later.

33
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,452
Okay, then I'll leave first.

34
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,693
You should also rest early.

35
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:42,093
Don't stay up too late.

36
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,093
Don't worry.

37
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,493
- Mr. Cui.
- You've been working all night.

38
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,772
Have some breakfast.

39
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,892
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

40
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,253
By the way, Mr. Cui.

41
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,573
About the tour group I mentioned
yesterday,

42
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,493
I wrote a reception plan overnight.

43
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:35,693
Please have a look

44
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,373
and see if anything needs to be added.

45
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:38,173
Really?

46
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,493
You secured a big deal for Xing'anli
so soon?

47
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,133
Not at all. It's a friend I knew before.

48
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:45,693
I'm just giving her a hand.

49
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,173
The client has a large number of people
and high demands,

50
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,892
and they are all middle-aged and elder
with high net worth.

51
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:53,852
Here's what I'm thinking.

52
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,092
We arrange the twenty double rooms

53
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,292
next to the Shikumen suites

54
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:58,493
all together.

55
00:04:58,652 --> 00:04:59,493
For one thing,

56
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,412
it's quieter in the depths of the hotel.

57
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,292
For another,

58
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,532
it's closer
to the accessibility equipments,

59
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,693
convenient for the guests
to rest and travel.

60
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,373
Besides, Mr. Cui,

61
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,013
I have my own ideas regarding the menu.

62
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,652
I've incorporated specialties
of Xing'anli

63
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:14,852
into the menu.

64
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,332
But I've also matched it with some

65
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,493
low-fat, healthy butterfly pastries.

66
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,573
First, it can make people feel

67
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,292
that we offer personalized services.

68
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:22,173
Secondly,

69
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,053
it can conveniently allow guests to

70
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,412
buy Gift Packs before they leave.

71
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,373
What do you think?

72
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,493
That's great.

73
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,292
Chenghuan, you've been very considerate.

74
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:35,092
I'll take a closer look at your plan.

75
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,092
If there are no questions,

76
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,772
I will proceed with it immediately.

77
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:39,852
Okay, Mr. Cui.

78
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:42,452
I'll go back to the apartment
in a moment,

79
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,892
to handle the handover procedures.

80
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,292
I might return a bit late.

81
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:46,693
Alright.

82
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,133
I'm leaving, Mr. Cui.

83
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,493
Aren't you going to eat a bit more?

84
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:50,493
I've had enough.

85
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,452
Take care.

86
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,852
Okay, no need to see me off.

87
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:04,933
Go back.

88
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,532
My lunch break buddy,

89
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,532
patrol buddy, and meal buddy.

90
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:09,493
Without you,

91
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,173
I'll lose my motivation to work.

92
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,493
How come you look like
you've gone through a breakup?

93
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:17,892
Xing'anli is just a few stops away
from the apartment.

94
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,733
We can meet often
when we miss each another.

95
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,253
Right, it's a good thing.

96
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:25,292
Look, a boss emerged from

97
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,972
our property management office.

98
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:28,536
Right, Miss Mai?

99
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,892
Manager Zhang, please don't say that.

100
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,452
Thank you all for your help
during this time.

101
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,693
If there's anything in the future,
just call me.

102
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,573
Come back and visit us
whenever you have time.

103
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,253
You are always welcomed
to the property management office.

104
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:42,013
Exactly.

105
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:44,173
I will.

106
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:46,852
Alright, everyone go back.

107
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,813
I'm leaving. No need to see me out.

108
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:49,493
Okay.

109
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,412
Go back.

110
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:51,733
- Goodbye.
- Chenghuan, see you.

111
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:04,332
Everything has been handed over?

112
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,933
Yes, the handover is complete.

113
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:07,933
I'll go over today.

114
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,693
It's quite good.

115
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,892
Have you made up your mind?

116
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,133
Yes.

117
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:15,092
And it won't change.

118
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:19,332
Then, I wish you all the best.

119
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,693
Thank you, I will.

120
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:26,972
Let's go.

121
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,493
Mr. Cui, what's wrong?

122
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,532
Chenghuan,
something happened in the hotel.

123
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,933
Can you talk now?

124
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,573
Yes. What happened?

125
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,733
Here's the thing. Just now,

126
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,092
the food sanitation department
suddenly came for an inspection.

127
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,772
They ordered Xing'anli to temporarily
cease operations for rectification.

128
00:07:58,092 --> 00:08:00,772
They said they'd received
an anonymous complaint from a consumer

129
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,933
who dined at Xing'anli

130
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,092
and got food poisoning.

131
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:06,053
I've already asked the staff
to cooperate with their investigation.

132
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,772
The guests have also been appeased.

133
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,373
But there are still quite a few guests
staying at the hotel,

134
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,652
who're requesting refunds and checkouts.

135
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,933
The situation is somewhat serious.

136
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,652
That's why I'm calling you right away.

137
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,693
Is the situation true?

138
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:18,933
Have you verified it?

139
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,693
This person has posted a video
exposing it.

140
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,693
From the video,

141
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,652
the food was from our hotel.

142
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,253
But it's impossible.

143
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:28,573
Our ingredients

144
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,693
are personally selected and purchased

145
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,493
by the Head Chef early every morning,

146
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:33,733
and they never stay overnight.

147
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:36,373
Of course, we still have to investigate.

148
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,412
We have already had samples of the dish

149
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,692
sent to the relevant institutions
for testing.

150
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,133
Mr. Cui, don't worry.

151
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,493
I'm coming over right away.

152
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:48,652
Right.

153
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,853
I understand.

154
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,052
Would you please also understand me?

155
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,292
This matter will be resolved soon.

156
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,292
Alright, I see.

157
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,692
You all, just cool down, okay?

158
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:02,052
It's getting a bit chaotic, Chenghuan.

159
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:04,133
What should we do?
I'll follow your lead.

160
00:09:05,453 --> 00:09:07,373
If they want to check out, let them.

161
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:09,133
This way, our loss will be significant.

162
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,172
It's not a small issue.

163
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,133
Then you need to be quick and give us

164
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,213
a solution right away.

165
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,853
We have to go out and
look for another hotel now.

166
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,853
Everyone, sorry for the inconvenience.

167
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,733
May I take a few minutes of your time?

168
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,052
Hello everyone,
I'm the person in charge at Xing'anli.

169
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:24,572
Now the situation is

170
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,453
that we've caused inconvenience for you.

171
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:27,892
We are very sorry.

172
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,453
However, at the moment, our hotel

173
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,493
has only suspended the operation
of the restaurant.

174
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,692
Our guest room services continue
as usual.

175
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,692
If you're still willing to
continue your stay,

176
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,493
I can offer room vouchers
as compensation for you.

177
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:42,052
Of course, if you wish to leave,

178
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,253
we'll assist in the procedures for you.

179
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,652
We will issue a full refund

180
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,453
I'm truly sorry, and I apologize to you.

181
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:48,853
Sorry, everyone.

182
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,172
Sorry.

183
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:53,932
Sorry.

184
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:55,853
They can't guarantee
the essential food sanitation.

185
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:56,373
Bad luck.

186
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:57,093
Sorry.

187
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,853
That's awful.

188
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:00,532
Yes, it's infuriating.

189
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:01,733
Sorry, sorry.

190
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,133
Alright.

191
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:04,652
Don't rush.

192
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:07,892
Ms. Chen.

193
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:08,932
Chenghuan,

194
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,812
what exactly is the situation?

195
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:13,013
I trusted you
so that I booked Xing'anli Hotel.

196
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,532
Now there's food poisoning.

197
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,613
All the guests are asking to check out.

198
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,133
Where can I find a new hotel
that meets the criteria?

199
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,292
I understand that, Ms. Chen.

200
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:23,213
I will immediately contact a hotel
of the same standard for you.

201
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,292
I'm really sorry.

202
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,973
Then be quick and get it done.

203
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,532
The clients are important to me.

204
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,613
Thank you.

205
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,133
Sorry.

206
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,373
Sorry, sorry.

207
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:34,052
We're not staying. We want to check out.

208
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,572
Don't stop us. We want to check out.

209
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,213
We really don't dare to stay anymore.

210
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:39,133
We don't dare to stay.

211
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:39,812
It's too horrible.

212
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:40,892
- We don't dare to stay.
- Alright.

213
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:41,772
Check out.

214
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,172
This has become a hot search topic
on the internet.

215
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,692
How did it get so blown up?

216
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:54,572
It's not just a hot search topic.

217
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:55,333
Look,

218
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,932
local Shanghai official accounts

219
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,292
have also posted
news of the suspension of the hotel.

220
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,892
How did the news spread so quickly?

221
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:06,733
Xing'anli relies on good reputation
for business.

222
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:08,172
Such an incident has occurred.

223
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:09,853
I can't shirk the blame.

224
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,253
Cui, I am the Head Chef.

225
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,892
I will take the blame for this.

226
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,292
Everyone, don't be discouraged.

227
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,373
As I know,

228
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,253
you all have been with my grandma

229
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:22,692
and gotten through a lot.

230
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:26,373
Since Xing'anli
has overcome difficulties before,

231
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,333
as long as
we still have our drive this time,

232
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,133
Xing'anli will not be defeated.

233
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:31,973
Okay.

234
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:34,973
The test results are out.

235
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:35,572
How is it?

236
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,172
Our dishes don't have any problems.

237
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,213
I knew it.

238
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,453
Just as I said.

239
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,172
Chenghuan,

240
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,248
thanks to your previous reminder
to keep samples of the dishes.

241
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,292
It saved Xing'anli in a critical moment.

242
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,760
Mr. Cui, have the PR department
write an article immediately,

243
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,292
to respond online.

244
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:54,532
Then let's not stand around.

245
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,052
Be quick and get ready.

246
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,613
Good. Come with me. Let's go.

247
00:11:58,613 --> 00:11:59,892
- Let's go.
- Cheer up.

248
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:00,853
Let's go.

249
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,465
(Declaration of Xing'anli Hotel)

250
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,253
Who is this?

251
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,613
These methods are too lousy, right?

252
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,772
Really disgusting.

253
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:17,493
It's not a clever move.
No need to be so agitated.

254
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,493
Thankfully, Chenghuan reacted quickly.

255
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,333
Contact the PR firm,

256
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,532
in case she can't conclude this matter
properly.

257
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:26,333
Understood.

258
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:33,772
Hello, Miss Mai.

259
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:34,692
Hello.

260
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,692
Chenghuan, I was just looking for you.

261
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:40,373
Mr. Cui,

262
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:41,493
take a look at this video.

263
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,172
What's the use of food testing?

264
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,292
There is certainly no problem
with those samples.

265
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,772
But as for the dishes
that I actually ate,

266
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,093
who can guarantee it?

267
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:55,572
Look, everyone,
I have medical records here.

268
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,772
Whether I get food poisoning or not,

269
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,892
should it be decided by the hotel
or the doctor?

270
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,253
This kind of hotel must be rectified

271
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:03,292
and exposed completely.

272
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,052
Just wait for it to shut down for good.

273
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,733
Look at these comments.

274
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,572
(It can be checked in Nuoru Hospital.
It's not just whatever the hotel claims.)

275
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,013
(That money was really "well spent".)
What kind of person he is?

276
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,772
The test results are out.
How can he still make excuses?

277
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:17,093
Those who made comments online,

278
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,733
can't they see the truth?

279
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,292
Mr. Cui, about this matter,

280
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,892
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence.

281
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,373
Think about it.

282
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:28,093
He just complained,
but didn't ask for compensation.

283
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:29,812
And now the public opinions online

284
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:31,532
is spreading way too fast.

285
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,493
Clearly, someone is behind this.

286
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,373
So it's not an ordinary complaint.

287
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,493
Could it be

288
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,493
that our hotel has offended someone?

289
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:42,652
How about this, Mr. Cui?

290
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,692
Let's check the surveillance video.

291
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,172
Locate the complainer
and then we'll talk.

292
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:45,613
Okay.

293
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,292
Let's go.

294
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,772
That's right. It's this guy.

295
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,333
I privately messaged him online earlier.

296
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,493
But he didn't reply.

297
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:56,932
Chenghuan,

298
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,133
we now have ample evidence.

299
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:00,973
We can ask that review site

300
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,892
to revoke his false comments
immediately.

301
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,692
Mr. Cui, don't rush. I got it.

302
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:07,692
Actually, I contacted the website
as soon as we got the evidence.

303
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,613
But, even if the website removes
his false statements,

304
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:14,373
the video he posted
has already gone viral online.

305
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,973
What we need to do now

306
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:17,333
is to counteract the public opinions.

307
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,493
We should find him out

308
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,172
and have him make a clarification video.

309
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,453
But he never intended
to let us find him in the first place.

310
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,093
How can we contact them?

311
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:27,973
Hello, boss.

312
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:29,333
Two things.

313
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,052
First, I contacted Mr. Liu
from the review site

314
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,892
and had him find out the info on the one
behind the defamation of Xing'anli.

315
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,172
Follow up on this.

316
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,093
Second,

317
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,373
help me make an appointment

318
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,572
with Mr. Li from the Global Golf Tour,

319
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,093
and tell him I want to see him tomorrow.

320
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,013
Boss, Ms. Zhang has always been the one
to contact about this.

321
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:47,892
Get on it right away.

322
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:52,613
Come in, please.

323
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:55,772
Chenghuan.

324
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,333
What are you here for?

325
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,253
I've come to help.

326
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,093
This matter is not simple.

327
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,853
There's malicious competition
going on behind this.

328
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,093
I've got a friend at the review site.

329
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,292
They're looking into the identity
of the rumormonger.

330
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,172
Someone's behind this.

331
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:13,652
Yao Zhiming,

332
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,772
you deliberately slandered Xing'anli,

333
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,172
to drive down the price for a takeover,
right?

334
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,493
I didn't cooperate with you,

335
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,292
so you used this method
to mess with Xing'anli. Am I right?

336
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,412
I didn't.

337
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,373
Chenghuan, believe me.

338
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,532
You had just told me
you wanted Xing'anli,

339
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,572
but I didn't agree,

340
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,493
and immediately,
Xing'anli encountered these issues.

341
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,932
How can you expect me to believe you?

342
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,093
Xing'anli is the result
of Grandma's hard work.

343
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,932
Even if I want to get it,

344
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,932
I wouldn't resort to
such despicable means.

345
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,892
Current public opinions

346
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,973
are quite unfavorable for Xing'anli.

347
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,572
Let me help.

348
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:54,652
I will look into our affairs myself.

349
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,333
Your identity makes it inconvenient
for you to be here.

350
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,572
You better leave.

351
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,932
I've read the letter Grandma gave me.

352
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,572
She hoped we would help each other,

353
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:07,292
rather than harm one another.

354
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,373
Please give me another chance,

355
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,292
a chance to prove my innocence.

356
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:22,853
I think,

357
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,572
the more people we have,
the stronger we'll be.

358
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:49,733
Chenghuan.

359
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,453
I'm sorry, I...

360
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:55,213
It's okay.

361
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,973
I didn't notice you.

362
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:00,173
You...

363
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:06,493
You could wipe it yourself.

364
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:07,893
There's some paper here.

365
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,852
It's all soaked.

366
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:12,292
Mr. Yao,

367
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,372
I have the uniform from Xing'anli.

368
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:16,493
How about you make do and get changed?

369
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,332
I hope you can remember,

370
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,852
don't try to be tough
in front of family.

371
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:43,213
Family

372
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:47,052
means to bear each other's
burdens and troubles.

373
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,413
There are many times in one's life

374
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:51,173
when it is necessary to lean on others.

375
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:55,213
Otherwise,
how can people get close to each other?

376
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,893
Independence is certainly important,

377
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:01,532
but if you wear yourself out,

378
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,532
being independent from others,

379
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,612
what good is that?

380
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,092
What's wrong?

381
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,612
You're eating so fast.

382
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,852
Like you're starved. Slow down.

383
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,933
You believe me now?

384
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:33,213
I cooked noodles for you
because you were sick before.

385
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,132
I'm afraid Grandma will blame me,
if anything happens to you again.

386
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:40,572
Okay.

387
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:50,933
Hello, Mr. Liu.

388
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,572
Have you found the person?

389
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,372
Good.
I'll invite you to play golf later.

390
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:58,132
How is it?

391
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,733
Found him.
I've got his contact information.

392
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,572
I'll contact him.

393
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,493
No need.

394
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,852
You've already stayed up with us
all night.

395
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:06,052
You've helped enough already.

396
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,772
Give it to me. I'll handle it.

397
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:37,973
Hello,

398
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:41,052
this is Mai Chenghuan,
the general manager of Xing'anli Hotel.

399
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,132
I would like to ask...

400
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,292
He hung up.

401
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,612
Hello, sir.

402
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,933
We would like to

403
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:07,013
offer you cash compensation

404
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,933
and apology in person.

405
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:15,372
I'm wondering if you have the time.

406
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,173
Done.

407
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:31,064
(Okay.)

408
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,852
How about I go with you
to find that person?

409
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:39,453
No need.

410
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,653
I just told Mao.
She will come to see me in a while.

411
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:45,453
Young man, help me with my luggage.
Thank you.

412
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,173
- That, the recep...
- Never mind.

413
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,413
I'll do it.

414
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:50,413
Be careful.

415
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:05,612
Mr. Yao.

416
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:10,973
Hello, Mr. Yao.

417
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:16,532
You...

418
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,132
No way.

419
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,532
What's going on with you?

420
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,173
Your outfit...

421
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:28,173
Are you planning
to be a doorman at Xing'anli?

422
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,372
Besides,

423
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:31,372
the size of your clothes
isn't right either.

424
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,852
Half of your leg is still showing.

425
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:36,413
Cut the chatter.
Haven't you seen such long legs?

426
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,292
Have you scheduled with Mr. Li?

427
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,372
I did make the appointment.

428
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:43,052
But look at you now.

429
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,372
Clearly you haven't slept all night.
Can you handle it?

430
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,173
Go get me some clothes.

431
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:48,772
Then go to...

432
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,493
Go on.

433
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:55,893
The PR team I asked you to find before,

434
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:57,852
tell them,

435
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,572
if Mai Chenghuan settles it,

436
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:01,213
Xing'anli will surely issue a statement.

437
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:03,013
Spend more money on helping spread it,

438
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,332
to suppress the rumors.

439
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:06,973
Understood.
It's all about the financial power.

440
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,332
How about I give you all the money,

441
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:10,852
and you take it into the coffin?

442
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:12,453
That won't be necessary.

443
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:13,812
I could use that money

444
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:14,893
to buy you some pants.

445
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:19,173
I'm going right now.

446
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,772
Huan, to the right as you enter.

447
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,772
A guy wearing a black baseball cap

448
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,493
is the person from the complaint video.

449
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:51,372
He came here by himself.

450
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,453
Hello, I'm Mai Chenghuan from Xing'anli.

451
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:24,572
Sir, how are you feeling now?

452
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:26,933
I became like this
after eating your dishes.

453
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:28,772
I haven't drunk it yet.

454
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,933
I came here to discuss
about the compensation with you.

455
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,453
However, in return,

456
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:39,772
I also need to know the full story.

457
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:42,052
Would you mind showing me
your medical records?

458
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:43,973
Why? You don't believe me?

459
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:45,572
It's not like that.

460
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,453
Even if we offer you compensation,

461
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,292
we still need some relevant documents.

462
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:51,332
If you do not provide them to me,

463
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:52,852
it will be difficult for me to proceed.

464
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:03,213
Thank you.

465
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,372
You arrived at Xing'anli for a meal
at eleven o'clock,

466
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,253
and left Xing'anli at twelve o'clock.

467
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:13,733
The clinic was located
in Chuansha, Pudong.

468
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,453
You consulted at

469
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:16,292
(Consulted at: 12:31:27
on Sep. 16, 2023)

470
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,693
half past twelve.

471
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,772
Any questions?

472
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,173
I went to Chuansha with a friend
to handle some affairs.

473
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:24,612
I was vomiting and having diarrhea
on the way.

474
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:26,413
Sir,

475
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:28,052
from Xing'anli to Chuansha,

476
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,612
even if there's no traffic jam,

477
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,292
it takes at least forty minutes.

478
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,372
How did you manage
to spend thirty minutes

479
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,132
to get to the Chuansha clinic?

480
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,973
You are setting a trap for me,
aren't you?

481
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:43,493
Well then, sir,

482
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:46,532
we will take you to the hospital
for a comprehensive examination.

483
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:47,612
The car and driver

484
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,812
are already waiting outside.

485
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:50,052
We can leave at any time.

486
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,733
Alright, never mind. I'll let it go.

487
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,493
Who are you?

488
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,733
I'm an attorney of Xing'anli Hotel.

489
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:01,612
The conversation you just had,

490
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:02,612
I heard it all.

491
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,693
Under circumstances
where the facts have not been settled,

492
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:07,292
you smeared Xing'anli on the internet.

493
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,372
According to the law,

494
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,372
we have sufficient grounds
to sue you for defamation.

495
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:20,013
What are you going to do?

496
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,572
Sir, please speak frankly.

497
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,173
Are you simply extorting,

498
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:24,453
or someone instructed you to do it?

499
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,052
If you tell the truth,

500
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:29,332
we can discuss everything.

501
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,612
But if you refuse to cooperate,

502
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:36,572
then we will call the police.

503
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,453
(I am very sorry.)

504
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,413
(I was quick-tongued momentarily,)

505
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:44,893
(and posted on the internet)

506
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:46,693
(misstatements about Xing'anli Hotel,)

507
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,253
(specifically regarding their food.)

508
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:50,933
(This has caused a negative impact)

509
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,612
(on Xing'anli Hotel and its staff.)

510
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,693
(I would like to clarify
to the general netizens...)

511
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,612
Great!

512
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,653
My heart feels relieved.

513
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,372
I'm glad you were here today.

514
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,852
If I were alone,

515
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:04,572
I would still feel somewhat uneasy.

516
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:06,772
Where are you going later?

517
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,253
I can't invite you for a meal today.

518
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,933
I need to make a trip to Botticelli.

519
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,653
For what?

520
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:14,132
To settle scores with Yao Zhiming?
I'm in.

521
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:18,772
It definitely wasn't done
by Yao Zhiming,

522
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,013
He's not that low-level.

523
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,772
What kind of high-level means did he use

524
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:26,572
to make you speak for him?

525
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,092
Playing the emotional card, huh?

526
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,812
Mao.

527
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,973
I'll be heading to Botticelli in a bit,

528
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,493
to tell Yao Zhiming of my decision.

529
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:39,893
Miss Mai, you can do it!

530
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:41,372
Go. Hurry.

531
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,173
Then I'm off.

532
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:52,413
- I...
- How about I send you back home?

533
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:54,693
What if Song Huaimin causes trouble
again?

534
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:56,973
No need.

535
00:27:58,413 --> 00:27:59,852
If he had any shame,

536
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,092
he wouldn't come back again.

537
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:10,572
I'm sorry.

538
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,173
I was too impulsive last time.
Don't take it to heart.

539
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:19,532
I just don't want our relationship
in the future

540
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,733
to become so awkward.

541
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,453
What did you say that day?

542
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,772
I've forgotten all about it.

543
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,532
What I mean is...

544
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:35,572
Aren't you busy with work?

545
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,893
Besides, we're not on the way
to the same place either.

546
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,852
I also have an appointment with someone
to look at my designs.

547
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:46,772
You should head back earlier.

548
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:47,453
I'm going now.

549
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,612
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

550
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:49,372
See you.

551
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,372
- Miss Mai is here!
- Miss Mai is here!

552
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,332
Chenghuan.

553
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,092
How's it going?

554
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,612
Don't worry. It's been taken care of.

555
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,572
That's wonderful!

556
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,013
I was prepared to be unemployed.

557
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,372
I didn't expect Chenghuan would solve it

558
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:28,572
just like a piece of cake,

559
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:29,812
and get everything settled.

560
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:32,413
Come on, let's celebrate.

561
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:37,612
If not for Chenghuan's
constant reminders

562
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:38,372
to keep food samples,

563
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,013
it really couldn't have been clarified.

564
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:41,572
Chenghuan,

565
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:42,852
to be honest,

566
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,920
ever since Ms. Chen passed away,

567
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,372
we've all felt like

568
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,852
a group without leader.

569
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,253
Especially when encountering
this matter, we felt very panicked.

570
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:51,612
Now it's good.

571
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,532
Xing'anli has its leader again.

572
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:55,453
Not really, Mr. Cui.

573
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:56,772
Thank you, everyone.

574
00:29:57,173 --> 00:29:59,213
Although the crisis has been resolved
for now,

575
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:02,092
but actually,
the business situation of Xing'anli

576
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,292
is not so ideal.

577
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,852
After all, the negative impact

578
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,132
has already been left behind.

579
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:07,933
So the road ahead,

580
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,372
I still have to walk step by step
with everyone.

581
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:13,852
Rest assured.
It's now the information age.

582
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,852
As long as the voice
of positive comments is loud enough

583
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,572
to be passed on by word of mouth,

584
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,292
it can certainly suppress
that of the negative ones, right?

585
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:20,973
Yes.

586
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:23,092
Come on, let's all

587
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:25,372
ask our relatives and friends
to share the video

588
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,453
and clarify the facts.

589
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:26,933
Right.

590
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,453
Right, we can send it too.

591
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:29,933
This is an energy boost

592
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,092
for everyone.

593
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,292
Thank you all for your hard work.

594
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:35,893
(I am very sorry.)

595
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:39,253
(I was quick-tongued momentarily,)

596
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,173
(and posted on the internet)

597
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:42,933
(misstatements about Xing'anli Hotel...)

598
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,493
Look,

599
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,292
they did it so efficient and clear.

600
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:48,733
The problem was solved so quickly.

601
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:50,453
If she can't even handle this,

602
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:52,132
she shouldn't be in this industry.

603
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,332
You just don't admit it yet.

604
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,453
By the way,

605
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,092
I have already paid the advance
for the PR.

606
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,612
Remember to transfer it to me later.

607
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:03,693
So serious.

608
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,092
What? Need some money?

609
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,213
No.

610
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:08,173
I'm just afraid
you will duck out of paying.

611
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:10,292
Forget it. Just transfer it to me now.

612
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:11,493
Come on.

613
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,013
It's no fun, Mr. Yao.

614
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:16,852
Quickly, I'm at work.
Transfer the money to me.

615
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:22,493
Grandma,

616
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,092
I haven't disappointed you, have I?

617
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:30,332
Chenghuan.

618
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:32,572
Chenghuan,

619
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,173
I just received a call
from the Health Bureau.

620
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:37,052
They notified
that we can resume normal operations.

621
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:40,332
Really? That's great!

622
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:42,092
You acted really quickly.

623
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:43,332
You spent money to spread

624
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,532
the clarification video.

625
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:47,173
Negative comments on the review site
have all been taken down.

626
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,653
This turned out to be a good thing.
It's like a kind of advertising as well.

627
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,453
Just now, there was a travel agency

628
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,173
calling to inquire about business.

629
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,653
Mr. Cui, I'm not the one who did these.

630
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:01,173
Doing these things
requires money and resources.

631
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,572
It's Mr. Yao?

632
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:08,693
Mr. Cui,

633
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,852
help me organize everyone
to resume business.

634
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,052
We must check and recheck
the ingredients and keep samples.

635
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,292
I'm going to Botticelli.

636
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,532
I'll leave it to you.

637
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:18,213
Okay.

638
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:19,772
I'm leaving, Mr. Cui.

639
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,253
Huan, you're here.

640
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,173
Chenghuan.

641
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:30,092
Lily.

642
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:33,132
Chenghuan.

643
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,973
What brought you here today?

644
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:37,132
I heard
you became the boss of Xing'anli.

645
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:39,893
I came to see Mr. Yao today.

646
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,052
Is he in the office?

647
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:41,893
Mr. Yao?

648
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,693
He's in Ms. Zhang's office.

649
00:32:44,973 --> 00:32:46,092
Then I'll wait for him.

650
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:49,464
I've always been the one
following up on the Global Golf project.

651
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:51,960
What's your intention
taking it away now?

652
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,812
Ms. Zhang,

653
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,973
you work on Xing'anli,
and I take your clients.

654
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,933
Isn't that quite normal and fair?

655
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,213
I talked on the phone
with Amber last night.

656
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,973
I said, I've come back

657
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,852
and have been here for a while.

658
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,213
I found the domestic market is vast.

659
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:08,253
I can help him expand it.

660
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:10,612
If Amber approves,

661
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:12,572
then I won't leave.

662
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,693
At that time,
I would seek much guidance from you.

663
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:21,532
Zhiming,

664
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,372
I'm helping you.

665
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:25,693
If you can't get Xing'anli,

666
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,292
how can you get a promotion?

667
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,332
Xing'anli and Mai Chenghuan

668
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,693
are both entrusted to me by grandma.

669
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,332
I won't allow anyone

670
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,493
in any form

671
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:40,372
to harm them.

672
00:33:58,173 --> 00:33:58,933
Here you are.

673
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,173
Here I am.

674
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,413
Do you have time? I'd like to invite you
for a cup of coffee.

675
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,213
Sure, let's go.

676
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:06,372
I'm off.

677
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:07,292
Go ahead.

678
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,572
In fact,
when the person who complained told me

679
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:24,572
that it was someone from Yueda
behind it,

680
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:25,652
I guessed

681
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:27,453
it must be Zhang Peisheng.

682
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,013
You knew it too, right?

683
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:33,773
Why didn't you tell me before?

684
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:36,692
I have my professional stance.

685
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,493
I couldn't tell you.

686
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,493
Actually, there's something
I've always wanted to tell you.

687
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,692
I've been collaborating with
Zhang Peisheng all along.

688
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,773
After getting Xing'anli,

689
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,013
she will get promoted to CEO,

690
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:54,680
and I'll be back to headquarters
for promotion.

691
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,612
Since now you've taken over Xing'anli,

692
00:34:57,692 --> 00:34:59,092
can she still take you into account?

693
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:06,933
So that's how it is.

694
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,813
But it's understandable.

695
00:35:12,692 --> 00:35:14,853
In front of interests,
even the best friendship

696
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:16,572
is insignificant.

697
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:22,333
Alright.

698
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:24,933
I've told you everything.

699
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:28,092
Do you believe me now?

700
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:33,973
I came here this time

701
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:35,333
to thank you.

702
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:37,572
For what?

703
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:40,172
For bringing up the issue
of food security to me before.

704
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:42,453
If it wasn't for your reminder,

705
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,453
I wouldn't have reminded Mr. Cui

706
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,973
to keep daily samples of the dishes.

707
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,172
Somehow, you helped me

708
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:51,373
and Xing'anli.

709
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:00,252
Yao Zhiming,

710
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:03,132
I wrongly blamed you before.

711
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:05,132
I apologize to you.

712
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,692
It's okay. There's no need to apologize.

713
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:09,333
No. An apology is necessary.

714
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,532
That's what Grandma said.

715
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:13,172
Thank you and sorry
must be said in person.

716
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,333
Otherwise, you will become someone

717
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,692
who finds it increasingly difficult
to express their emotions.

718
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,973
Then, if you like someone,

719
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:26,853
do you have to express it in person too?

720
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:32,973
Liking someone...

721
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:35,973
Of course.

722
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,333
If you don't say it,

723
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,172
what if the two people miss out
on each other?

724
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:49,013
I like you.

Yes.

745
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:34,172
Then, I will come to see you.

746
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,013
Okay.

747
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:36,373
See you later.

748
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:45,212
This rice cake is delicious.

749
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:48,013
Have some crayfish.

750
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,773
You're so busy today,

751
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:51,732
yet you still have time
to bring me crayfish?

752
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,413
I came back from Botticelli.

753
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,612
Since your place is on my way,
I brought it to you.

754
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,373
From Botticelli?
Then my place is not on your way back.

755
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:05,453
Out with it, what's up?

756
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,293
It's nothing.

757
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:15,612
It's just that

758
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:17,252
recently,

759
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,692
I've encountered some situations.

760
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:21,333
What happened?

761
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:23,813
To be precise,

762
00:39:24,413 --> 00:39:26,132
it's not
that I've encountered some situations,

763
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,212
but Yao Zhiming had some situations.

764
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,212
What does his situation
have to do with you?

765
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,172
It actually does have something to do
with me.

766
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:41,293
It's just that Yao Zhiming...

767
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:45,413
He said that he likes me.

768
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:48,893
Really? No kidding?

769
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,973
He's not trying to reel you in

770
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,132
and then get Xing'anli?

771
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,453
That's definitely not it.

772
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,493
He's not that petty.

773
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:01,893
Anyway, the matter is quite complicated.

774
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:04,373
His expression

775
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:07,293
seems quite sincere.

776
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,493
Although I don't know much about him,

777
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,493
I think this person is not simple.

778
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,453
You'd better be more cautious.

779
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:21,092
Think from a different perspective.

780
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:23,572
Anyway, you're single now.

781
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:25,652
You have a career and money.

782
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:27,013
There's also no rush to get married.

783
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,532
What's wrong with having a date?

784
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:36,132
Only if you are also a bit interested.

785
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:39,132
I'm not. I'm certainly not.

786
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:41,933
Moreover,

787
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,973
I'm already a rich woman now.

788
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,413
As for romantic relationships,

789
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:47,252
I'll definitely have to
carefully think it over.

790
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:48,652
I'm not in a hurry.

791
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:49,853
Really?

792
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,612
I think it's okay. He's quite handsome.

793
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,813
Come on, have a drink.

794
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,912
I'll order a bit more.

795
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:14,648
Okay, thank you.

796
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:15,352
Anything else?

797
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:16,132
Anything is fine.

798
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:17,853
Just wait.

799
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:19,493
One moment.

800
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:22,413
Keep an eye on it.

801
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:26,652
Let me tell you, this Alice...

802
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,333
Today it's Alice,

803
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,973
tomorrow Cindy.

804
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:32,453
You might as well listen to my Mary.

805
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:33,893
Mary?

806
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:37,893
Mai Chenghuan?
What's the situation with you two?

807
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:42,052
Mary is ready to marry you?

808
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,172
It's a good start anyway.

809
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:13,493
Ms. Zhang,

810
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,532
about those negative press releases
for Xing'anli,

811
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:17,572
are we still releasing them?

812
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:18,773
Stop them all.

813
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,532
The current Yao Zhiming

814
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:23,413
is no longer
the Yao Zhiming of the past.

815
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:27,252
Ms. Zhang,
you're now the acting President.

816
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,493
You're half a level higher than Mr. Yao
in terms of rank.

817
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,172
Why do we have to give way to him
in everything?

818
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:34,293
In your opinion,

819
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:37,572
what exactly is his relationship
with Mai Chenghuan?

820
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:39,532
They...

821
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:42,973
If one didn't know they were siblings,

822
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,132
judging from what Mr. Yao says,

823
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,453
I would really think they were a couple.

824
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:54,333
Once a person has a weak spot,

825
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:57,652
it will become a target for others
to attack.
