00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,976
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,356
Excuse me, madam.

4
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:37,556
May I ask where Feng's Mandarin Fish is?

5
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:39,716
This is Ms. Feng's shop.

6
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,916
But it's a cake shop.

7
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,875
Ms. Feng has closed her shop long ago.

8
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,716
Madam, do you know

9
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:50,515
where she lives now?

10
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,116
Yeah, I do.

11
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:53,315
I can tell you.

12
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:55,356
Thank you.

13
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:56,155
Thank you.

14
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,515
Madam.

15
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,196
May I ask

16
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:12,795
where the house No.723 is?

17
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:13,955
Over there.

18
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,036
Thank you.

19
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:27,675
I guess here it is.

20
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:31,795
Hello?

21
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:34,835
Is anyone there?

22
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,756
Hello, is this Ms. Feng's house?

23
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:43,916
Why?

24
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:46,675
We would like to ask you
to make us a mandarin fish dish.

25
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,076
Can you do that?

26
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:49,916
The shop closed long ago.
We don't make it anymore.

27
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,995
Hello, sorry to disturb you.

28
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,024
Hello?

29
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,316
Haven't I already said it?
We don't make it anymore.

30
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,795
Sorry, Ms. Feng.

31
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,436
I know I am disturbing you.

32
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:08,476
But right now,

33
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,876
I have an emergency.

34
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,356
my mom was from this village.

35
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,955
She grew up eating your mandarin fish.

36
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,515
She is sick now

37
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,715
and wants to eat it again.

38
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,156
I wonder if you could make an exception
and help us make it.

39
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:21,715
Yes.

40
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,156
I am not Ms. Feng.

41
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,356
Ms. Feng is my mom.

42
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:28,395
She can't make it anymore.
You can come in and see.

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,715
Come in.

44
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:32,436
Thank you.

45
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,196
Thanks.

46
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,196
Mom.

47
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,955
Two kids came to see me.

48
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,356
You eat your food.

49
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:46,196
How are you?

50
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:47,115
How are you?

51
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,555
See, she's like this.

52
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:51,995
She cannot do it.

53
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:57,115
Madam, can you do it?

54
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,356
I don't know how, nor will I do it.

55
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:04,115
Chenghuan.

56
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,316
Let's think of another way.

57
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:07,515
Chew it up.

58
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:09,316
Alright.

59
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,636
Sorry to interrupt.

60
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,316
Sorry, Ms. Feng.

61
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,235
Sorry to interrupt.

62
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,316
We're leaving.

63
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:16,076
Sorry to interrupt.

64
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,116
You are Chenghuan?

65
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,715
Yes.

66
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:20,715
Wanyu?

67
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,236
Liu Wanyu is your mom?

68
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:25,475
Yes, she's my mom.

69
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:26,715
Do you know her?

70
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:30,715
Mom, she's Wanyu's daughter.

71
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:32,876
Look, she has grown up.

72
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:33,796
Have a seat.

73
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,475
Grab a stool and sit.

74
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,316
Alright, we can do it ourselves.

75
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,475
We are more than just acquaintances.

76
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,955
Ever since I was little,

77
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:45,556
My mom has pushed me
to learn how to cook mandarin fish.

78
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,436
But I don't like or want to learn it.

79
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:48,876
So she hit me.

80
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,715
One time she hit me really hard.

81
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:52,915
I hid outside and sat there crying.

82
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:56,955
I just saw a little girl sitting
around the corner

83
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,116
in the distance.

84
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,715
She cried even more loudly than me.

85
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,116
We hugged each other and cried.

86
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:04,796
In the end, we became friends.

87
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:09,876
My mom never told me about this.

88
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:11,955
What happened to my mom back then?

89
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,355
Why was she crying?

90
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,196
An opera school
in the city was recruiting students.

91
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,715
She was admitted.

92
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,155
But she didn't have the money

93
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,915
to send her to study.

94
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,676
What a pity. She has a good voice.

95
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,116
I never knew
that when your mom was young,

96
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:31,715
she was talented in singing opera.

97
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,835
She couldn't study,

98
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:38,835
so she was very upset.

99
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,756
She advised me to go to Shanghai

100
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,395
with her and try our luck.

101
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:43,835
She tried to leave this place.

102
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,076
My mom made her mandarin fish

103
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,076
and encouraged her

104
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,116
to put in the same effort
as she did in opera singing.

105
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,796
If so, she would succeed.

106
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,275
I admire your mom.

107
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,076
A young girl ventured

108
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,796
to Shanghai alone.

109
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,835
Your mom is sick?

110
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:05,915
What illness?

111
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,116
How is she now?

112
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,035
It's not serious, madam.

113
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,076
My mom just has a minor illness.

114
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,796
She'll be fine after some rest.

115
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,475
So she came back to recuperate.

116
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,196
She told me
she was craving your mandarin fish.

117
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:19,676
So I'm here for that.

118
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,715
But I can't help.

119
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,275
I don't know how to cook it.

120
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:32,955
Madam.

121
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,636
Can Ms. Feng teach me

122
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,715
to cook it?

123
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,155
Please try this.

124
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,556
Please tell me how it tastes.

125
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:34,756
Does it taste right?

126
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:38,915
I'll add a bit more.

127
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,076
Is this much okay?

128
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,076
Taste it again.

129
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:00,796
Okay.

130
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:25,835
Zhiming.

131
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:27,715
Make the fire stronger.

132
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:56,595
Are you okay?

133
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,635
I'm fine.

134
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,595
Is it enough?

135
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,635
Yes, it is.

136
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:03,196
Make it a little stronger.

137
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,396
Ms. Feng, please taste it.

138
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:42,875
How does it taste?

139
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,595
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

140
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,436
Chenghuan, come here.

141
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:00,115
I've found something good for you.

142
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,556
Sit here. Look.

143
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:03,355
Photo album.

144
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,635
Look, who is this?

145
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:21,196
Look at your mom.

146
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,635
She was glowing back then.

147
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,276
This is my mom?

148
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:27,516
Yeah, of course.

149
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:30,436
Your mom was quite famous back then.

150
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,955
Your mom was best
at playing the Female Prince Consort.

151
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:37,396
She had a good voice and appearance.

152
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,276
When she got on stage,
many young men went to listen.

153
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:50,995
Zhiming, thank you.

154
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,196
For what?

155
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,875
Thank you
for helping me protect my home.

156
00:10:58,835 --> 00:10:59,916
Your home?

157
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,796
Isn't it also my home?

158
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,595
Look at your face.

159
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,635
You're especially down-to-earth now.

160
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,916
(♪I left my home to save my husband♪)

161
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:31,715
(♪Unexpectedly,
I passed the imperial examination♪)

162
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,316
What's wrong?
Did you think of something?

163
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:13,316
It's nothing.

164
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:19,755
This place

165
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,635
was where people performed opera.

166
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,396
Every month,

167
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,396
there would be one or two performances.

168
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,715
I've even performed opera on this stage.

169
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:38,276
Back then,

170
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:42,715
the seats below were fully packed.

171
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,156
Now, there are no performances.

172
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,835
The young people have all left here.

173
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,835
There aren't many
who watch opera anymore.

174
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:01,995
Let's go back.

175
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,355
Have you finished a walk?

176
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:27,755
Are you tired?

177
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,396
You go to sleep.

178
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,156
Huan.

179
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,115
Your mom's condition is getting worse.

180
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,916
We must hurry back.

181
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,556
Dad, don't worry. Have a seat.

182
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,036
Dad.

183
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,556
Even if we force mom to go back now,

184
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,635
I guess she won't agree.

185
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,835
So what do we do?
We can't just let her be.

186
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:55,355
We can't waste any more time.

187
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,036
This is what I think.

188
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,036
Right now,

189
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:02,475
mom isn't mentally prepared
for treatment.

190
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:03,955
So, at this time,

191
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,955
we should try to encourage her,

192
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,835
giving her the courage to live and hope.

193
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,036
But this hope cannot come from us

194
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:12,796
but from herself.

195
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:14,676
We make her

196
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,676
feel optimistic about her future life.

197
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,235
So is there anything

198
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:22,676
we can do to help her?

199
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:26,796
Do you remember those posters
you showed me last time?

200
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:27,595
Yeah, I do.

201
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,715
Mom loved performing opera
when she was young.

202
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,995
She sang very well.

203
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,835
Now that you mention it, I remember.

204
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,115
When your mom and I just started dating,

205
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:39,995
she would always drag me
to watch operas,

206
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:42,516
like Shaoxing opera,
Huangmei opera, and Beijing opera.

207
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,955
She liked all kinds of operas.

208
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,715
So I think

209
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,715
this could be a breakthrough.

210
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:48,796
If...

211
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:50,316
I mean,

212
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,676
if we help mom
fulfill what she couldn't do

213
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,355
when she was young,

214
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:56,115
perhaps

215
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,475
it could rekindle her hope for life.

216
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:00,595
You mean

217
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,036
we help her rebuild confidence

218
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,516
in life?

219
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:06,875
Exactly.

220
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,436
Huan, that's an amazing idea.

221
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:10,875
I will listen to you.

222
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:21,516
Be careful.

223
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:24,796
What are you doing?

224
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,076
They don't know how to use the stove.

225
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:29,396
Just sit here.

226
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:30,715
They said

227
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,235
they wanted to show filial piety to you.

228
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,715
Just sit here and wait.

229
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,355
Enjoy your time here.

230
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,436
Mom.

231
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,196
I made the fish. Give it a try.

232
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,715
Does it taste the same as before?

233
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:52,755
Here, Ms. Liu.

234
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:12,956
How does it taste?

235
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:16,155
How does it taste?

236
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,675
Let me taste it.

237
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:31,716
Not bad.

238
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:33,036
Yu.

239
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,395
Compared to the mandarin fish
you used to make,

240
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:37,036
it tastes a bit different.

241
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,516
But it's quite delicious.

242
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:41,355
Ms. Liu.

243
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:43,236
Huan put a lot of thought

244
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,635
into this dish.

245
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,355
She learned to cook it from Ms. Feng.

246
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:48,675
She wanted

247
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:50,756
to let you taste an authentic flavor
of home.

248
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,476
It's okay, mom.

249
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,675
If it's unpalatable, you won't eat it.

250
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:04,675
Delicious.

251
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,115
It's more delicious than the one I ate

252
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:16,875
when I was young.

253
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:38,316
You can't eat too much salt.

254
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,675
Mom, if you like it,

255
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:48,276
I'll make it for you every day, okay?

256
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,835
Yu.

257
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,476
I'll take you to watch an opera tonight.

258
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,276
(Villagers, attention!)

259
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:16,915
(There's a performance tonight.)

260
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,756
Dad, mom.

261
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,476
Zao, how come you're here?

262
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,435
Look.

263
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,956
Mom, over here.

264
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:34,395
Come.

265
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,635
How come you're here?

266
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:36,996
Didn't I tell you?

267
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,155
I came back right after work.

268
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,796
I got here early on purpose
to save seats for you.

269
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,635
You arrived without telling us.

270
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,036
What's this for? A shadow play?

271
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,516
Where are Ming and Huan?

272
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,076
They will be here soon.

273
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:04,996
With the sound of gongs and drums,
the show begins.

274
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,556
Isn't that Huan's voice?

275
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,155
It is Huan's voice indeed.

276
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,996
Once there was a girl,

277
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:15,835
with high talent for singing opera.

278
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:19,756
She was smart and beautiful.

279
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:24,716
There came a selection of opera talents.

280
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:29,595
And she stood out.

281
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,435
Sadly,

282
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,675
her dream remained unfulfilled.

283
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,595
She kept the dream inside her heart.

284
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,155
The girl packed her bags

285
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:42,115
and left her hometown.

286
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,435
And it's been 30 years.

287
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,635
Her hair is turning grey.

288
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:52,195
As the days went on,

289
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:56,276
she got married.

290
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:04,435
Then she had two children.

291
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:11,595
She changed from a girl to a wife,

292
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:15,556
and from a wife to a mother.

293
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,076
With her courage,

294
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,875
she sheltered her family
from wind and rain

295
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:27,236
and fully supported her own children.

296
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:30,956
She aged slowly,

297
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:33,796
but in her heart,

298
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,595
she never forgot her dream.

299
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:38,276
That is,

300
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,556
one day,

301
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:44,076
she would stand on this stage again

302
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,076
and bloom beautifully.

303
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:57,355
I think she's telling your story.

304
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,835
Mom.

305
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,276
I know you've always had a dream
of singing opera.

306
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,956
I prepared it all for you.

307
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,556
I don't want you to have any regrets.

308
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:23,675
Mom, look.

309
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:25,556
Is this opera costume beautiful?

310
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:28,915
It's so beautiful.

311
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:31,635
I've never seen
such a beautiful opera costume before.

312
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:33,635
Ms. Liu.

313
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,195
We've specially invited the accompanist
you worked with before.

314
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:38,835
Just sing today.

315
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,835
We are your most loyal audience.

316
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:43,956
I...

317
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,195
I sing?

318
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:47,435
Honey.

319
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,756
I've never really

320
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,195
heard you sing opera before.

321
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:52,395
I'm looking forward to it.

322
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,435
No, I can't.

323
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:56,716
I'm afraid I can't sing really well.

324
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:57,435
I can't.

325
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,316
Mom, be confident. You can do it.

326
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:00,395
No, I...

327
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,516
Mom, turn around and look.

328
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:05,675
Look who's here.

329
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,996
I have invited all your friends over.

330
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,115
Yu.

331
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,635
We haven't seen each other for so long.

332
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:13,635
Yu.

333
00:23:14,236 --> 00:23:15,036
Ms. Feng.

334
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:17,355
Let me tell you, Yu.

335
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:19,956
You ate the mandarin fish of my family.

336
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,556
You have to sing for me.

337
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:22,516
Sure.

338
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:23,635
- Right?
- She should sing.

339
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,675
Yu, if you don't sing,

340
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:26,915
I will argue with you.

341
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:29,476
I can't do it.

342
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,395
Yu, you sang so well before.

343
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:33,996
Mom, everyone is watching.

344
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:34,956
Put the costume on.

345
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:39,476
- Put it on.
- Put it on.

346
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:51,556
- Put it on.
- Put it on.

What's going on?

407
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:47,796
Run.

408
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:48,796
- Yu, come.
- What?

409
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:49,395
Come quickly.

410
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,355
What's going on?

411
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,675
Look up.

412
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,115
Yu.

413
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:11,595
You used to say

414
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:13,316
I'm not romantic.

415
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:16,395
I did something romantic for you.

416
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:18,915
At this age,
what's the point of being romantic?

417
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,115
If you have the money for that,
I hope you spend it

418
00:29:21,115 --> 00:29:22,796
on a big meal.

419
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:23,796
Did you hear that?

420
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:24,996
I told you.

421
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,716
Your mom doesn't like this.

422
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,996
Who told you? I'm happy about this.

423
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,756
That's good.

424
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,595
Yu, do you have any other wishes

425
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,076
that haven't come true?

426
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,395
Make a wish right now.

427
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,956
I wish that our family stays healthy.

428
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:57,195
Great. A good wish.

429
00:29:58,716 --> 00:29:59,996
I also want to make a wish.

430
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:00,716
Go ahead.

431
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,756
I hope

432
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:03,716
if we have time in the future,

433
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:05,915
we can often come back
to this old house to live for a while.

434
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,395
That's simple.

435
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:08,956
We'll often come back.

436
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:09,595
Okay.

437
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:12,556
Dad, do you have any wishes?

438
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,316
Your wishes are my wishes.

439
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:26,316
I wanted to escape from home

440
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:28,236
to be an independent person.

441
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,835
But now, seeing how happy our family is,

442
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:36,236
I realize this is the best.

443
00:30:38,556 --> 00:30:39,355
Huan.

444
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,835
How about

445
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,875
we jointly establish a new hotel here?

446
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:48,956
Talking about work
during such a beautiful moment?

447
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:53,115
That's a good idea.

448
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:54,556
But I want to be the boss.

449
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:56,835
Of course, you'd be the boss.

450
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:57,956
Otherwise, who else will be?

00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:05,688

00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:08,280

454
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:24,956
Yu.

455
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,796
Tomorrow morning we will catch
the high-speed train back to Shanghai.

456
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:30,195
Go to sleep early tonight.

457
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,395
Dad, have you gone to sleep yet?

458
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,756
May I come in?

459
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:35,796
Yes, of course.

460
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:36,996
Haven't slept yet.

461
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,236
What's up?

462
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,036
Dad, I want to discuss something
with you.

463
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:42,875
What is it?

464
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:45,796
Tonight, I want to sleep with mom.

465
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:47,915
Sure.

466
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:50,236
I'll sleep with Zao.

467
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,236
Yu, I'm going to Zao's room.

468
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:02,875
I'm here.

469
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,675
Mom, when I was little,

470
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:18,675
I was scared of getting a shot,
final exams,

471
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,316
and watching a horror movie.

472
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:24,316
I always got into your bed
when I was scared.

473
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,556
I always feel warm

474
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,435
and safe

475
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:30,835
in your arms.

476
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:35,835
Now that I've grown up,

477
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:38,316
I'm your shelter.

478
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,835
It's my turn to protect you.

479
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:48,195
Don't be afraid, mom. I'm here.

480
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:17,080
(One year later)

481
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,796
You can tell my mom this news.

482
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:29,956
How's it going, Mrs. Mai?

483
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:30,595
Ms. Liu.

484
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:33,556
Mom, are you alright?

485
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:34,036
Mom.

486
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:35,195
Dad, how did it turn out?

487
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:37,316
Let her say it herself.

488
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:39,756
How did it go, mom?

489
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:44,516
I'm fine now.

490
00:33:47,076 --> 00:33:47,956
The doctor said

491
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:49,996
that the surgery was successful.

492
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:51,476
And I'm good now.

493
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,796
I don't need to take medicine anymore.

494
00:33:54,395 --> 00:33:56,115
You just scared me.

495
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:56,675
Exactly.

496
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:58,195
Sorry.

497
00:33:58,195 --> 00:33:59,516
What a relief.

498
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,355
No butterflies in my stomach anymore.

499
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:03,476
In your stomach?

500
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,395
Let me check it out.

501
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,675
It's here?

502
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:07,956
Here?

503
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,755
What is this?

504
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:11,556
Little baby?

505
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,396
- Mrs. Mai.
- Mom.

506
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:16,916
You're married. Don't you want kids?

507
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:19,155
Mom, again?

508
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,195
Urging them to have a baby?

509
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:20,996
I am sorry.

510
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:23,275
Mom.

511
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,675
Our family has finally reunited.

512
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,076
How are you gonna
spend the Mid-Autumn Festival?

513
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:28,396
We will make arrangements for you.

514
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:29,235
Yes.

515
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:31,755
I want to go to Anhui.

516
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,076
Okay.

517
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:34,436
Well, that's good.

518
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:36,876
Folks from Anhui
keep sending me messages.

519
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:39,155
They ask when you will go back
to perform for them again.

520
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:45,036
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,916
Go back. Don't stay here.

522
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:48,356
Let's go.

523
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:48,916
- Go home.
- Go.

524
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,235
Let's go.

525
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,275
Oh, right, Ms. Liu.

526
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,155
I have good news for you
when we get to Anhui.

527
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,235
Really? What good news?

528
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:57,755
You will know when we get there.

529
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,635
Tell me now.

530
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:00,556
I can't wait to know.

531
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:20,076
(Cooperation Launch Ceremony
of Xing'anli and Yueda Group)

532
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,996
Hello, everyone.

533
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:25,315
I am Mai Chengzao,
the host of this launching ceremony.

534
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,275
I am from Shang Village.

535
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:29,876
I grew up here.

536
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,195
Next, I would like
to invite Mr. Yao Zhiming,

537
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:36,436
the President of East China Region
of the Yueda Group, to give a speech.

538
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:44,715
Everyone.

539
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:47,675
Good morning.

540
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:50,275
This co-branded hotel is the first

541
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,916
to be co-created

542
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,275
by Yueda Group

543
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:54,516
and Xing'anli.

544
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,675
It boasts international

545
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,755
and high-standard services

546
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:02,356
and features unique characteristics,

547
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:03,635
a different kind of charm,

548
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,155
as well as humanitarian care.

549
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:08,956
I hope this hotel

550
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:10,996
can bring quaint Shang Village

551
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,356
more new development opportunities.

552
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,315
At the same time, I also hope

553
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,675
that it can provide tourists
with a new lodging experience.

554
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,115
I am looking forward to this.

555
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:24,195
Without further ado,

556
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:26,556
please welcome my partner,

557
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:28,556
Miss Mai Chenghuan.

00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,755
Hello, everyone, I am Mai Chenghuan.

00:36:41,476 --> 00:36:43,476
Welcome you all here today.

560
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:45,635
Spending good times

561
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,356
with your family

562
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,956
is the theme of our hotel.

563
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,235
I got this idea

564
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:55,036
a year ago.

565
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:58,916
When I returned to her hometown

566
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,876
with my sick mom,

567
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:05,876
I deeply and clearly realized

568
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:08,836
that the family

569
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,235
was so familiar

570
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:13,795
and precious to us.

571
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,715
Yet it's so easily overlooked.

572
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:18,836
Therefore, I hope our hotel

573
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,996
can become a station for everyone.

574
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:24,795
In the process
of your relentless progress,

575
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,996
we can momentarily pause,

576
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:28,556
slow down the pace,

577
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:31,315
and wait for our parents

578
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,476
to spend quality time together.

579
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:44,315
Home

580
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,476
is our driving force.

581
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:47,916
And love

582
00:37:48,795 --> 00:37:50,795
is the reason we stay put.

583
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:52,155
Thank you, everyone.

584
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:18,516
Mom.

585
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,516
After coming here,

586
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:22,315
I feel like

587
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,155
I've truly begun

588
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,036
to know you.

589
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:31,956
Mom.

590
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:34,315
I often think about it.

591
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:37,715
If you were born in my era,

592
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,675
you would become a great artist.

593
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:45,436
In a different era,

594
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,436
there are different ways of living.

595
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:51,356
In my life,

596
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,036
I married your dad

597
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:55,996
and gave birth to you and Zao.

598
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,715
It is the happiest thing for me.

599
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:05,115
However,

600
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:08,635
I have realized it.

601
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:12,036
Withdrawing from your life

602
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:16,516
is something I must learn to do.

603
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:18,356
It's a lesson I must finish.

604
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:26,195
Mom, you have misunderstood me.

605
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,275
I have never wanted to push you away.

606
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,436
I just want us to improve

607
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:34,956
and grow together.

608
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:37,996
We can be close family

609
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:40,876
and independent individuals.

610
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:42,715
When I was little,

611
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:45,876
you gave me enough love
and let me rely upon you.

612
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:47,916
Now, I've grown up.

613
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,315
I can take care of myself and my family.

614
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:52,956
So, mom,

615
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:56,675
I hope you can tear off the label of mom

616
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,155
and be yourself.

617
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:08,715
Be myself?

618
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,275
Let's just be ourselves.

619
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:51,396
Here, the last main dish, mandarin fish.

620
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:54,476
Come on. Let's all raise our glasses.

621
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:55,155
Come on.

622
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:57,356
Shouldn't we say something?

623
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,672
As for our family...

624
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:05,516
There are many happy things
in our family.

625
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,635
Dad doesn't even know where to start.

626
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:08,556
Yeah.

627
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:09,635
Then let me start.

628
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:12,155
I hope

629
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,516
Ms. Liu can be healthy

630
00:41:13,715 --> 00:41:14,795
and happy.

631
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:17,436
Wish you two

632
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:18,916
make a fortune

633
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:20,956
and a booming business.

634
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:21,635
Great.

635
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:22,675
Thank you, mom.

636
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:26,436
Wish Zao and Mao a happy wedding,

637
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:28,836
no, a happy marriage.

638
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:33,436
Congratulations to Mao
for becoming a member of our family.

639
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:35,275
- Thank you, dad.
- Wait.

640
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:39,996
Look, Zao is married ahead of you.

641
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:41,635
As his elder sister,

642
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:43,956
when will you and Ming get married

643
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:46,076
Dad.

644
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:47,036
What's the date

645
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,076
of the trip to Europe I booked

646
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:48,876
for you for next month?

647
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:49,715
The tenth.

648
00:41:49,795 --> 00:41:51,036
Don't get the date wrong.

649
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:51,436
I know.

650
00:41:51,436 --> 00:41:52,996
Alright, don't change the subject.

651
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:55,356
Look, Dingding is about
to start elementary school.

652
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:57,996
Dingding is going to elementary school?

653
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,516
- Congratulations.
- You'll take the college entrance exam very soon.

654
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:01,795
Congratulations.

655
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:02,956
Good.

656
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,436
Alright, I'll stop talking.

657
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,436
After all, you don't listen to me.

658
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:07,635
I won't interfere.

659
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:11,356
I'm busy performing in a lead role

660
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:12,836
at the senior theater troupe.

661
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:15,556
Alright, everyone.
Minds our own business.

662
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,036
She takes a lead role.

663
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,635
But then again,

664
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,876
when will you two get married?

665
00:42:21,076 --> 00:42:23,755
Shouldn't the man make the first move?

666
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,036
I'm always ready for that.

667
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:29,436
Come to me when you buy the ring.

668
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,235
Regarding Zhiming's attitude,

669
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:32,476
I must give him a thumb up.

670
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:35,876
I think
our family will never stop arguing.

671
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:39,115
The louder, the merrier.

672
00:42:39,115 --> 00:42:40,036
That's a family.

673
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:40,956
Am I right, mom?

674
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:41,715
Yes.

675
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:42,956
Come on. Raise your glasses.

676
00:42:42,956 --> 00:42:43,755
Come on.

677
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,956
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone.

678
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:47,755
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

679
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:48,556
Cheers.

680
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:50,916
Come on.

681
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,448
