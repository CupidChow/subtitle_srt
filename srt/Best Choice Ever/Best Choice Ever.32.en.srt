00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:29,880
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:35,275
You've known about them for a while now?

4
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,235
I saw the signs a long time ago.

5
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:41,596
You've been keeping it from me
all along.

6
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,704
Yeah. No, no, no.

7
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:47,316
I thought if I could see the signs,
you must be able to see them too.

8
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:52,036
What were you thinking, Mai Laitian?
You're quite something.

9
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,116
You have been hiding it
from me alone, right?

10
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,916
You're hiding it.
How long do you plan to keep it up?

11
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,556
You wanted to hide it from me until
they got their marriage certificate,

12
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,435
and tell me only after that, didn't you?
You're amazing.

13
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,275
You can act. You really can pretend.

14
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,556
I thought you could see it too.

15
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:07,715
You're great. You're so happy, right?
You're happy now.

16
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,515
That's it.
She's psychologically unbalanced now.

17
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,756
How could she know about it
later than me?

18
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,395
Take it to the kitchen in a while, okay?

19
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,756
It's fine. I'll go and talk to her.

20
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,115
Mr. Yao, you have quite a way
with words, don't you?

21
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:38,476
Did I say too much?

22
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:45,555
Not at all. You said just right,
full of sincerity and wealth.

23
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,395
So, did your mom agree or not?

24
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,596
Do I just naturally invite your scorn?

25
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,555
- All of you are hiding it from me.
- That's not good.

26
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,916
The whole world knows,
and only I'm in the dark.

27
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,476
Don't be nervous. Leave it to me.
Sit down for a while.

28
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,395
Am I that repulsive?

29
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:06,235
You listen to me.
Huan hasn't told me either.

30
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:10,115
It was only through my own observations
that I found out.

31
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,036
I was originally going to tell you.

32
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:14,675
But you know your own temper.

33
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:15,916
What temper of mine?

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,476
Like a firecracker,
exploding with a touch.

35
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,756
Firecracker? Am I a firecracker?

36
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:20,916
You see that?

37
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,675
I'm not even as good as
cannon fodder, okay?

38
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:24,675
Cannon fodder is still fodder,
am I fodder?

39
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:26,316
I'm not even as good as fodder.
The fodder can...

40
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,276
What cannon fodder? This is irrelevant.

41
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,316
Huan, do you have something
to say to your mom?

42
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,528
Okay.

43
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:42,996
Yu, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

44
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,476
You're not a firecracker,
definitely not a firecracker.

45
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:08,436
Mom, I know you are angry with me.

46
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,355
Actually, about me and Zhiming.

47
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:18,435
I wanted to wait until
the timing was right to tell you.

48
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,312
But then due to various reasons,

49
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,516
I've been delaying until now.

50
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:31,315
I apologize to you. It was my fault.

51
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,675
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

52
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,836
Don't need to apologize.
This is your own business.

53
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:50,435
How could I possibly not discuss it
with you? You are my mother.

54
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:55,516
Our matters also need to be known
and agreed upon by mom.

55
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,675
Have you really thought it through?

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,024
I have thought it through.

57
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,276
Do you really understand him?

58
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:20,675
Mom, Zhiming has a stern appearance
but a tender heart.

59
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,435
Many people think he is difficult
to get along with.

60
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:30,836
But he has a very tender and kind heart.
He is nice to everyone.

61
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:37,875
He's very responsible,
both at work and in the family.

62
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:43,115
Whenever I encounter a problem
or difficulty,

63
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,435
he is the one who steps forward
to help me,

64
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,875
silently protects me and
gives me warmth.

65
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,675
The most important thing is,

66
00:05:54,235 --> 00:06:00,516
Mom, being with him makes me
feel so happy and blessed every day.

67
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,315
I really, really like him.

68
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:13,675
So this time, can you support me?

69
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:36,568
Okay, okay.

70
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,156
I believe in your judgment.

71
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,036
I believe in your ability to judge.

72
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:01,315
How wonderful, my precious daughter.

73
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:07,036
You have found someone
you can entrust your life to.

74
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,956
I feel reassured now.

75
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:33,156
(Okay, I believe in your judgment.)

76
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,716
(I believe in your ability to judge.)

77
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:41,795
(How wonderful, my precious daughter.)

78
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:46,675
(You have found someone
you can entrust your life to.)

79
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,636
(I feel reassured now.)

80
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:21,235
What kind of look is this?

81
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,956
Your mom has washed all my clothes.

82
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:29,115
So you've come out draped
in this bedsheet?

83
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:33,116
Or what? Being shirtless
would seem indecent, right?

84
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,756
That seems like a good sign.

85
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:37,996
What sign?

86
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,116
Cooking for you, doing your laundry.

87
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,876
That means she sees you as family.

88
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,435
That sounds good.

89
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,236
Why are you being so silly?

90
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:53,555
But it's a pity now. I had fantasies
with Mao before.

91
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,195
If we ever made money,

92
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,475
we'd lie on the beaches of Hawaii
for a day and watch muscle men.

93
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:01,715
Now there's no beach,

94
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:05,876
and the muscle men,
I can't see anything. It's no fun.

95
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,996
You'll be able to
see a muscle man in a moment.

96
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,784
What are you doing?
What do you want to do?

97
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:14,795
What do think?

98
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:18,756
Don't come over. Aren't you annoying?

99
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,795
Huan, Huan.

100
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:25,236
Huan.

101
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:28,795
Are you silly squatting here?
Get up, go over there.

102
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,416
Huan.

103
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,876
Mom, you learned to knock on the door.

104
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:41,795
Sure, I've learned to knock on doors
a long time ago.

105
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:43,916
When you're not at home,
I have plenty of time.

106
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,516
Whether you're at home or not,
I knock first. Knock knock.

107
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:50,236
Isn't this how hotel staff behave?
Civil and courteous.

108
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:51,236
Right, right.

109
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:55,075
Have some tangerines. They are sweet.
Ask that youngster to try some.

110
00:09:56,555 --> 00:10:00,276
Mom, you're mistaken, aren't you?
He's upstairs.

111
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:02,996
Stop pretending, will you?

112
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:07,475
Mom, what are you talking about?

113
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,555
Ming, use the main door in the future.

114
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:16,835
Don't climb that wobbly ladder.

115
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,835
It's very dangerous,
swaying back and forth like that.

116
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,795
What if you fall and end up disabled
or worse?

117
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,595
How would you join the Mai family then?

118
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:27,715
Because of that, I would still have to
take care of you. Do you hear me?

119
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,195
Ming?

120
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,795
My mom asked you to eat tangerines.
Stop posing here.

121
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,795
Your mom has laid her cards
on the table.

122
00:10:55,315 --> 00:11:00,236
I finally have a name too.

123
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:06,595
So, who are you?
A muscle man named Ming?

124
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,208
It sounds rather strange.

125
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:12,916
You won't find it strange in a bit.

126
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,396
What are you up to now?

127
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,396
Ming, it's already half past ten.

128
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,236
After eating the oranges,
go straight back to your room to sleep.

129
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:26,876
Ten more minutes, at most.
Did you hear that? Watch the clock.

130
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,435
Then I'll be going now.

131
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,528
Goodbye then.

132
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:49,756
Ms. Liu, Ms. Liu.

133
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:57,555
No, Ming's mother-in-law. You've come
to discuss the wedding date, right?

134
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:04,276
You, I'm going to tell you
the plain truth today.

135
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:07,435
Your son, Ming, is truly a good boy.

136
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,195
Such a good child has you for a father.

137
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,236
He must have had eight lifetimes
of bad luck.

138
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:17,475
Having you as a relative in-law
also leaves me discontent.

139
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:21,595
But what can I do when my daughter
likes your son?

140
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:27,156
That's right. As long as
our kids are happy, that's good.

141
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:30,236
However, your son
has made a promise to me.

142
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,675
After he gets married,
you two stay the way you are.

143
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,876
You understand that, don't you?
You get it, right?

144
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,835
My son really listens to you.

145
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:45,516
Of course, I'm good to him as well.

146
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,435
To get along with children,
you have to respect each other.

147
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,756
If you respect him,
he'll respect you too, right?

148
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:01,595
Then teach me how to get along
with children.

149
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,916
About this issue...

150
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:08,435
I do have experience with this issue.
I'm qualified to talk about it.

151
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:13,356
It's like this.
If you want the joys of a family,

152
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:16,835
then you, as a parent,
need to act the part, right?

153
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:20,195
Lead by example. Set a good model.

154
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:22,876
If you have any shortcomings,
fix them immediately, right?

155
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,516
Don't just act according to
your own temperament when doing things.

156
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:30,835
Otherwise, isn't it just making trouble
for the kids? Do you understand?

157
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:35,236
I understand.
I totally get what you're saying.

158
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:41,675
Then could you please talk to Ming
and ask if I can stay a few more days?

159
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,916
After all, I'm his biological father.
I have to attend his wedding, right?

160
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,036
It's not good for you
to go to his wedding.

161
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,036
You shouldn't go, really.

162
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:55,075
Just think about it. There will be
many people at the wedding.

163
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,715
People will surely talk about you,

164
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:00,675
saying things like his father has been
in jail, or has a criminal record.

165
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,116
If people start gossiping,
it would be embarrassing for the kids.

166
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,236
Then, how about this?

167
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:14,835
I'll see if I can talk to Ming
about letting you stay a few more days.

168
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,944
Farewell.

169
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,475
Lately, many customers have mentioned

170
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,835
that the Room Division's fancy
towel folding is very interesting.

171
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:27,236
It was your idea, right?

172
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:28,955
I just gave a bit of casual training.

173
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,835
Let's go check out
the newly upgraded smart suites later.

174
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,795
If they work well,
we'll launch them next week.

175
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,624
Mr. Yao.

176
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,475
Good day, Mr. Yao.
Miss Mai, I'll get to work now.

177
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:44,835
What's the matter? You seem so happy,
humming a tune as you come in.

178
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,396
I'm about to have a daughter-in-law.

179
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,435
Wouldn't you say
that's a great cause for celebration?

180
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,315
I have put in a lot of effort
for you and Zhiming.

181
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,640
A lot of effort, indeed.

182
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,396
I just managed to persuade your mom.

183
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:04,396
So, it was your doing, the good deed.

184
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,636
Who else could it be if not me?

185
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:11,075
As a future father-in-law,
I'll be waiting for you to offer me tea.

186
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,475
It seems Mr. Yao isn't planning
to return to Europe.

187
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:17,835
Why go back to Europe?
No, I'm not going.

188
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:21,592
My son and daughter-in-law are here.
The joy of family is here.

189
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:26,156
I plan to settle down here
for a long time.

190
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,516
Chenghuan, no, I mean,
future daughter-in-law.

191
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:34,236
Look, my outfit is a bit old.

192
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:39,236
In the future, it won't be presentable
for the engagement or the wedding.

193
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:42,315
When do you and Zhiming have time
to go shopping with me?

194
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,555
Actually, I have quite a few things
I need to buy.

195
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,955
Alright, in that case,
you go ahead and shop first.

196
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:50,156
If you find things you like, go ahead
and buy it. I'll reimburse you later.

197
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,116
Mr. Yao, I still have some things
to take care of. I'll go get busy.

198
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,036
Qian, come here.

199
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:05,835
You heard it, right? I'm now
your boss's future father-in-law.

200
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,435
Congratulations.

201
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,435
Then you should show some gesture.

202
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,296
I just heard about
your smart room upgrade.

203
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,396
Could you upgrade one for me?

204
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:20,835
Sorry, Mr. Yao,
I need to ask Miss Mai about that.

205
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:24,795
Still need to ask? Your boss
wouldn't agree to upgrade my room?

206
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,916
Okay, that's enough.
Get the room card ready later

207
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,435
and send it up to me. There you have it.

208
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,955
Mr. Yao, this way, please.

209
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:45,112
Mr. Yao, this is our latest
smart suite, and here is the key card.

210
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,116
Okay.

211
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:48,795
If you need anything,
just call me at any time.

212
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:50,315
Okay, you can leave now.

213
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:51,996
Okay, goodbye Mr. Yao.

214
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,016
Goodbye.

215
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:09,356
Why close the curtains
in broad daylight?

216
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,316
Hello, welcome to your stay
at Xing'anli Garden Hotel.

217
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,328
Who are you?

218
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm the intelligent service system, Zhi.

219
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,995
May I help you with anything?

220
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,080
Open the curtains.

221
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,715
Okay, the music has been turned on
for you.

222
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:26,584
What's that?

223
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:13,675
What smart suite is this?

224
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,656
Coming.

225
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:32,836
Mai Chenghuan,
you've arrived just in time.

226
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,435
What smart suite is this?
The toilet won't flush.

227
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:37,275
The curtains are shut tight
in the middle of the day.

228
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,675
Zhi, turn off the music.

229
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:48,235
Okay, master.

230
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,396
Zhi, open the curtains.

231
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,435
Okay, master.

232
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,035
That's all set, Mr. Yao.
Do you have any other problems?

233
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,316
You know
I can't use these smart devices.

234
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:03,876
You let me stay here on purpose to
torment me? Kicking me while I'm down.

235
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:11,556
Mr. Yao, you asked for
the room upgrade yourself.

236
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:14,195
It has nothing to do with me.
You can't blame this on me.

237
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,116
Get out. You'll be the death of me
one of these days.

238
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,035
I finally got out, but this room
is even scarier than a prison.

239
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:24,275
You owe me compensation
for emotional distress.

240
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,755
You are too malicious, if I had known
you would say such things,

241
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,116
I would never have let my son
be with you.

242
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:34,836
When Yao Zhiming was young,
no one helped him.

243
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:39,156
He knocked out his teeth and
swallowed them all by himself,

244
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,435
only to get to where he is today.

245
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:44,156
That is much harder than your troubles
being stuck in this room today.

246
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,955
And now you're making such a fuss
over this little inconvenience?

247
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,035
You're playing the "bad cop"
for Zhiming, trying to educate me?

248
00:19:55,916 --> 00:20:00,475
I know my youthful unreliability
brought the family suffering.

249
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,316
But to say that my love for my son
isn't genuine,

250
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,396
to accuse me of not wanting
the best for him, that's unjust.

251
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:07,596
I've come back wanting to change
for the better and to live well.

252
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,235
Everyone has their own difficulties.

253
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:15,316
You left Yao Zhiming when he was
so young.

254
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,195
You didn't establish a good
father-son relationship.

255
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:23,316
Now you want to come back
and enjoy the joy of family.

256
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,195
No one should agree to that, right?

257
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:33,715
Mr. Yao, if you really want to change
and get closer to him,

258
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:36,596
then show him your sincerity.

259
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,715
For instance, start integration
into new life with a new smartphone.

260
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,275
I don't want a smartphone.

261
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,955
I still don't understand
the smart suit system.

262
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:54,636
You just said you wanted what's best
for him and you wanted to change.

263
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,515
Can't you even manage
to change your phone?

264
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,235
With this phone,
you can register for WeChat.

265
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:04,275
Not only can you contact him,
but you can also view his Moments.

266
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:07,995
Wouldn't this bring you and your son
closer instantly?

267
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:14,435
But this is too difficult.
I really don't know how to use it.

268
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,755
Didn't you ask us to get you
a new outfit before?

269
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,195
Then this is the first step.

270
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:24,316
It's okay if you don't know.
I'll teach you. Take it slow.

271
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,275
I've been in jail for fifteen years.
I really don't know anything.

272
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:34,435
What do I need to do for Zhiming
to believe I'm truly changing?

273
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:42,275
I used to not learn anything.
I just knew how to enjoy life.

274
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:47,876
Speaking of enjoying,

275
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:52,396
I have another method.

276
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,742
(Wine and Cigar Tasting Event)

277
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:57,076
To judge the quality of a cigar,

278
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:02,156
besides tasting its flavor,
you also need to observe its burning.

279
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:07,636
The ash, the ash.

280
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,636
Mr. Yao, how is your practice going?

281
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:11,636
Still not good.

282
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,032
It's okay, this is just a rehearsal.
You don't need to be nervous.

283
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:18,435
I don't want to be nervous. But the less
I want to, the more nervous I get.

284
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,435
How about this? I've already memorized
the script you wrote.

285
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:25,076
If you get nervous at that time,
how about I coordinate with you?

286
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:26,136
That could work?

287
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,876
That will work.
Mr. Yao, do you see that tree?

288
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:36,275
Yao Zhiming told me that he planted it
himself when he was a child.

289
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,715
It also has his height carved on it.

290
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:42,556
Just imagine your son watching you
from there.

291
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:44,275
Make an effort for your own son.

292
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:47,320
Okay.

293
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,116
Then let's go through it again.

294
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,035
Okay.

295
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:55,156
I'll start you off.
The burning ash is white as snow.

296
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,596
The tobacco roll is like a cigar.

297
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:58,616
Exactly.

298
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:02,275
A good cigar is judged
by observing it burn to the end.

299
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,636
Only then can you determine its quality.

300
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:09,916
And it must be paired with red wine,
that's what makes a perfect life.

301
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,076
You're amazing. Isn't that well said?

302
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:13,636
Then you keep practicing.

303
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,675
Alright, alright.

304
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:20,515
The burning ash is white as snow.
The tobacco roll is like a cigar.

305
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:33,035
Let's see how Yao Renfu's
re-employment project is going.

306
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,475
What else does he know besides eating,
drinking, and having fun?

307
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:41,316
I wanted to host a tasting salon
for guests at the hotel.

308
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:43,076
Doesn't he like to have fun?

309
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,275
Then let's channel his hedonism
into something useful.

310
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:51,116
I know you mean well,
but you have to be careful.

311
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:54,435
Don't let his cunning and shrewdness
blind you.

312
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:57,876
Rest assured. I have no intention
of persuading you to forgive him.

313
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,156
I'm just offering a possibility.

314
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:03,035
I settled his daily wages for him.

315
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:06,515
As for whether he can pass
the assessment, it's up to you.

316
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:10,836
It must have been hard for you.

317
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:13,195
What's hard about that?

318
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,636
Ms. Liu and I have had our
love-hate relationship for years.

319
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,876
I have more experience
in dealing with parents.

320
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:27,556
I'm leaving.

321
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:28,568
Zhiming.

322
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,916
Miss Mai, I did pretty well, didn't I?

323
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,995
I must say, your study in enjoying life
is like this.

324
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:41,720
Zhiming, I'd like to treat you
to a meal.

325
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:45,796
You don't have to pay this time.
I have money. I have a salary.

326
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,995
Then just have a meal together.
It won't cost an arm and a leg.

327
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,195
Mr. Yao, he'll go.

328
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:58,995
Shanghai-style spicy fried shrimp,
local eel shreds,

329
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:02,675
plum fish with scallion oil,
braised pork,

330
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:06,876
- squirrel-shaped mandarin fish...
- Okay, that's enough for now.

331
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:08,955
Okay, please wait a moment.

332
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:14,235
You ordered so much. Can we finish it?

333
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,836
It's rare to have a chance
to eat together.

334
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,235
I just want you to eat more,
to have a good meal.

335
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,556
Doesn't matter if it's good or not.

336
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:28,916
After you got in jail, I even ate
the food that fell on the ground.

337
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:36,876
Dad has a salary now. I just wanted you
to have a good meal.

338
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:46,156
That's right.
You've grown up so quickly.

339
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:52,636
When you were a baby,
you were just this little.

340
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,195
When I held you in my arms,

341
00:25:56,475 --> 00:26:02,035
I thought to myself,
"This child looks as ugly as a rat."

342
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:06,435
And you were particularly prone
to crying, from dawn till dusk.

343
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:09,995
In those years, I was a bit afraid of
you. I didn't want to go home.

344
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,435
Your mother was especially resentful.

345
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:19,116
I felt that it was because of you
that our lives changed.

346
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,116
So I sought various ways to vent.

347
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,636
Only later did it turn out that way.

348
00:26:26,556 --> 00:26:31,916
Yao Renfu, I'm here to eat with you
out of regard for Mai Chenghuan.

349
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:35,356
So there's no need for you
to say all this to me.

350
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:41,235
Yes, yes, thanks to Chenghuan,

351
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:46,396
I understand
that if I want to start over,

352
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:49,836
how could it be achieved all at once,
right? I should take my slow.

353
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:55,796
Son, I brought some fine liquor.
Let's have a drink.

354
00:26:58,195 --> 00:26:59,224
Wait a second.

355
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:09,816
Where did you buy this liquor?

356
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:12,116
I got it from a friend.

357
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:18,396
I socialize a lot.
What I give away is always this liquor.

358
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:19,796
It looks fake at a glance.

359
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:34,076
I've been deceived again.
I'm not confused at this senile age.

360
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:40,316
I've always been confused, which led me
to squander all the family's wealth.

361
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,116
Otherwise, your mom wouldn't...

362
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,235
It's all my own doing.

363
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:57,235
So, I've come back sincerely
to say I'm sorry to you.

364
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,035
What if you could forgive me?

365
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,536
Waiter!

366
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,316
Hello, what do you need?

367
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:19,435
Bring the liquor I've stored.

368
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:20,472
Okay.

369
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:46,755
Son, don't worry.
Once I've made some money,

370
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:50,675
I'll prepare substantial
betrothal gifts for you.

371
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:51,876
What are you doing?

372
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:56,556
Taking a photo.
Doesn't this scene look familiar?

373
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:58,916
Like father, like son. Look here.

374
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:02,776
Yao Zhiming.

375
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,016
Come over here.

376
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,596
Coming. Let's go.

377
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:31,556
Let's see if I can catch you.
Where do you think you're going?

378
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:34,475
- I'll catch you.
- Don't.

379
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:35,596
I'll catch you.

380
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,916
I've asked Mr. Cui
to take good care of your dad.

381
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,356
After drinking too much,
he was joyfully clamoring.

382
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,156
It seems you both enjoyed your meal.

383
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:24,280
Not too bad.

384
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:31,556
I suddenly remembered, on this lawn...

385
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,596
When I was young,
my dad also played with me here.

386
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:40,755
So, it seems you and your dad
have many happy memories.

387
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:45,955
After this meal, have you changed
your view of him?

388
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:56,596
For many things, right or wrong,
good or bad,

389
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:01,816
what's happened has happened and
can't be changed.

390
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,156
And it's not possible to cancel
each other out.

391
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:09,195
So, I can never bring myself
to verbally forgive him.

392
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:14,556
Not forgiving is okay too.
Just turn the page.

393
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,400
Turn the page?

394
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:21,876
Yes, we are parents and children
to each other for a lifetime.

395
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,596
None of us has the others' consent.

396
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,916
But blood relations, well,
you can't just shake them off.

397
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,596
Family happiness is of course the best.

398
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,728
If not, at least save face
for each other.

399
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,396
Being courteous to each other is always
better than mutual torment, right?

400
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,316
Why do I feel like you're speaking
from experience?

401
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:46,755
Of course, who do you think I am?
That's how I've lived.

402
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:49,836
But what's most important is

403
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,496
I don't want these things
to keep gnawing at your heart.

404
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,596
I hope you can be happier and
look forward.

405
00:32:00,675 --> 00:32:03,704
Okay, I'll listen to you.
As long as he doesn't cause trouble,

406
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:07,836
I won't bother him and
just get by courteously.

407
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:10,116
That's right.

408
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,048
I want a hug.

409
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:57,796
I've finished the promotional material.
I'll send it to you for review later.

410
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,755
About the exclusive interview content
for each guest,

411
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:03,396
I've already confirmed with the KOLs.

412
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:06,356
They will definitely mention
Xing'anli positively.

413
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:07,515
Rest assured.

414
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:08,755
(Shanghai Tourism Festival delegation reception plan)
Promote it well.

415
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:13,995
Alright. Chenghuan, goodbye.

416
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,976
(Shanghai Tourism Festival
delegation reception plan)

417
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,264
Have some tea.

418
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:20,155
Mr. Yao, actually, there's a favor
I need to ask of you.

419
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:24,155
Xing'anli will host a group of guests
for the Tourism Festival, in a few days.

420
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:27,035
There is a celebrity in that group
of guests.

421
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,756
My niece is particularly fond of him.

422
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:32,515
So, I was hoping to get a work card
from you for the event.

423
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:36,635
This would allow the girl
to get up close to her idol.

424
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:44,836
Mr. Zou, if she just wants
to meet the idol, why need a work card?

425
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:51,955
It's not like Ms. Zhang is up to
something, right?

426
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,916
What does this have to do with
Ms. Zhang?

427
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,716
As I told you, it's for my niece.

428
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,595
She just wants to meet her idol.

429
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:08,995
Everyone, please have a check.
The delegation will arrive in days.

430
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:10,916
All the linens and supplies in the rooms

431
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:14,515
should display our hotel's logo
prominently. Be meticulous.

432
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,635
This reception is extremely important.

433
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:20,515
Also, issue reception work cards
to the staff responsible only.

434
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,555
These colleagues have received training.

435
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,876
And in case of emergencies
during the reception,

436
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:27,115
you can handle it across departments.
Does everyone understand?

437
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:28,836
- Understood.
- Good, let's do this.

438
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,224
Thank you, everyone.

439
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:32,276
Mr. Yao.

440
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:34,635
Qian, come on. I'm treating you
to afternoon tea.

441
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,155
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

442
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:40,595
Don't be so formal.
You've taken such good care of me.

443
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:42,155
Here you go, young lady, take this.

444
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,192
Thank you.

445
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:44,995
I bought you some probiotic drinks.

446
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,635
I hear that young ladies now
love drinking these.

447
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:50,916
Come on, drink up. Don't be shy.

448
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,796
Mr. Yao, is there anything
I can help you with?

449
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:56,115
Are you satisfied with the suite
we switched you to this time?

450
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:58,356
Satisfied. I'm more than satisfied.

451
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:01,515
No wonder Miss Mai likes you so much.

452
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:04,716
But I was thinking,
since it's my daughter-in-law's place,

453
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:06,232
perhaps I should experience each room.

454
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:09,595
So, could you switch me
to another room to stay in?

455
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:13,075
I'm very sorry, Mr. Yao.

456
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:16,035
These days, our hotel
has a very important reception.

457
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:17,995
Let's wait for a couple of days
until this period is over.

458
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:20,276
I'll prioritize your arrangement.
Is that okay with you?

459
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:23,716
No problem, in a couple of days.
I'm not leaving anyway, right?

460
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:26,916
Come, come, children,
there are some pastries here.

461
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,836
- Come on, eat some pastries.
- Okay.

462
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:29,876
Then I'm leaving.

463
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:31,995
- Alright, thank you, Mr. Yao.
- Come on, eat!

464
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,316
Okay, then we won't be polite.

465
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,316
Don't be polite. Please don't!

466
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:35,515
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

467
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,756
(I've got the work card.
How should I give it to you?)

468
00:36:41,555 --> 00:36:42,968
Mr. Yao.

469
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,155
Chenghuan.

470
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:46,236
Is the room comfortable?

471
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,396
Comfortable, very comfortable.

472
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:49,475
That's good.

473
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:50,595
Okay, then I'm off.

474
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:56,555
Mr. Yao. This way is our dormitory.
Your room is up front.

475
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,595
This place is too big. I've gotten lost.

476
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:04,876
It's okay.
I'll take you back then, this way.

477
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:10,515
By the way, after you drank too much
yesterday, Zhiming took you back.

478
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:12,955
I took a few pictures of you.
I'll send them to you now.

479
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:17,316
You know how to use WeChat
now, don't you?

480
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:19,955
Just click "Save Original Picture"
to receive it.

481
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:21,240
(Mai Chenghuan)

482
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:23,672
Did you see it?

483
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:27,555
This was really embarrassing.

484
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:30,115
How could it? Let me tell you a secret.

485
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,316
Before, when Yao Zhiming was drunk,
I pushed him back just like this.

486
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:34,356
He's imitating me.

487
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,316
Chenghuan, you've been quite busy
lately, haven't you?

488
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,236
Mainly because we have a reception
the day after tomorrow.

489
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:44,035
This relates to if we can make the cut
of the top ten featured hotels.

490
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,716
After this busy period,

491
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:50,196
I'll invite you over to our house
for a meal.

492
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:57,916
You're inviting me to your house
for a meal?

493
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:04,475
Yes, isn't that okay? Although Zhiming
and I aren't married yet,

494
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:06,876
I've long since regarded him as family.

495
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:10,396
You are his father.
Naturally, you are also family.

496
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:14,236
What about your mom?

497
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:15,916
My mom thinks the same way.

498
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:20,316
She specifically told me that when we're
not busy, let's go home together.

499
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:22,396
As a family, let's have a lively time.

500
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:28,635
As a family, let's have a lively time.

501
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,276
Mr. Yao, the second room up ahead
is yours.

502
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,555
Then I won't send you there.

503
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:39,075
I know the way now, thank you.
Chenghuan, thank you.

504
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,635
Don't mention it.
Call me if you need anything.

505
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:42,115
Good, good.

506
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,768
As a family.

507
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:26,595
I've confirmed the publicity plan
and the procedures, no problems.

508
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:31,396
The rooms have also been arranged
according to official standards, check.

509
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,236
I've checked the delegation's itinerary,
and everything is in order.

510
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:38,916
It's really great to have you all here.

511
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:41,356
Mr. Cui, tomorrow, please help out

512
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:43,736
to be responsible for coordinating
and supporting all departments.

513
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:45,716
After all, there will be many guests.

514
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,608
Please don't affect the normal operation
of the hotel.

515
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:48,635
Okay.

516
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,555
That's all for the rest.

517
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,995
Let's go over tomorrow's work again.

518
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:55,635
Then get off work. Go home.

519
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:56,876
Okay, goodbye.

520
00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:57,944
Then we're off.

521
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,475
Mr. Yao, what's the matter?

522
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:14,555
Miss Mai, are you coming home for dinner
tonight? I'm buying groceries right now.

523
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:17,196
Really? Yao Zhiming.

524
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:21,155
You, who hardly can tell grains apart,
are at the food market?

525
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,236
Today is different.
Today, I have guidance from masters.

526
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:26,555
Your parents are here, too.

527
00:40:28,196 --> 00:40:29,995
Okay, then I'll come home early today.

528
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:33,555
Learn well from my mom, goodbye.

529
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:34,648
Okay.

530
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:40,955
Yao.

531
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:45,916
Don't underestimate grocery shopping.
There's a lot to learn from it.

532
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,995
You should learn
from Huan's mom in the future.

533
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,836
Ming, let me tell you.
When buying vegetables...

534
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:56,555
See, you don't need these flowers.
Just pick them all off.

535
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:59,955
For vegetables like these,
you have to pick all these off.

536
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:02,836
These can't be eaten and
this makes them much lighter, right?

537
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:16,595
Ming, how about inviting
your father over for a meal someday?

538
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:19,352
Well...

539
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:22,995
Don't make trouble.

540
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:28,515
It's okay. After all, you are
father and son, and he is quite pitiful.

541
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:32,356
Okay, then I'll give him a call later.

542
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:36,196
Okay, maybe tomorrow then?

543
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,316
Huan said there's a big event tomorrow.

544
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:41,155
After it's done tomorrow,
she'll come home and rest.

545
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,796
Okay.

546
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:43,800
Alright.

547
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,196
- Are you okay, Ms. Liu?
- Honey.

548
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:53,995
It's nothing. I might have gotten caught
in the rain the other day while dancing.

549
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,155
Getting old. A bit of wind and rain
can make one feel uncomfortable.

550
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:02,595
Ms. Liu, Mr. Mai, I made an appointment
for a high-end health check-up for you.

551
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:04,344
Go get checked out.

552
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,296
High-end health check-up?

553
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:07,356
We?

554
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,115
How much will that cost?

555
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:14,796
Ming, don't spend as much money as
you have. You need to save it up.

556
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:16,035
It has all been spent.

557
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:17,995
Spent?

558
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:21,475
Yu, Yao also means well
with his filial piety.

559
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:24,155
Since the money has already been spent,
let's not let it go to waste.

560
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:27,876
Yes, only if you're both in good health,
can Chenghuan and I feel at ease,

561
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,155
and then can we strive properly.

562
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:31,576
Okay.

563
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:35,356
Well, we want the eggplant.

564
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:37,435
No, grab a plastic bag.

565
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,676
I'll do it. Please go ahead.

566
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,995
Ms. Liu, what are you making today?

567
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:53,368
Today's dish is called
carp and tofu soup.

568
00:42:55,036 --> 00:42:57,955
Do you know what the greatest benefit
of this dish is?
