00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,402
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:36,508
Actually, I'm not upset because of Mom.

4
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,987
It's because of Mao?

5
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:47,028
Song Huaimin is sowing discord
between Mao and the child.

6
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:49,880
They will end up with a rift like this.

7
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,108
Mao would be disfavored
if they brought it to court.

8
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:56,187
She hates to hold me back,

9
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:58,108
so she wants me to think twice

10
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,907
about this relationship.

11
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,187
What do you think?

12
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:10,828
I was thinking, Huan...

13
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:15,267
Is Xing'anli available anytime soon?

14
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:19,348
Are you going to propose to Mao?

15
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,228
No, I'll contact Dingding's kindergarten

16
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,908
to organize a parent-child event

17
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:27,908
so that Mao can play with Dingding

18
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,348
to ease the tension.

19
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:32,547
We need a revenue.

20
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,867
Sure, Xing'anli is perfect for that.

21
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,747
Sunshine, big lawn.

22
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,147
The kids will love it.

23
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,628
Will it interfere with your business?

24
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,228
Don't worry about that.

25
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:47,587
- I've got your back.
- Thank you, Huan.

26
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:50,747
Eat the cake.

27
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,348
Otherwise, your birthday will be over.

28
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,547
- Where's Zao?
- Why are you still up?

29
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:19,908
I see.

30
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,027
He's still angry with me.

31
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,908
No, he's not angry with you.

32
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,068
Zao told me

33
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:34,668
he had some things to deal with

34
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,228
and wouldn't return for now.

35
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,027
What's the matter? Is it serious?

36
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,908
It's nothing serious.

37
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,547
Mom, actually,

38
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,828
I've been wanting
to talk to you about Zao.

39
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:56,547
We lived in our old house
for over twenty years,

40
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,256
and Zao never had his own bedroom.

41
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,348
He lived in the living room.

42
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:03,707
Whenever we had guests,

43
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:07,096
you would
shove his stuff here and there.

44
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:08,824
And you often forgot to

45
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,228
put his things back afterward.

46
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:19,147
Earlier, Zao lost his job
because of my broken relationship.

47
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:23,227
He didn't want to burden us,

48
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:26,868
and started delivering food
without telling us.

49
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:31,707
(Delivering food?
Riding an electric bike)

50
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:33,667
(through the alleys?)

51
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,707
(That was so dangerous.)

52
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,107
(How come he never mentioned it to me?)

53
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,027
Mom, relax.

54
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,107
He's past that period.

55
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:45,508
He just didn't

56
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,107
want us to worry about him.

57
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,868
So he didn't tell us.

58
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,428
I found out about it later.

59
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,868
He grew up away from us

60
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,107
and missed out on a lot of love.

61
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,748
So he cared about you
very much after he returned.

62
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,107
Do you know what he said?

63
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:13,548
He said you want him
to achieve something when he's young.

64
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,267
He didn't want to let you down.

65
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:21,147
He wanted to make you proud of him.

66
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:34,467
I thought he would be fine because

67
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,748
he's a boy.

68
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,107
He can sustain himself.

69
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,068
He's well-educated

70
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:45,227
and has a good character.

71
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,667
He'll find a good job

72
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,068
and marry a good girl.

73
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,948
I'm sure he can lead a good life.

74
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,467
But I didn't know he was so sensitive.

75
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:05,748
He had so much to say but never told me.

76
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:12,428
He never told me
about the hardships or grievances.

77
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:17,227
He clearly kept me at a distance.

78
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,707
Mom, Zao is very considerate.

79
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,227
He will understand you.

80
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,267
It's not too late to be aware of it now.

81
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,267
We can start anew, right?

82
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,707
I've talked to Zao today.

83
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,308
He promised he'd come home.

84
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:44,227
When he comes home,

85
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:48,707
tell him what you think in person, okay?

86
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,868
Thank you, Huan.

87
00:06:55,628 --> 00:07:01,508
Don't cry.

88
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:14,700
(Child Custody Lawsuit)

89
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,248
(Chengzao: Where are you?
Just take your time. No rush.)

90
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,283
(How are you?)

91
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,068
Mao, I've made up my mind.

92
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,308
I still want to be with you.

93
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,467
I know you are worried about Dingding.

94
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:08,267
I'm sure we can get the custody back.

95
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,828
I reviewed the case files
in the past five years

96
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,027
and found quite a few cases
similar to yours.

97
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,428
I also sorted out the evidence.

98
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,308
These can prove

99
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,467
that you are more suited
to raise the child.

100
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:24,707
These can prove that

101
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,428
he is not suited to raise a child.

102
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,707
Rest assured, I will do my utmost

103
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:34,268
to help you win this lawsuit.

104
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,948
We can certainly bring Dingding back.

105
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,548
This is my answer.

106
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:45,908
Right, this is my payroll card.

107
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,467
I've just started working

108
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,268
and might not be able to offer much.

109
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,828
But I swear I will work hard

110
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,507
to provide a better life
for you and Dingding.

111
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,828
You wanted me to think twice.

112
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,668
I've thought about it carefully.

113
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,467
No matter what,

114
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,107
I choose to be with you.

115
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,627
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

116
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,507
I thought you had chosen to give up.

117
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,227
I will never give up on you.

118
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,107
Thank you.

119
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:51,668
Thank you for everything you've done.
Thank you, Zao.

120
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,627
- Dig in.
- Here's your liquor set.

121
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,428
Please enjoy.
Call me if you need anything.

122
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:19,028
- Alright, thank you.
- Come on.

123
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,107
Miss Mai looks very happy today.

124
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:31,148
- Of course, I'm dining with Mr. Yao.
- Stop it.

125
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:37,627
Zao and Mao have reconciled.

126
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,107
This is something to be happy about.

127
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:44,068
Come on, let's have a drink today.

128
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:48,028
Forget it. You know I can barely drink.

129
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,107
There's no handcart
for you to take me home.

130
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,068
You hold grudges, huh?

131
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,707
Don't worry. I won't sneak a photo
of you being drunk today.

132
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:02,828
Right, I'm planning

133
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,268
to hold a parent-child event
in Xing'anli.

134
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:07,867
Are you blazing a new trail?

135
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:11,068
No, Mao's ex-husband has been

136
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,668
trash-talking Mao in front of the child.

137
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,867
So Zao wants to organize
a parent-child activity

138
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,467
to help Mao get closer to Dingding.

139
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,428
Of course, I'll lend a hand.

140
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:25,107
But organizing a parent-child event

141
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,507
is not any easier
than holding a wedding.

142
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,828
Haven't you been overwhelmed

143
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,268
by the evaluations?

144
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,428
Are you sure you want to do this?

145
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,268
I'm Mao's bestie and Zao's sister.

146
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:38,068
I have to do this

147
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:41,908
- even if I pass out from exhaustion.
- True.

148
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:46,828
Are you free next weekend?

149
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:48,627
Would you like to take part in it?

150
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:52,828
Have you ever seen a couple on a date
at a parent-child event?

151
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,428
It's the 14th next weekend.

152
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,668
What about it?

153
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,828
It's the Valentine's Day.

154
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:02,948
But it's not February.

155
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,227
You've been such a workaholic.

156
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,428
Don't you know?

157
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,347
For lovers,

158
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,347
it's Valentine's Day
every month on the 14th.

159
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,148
You're really something.

160
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:18,068
- Stop it. So will you come?
- Sure.

161
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,347
- Here.
- Let's get you drunk.

162
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,227
- Miss Zhao.
- Sorry to have

163
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,268
kept you waiting.

164
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,028
- It's alright.
- Ms. Mao.

165
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,068
Dingding's dad informed us

166
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,467
that you were emotionally unstable
due to the divorce

167
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,428
and told us
to limit your access to the child.

168
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:48,107
Miss Zhao, you have a child too, right?

169
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:51,908
We are both first-time mothers.

170
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,507
I'm sorry I've done
something inappropriate.

171
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,668
I've been trying to improve.

172
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,548
I want to be a good mom.

173
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:05,627
Actually,

174
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:08,268
I came to tell you something.

175
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,548
I'd like to invite all the kids,

176
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,828
(Invitation)
their parents, and the teachers

177
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,668
to a parent-child event
at Xing'anli Hotel.

178
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,268
You don't have to
worry about the expenses.

179
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:20,867
I'll take care of that.

180
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:23,747
I hope it can help Dingding get along

181
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,668
with the other kids.

182
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,908
Ms. Mao, I totally understand.

183
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:34,587
But after all,
the father is the guardian.

184
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:35,627
Hello, Miss Zhao.

185
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,747
I'm Ms. Mao Yongxin's lawyer.

186
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:41,948
It's my client's legitimate right
to visit her child.

187
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,268
Song Huaimin shall not
unilaterally terminate such right.

188
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,068
The court rarely rules

189
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:49,668
to terminate such rights,
considering that it might

190
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,668
harm the children's

191
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,867
physical and mental health.

192
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,908
If Mr. Song Huaimin has any objections,

193
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,467
I'll come forward to negotiate.

194
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:00,467
The kindergarten won't bear
any responsibility. Please rest assured.

195
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,227
And please trust us.

196
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,948
We want all the kids
to have a delightful experience.

197
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:11,028
Let me discuss this with our principal.

198
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,467
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

199
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,948
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

200
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,148
That curly-haired lady.

201
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:27,828
Over here.

202
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,107
You've ordered coffee for me?

203
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,627
How did it go at the kindergarten?

204
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,867
Zao helped me a lot.

205
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:41,227
He persuaded them to accept it.

206
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:42,908
I think it's settled.

207
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,867
There will be many children

208
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,428
and their parents.

209
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,668
Will you be annoyed?

210
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:50,268
No way. I've thought it all through.

211
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,107
We will hold the event on the lawn.

212
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,428
The theme will be
"Little Heroes, Big Adventure"

213
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,828
with many cartoon characters.

214
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,068
- Hello, Miss Mai.
- Hello, Miss Mai.

215
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,227
I told you. Her relatives just left.

216
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,668
And her friend came for perks.

217
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,867
We hustle and bustle for nothing.

218
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,268
Your employees sound so mean.

219
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:14,268
They've been against me
ever since I came. Give them some time.

220
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:22,188
Is it causing you a lot of trouble

221
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,107
to host this event here?

222
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:25,668
What are you talking about?

223
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,268
Not at all.

224
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:30,467
Granny used to run Xing'anli
under the concept of "home".

225
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,627
She hoped that all the guests

226
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,268
would consider Xing'anli as their home

227
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,028
and heal all the emotional wounds here.

228
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:41,068
I want to carry on her legacy.

229
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,828
That's why I took over Xing'anli.

230
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,948
Sorry about the trouble. Thanks.

231
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,507
Stop saying that or I'll be mad.

232
00:15:57,148 --> 00:16:04,068
Sir, please take a look at the contract
for the room-service system upgrade

233
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:08,788
and the background information
of the suppliers.

234
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,148
- Geez.
- You caught a cold?

235
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,387
You wanted the contract ready asap,

236
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:19,948
so I had to work on it overnight.

237
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:24,028
- Here.
- Thank you.

238
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:26,507
Tell them to start as soon as possible.

239
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:32,068
Didn't you want to start
after the National Day?

240
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,028
If we start now,

241
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,948
it will hinder our performance
in the peak season.

242
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:41,948
You can't do this.
You failed to obtain Xing'anli.

243
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,428
Now you won't even meet the KPI.
What are you thinking?

244
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:50,707

- Your tip.

Why do you keep having junk food?

262
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,947
You do nothing serious all day long.

263
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,064
(Invitation)
This is serious.

264
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,187
Come and see if you're interested.

265
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,804
(Invitation, Xing'anli Garden Hotel)

266
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:15,672
You went to Xing'anli?

267
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:19,068
You just found out? I've been
working there for half a month.

268
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,107
Mai Chenghuan is quite something.
She won over Yao Zhiming

269
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,068
and gained control
over you just like that.

270
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:34,708
I went there to work, okay?

271
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,907
I'm managing
Xing'anli's social media account.

272
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:38,308
We're getting more followers.

273
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,312
Chenghuan praised me for my creativity,

274
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:43,308
which diverted traffic
to our wedding planning service.

275
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,107
I'm still available.

276
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,508
If you ask nicely,

277
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:52,587
I can consider helping you optimize
Botticelli's social media.

278
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:55,228
Have you lost your mind?

279
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,107
You are so happy about
doing the groundwork?

280
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:02,028
How come you have no vision
and no ambition at all?

281
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,028
How did I give birth
to such a foolish daughter?

282
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,032
Fine.

283
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:11,192
Find a daughter like you.

284
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:14,907
Find someone with ambition and vision

285
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,867
who doesn't like
river snail rice noodles.

286
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:21,867
You despise me, huh? I despise you too.

287
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,748
Look at the other mothers.

288
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:26,548
Look how sweet
Chenghuan's mother is to her.

289
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,867
When have you ever been sweet to me?

290
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,308
Why can't you care about me for once?

291
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:35,068
Y-You compare me
to Mai Chenghuan's mother?

292
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,376
This is a humiliation.

293
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:41,028
What's wrong?
You hate everyone, don't you?

294
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,508
Is that why you're always
cold-blooded and heartless?

295
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,160
Zhang Ziyu, let me tell you

296
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:52,268
how I've survived
in this society as a single mother.

297
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:55,708
I sent you to the best schools
and funded your studies abroad.

298
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,508
Why did I work so hard?
Didn't I do it for you?

299
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,387
And now you're insulting me.
Do you want to break my heart?

300
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,508
You don't know how fortunate you are.

301
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:09,548
Zhang Peisheng.

302
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:17,587
You wanted the house,
the car, and the money for yourself.

303
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:20,107
Why do you claim that it's for me?

304
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,576
This isn't trendy anymore.

305
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:26,347
Stop moral blackmailing me.

306
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:28,228
It takes two to form a relationship.

307
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,228
If you want a sweet daughter,

308
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:36,988
learn to be a good mother first.

309
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,107
We're doing parenting activities
on top of all those weddings.

310
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,667
We even lost our days off.

311
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,947
She's working us to the bone.

312
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:55,387
- Yeah.
- Exactly, this is unbearable.

313
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:59,448
Right? Miss Mai
is too young and too naive.

314
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:04,748
She lacks experience. Our hotel
will be doomed sooner or later.

315
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,784
I agree.

316
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,788
Guys, let's pick up the pace here.

317
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,228
Take a break once you're done.

318
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:12,248
Okay.

319
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:15,508
Come on, pick up the pace.

320
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,347
Hello, when is the steel frame
for the backdrop arriving?

321
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,268
You can't make it? Are you kidding me?

322
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:31,468
Have a look there.

323
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,748
Pouring rain. Didn't you
check the weather forecast?

324
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:37,708
What do you want me to do now?
Pull some banners?

325
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,228
In the afternoon?
The event will be over.

326
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:56,508
Mr. Zhang, do you have
steel frames available?

327
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,028
In about an hour or so.

328
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:03,988
Alright, I'll think of
something else. Okay.

329
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,427
Mr. Fang, nice to meet you.

330
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,988
I'm Liao Gang, head of
the concierge department.

331
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,788
Hello.

332
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:16,427
I heard there was a problem
with the steel frame.

333
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,508
They can't make it on time.

334
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,387
I know someone.
And I can get you a discount.

335
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:24,427
Really?

336
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:25,848
Of course.

337
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:26,947
Is it reliable?

338
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,988
Of course. Didn't we
organize events before you came?

339
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:32,187
Right.

340
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,947
Rest assured, I've got this.

341
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,308
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

342
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,788
I'm sharing Miss Mai's burden.

343
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,548
- Liao Gang, huh?
- Yeah.

344
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:43,832
Let me buy you dinner one day.

345
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,387
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

346
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,768
What are you doing?

347
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:00,907
Take a guess.

348
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:06,947
Man, things are getting urgent
and you're in the mood for romance?

349
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:10,587
What happened?
What did Zhang Peisheng do again?

350
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,147
She's taking a tough stance.

351
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:14,587
She said that the system upgrade

352
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,947
hindered the performance
of the entire peak season.

353
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:18,947
So she shifted our access

354
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:21,587
to the administrative system
to her name.

355
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:23,667
Isn't this a blatant power grab?

356
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,347
I knew she would do this.

357
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,988
Aren't we having an online meeting soon?

358
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:31,947
Let's see what surprise
Ms. Zhang has prepared for us.

359
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,347
I'll take a photo for you.
Three, two, one.

360
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,587
Three, two, one. Another one.

361
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:37,592
Okay.

362
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,347
Stick it at a nice spot. Adorable.

363
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:49,240
Come on, one more picture.
Three, two, one. Okay.

364
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:52,708
Hello, kiddo. Welcome.

365
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:57,592
Hello, Miss Mai.

366
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:01,107
Ziyu, how's it going? Everything fine?

367
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:03,192
Yeah.

368
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:07,107
You've been here for half a month.
Have you adapted to the work?

369
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,228
Yeah, I'm highly adaptable.

370
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:15,907
You look bothered.

371
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,667
I wanted to prove myself to my mom.

372
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:25,308
But she meant it
when she said she wouldn't show up.

373
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:28,548
Ms. Zhang must be busy.

374
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:31,704
Besides, growing up
is a personal journey.

375
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,692
You don't need to prove anything.

376
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:35,867
Take good photos.

377
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,548
I'll reward you with bonuses.

378
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:39,416
Really?

379
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,228
Of course.

380
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,387
I'll keep it in mind, Huan.

381
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:44,427
Let's go. It's about to start.

382
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:52,508
Ms. Zhang, I'm here
to reclaim my access to the system.

383
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:58,680
Mr. Yao, you have harmed
the company's interests.

384
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,368
I have the right to freeze your access.

385
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,228
Don't forget.
I'm still the acting president.

386
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,387
It happens that
I have an online meeting with Amber.

387
00:26:09,387 --> 00:26:10,907
Shall we talk together?

388
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:13,688
Sure.

389
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:16,667
Hi, Amber.

390
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:19,228
Hey, Eric. Good to see you.

391
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:23,147
Marisa says
you are in a relationship with

392
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:27,627
Miss Mai from Xing'anli,
our acquisition target,

393
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,160
and you're giving up
advantages in business.

394
00:26:31,896 --> 00:26:34,187
What do you think about that?

395
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,907
Ms. Zhang, it's all about
performance at work.

396
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:41,187
It's not very nice
to gossip about others.

397
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:46,788
Mr. Yao, maybe you should
explain it personally.

398
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:51,187
Right, Eric, I would also like to
hear what you have to say.

399
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:54,907
Amber, there is an old Chinese saying.

400
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,587
"A thousand-mile dike
collapses in an ant's burrow."

401
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:00,312
I acknowledge
Mr. Yao's past achievements.

402
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:03,187
But if everyone were to follow suit

403
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,187
and put the company's interests
after personal feelings,

404
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,147
that would be
a vital threat to the company.

405
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:15,667
Amber, I didn't get a chance to
inform you that I secured the quota

406
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,187
for hosting the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization summit

407
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,568
as one of the qualified hotels
this autumn.

408
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:25,147
We're upgrading room services
to meet the hosting standards.

409
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:28,068
As a foreign-funded hotel group,

410
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:30,107
I find it necessary for Yueda
to undertake

411
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,828
some large-scale summit projects

412
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:35,548
to enhance our local competitiveness.

413
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:38,028
We lost a month's performance,

414
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:41,187
but I've secured a great performance
for the next three years.

415
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:42,456
I've found

416
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:47,548
a more potent path to profit
than acquiring Xing'anli.

417
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:50,776
When did this happen?
How come I didn't know about it?

418
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:55,187
Ms. Zhang, don't always focus on
the immediate issues at hand.

419
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,664
It may cause great losses.

420
00:27:57,268 --> 00:28:00,947
May I have my access back now?

421
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:05,107
Eric, this is great.

422
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:07,867
You've solved a big problem for us.

423
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,587
After the meeting,

424
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:13,788
let's talk about your work arrangements.

425
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:19,587
Marisa, restore Mr. Yao's access
to the system now.

426
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,627
Zou, restore Mr. Yao's access.

427
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,147
Marisa.

428
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:37,656
The group pays you handsomely
to compete with other companies,

429
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:39,907
not with each other.

430
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:44,216
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

431
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:53,028
Yao Zhiming.

432
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,387
I'm asking you one last time.
What do you want?

433
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:05,368
Ms. Zhang, let me tell you
for the last time.

434
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,788
First, I do not intend to
return to headquarters.

435
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:12,587
So, whether I get
another promotion doesn't matter.

436
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,147
Second, I advise you
to give up on Xing'anli.

437
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:19,667
Then we can still work together.

438
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,748
All for Mai Chenghuan?

439
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:29,268
Third, if you dare to
make a move on Xing'anli again,

440
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:35,988
I guarantee you won't be
in your current position for long.

441
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:45,508
Have you forgotten who got you here?

442
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:50,947
I've repaid my debt when I helped you
become the acting president.

443
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:58,667
I'm telling you.
No one can lay a hand on Xing'anli.

444
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,828
Sir, when did you
land the job for the summit?

445
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,228
Why did you keep me in the dark?

446
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,107
You're a bad actor and may give us away.

447
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:35,708
I thought you were too devoted
to your relationship

448
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,828
to care about anything else.
So it was just a disguise.

449
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:40,508
I have an event to attend to. Bye.

450
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,352
Then...

451
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,667
(Little Hero, Big Adventure: Save Mommy)

452
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,468
Hello there, kids.

453
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:55,627
Welcome to
the Animal Kingdom of Xing'anli.

454
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,187
There is an important task for you.

455
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:01,028
The big bad wolf captured your moms.

456
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,104
Dingding.

457
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:07,107
Your mission is to rescue your mothers.

458
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,907
But there will be
all sorts of dangers along the way.

459
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:12,228
You must overcome difficulties
to rescue your mothers.

460
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:13,468
Are you ready?

461
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,708
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

462
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,468
Then let's set off. Come on!

463
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:21,427
- You got this.
- You got this.

464
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:25,028
Dingding, hurry. Save Mommy.

465
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,028
Dingding.

466
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:29,828
- Hurry up.
- She doesn't love me. I'm not going.

467
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:42,520
Dingding, why do you feel
that your mom doesn't love you?

468
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,907
Mom has found a boyfriend.
She doesn't love me at all.

469
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:51,308
Dingding, your mom has told me

470
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:54,988
that you're the best
and bravest child in the world.

471
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,548
The big bad wolf captured her today.

472
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:00,867
Your mom will be in danger
if you don't save her.

473
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,548
She will be very sad.

474
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:03,988
Do you want her to be sad?

475
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:09,387
I don't want her to be sad
or taken away by the big bad wolf.

476
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:11,508
Then off you go.

477
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:17,788
Dingding, hurry up. Go for it.

478
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:46,392
Dingding, hurry. Come on.

479
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,147
I will defeat you.

480
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:49,240
Go for it!

481
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:53,068
You are amazing, Dingding.

482
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,667
Mom, I'm coming to save you.

483
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,268
You are the best baby in the world.

484
00:32:57,268 --> 00:33:00,548
You are the best mom in the world.

485
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:13,867
Take another round.

486
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,828
You've worked hard.
It's hot in the costume, huh?

487
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:22,708
It's alright. I'm happy that
I can help you and Dingding.

488
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,308
I don't even know

489
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:31,468
how to interact with my kid as his mom.

490
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,788
And I need your help. I'm such a rookie.

491
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,308
You want to do everything by yourself?

492
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,028
Give me a chance to do something.

493
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,708
You've handled Dingding
but that doesn't mean you can handle me.

494
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,667
I remember when I wasn't as tall as you,

495
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,107
you used to pat my head and say that

496
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,867
you'd be there for me
if anyone dared to bully me.

497
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:57,187
It's finally my turn to say

498
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,708
I'm here if you ever need me.

499
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,308
People are watching.

500
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,347
So what?

501
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,427

00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,268
Tell Fang Da to see me
at my office tonight.

519
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:19,867
Sorry, I'm late.

520
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:23,027
Not at all, you came just in time.

521
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:25,528

I think the wind stopped.

527
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:43,547
Leave it and let's see.

528
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:47,828
My heart skipped a beat.

529
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:56,308
Thankfully, you came.
Otherwise, it would have collapsed.

530
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:00,027
Sorry, I invited you over for fun,

531
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:02,507
but you ended up working for us.

532
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:06,628
It's okay. I enjoy
working for you, anyway.

533
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:16,148
It's my turn. I have a gift for you.

534
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:17,784
What is it?

535
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:22,668
It's for me?

536
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:23,832
Of course.

537
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:28,907
Thank you, Mr. Yao. I really like it.

538
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:31,628
I'll help you put it on. Come here.

539
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:43,507
Done.

540
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:47,736
How is it?

541
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,347
I really like it, thank you.

542
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:53,848
Glad you like it.

543
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:58,748
Wait, lipstick.

544
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:02,507
Wipe it off.

545
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:04,547
Do you know what you look like?

546
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:07,547
You look like those kids
dancing on the stage just now.

547
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,080
Really?

548
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,168
The blush.

549
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:27,467
You used a wooden frame
instead of a steel one.

550
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,708
This is a serious case
of cutting corners.

551
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,427
We had many kids here.
What if they got hurt?

552
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:35,987
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:40,027
The steel frame was stranded
in Suzhou due to the torrential rain.

554
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,748
I didn't know what to do.

555
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:46,148
Liao Gang came and said
he had an economic solution.

556
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,748
I was too busy and didn't double-check.

557
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:51,067
And I didn't expect the strong wind.

558
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:53,560
Liao Gang?

559
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,027
Shouldn't you

560
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,708
double-check everything
as the business owner?

561
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:04,668
Are you aware of the consequences
of a potential accident?

562
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:07,928
Fang Da, as a partner,

563
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,947
I'm deeply disappointed
in you and Huixue.

564
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:17,347
Mr. Cui, we're holding
an urgent meeting tomorrow morning.

565
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:20,148
Okay, let me walk you out, Mr. Fang.

566
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:34,467
Chenghuan...
Miss Mai. I'll take my leave.

567
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,148
(Listen, next time
you come to this bar,)

568
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:46,947
mention me
and they will give you a free pass.

569
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,347
Come on, cheers.

570
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:49,400
Cheers.

571
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:55,507
Tell you what...

572
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,536
What a rare visitor! Come on, sit down.

573
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:05,108
Why did someone in a sweet relationship
come to find me at this hour?

574
00:39:07,668 --> 00:39:09,268
Something's off with you.

575
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:12,228
You never come here
and here you are in the dead of night.

576
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:13,467
Something's up.

577
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:15,748
Come on, what's the matter?

578
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:20,828
Come on, don't keep me
in suspense. Spill it.

579
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:27,947
He Dong, your position might be at risk.

580
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,748
Wait, what joke is this?

581
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,987
My position... What...

582
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:41,347
Really? Are you serious?

583
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:42,456
Because...

584
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,708
Because I'm getting promoted.

585
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:52,600
To what?

586
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,507
President of the East China Region.

587
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,108
When did this happen?

588
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,264
Just now.

589
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:05,308
Fantastic, Mr. Yao!

590
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:13,788
Listen up, everyone.
All the tabs are on Mr. Yao tonight.

591
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,507
Mr. Yao!

592
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:24,308
- Mr. Yao!
- Mr. Yao!

593
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,148
Here are a few things.

594
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,216
Firstly, the parent-child event

595
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:34,547
went well yesterday. Great job.

596
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:40,947
Secondly,

597
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:45,867
we're terminating our partnership
with Huixue Wedding Planning.

598
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:47,867
Why is that?

599
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,067
Thirdly,

600
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:56,067
Liao Gang from the Concierge Department
has been dismissed by the company.

601
00:40:57,828 --> 00:41:02,347
Why, Miss Mai? Give me a reason.

602
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:03,907
You want a reason?

603
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:08,467
I just emphasized
the standardized management

604
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,708
and you cut corners
with the stage setup materials.

605
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,027
Not only did you ignore my words,

606
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:16,547
but you also nearly
caused an accident for the kids.

607
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,228
- What...
- Stop denying.

608
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:21,748
Fang Da has told me everything.
You offered the materials.

609
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:24,387
He made a mistake
in a moment of confusion.

610
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,588
Can you give him a chance
to rectify his error

611
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:29,228
for Ms. Chen's sake?

612
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:34,027
Mr. Cui, it's not like
I haven't given him chances.

613
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:39,108
Liao Gang acted
all passive-aggressive on my first day.

614
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,507
I put my money into the company account
and gave everyone a raise.

615
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:45,668
I treat everyone like family.

616
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:47,320
You should be able to feel it.

617
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,308
But Liao Gang,
what do you take me for? A total fool?

618
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,788
Also, you didn't just cut corners.

619
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:58,308
You abused your power to take kickbacks.

620
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,507
You stole those
imported condiments, didn't you?

621
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:04,708
We have surveillance videos.
Do you acknowledge it?

622
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:08,628
Your junk isn't even worth much money.

623
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:11,188
You own such a big hotel.
Do you have to do this?

624
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:15,027
Everyone, I've heard that

625
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:19,067
all the hotels out there
offer better wages.

626
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,907
The job is much easier and less tiring.

627
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:26,108
What about here? You're already loaded.

628
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:28,588
Yet you keep making empty promises.

629
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,027
You're just stingy and heartless.

630
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,907
Liao Gang, I'll say it one last time.

631
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,467
Do the resignation paperwork right now.

632
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:39,708
I'll call the police
if you keep making a scene.

633
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:42,308
You're threatening me?
Who do you think you are?

634
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:45,427
You'll get your retribution!

635
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:48,588
Liao Gang, have you gone mad?

636
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,188
Take him out.

637
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:53,507
Let go. I can walk!

638
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:56,856
