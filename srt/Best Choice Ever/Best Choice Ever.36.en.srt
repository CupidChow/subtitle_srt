=Episode 36=

3
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,851
Come on.

4
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,051
Huan.

5
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,411
Have you found your mom?

6
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,610
Give it to me.

7
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,051
Hello, Mr. Mai. We've found Ms. Liu.

8
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,250
She's at the old house in Shang Village.

9
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,411
Don't worry.

10
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,450
She's not in a good mood now.

11
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:50,810
We are with her.

12
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,691
The most important thing right now

13
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,691
is to get your mom back

14
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,931
and take her to the hospital
for a thorough check-up.

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,851
If surgery is needed, then have surgery.

16
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,411
If treatment is required, then get it.

17
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,427
Okay, got it.

18
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:03,907
Alright then.

19
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,187
Keep contact.

20
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:08,668
Did they find Mrs. Mai?

21
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,948
She is in Shang Village.

22
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,628
I didn't even know my mom is so sick.

23
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:23,828
She...

24
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,188
She was doing fine, why would

25
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,267
she get a tumor?

26
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:33,068
Did you see my mom just like that?

27
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,828
She definitely didn't want us
to see her sick,

28
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,467
so she deliberately put on makeup.

29
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:39,908
But she...

30
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,307
she's got the lipstick

31
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,348
all crooked.

32
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,068
I know exactly

33
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:49,867
how you feel right now.

34
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,307
Let's think about it another way.

35
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,147
At least we've found her now.

36
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,188
And the doctor hasn't said
whether it's benign or malignant.

37
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:00,908
Right?

38
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:08,908
You're right.

39
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,027
I can't cry now.

40
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,467
Anyway,

41
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,908
I have to bring my mom back

42
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,228
and take her back for treatment.

43
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:23,828
Yes.

44
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,707
I am with you.

Hello.

55
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,388
Hello, Mr. Mai.

56
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,068
I can't say it when Huan was here.

57
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,347
Actually, Ms. Liu is not doing so well.

58
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,188
And now she is at a standoff with Huan.

59
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,907
I think you all need to come over now.

60
00:04:57,948 --> 00:04:59,988
Okay, we'll set off now.

61
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:00,948
Zhiming.

62
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:02,907
Let me know as soon if anything happens.

63
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,707
Okay, be careful on your way.

64
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,107
You are still here.

65
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,508
Zao called me

66
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:23,672
that your tumor

67
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,147
is not confirmed to be malignant,

68
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,508
needs to be re-examined.

69
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,267
I got you an appointment
with the best doctor.

70
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,347
Come back to Shanghai with me.

71
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,988
It might be benign.

72
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,227
I'm not going back.

73
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:44,988
You leave.

74
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,707
Fine. If you're not going back,
I won't either.

75
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:53,587
I'll stay right here with you.

76
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,388
Where are you going?

77
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,868
We need to buy some food.

78
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,267
Then I'll go too.

79
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:34,347
You go first.

80
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,227
Mom.

81
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,147
What do you want to buy?

82
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:44,628
We have no food.

83
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,027
Okay, got it.

84
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,587
Mom, see

85
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:17,948
if this is enough.

86
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,667
I'm a bit tired today.

87
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,107
Let's just eat something ready-made.

88
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:25,988
That works.

89
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,188
Boss, check please.

90
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,948
(Why doesn't she want to leave?)

91
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:50,027
Spicy roasted chicken,

92
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,308
spicy roasted bamboo shoots,

93
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:54,628
and spicy roasted shredded pork.

94
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,107
Make it extra spicy.

95
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,136
Okay.

96
00:07:58,548 --> 00:07:59,587
Thank you!

97
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:15,748
Try some authentic Anhui cuisine.

98
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:18,988
Sure.

99
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,428
Zhiming, come on. Let's eat.

100
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,707
Not used to it?

101
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,268
Go back.

102
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,148
I'm used to it.

103
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,188
I think it's delicious. I like it.

104
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,867
Maybe I'll go get you
something else to eat.

105
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:10,308
Don't worry about me.

106
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,028
I like it.

107
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:13,987
I think it's quite delicious.

108
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:36,347
I have a call.

109
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,148
I'll go get it.

110
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,467
Mr. Mai.

111
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,467
I'm heading out of the village now.
Just give me a second.

112
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,268
I'm... Mr. Mai!

113
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:47,908
Zhiming.

114
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:50,987
How is she?

115
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,507
She's not in a good mood.

116
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,107
She wants to stay here.

117
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,627
Neither Huan nor I dare to push her.

118
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,107
So we can only stay with her.

119
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,467
Can't believe it.

120
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:00,347
I'll go find her.

121
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,107
Mr. Mai.

122
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,387
You go ahead.

123
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:03,828
I'll go buy Huan something to drink.

124
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,507
Okay, come back early.

125
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:06,148
Okay.

126
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:09,336
Dad, be careful.

127
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,587
Don't force yourself.

128
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,148
These tricks you're using
are of no use to me.

129
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,467
You don't want to leave, right?

130
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,227
I'm not going either.

131
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:26,828
I'll just stay here with you.

132
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,507
I don't want my job anyway.

133
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:30,707
Just waste time here.

134
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:32,107
I'll do it with you

135
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,107
until you want to leave with me.

136
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,387
Otherwise, I won't leave either.

137
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,428
You've grown up.

138
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,308
You can decide it yourself.

139
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:44,908
Liu Wanyu!

140
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:45,707
Dad.

141
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:49,908
Dad.

142
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:51,256
Huan.

143
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:55,576
Liu Wanyu.

144
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,387
Let me tell you.

145
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,987
Don't go too far.

146
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,227
Why so fierce?

147
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:05,068
Dad, calm down.

148
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:07,387
Didn't we agree to talk nicely
when we saw mom?

149
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:08,747
This old woman

150
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:11,188
wants to leave me alone.

151
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:12,627
Can I be calm?

152
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,028
Liu Wanyu.

153
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:24,308
Get your head straight.

154
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,828
You're over 50 years old,

155
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:28,948
and yet you're still like this.

156
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,867
You've caused so much trouble
for these two children.

157
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:36,428
Zao just took on a case,

158
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,867
and he took leave because of you.

159
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,387
Huan and Zhiming

160
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,707
left the hotel and the staff behind,

161
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:44,788
and came all the way here

162
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,428
by car in the dead of night.

163
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,587
I didn't ask them to come.

164
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,308
All these years,

165
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,788
I've done everything for you,

166
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,587
and I've been submissive towards you.

167
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,188
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

168
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,507
Why would I?

169
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,523
But if I were acting like you,

170
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,404
we'd fight against each other,

171
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,523
and this family would have fallen apart

172
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:20,483
long ago.

173
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,044
Let me tell you.

174
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,284
I am here today

175
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,603
to take you back

176
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:31,924
and get treatment.

177
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:33,763
Otherwise,

178
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,003
I will divorce you.

179
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,363
Then let's divorce.

180
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:07,324
What did she say?

181
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:12,843
Dad. Why did you
say something that serious?

182
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,804
How could you even mention divorce?

183
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:15,643
Exactly.

184
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:17,763
I-I was just trying to scare her.

185
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,243
So, what do we do now?

186
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:24,164
Alright, don't worry about it.

187
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,044
In a while,

188
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,123
I'll go in

189
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,204
and have a good talk with her.

190
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:32,324
I need to calm down now.

191
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,643
You scared me.

192
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,643
Have some water.

193
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:54,964
I really can't take

194
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:58,044
those spicy dishes.

195
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,044
Didn't you say you like it?

196
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,243
I lied. Can't you tell?

197
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,763
How's the talk going?

198
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:09,883
It's still ongoing.

199
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:12,404
Actually, I know

200
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,883
that my mom is really scared.

201
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,684
But she's used to
putting on a brave face

202
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,483
and embarrassing to say it
in front of us.

203
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,204
Only my dad is here,

204
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,964
so she can show
her most vulnerable side.

205
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,444
So,

206
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,643
she agreed to go back with us?

207
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,444
She's really stubborn.

208
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,444
Do you really want to divorce me?

209
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:20,243
Mai,

210
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,843
if I can survive,

211
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,363
I will change

212
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:29,204
my bad temper.

213
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,723
But I don't know if this disease

214
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,523
can be cured or not.

215
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:44,284
If I'd pass away,

216
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,964
don't miss me.

217
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:54,003
You're not even 60 yet.

218
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,003
There's still a long life ahead of you.

219
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:00,843
You must find someone

220
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,243
who is gentle

221
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:08,324
and caring.

222
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,044
You have to take good care

223
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,444
of her,

224
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:19,643
and live a happy

225
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,044
and peaceful life.

226
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,204
Got it?

227
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,084
What are you talking about?

228
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:28,404
Let me tell you.

229
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,603
I, Mai,

230
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:31,483
am yours in life,

231
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,044
and even in hell, I am yours.

232
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:34,924
So are you.

233
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,883
But I am scared.

234
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,643
This is cancer, after all.

235
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:46,164
It's not a joke.

236
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,243
If you want to stay,

237
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,003
then stay.

238
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:01,123
Alright.

239
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,404
I will go resign to Zhiming.

240
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,644
Starting from today,

241
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,763
I'm not going anywhere

242
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,364
and being with you all the time, okay?

243
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:17,444
Alright.

244
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,043
Yu.

245
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:32,644
You've been tired for two days.

246
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:34,483
Have a good sleep.

247
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:37,483
I'll go talk to Huan, Zao and Zhiming.

248
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,604
Ask them to give you some time.

249
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,083
Sleep well.

250
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,644
Call me if you need anything.

251
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:34,323
Smoke less.

252
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:46,684
My mom is asleep?

253
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:51,964
Huan.

254
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:56,124
I saw those dishes you had for dinner
were full of chili peppers.

255
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:58,043
Can you stand it?

256
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:01,884
It's okay. Nothing.

257
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:03,844
You

258
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,243
have the same temper as your mom,

259
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:10,124
never show your weakness.

260
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:13,323
If you encounter anything,

261
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:16,523
just carry it all by yourself.

262
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:21,164
Huan.

263
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:23,884
I have something

264
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:27,003
that I really regret.

265
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,404
I used to joke with your mom

266
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,444
that when we get older,

267
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,083
if we get cancer,

268
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,164
then we wouldn't treat it,

269
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,283
not suffering from the radiation
therapy and chemotherapy.

270
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,684
But I mean,

271
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,684
if we get cancer in our 80.

272
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,283
But I didn't expect that your mom...

273
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,844
Did she take my words seriously?

274
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,644
Your mom has been married
to me for 30 years

275
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:15,043
and worried and toiled for 30 years.

276
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,323
I am not capable

277
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,803
to let her live a good life.

278
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,844
Finally,

279
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:28,604
both you and Chengzao

280
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,083
become successful,

281
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:34,083
but she fell ill.

282
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,083
She's so unlucky.

283
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,404
Alright, dad.

284
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,844
Don't be so upset.

285
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:47,083
Now

286
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,604
we are not
in the worst situation, right?

287
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:54,844
Well, Huan.

288
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:59,283
You'll go back tomorrow.

289
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,604
I'll stay here and be with your mom.

290
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:05,083
Dad.

291
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,723
Since she doesn't want to leave now,

292
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,964
let's not push her.

293
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,803
We'll find another way to persuade her.

294
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:13,083
What is it?

295
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:14,003
Dad.

296
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,483
Give me one week.

297
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,523
I have an appointment
with an oncologist next week.

298
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,444
If we can persuade mom this week,

299
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:23,563
that would be the best.

300
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,124
But if we can't,

301
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,003
we have to bring her back,

302
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:28,404
no matter how.

303
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,604
Okay.

304
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,323
Huan.

305
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:35,604
You have truly grown up,

306
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,483
and become matured.

307
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,483
You think things through

308
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,283
better than I do.

309
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:44,003
You really are the backbone

310
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:45,644
of our family.

311
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:48,164
Dad.

312
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,803
Even if I've grown up,
I'm still your daughter.

313
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:53,043
You are the backbone of our family.

314
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:38,563
Mom, you're awake.

315
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:45,243
I have

316
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:47,523
thought about it all night yesterday.

317
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,884
I think I was too hasty.

318
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,124
I should respect you.

319
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,404
So I'm not going to push you anymore.

320
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,283
If you don't want to go back,

321
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:59,043
then we won't go back.

322
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:02,204
Really?

323
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:03,124
Really.

324
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:06,684
There are good views here,
and the air is fresh.

325
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:08,604
Zhiming and I both like it very much.

326
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,803
We both are too tired.

327
00:23:10,884 --> 00:23:12,323
We can take the opportunity

328
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:13,483
to take a long vacation.

329
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,523
But what about your work?

330
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,043
Don't worry about it.

331
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:21,043
Mr. Cui is there in Xing'anli.

332
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,803
Zhiming has He Dong.

333
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:26,124
We just want to take advantage of it

334
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:28,684
to see
what the hotel market is like nearby.

335
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,323
Come on. I'll take you to go around.

336
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:36,723
Let's go.

337
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:38,483
Let's go.

338
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:54,323
What are you guys doing?

339
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,723
Didn't you say you want to stay longer?

340
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,323
We discussed it yesterday.

341
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:00,644
Since we are all here,

342
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:03,364
we'd clean up this old house,

343
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:04,563
so we can live more comfortably.

344
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:38,523
Yu.

345
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:40,844
Didn't we agree that I would cook?

346
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,323
You are now the treasure of the family.

347
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:44,604
I'll do everything for you,

348
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:45,844
and you just make the command.

349
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:46,563
Okay?

350
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,164
Look, I've already boiled the water.

351
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,323
Now, Huan

352
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,164
is under a lot of work pressure
at the hotel.

353
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:01,164
And Zao also just found a job.

354
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:04,964
Ming is always busy.

355
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,003
They all got held up by me.

356
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:12,404
I told you

357
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:15,204
to persuade them to go back yesterday.

358
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,204
Why do they all stay?

359
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,164
Yes, I've told them.

360
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:21,003
But they said since they've come,

361
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:23,723
just consider it as taking a vacation.

362
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,364
Think about it.

363
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,684
They usually work under pressure

364
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:27,723
and are busy.

365
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,204
It's appropriate for them

366
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:32,043
to come here and relax for a few days.

367
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:33,444
And look.

368
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,604
They are out there doing manual labor.

369
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,404
Just consider it as exercise.

370
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:40,803
I thought

371
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:43,003
I don't bother the children

372
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:45,444
by hiding in this remote place.

373
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,803
But I didn't expect

374
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:50,604
to hold them up.

375
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,204
Silly.

376
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:56,204
We are a family.

377
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:58,803
The children want

378
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:01,964
the two of us to be healthy and happy.

379
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:05,323
Alright, come on. Leave it to me.

380
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:06,563
Come on.

381
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,003
Rest assured.

382
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:09,684
Mom.

383
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:11,803
Are you feeling any better?

384
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,003
Let me help you with that.

385
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:15,124
It's dirty in this kitchen.

386
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:16,003
Get out

387
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,644
and wait outside.

388
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:18,444
Go on now.

389
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:21,644
Zao.

390
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:23,924
Do you have something to tell your mom?

391
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,924
Yes.

392
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:25,723
Okay then.

393
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:27,404
You'd talk with your mom,

394
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:28,844
and I'll step out for a bit.

395
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:31,563
Don't cook. I'll do it when I get back.

396
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:34,444
What's wrong?

397
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,323
Mom.

398
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:38,404
The case I was working on
is about to go to trial,

399
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:40,323
so I must go back today.

400
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:44,243
But my sister and Zhiming would stay
to keep you company, is that okay?

401
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,964
Yes. You go back now.

402
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:48,844
You go on with your work.

403
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:49,364
Okay.

404
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:51,563
It's getting cold.

405
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:52,763
Your jackets

406
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:55,404
are in the bottom one of the cabinet.

407
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:57,364
Remember to put on clothes.

408
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,844
I know, Mom. Don't worry.

409
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:00,803
Stop worrying about me.
I'll be back soon.

410
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:03,404
Zao.

411
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:13,404
Zao.

412
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:18,803
You've grown up

413
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:20,803
and have a girlfriend.

414
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:22,723
You are so busy,

415
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,204
so I hardly see you.

416
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,844
I have something

417
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,604
that I never get the chance to tell you.

418
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:36,003
I owe you an apology.

419
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,364
Mom, why are you saying this?

420
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:47,003
You're my mom,

421
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,604
why are you saying sorry to me?

422
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,404
Zao,

423
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:58,204
Huan...

424
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,563
Huan has been weak since she was little.

425
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:04,124
She got sick several times.

426
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,444
Once she was seriously ill

427
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:08,803
for almost half a year.

428
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:12,164
I was scared that something bad
would happen to her.

429
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:16,204
Don't despise me
for my old-fashioned ideas.

430
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:18,803
That's what I thought at the time.

431
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,204
I should at least give birth to a child

432
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:24,043
since I've married into the Mai family.

433
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,404
That's why you were born.

434
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,563
But I didn't expect

435
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:34,644
you are a blessing to our family.

436
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,763
Ever since you were born,

437
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,723
Huan's getting better.

438
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,364
But,

439
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:46,964
at that time,
your dad and I were too busy

440
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:49,723
to take care of two children.

441
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,604
And Huan grew up,

442
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,444
with a lot to take care of,

443
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:54,803
and had to go to school.

444
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,204
That's why I sent you

445
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:01,043
to Grandma.

446
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:07,404
Zao,

447
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:12,644
I was absent during your childhood.

448
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:17,323
I feel so guilty.

449
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:27,083
Mom,

450
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,003
I know all about it.

451
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:33,563
I stopped blaming you

452
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,844
a long time ago.

453
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,204
Really?

454
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:42,604
Really.

455
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:48,204
But if you can be healthy

456
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,003
and stay with us,

457
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,364
I would be even happier.

458
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:10,444
Okay.

459
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,283
Okay.

460
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:27,924
Huan.

461
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:29,844
Take care of mom.

462
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:30,964
I'll be back

463
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,204
once I'm done with the work.

464
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,283
You just go back and focus on your work.

465
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:36,404
I'm here.

466
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:39,924
Huan.

467
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:43,204
Mom apologized to me.

468
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,723
She said,

469
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:47,404
she feels so guilty for being absent

470
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,164
during my childhood.

471
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:53,080
Just let her spit it out.

472
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:54,808
It is a knot

473
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:56,323
she couldn't get out of.

474
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:04,924
What's wrong?

475
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,164
Huan, do you know?

476
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:12,003
As a child, I would often sit on
this stone bench and be in a daze.

477
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,844
Every day, I thought and hoped

478
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:16,803
that when I looked up,

479
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,563
my mom and dad would come
and take me home.

480
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:22,136
Back then,

481
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:25,204
I often felt like I was redundant.

482
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:27,803
But this time,

483
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,444
we're coming back together as a family.

484
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,124
I am so relieved all of a sudden.

485
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:34,204
I know,

486
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:35,803
no matter where I am,

487
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:37,723
Mom always loves me.

488
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,404
Of course.

489
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:42,644
Mom surely loves you.

490
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:46,124
My brother

491
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:48,124
has always been

492
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:49,803
so sensible

493
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,204
and kind since he's little.

494
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:54,924
Huan, I feel that with us
accompanying mom here,

495
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:56,563
she's getting better.

496
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,243
Let's try harder,

497
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,323
we can surely
bring her back to Shanghai.

498
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:03,204
Sure.

499
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:04,563
Let's go.

500
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,204
Didn't you say you beat
Fang Jie when you were little?

501
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:09,243
Where did you beat him?

502
00:32:09,924 --> 00:32:10,803
Here.

503
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,164
Here?

504
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:12,844
Right.

505
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:35,964
Zhiming.

506
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:37,323
Mr. Mai.

507
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:40,164
Waiting for Huan?

508
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:41,563
Yes.

509
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:43,684
It's dark in the village.

510
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:45,003
She might not see the way clearly.

511
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,604
Thank you.

512
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:56,684
Zhiming.

513
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,763
With you here,

514
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:00,644
we all feel

515
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,003
much more at ease,

516
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,003
especially Huan.

517
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:08,763
But Huan's mom and I

518
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,803
still feel somewhat sorry about you.

519
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:13,404
We are worried
that we'd hold up your work.

520
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:16,164
If you have anything to do,
just tell me.

521
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:18,723
After all, I am here.

522
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:20,444
Mr. Mai.

523
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,364
We are a family.

524
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:27,124
Work is never as important as family.

525
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:30,404
So don't overthink it.

526
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:32,803
Chenghuan told me

527
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,488
to discuss something with you.

528
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:37,003
Tomorrow we want
to survey the location for the branch,

529
00:33:37,323 --> 00:33:39,243
and take Ms. Liu out for a stroll.

530
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,723
I think it is really nice.

531
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,003
If there really is

532
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,552
a good investment opportunity,

533
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:49,283
it is the best, right?

534
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:17,563
You are awake?

535
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:21,003
Did you sleep well?

536
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,404
That's good then.

537
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:25,924
Get up.

538
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,404
I've prepared you water.

539
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,764
Huan has prepared breakfast already.

540
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,163
Come on. Be careful.

541
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:45,324
Yu, look.

542
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:47,444
Your daughter got up early

543
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:51,163
and spent more than an hour
preparing breakfast for you.

544
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,523
Mom, you eat the egg,

545
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:56,244
and we drink soy milk.

546
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,444
I-I'll tell you something.

547
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,683
After we finish breakfast,

548
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:15,804
we're going to accompany
Zhiming and Huan

549
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,123
to go find a place.

550
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:20,440
They want to set up

551
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:22,003
a hotel here.

552
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:24,364
We need to help them
choose a good place.

553
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:30,523
What are you up to?

554
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,603
Nothing.

555
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:34,884
You are familiar with this place.

556
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,404
If you don't accompany them, who will?

557
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:40,603
Besides, didn't you say
you are afraid to hold up their work?

558
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,003
This is their work right now.

559
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,244
Can you say no?

560
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:46,884
Yes, Ms. Liu.

561
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,804
We really need you as a guide.

562
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:52,324
Mom.

563
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,203
Don't stay in the house all day.
It's so stuffy.

564
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:56,764
Hang out with us,

565
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:58,083
just consider it helping us out.

566
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,764
Come on, let's eat.

567
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:43,544
Isn't it Yu?

568
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,284
It's been so many years,

569
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,804
I almost didn't recognize you.

570
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:50,232
Ms. Wang.

571
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:51,608
It's me.

572
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:53,404
What brings

573
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:55,523
you here again?

574
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:57,203
Come to my place for lunch.

575
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:00,003
Ms. Wang, don't be so polite.

576
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:01,804
We're hanging out with our mom

577
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,643
for fun.

578
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:05,643
This is Huan, right?

579
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:07,003
Don't mention it.

580
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,924
My duck ran off into the field.

581
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:10,163
Wait for me to catch it.

582
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,964
Let's go then.

583
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:14,083
L-Looks like it's over there.

584
00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:17,804
Well, Ms. Wang, we'll help you catch it.

585
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,804
Thank you then.

586
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,203
Zhiming, let's go catch the duck.

587
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:24,163
Let's go.

588
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:25,003
Maybe I should go.

589
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,804
No need, Dad.
The two of us will be fine.

590
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,003
Let's go.

591
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:29,123
You guys...

592
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:31,043
Come here, come here.

593
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:32,444
Huan, be careful.

594
00:37:32,444 --> 00:37:34,563
Huan has grown up so much.

595
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,483
Yao Zhiming, it went to you.

596
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:38,444
Take a look.

597
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:39,203
Coming.

598
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:40,683
- Here, here.
- Where?

599
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,043
Here, here. Yao Zhiming.

600
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:43,444
Here, here. Hurry up.

601
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,043
- Right here. Hurry up.
- I can't stand here.

602
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:45,844
It's out.

603
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,444
Mom, look. We caught it.

604
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:59,244
Two bosses caught a duck.

605
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,844
This is funny.

606
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,444
Good.

607
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:10,244
Did you see my mom just smiled?

608
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:12,884
She made a sincere smile

609
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,844
after what happened.

610
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:19,804
I finally understand now

611
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:21,043
why my mom wants to come back.

612
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:24,284
This is where she grew up.

613
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:26,804
There are memories of her everywhere.

614
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,804
This is where she's most comfortable,

615
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:31,804
where she can find herself.

616
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,444
Unlike in Shanghai,

617
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:38,003
she has to
keep her head up at all times.

618
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,364
Shanghainese must be spoken flawlessly.

619
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:43,364
Even for dancing,
she has to fight for the center spot.

620
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:46,924
Living here,

621
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:49,523
my mom is the happiest.

622
00:38:51,483 --> 00:38:53,560
Only when Ms. Liu is your mom,

623
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,163
will she be strong.

624
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,804
Everyone wants to be a child.

625
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:04,152
Huan, Ming.

626
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,712
Come on, let's take a group photo.

627
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:08,163
Coming!

628
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:09,924
Let's go.

629
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,160
Come on, I'll take a picture for you.

630
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,203
- Take the photo.
- Come on.

631
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:17,764
Wait, wait.

632
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:21,003
Look ahead.

633
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:21,924
Take the photo.

634
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,444
Ready, three, two, one.

635
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:25,912
Cheese.

636
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:38,483
All dishes are served.

637
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:41,324
Ms. Liu.

638
00:39:41,324 --> 00:39:43,003
Would you like some more?

639
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:45,444
No, there's already so much.

640
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:48,083
I don't know what you like to eat,

641
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,163
so I ordered some more dishes.

642
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:49,964
No need.

643
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,083
Look, stinky mandarin fish.

644
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:53,964
This must be hairy tofu, right?

645
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:57,324
And this stewed soft-shelled turtle...

646
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:58,924
Ham stewed with soft-shelled turtle.

647
00:39:58,924 --> 00:40:00,163
These are all signature dishes.

648
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:01,523
I heard

649
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,764
that Anhui cuisine is one
of the eight major Chinese cuisines.

650
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:07,083
And now we are
in the land of Anhui cuisine.

651
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:10,244
They must taste well.

652
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:12,444
Of course.

653
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,364
When the Hui troupes
came to the capital,

654
00:40:14,884 --> 00:40:16,844
Anhui cuisine was also
brought to Beijing.

655
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:18,844
It has a top-notch reputation

656
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,364
in China.

657
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,163
Yu, I've noticed

658
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:24,764
you really know something about troupe.

659
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:26,563
However,

660
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,483
you still have
the most clout in our family.

661
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:31,924
Look, Zhiming
has ordered so much for you.

662
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:34,523
Well, I can bask in your glory.

663
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:36,163
Come on.

664
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:38,683
Let's have your mom
try this stinky mandarin fish first.

665
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,404
Try this.

666
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:44,683
Let's eat.

667
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,284
Come on, Huan.

668
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:46,724
Okay.

669
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:47,203
Have a taste.

670
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:48,764
It's okay, Dad. Don't mind us.

671
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:49,764
Eat.

672
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:57,656
This fish

673
00:40:58,844 --> 00:40:59,844
is not

674
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:01,764
salted well.

675
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,964
Merchants are eager for quick success,

676
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:08,284
just focusing on making money.

677
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,764
Mom, do you know

678
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,083
where to find the authentic
stinky mandarin fish around here?

679
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:27,884
The one on the east end
of the village where I grew up,

680
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:29,163
the Feng's Mandarin Fish,

681
00:41:31,683 --> 00:41:32,964
which was very delicious.

682
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:35,884
They never

683
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:38,364
cut the salting time

684
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:39,964
in order to do business.

685
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:44,244
It tasted stinky and wonderful,

686
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:45,884
so delicious.

687
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:49,523
But after all these years,

688
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,563
I wonder if it's still on.

689
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,603
So many years have passed,

690
00:41:57,364 --> 00:41:59,523
I can't taste it anymore.

691
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,003
Village pharmacy.

692
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:09,804
Let's ask them.

693
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,163
Well, madam, I'd like to ask

694
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:17,324
if you know about Feng's Mandarin Fish.

695
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:18,764
No idea.

696
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:22,003
Hello, excuse me.

697
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:24,444
Do you know
where Feng's Mandarin Fish is?

698
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:26,284
No idea.

699
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:26,884
No idea.

700
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:27,924
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

701
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:28,804
No need.

702
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,244
Madam.

703
00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:32,683
Excuse me, do you know
where the Feng's Mandarin Fish is?

704
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,364
No idea. We are not locals.

705
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:36,244
No problem, thank you.

706
00:42:36,244 --> 00:42:37,444
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

707
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,844
Madam, excuse me.

708
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:45,043
May I ask where Feng's Mandarin Fish is?

709
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:47,203
This is Ms. Feng's shop.

710
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,404
But it's a cake shop.

711
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:53,364
Ms. Feng has closed her shop long ago.

712
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:57,912
