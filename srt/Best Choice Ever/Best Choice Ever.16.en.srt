=Episode 16=

3
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:33,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,216
Mom.

5
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,770
You're finally here.
Hurry and put this on.

6
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,770
Why should I change my clothes?
Aren't we just going to eat?

7
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,690
Yes, we are going to eat,
but you're still in your work clothes.

8
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,891
Change into nice clothes. Your auntie
will be happy to see you dressed up.

9
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:55,064
No need, Mom.

10
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:56,330
- My aunt...
- Go. Be good.

11
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,731
Why do I have to change my clothes?

12
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,376
It looks good, doesn't it?

13
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:10,131
It does, but aren't we just going
to have a meal with my auntie?

14
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,810
Why do I need to dress so formally?

15
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:15,291
You don't even see your aunt
once a year, do you?

16
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,490
Of course, you should dress up a bit.

17
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,731
Besides, wearing such clothes
will flaunt your figure.

18
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,571
I spent a lot of money on this.

19
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:26,171
Mom, isn't this a waste of money?

20
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,171
I won't often wear it.
Why did you buy it?

21
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,490
Then wear it more often from now on.

22
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,851
Be careful not to get it dirty,
and it won't be a waste, right?

23
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:41,530
Come on. Don't forget your shoes.

24
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,810
There are shoes too?

25
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,851
High heels. Come on. Put them all on.

26
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,731
Hurry up. I'm waiting.

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,330
Mom, who called you just now?

28
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,090
Your aunt. She was urging us.

29
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,328
What is she urging for?

30
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,291
It's about time.
If we don't hurry, we'll be late.

31
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,411
What time?

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,251
It's about time for the meal. Hurry up.

33
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:13,891
Mom, what's going on?
You're acting very strangely today.

34
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,216
I...

35
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,530
Huan, listen to me.

36
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,971
I do everything for your own good.

37
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:27,971
As long as you're happy,

38
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,330
no matter how angry
you are with me, it's okay.

39
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,490
What do you mean?

40
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,291
Open the door. Let's go.

41
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,131
Let's welcome the bride,
Ms. Mai Chenghuan.

42
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,976
(Engagement Banquet of Xin Jialiang
and Mai Chenghuan)

43
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,730
Dad, rest assured.

44
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,410
As the saying goes, "Settle down
before you establish your career."

45
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,491
Once Jialiang's marriage is settled,
you can take a break

46
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,650
and leave Deshan to Jialiang to handle.

47
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,210
With Chenghuan's help,
there will certainly be no problem.

48
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,090
You two have finally wised up.

49
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:54,611
Boss, do you know...

50
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:59,691
Whose engagement banquet is downstairs?

51
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,410
Sherry said it was Xin Jialiang
and Mai Chenghuan.

52
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,970
How come you are so out of the loop?

53
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,691
Calm down.

54
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,251
Mom,

55
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,650
this is for my good?

56
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,530
Yes. Huan, others
and I have been working

57
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,410
on this engagement banquet
for several days.

58
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,696
Your auntie, uncle,

59
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:43,290
and other relatives
you've never met have all come.

60
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,970
Yu, what is this all about?

61
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,251
Mom, what's with this engagement?
Didn't they break up?

62
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,976
Keep it down. What are you doing?

63
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,730
The two of them are a perfect match.

64
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,131
No external force
can tear them apart easily.

65
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,571
I just want to speed things up
and give everyone a surprise now.

66
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,410
Mom, this is clearly a scare.

67
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,992
Have you ever asked your daughter
for her opinion on such a big matter?

68
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,251
Huan, you're here.

69
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:19,931
You're using our engagement
to please your dad, right?

70
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,408
I'm not.

71
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,891
Jiali said you agreed.

72
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,011
Your sister said I agreed.

73
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,451
Do you think I'm a fool,
or do you think you are?

74
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:46,488
Chenghuan, go on stage and help us
cover this up from my dad.

75
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,491
Then I'll give you whatever you want.

76
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,371
And I won't stop you two anymore.

77
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:53,170
What do you mean?

78
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,811
Mom, they are the type who are driven
by their own self-interest.

79
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,048
They are just using my sister.

80
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,051
What?

81
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,730
Mrs. Mai, let's talk about this later.

82
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,811
There are so many people watching now.
Let them hurry onto the stage.

83
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:07,210
Right. Huan, listen to me. Go on stage.

84
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,440
I do it for your sake.

85
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,451
- Mom.
- I thought it through.

86
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,051
Mom, don't force my sister.
You're guilt-tripping her.

87
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,410
What are you doing? Know better.

88
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,090
- Come on stage with me.
- What are you doing?

89
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,176
Huan!

90
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,056
Hurry up.

91
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:50,970
Hello, everyone, I am Mai Chenghuan.

92
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:56,131
Thank you all for taking
the time to come here today.

93
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,251
I've been in love
with Mr. Xin Jialiang for many years.

94
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,131
We've had some really good memories.

95
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:12,571
But today, I have to solemnly
and regrettably inform you

96
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,410
that Mr. Xin Jialiang
and I have broken up.

97
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,090
This is the result
of our careful consideration.

98
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,891
Causing today's mix-up
was not my intention.

99
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,930
I still want to say sorry to everyone.

100
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,731
What use is saying sorry?

101
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:51,050
Sorry for making you
all come here for nothing.

102
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:05,891
Huan.

103
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:14,392
E-Everyone.

104
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:18,050
T-T-The young couple are quarreling.

105
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,650
It's nothing. Enjoy yourselves.

106
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,211
It is just
their engagement banquet today.

107
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,290
Mom!

108
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,570
I'll say it again.
Please respect my decision.

109
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,530
Huan, listen to me.

110
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,731
Hasn't Jialiang shown you enough love
by what he has done?

111
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:43,450
Hasn't he been good enough to you?
What more do you want from him?

112
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,530
He says he loves me.

113
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:49,131
That's why he tested me
by hiding his privileged upbringing.

114
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,891
He says he loves me.

115
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,251
That's why he's been indecisive
between me and his parents.

116
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,410
He shies away from problems
and doesn't care about me.

117
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,690
He says he loves me.

118
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:59,251
That's why he peacefully broke up
with me only moments ago

119
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,690
and then right after that, to please
his father, he's trying to force me

120
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,331
to agree to his proposal!

121
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,611
Huan.

122
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:06,680
I...

123
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,410
Huan, listen, nobody is perfect.

124
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,971
Jialiang is essentially a good person.
He truly loves you.

125
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,731
Whether I agree to get engaged
and to whom is my own business.

126
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,530
No one can make that decision for me.

127
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,690
Huan.

128
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,930
It's okay.

129
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,450
Huan, I know you feel upset.

130
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,891
But can you just bear it a little
and do it later at home instead, please?

131
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:48,530
So many relatives are around.
You're gonna embarrass me.

132
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,650
Mom! I have never been so clear-headed.

133
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,211
I'm done playing. You guys go ahead.

134
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:01,530
Mai Chenghuan!

135
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,091
If you leave today,
you'll be no longer my daughter.

136
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:51,650
Mom, because you gave birth
to me and raised me,

137
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,450
I am deeply grateful to you
and have respect for you.

138
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,050
Because I understand
how hard you've worked,

139
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:06,690
I've always listened to you
in all matters.

140
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:12,251
I tolerated your unreasonable demands
as much as possible.

141
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:18,810
I used to think that everything
you did was for my own good,

142
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:22,450
so I always stepped back and gave in,

143
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,971
which, unknowingly,
has led to this situation.

144
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,050
I think perhaps you only
want an obedient doll

145
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,770
and manipulate it

146
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,530
to fulfill the ambitions
you never achieved when you were young.

147
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:48,170
But I...

148
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,410
I no longer want to be that doll.

149
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,530
Huan.

150
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,971
Huan.

151
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:08,731
Come back. Give Huan some space.

152
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:32,011
Wanyu, don't be angry.

153
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,611
What's there to be angry about?

154
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,170
Chenghuan's almost 30. It might be
quite difficult for her to get married.

155
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,280
Stop saying that.

156
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,544
Mom.

157
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:49,690
Mr. Xin, although we're poor,

158
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,891
my daughter has her own dignity.

159
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,690
Please tell your son not
to harass my daughter again.

160
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:07,672
Let's go.

161
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,136
Dad.

162
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:24,056
You disgraced me completely.

163
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,170
Dad, aren't we doing this
to make you happy?

164
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,930
This is a sign of our filial piety.

165
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:38,331
Shut up! You're only after my money
in the name of filial piety.

166
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:45,690
Why the rush?
My money will all be yours eventually.

167
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,731
Ours? Who knows
if you'll spend it on that woman?

168
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,851
Y-Y-You brat!

169
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,770
- Mr. Xin!
- Mr. Xin!

170
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,891
Call an ambulance!

171
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,104
Are you okay?

172
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:33,011
What are you doing here?

173
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,371
Passing by. If you do something rash,
my grandma would blame me.

174
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:58,268
♪Dust wanders everywhere

Do you know the meaning of my name?

180
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:31,771
Mai Chenghuan, catering to others
and winning their favor?

181
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,291
Serving parents.

182
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,571
That is the true meaning.

183
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,891
It is quite suffocating to have
a name that's meant for others.

184
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,650
For the first time in my life,
I went against that meaning.

185
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm feeling a bit conflicted.

186
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:07,250
But no matter what,
I used to please my parents.

187
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,331
From now on,
I just want to please myself.

Yu, you haven't eaten all day.

192
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,410
Do you want me
to make something for you?

193
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,944
Dad, Mom, I sent Auntie
and Uncle to the train station.

194
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:03,032
You don't have to worry.

195
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:06,571
Okay. What about your sister?
Have you tried contacting her?

196
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:09,291
I don't know.
She didn't answer the phone.

197
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,891
Let her have some peace
during this time.

198
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,611
After such a fuss,
I can't persuade her to come home.

199
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,970
Yu, you really need to reflect on this.

200
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,616
You didn't even check with your daughter

201
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,410
before agreeing
to this whole engagement thing?

202
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,600
All these years,
it's been whatever you say goes.

203
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:46,571
I'm okay with it,
but the kids have grown up.

204
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,851
Nowadays, children seek independence.

205
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,120
Your intentions are good.

206
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:57,690
But it's her feelings

207
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,131
that matter most.

208
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:05,051
Yes, Mom. A matter like marriage
should be decided by Huan herself.

209
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:10,136
Huan.

210
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,811
Huan, what are you doing?

211
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:34,730
What are you doing?

212
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,690
I'm going to a place of freedom.
I should have moved out a long time ago.

213
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,371
How dare you?

214
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,250
Yu, calm down.

215
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,650
She's practically rebelling,
and you're telling me to stay calm?

216
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,728
Mom.

217
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,891
Freedom? You're 29 now
and asking me for freedom?

218
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,331
Why didn't you ask for it
when you were nine?

219
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,410
You grew up on my milk.

220
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,250
You ate the food I cooked.

221
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,250
I paid for your education.

222
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,611
Even your ID card was applied by me.

223
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,730
You're grown-up now
and want to move out.

224
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,611
Huan.

225
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,456
Huan.

226
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,232
Watch over your mom.

227
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:57,051
Who did I do all this for?

228
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,450
Isn't it all for her own good?

229
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:09,531
And after all this,
I'm still the one to blame?

230
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,811
Mom, don't blame yourself.

231
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:27,051
Huan will calm down and come back.

232
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,571
Huan, wait.

233
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,051
Dad, don't try to persuade me.

234
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:50,091
I've already made my decision.

235
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,410
I understand. You've grown up.
Eventually, you have to leave the nest.

236
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:10,531
I saved my pocket money.

237
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:14,970
Though it's not much,
it could help you for a few days.

238
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,371
Take it.

239
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:18,930
Dad, I don't want it.
I've already grown up.

240
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,010
I have a job and earn money.
Keep it for yourself.

241
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,571
Silly child, whether you are
at home or not,

242
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:31,531
even if you get married,
you'll always be my daughter.

243
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:40,250
Dad, I want freedom,

244
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,291
but I will also take responsibility.

245
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:48,650
Please give me a chance

246
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,811
to stand tall
and be an independent person, alright?

247
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,450
It's been a hard time for you, Dad.

248
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,450
No. It's my duty.

249
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:05,970
You know your mom's temper.

250
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:10,091
I have to bend a little, right?

251
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:13,851
Otherwise,
there would be daily quarrels.

252
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:22,250
Huan, I looked forward to you growing up
when you were little.

253
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,930
But now, I hope you will be happy.

254
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:31,930
If you're happy, I'll be happy.

255
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,650
Alright, I'll stop. Otherwise,
I won't bear to let you go.

256
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:47,131
Where are you going?

257
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,250
Mao's place or your grandma's?

258
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,410
Look, I have so many places to stay.

259
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,490
Don't worry about me.

260
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,091
Let me know when you're settled
so I can rest assured.

261
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,584
Dad.

262
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,360
(Deposit card)

263
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,920
(Sanheli)

264
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,331
Where are you moving to?

265
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:01,730
You saw all the drama unfold today.

266
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,170
You saved my life, and I caught you
in an awkward situation.

267
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,170
I'd say we're close after that.

268
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,664
I suppose so.

269
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,410
Do you need me to arrange
a place for you to stay for a while?

270
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,611
No need. I appreciate it, but...

271
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:27,291
Huan, Chengzao told me so I rushed over.

272
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,650
Come stay at my place. Let's go.

273
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,891
No. I can't stay at your place.

274
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:31,930
If I do it,

275
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,851
my mom will go over there
and it'll affect your business.

276
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:36,010
You are more important, okay?
Don't worry. Let's go.

277
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,051
But I really can't go.

278
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:40,250
Your shop has just opened
and it's time to attract customers.

279
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,811
I'll go to my grandma's place.
My mother is wary of her.

280
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:43,851
She won't make a scene there.

281
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,170
Let's go. I'll take you
to your grandma's place.

282
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,216
I'll take you.

283
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,051
Who are you?

284
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:53,611
I forgot he was here.

285
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,131
Yao Zhiming, my grandma's own grandson
and my former boss.

286
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,771
So you're that grandson.

287
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,851
The one who caused
Chenghuan to be suspended

288
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:04,091
and this whole drama
with the Xin family, right?

289
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,170
And now you're here
playing the good guy. What for?

290
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,210
Mind your words.

291
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:10,730
I don't deny nor defend my past actions.

292
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,250
I'm just acting on Grandma's request
to take good care of Chenghuan.

293
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,891
You talk a good game.

294
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,611
Mao, this time
it really had nothing to do with him.

295
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,650
Sorry. We'll be going.

296
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:25,371
Weren't you going to give me a ride? Go.

297
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:27,571
Goodbye then, dear grandson.

298
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,930
You haven't eaten, have you?
If you're hungry,

299
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,250
open that little box for food.

300
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,184
Get something in your stomach first.
I'll take you to eat.

301
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:58,210
I'm not hungry.

302
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:02,490
Should I get you a lucky bead?

303
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,811
Look at the kind of men
you've been meeting.

304
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:10,930
One set you up in business,
and another lied to you in love.

305
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:14,490
Just thinking about Xin Jialiang
makes me angry.

306
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,611
He dated you for three years.

307
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,891
He swore he loved you but then went
on a blind date with someone else.

308
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:27,851
And now he's staging a fake engagement
over a fight for inheritance.

309
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:31,930
What sort of person is this?
I've never seen such a shameless man.

310
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,531
The Xin family are now strangers to me.

311
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:39,891
They have nothing to do with me.

312
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:43,131
I am just

313
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,490
too disappointed in my mom this time.

314
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:53,410
Mrs. Mai has never had a moment
of true happiness in her life.

315
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,131
Your house got flooded, and her hopes
for it to be demolished were dashed.

316
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,930
It's been a roller coaster
with the house issues.

317
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,650
So she was desperate.

318
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,970
I'm not making excuses for her.

319
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,490
She really did go too far this time.

320
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:15,131
I support you.

321
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:20,170
It's quite good for you and your mom
to take a break from each other.

322
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,730
And there's a fundamental difference
in values.

323
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:30,410
Is it that serious?

324
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,730
Xin Jialiang came to me before
with a high-paying job offer.

325
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,650
I refused. Our family
is short of money right now,

326
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,250
but I know I mustn't take it.

327
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,811
But when I saw Zao delivering takeout,

328
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,291
I actually had a moment
of hesitation and doubt.

329
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,210
Was my decision right or not?

330
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:05,891
But later Zao reinforced my resolve.

331
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,250
We decided to strive hard
without relying on others.

332
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:18,930
But my mom gave us
a completely opposite answer.

333
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,450
Why did Zao become a delivery guy?

334
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,811
Wasn't he doing well at the law firm?

335
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:31,410
After I broke up with Xin Jialiang,
people at the law firm bullied him.

336
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,930
Is Zao okay?

337
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,690
Zao is very sensible and optimistic.

338
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,400
He gave me all the money
he earned from tutoring over the years.

339
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:49,131
We pooled money together
to renovate the house.

340
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,851
So many bad things happened to you.

341
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,051
I'm also a member of this family.

342
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,611
If you need anything,
you must tell me, okay?

343
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:14,650
Mai Chenghuan, next time you date,

344
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,771
just pick someone who is handsome
and has a good figure.

345
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:20,930
Many girls

346
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,250
are highly educated,
successful in their careers,

347
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,490
smart, ambitious and responsible.

348
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:31,210
What's wrong with them
being awesome on their own?

349
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,010
Why do they have to
rely on men for their hopes?

350
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,200
Men can be much more realistic than us.

351
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,771
They can hide
their financial situations from you.

352
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:45,720
They can even control you emotionally.

353
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,650
Only their faces don't lie.

354
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,170
So, you just have to choose
the handsome ones.

355
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,970
That's superficial.

356
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,131
It's true. Since men lust after beauty,

357
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:00,210
why can't we girls?

358
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:05,010
Let me tell you something.
Song Huaimin is bald.

359
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:07,650
You can't tell, right?
He's wearing a toupee.

360
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,690
No wonder you decisively divorced him.

361
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,091
Mao Yongxin, that's so you.

362
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:23,131
Next time, keep your eyes wide open

363
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,051
and pick a handsome one
as a boyfriend, got it?

364
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:33,970
Right now, I'm only
thinking about my career.

365
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,531
As long as I get a higher pay,
I'll have everything I need.

366
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:42,410
You've wised up.

367
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:47,970
I just put my career
before my relationship.

368
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:51,851
Alright, Master Mai.

369
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,690
Boss, it's a crucial period

370
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,210
for the Xing'anli project.

371
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,371
What exactly are you thinking?
Give me a clear answer.

372
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,650
Help me push this forward.

373
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,531
What do you mean
by me pushing it forward?

374
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:17,210
Who am I? Do I have that much power?

375
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,291
Did you hear me?

376
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,690
Go buy a bouquet of sunflowers.

377
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,131
Bring them to me
tomorrow morning. I need them.

378
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:31,051
It's time for Chinese violets to bloom.

379
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,250
Where am I supposed
to find sunflowers for you at this hour?

380
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,450
This is your job. Why are you asking me?

381
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,771
Mai Chenghuan's engagement
is really giving you a headache.

382
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,571
You take painkillers and ask
for sunflowers. What do you want to do?

383
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,410
I'll plant them for you. Just wait.

384
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,371
Have a cup of anti-inflammatory tea.

385
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:14,651
Have a good sleep,
and you'll feel better soon.

386
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:15,651
Thank you, Grandma.

387
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,251
You're the best, willing to take me in.

388
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:34,490
I've already said this is your haven.

389
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:39,050
Just settle down here.
Does your face still hurt?

390
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:45,171
I've lived with my mother for 29 years.

391
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,811
I used to think she had it tough,

392
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,130
so I complied with everything.

393
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,450
I myself found it deeply moving.

394
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:59,731
But unexpectedly, I ended up
being labeled as an ungrateful child.

395
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,504
Your parents hope for you to serve them.

396
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:08,171
In the past, you kept enduring

397
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:11,410
and enduring.

398
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:16,371
This time, it is an exception.

399
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,410
Chenghuan, your parents
and brother are just passersby.

400
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,136
One should live for oneself.

401
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:31,010
When you reach my age, you'll realize

402
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,251
it's just you alone.

403
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:47,930
Right, Grandma, take a look.

404
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,811
Where did this come from?

405
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:52,930
Open it.

406
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,744
Okay.

407
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,130
It's the two of us.

408
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,891
Grandma, this was handmade by Mao.

409
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,331
You gave me a bracelet last time,
so this is like a return gift.

410
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,331
You must wear it all the time
from now on.

411
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:15,171
I certainly will.

412
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:20,851
I love it so much.

413
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:28,184
Good morning, Grandma.

414
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:29,331
Morning.

415
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:31,450
I bought these for you
as I passed by a flower shop.

416
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,291
Sunflowers? I've never seen
you bring flowers before.

417
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,530
How come you're so nice?

418
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,851
It's all thanks to your teaching.
Where's Chenghuan?

419
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,930
You smooth talker.

420
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,771
It's Chenghuan's influence, right?

421
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,371
No.

422
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,224
Morning.

423
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,490
What's wrong? Your eyes are so red.

424
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,530
Mai Chenghuan, did you cry?

425
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,731
Come on. I'm not the heroine
of a soap opera

426
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,610
who likes to cry when something happens.

427
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:11,731
I was hand-washing
two silk clothes for Grandma.

428
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,171
The detergent foamed too much.

429
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:16,570
It's my first time using it.
I poured too much of it.

430
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,811
It floated all over my face
and suddenly got into my eyes.

431
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:22,291
That's it? Just hire a part-time worker.

432
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:25,891
No, they won't wash as well as we do.

433
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:28,291
And I'm on the afternoon shift today
and have nothing to do.

434
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:32,130
I can't just use
Grandma's small bed for free, right?

435
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,490
I was wondering why you came
so early in the morning.

436
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,771
So you're here for Chenghuan.

437
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:46,371
How could that be?
I came specially to see you.

438
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:51,610
If so, show your filial piety.

439
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,331
Feel free to say it. Want a feast,
fine wine or a trip out?

440
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,891
Excuse me.

441
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,371
Neither of those.
Use the purple one first.

442
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,664
I know.

443
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,530
You can't pour it directly
on this bedsheet.

444
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,291
You should first dissolve
the laundry detergent in water.

445
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:32,171
When you wash Grandma's bedsheet,
be gentle. Do you understand?

446
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,570
Thank you for telling me.

447
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,171
It's good to just sit there
and talk without doing anything.

448
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:43,211
You're blaming me? It's you
who wanted to show filial piety.

449
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:52,696
You...

450
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,432
Forget it.

451
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:11,960
Stop!

452
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,936
I knew you would twist it.

453
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,530
You can't do it so hard.

454
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,010
Otherwise, the bedsheet
will get deformed.

455
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,376
You do it.

456
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:33,368
Fine, let me teach you.

457
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,376
Okay.

458
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,651
Fold it again. One last time.

459
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,331
There, squeeze out all the water.

460
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,490
You can't roll it.
You need to press it like I do.

461
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:20,970
That's nice. We're practically...

462
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:22,776
What?

463
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:28,450
Siblings. What else
did you think? Alright.

464
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,080
What's next?

465
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,731
Open the bedsheet
and shake off the remaining water.

466
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,450
Actually, I'm quite content right now.

467
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,651
Although my marriage fell through
and I had a falling out with my mom,

468
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:52,371
I still feel happy with my bestie

469
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,490
and my grandma around.

470
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,970
You're pretty good at
comforting yourself.

471
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:03,050
Whether I'm happy or not,
the days will just pass by.

472
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,211
Why bother to worry?

473
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,410
Hey! You're doing this
on purpose, right?

474
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,851
I'm just trying
to bring you back to reality.

475
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,530

We can't finish them all at once.

You're not allowed to use it.
