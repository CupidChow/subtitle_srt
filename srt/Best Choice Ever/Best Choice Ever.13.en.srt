00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:30,008
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,880
Get me another pillow, please.

4
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,779
Still troublesome in the sickbed.

5
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,940
Get up for a second.

6
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,940
Try it. Is it fine like this?

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,056
It's much better.

8
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,580
Oh, many people called you
while you were unconscious yesterday,

9
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,940
probably your family members.

10
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,440
Call them so they don't worry.

11
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,736
You got it wrong.
I don't have any family.

12
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,848
I'm just a lone soul.

13
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,144
My grandma is my only kin.

14
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,980
What about your other relatives?

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,200
My grandpa left my grandma.
My dad left my mom.

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,499
My mom abandoned me.
My dad went to prison.

17
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:32,860
My mom had an accident
on the way to her boyfriend.

18
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,064
That's my family, quite extraordinary.

19
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,460
Feeling sorry for me?

20
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,416
Refill it. I want it warm.

21
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,099
Feeling sorry for you?
You don't even say "thank you".

22
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,180
Let me fetch some water.

23
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,140
Mr. Yao, due to your sudden illness,

24
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,020
we held an internal meeting.

25
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,140
Thanks to Miss Mai's instructions,

26
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,300
we have prepared
first aid kits for each guest room

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,460
to prevent similar incidents.

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,659
That was fast.

29
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,180
Of course, it is my job. Here.

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,819
Be careful, Grandma.

31
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,700
Uncle, I heard you were sick.

32
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,784
Here are some local specialties
for you and that sister.

33
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,856
Thank you, come here.

34
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,140
What are you telling him again?

35
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,539
Kiddo, don't be scared.
That uncle is just teasing you.

36
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,659
He was kidding.

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,300
He didn't scare me.

38
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,059
He said that there is no Ultraman,

39
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,300
but there are Superman and Spider-Man.

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
That's what he told you?

41
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:12,260
Yao Zhiming, you will train
those employees, right?

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,539
They may not be professional,

43
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,940
but they are enthusiastic
about what they do.

44
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,808
I can extend the bottom line.

45
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,779
Mr. Yao, you surely talk tough.

46
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:36,900
Chenghuan, I'm sorry about the bidding.

47
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,624
Mr. Yao, what did you say?
I didn't quite catch that.

48
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,900
Come on, say goodbye.

50
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,080
Goodbye.

51
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,416
Hello, sir.

52
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,820
Mai Chenghuan, you...

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,460
I'm the new property manager.

54
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:26,979
You were demoted due to the bidding?

55
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,219
What a coincidence. I live here.

56
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,859
You're in charge of this floor?
Let's hang out.

57
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,720
Miss Zhu, tell me if you need anything.

58
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,820
I'll take my leave now.

59
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Okay.

60
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,500
It's lease renewal season again.
So much trouble.

61
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,140
The bottom floor I'm in charge of
has half your renewal rate.

62
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,419
What should I do?

63
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,659
Be more attentive

64
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,380
and pay more attention to their needs.

65
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,219
People pay the property fee
for the service.

66
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,179
Once you please them with your service,

67
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,816
they'll renew the lease.

68
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,820
Chenghuan, I really admire you.

69
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,779
To be fair,
you're both patient and capable.

70
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,099
All those tenants spoke highly of you.
No wonder you were

71
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,240
from the headquarters.

72
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,179
We should love what we do.

73
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,880
I won't be happy at work
if I keep complaining, right?

74
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,659
I'm not as optimistic as you.
I only get 8000 per month.

75
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,859
I wouldn't walk any dogs every day.

76
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,900
But there's the bonus.

77
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,896
It's as little as a tip.

78
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,192
Small amounts add up. It will pay off.

79
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,219
Chenghuan, Room 416
is asking for service. Go take a look.

80
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,080
Alright, copy that.

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,140
I have to go.

82
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,299
Go ahead.

83
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,184
Darling, are you really in such a hurry?

84
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
I haven't seen you for days.

85
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:02,659
You made me quit the job.
Are you really mad at me?

86
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,440
Why would I be mad at you?

87
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,820
Besides, I can't be mad once I see you.

88
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,979
Many things are going on at work.
They can't do anything without me.

89
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,896
True, they don't know how you do things.

90
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,739
How about this? Stay for dinner.

91
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,260
I'll open a bottle of good wine.
What do you say?

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,056
No, I really have to go.

93
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,659
How about a kiss before you leave?

94
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,380
So greedy.

95
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,539
Then I'll kiss you.

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,380
Okay, fine.

97
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,539
Chenghuan, what is it? Do you need help?

98
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,620
It's nothing. I'm working on it.

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,539
What's wrong? You look flustered.

100
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:28,020
Nothing. The doctor said
you should drink more water.

101
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,980
How many times have I told you?

102
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,340
Be careful in public. But look at you,

103
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,699
hugging me and everything in public.

104
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,260
Someone saw it. What should we do?

105
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,939
I love you too much.

106
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:59,832
How do you expect me to restrain myself?

107
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,340
Anyway, you and your wife
have long been estranged.

108
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,900
Just get a divorce.

109
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,539
If they find out about our affair,

110
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,419
you won't get a penny
out of the divorce as the one at fault.

111
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,459
You knew that Mai Chenghuan
was transferred here

112
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,304
and did that in front of her on purpose

113
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,152
to force me into a divorce, right?

114
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:24,299
Darling, how could you think that of me?

115
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,860
I simply love you and adore you.

116
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,220
I've always kept myself in check.

117
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,260
I've never asked for anything.

118
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,620
I just don't get it.

119
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,272
What do you gain
if I get stripped of every penny?

120
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,816
I made up my mind
the day I started dating you.

121
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,020
I don't want anything.

122
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,620
I just want to be with you.

123
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,819
You don't want a divorce yet.

124
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,320
Just pretend that I don't exist.

125
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,299
I will explain things to Mai Chenghuan

126
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,539
and ask her not to speak of our affair.

127
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,216
Handle it well. Don't cause me trouble.

128
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,256
Miss Zhu, did you call for the service?

129
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,900
How dare I call for
your service? Come on in.

130
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,260
I just think that we are close.

131
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,824
You're about to get off work,
so let's have dinner together.

132
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,819
Try it. It's from
a new Black Pearl restaurant nearby.

133
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,059
I ordered so much.

134
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,419
It will be a waste if you don't eat.

135
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,900
Miss Zhu,
we went to the same university.

136
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,024
So I'll cut to the chase.

137
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,864
You schemed for me to see that, right?

138
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,860
What are you talking about?

139
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,020
You called me for service earlier.

140
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,819
You wanted me
to see you with Xin Zhishan.

141
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,140
Am I right?

142
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,659
Chenghuan, you're clever.
I'll just be straightforward.

143
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,059
I've been dating Mr. Xin
ever since I graduated.

144
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,232
He still hasn't married me
after all these years.

145
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,296
I can't accept that
so I want to pressure him a bit.

146
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,220
He still hasn't married you.

147
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,600
Why do you think that
I can help you get what you want?

148
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,659
Chenghuan, do you remember
how close we were in college?

149
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,848
We were best friends in the same major,

150
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,020
perhaps because
we were both from average families.

151
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,016
Your family can only decide your life
before you turn eighteen.

152
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,100
If you keep blaming everything on that,

153
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,980
it only means that
you're not working hard enough.

154
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,380
Chenghuan, it takes a lot to work hard.

155
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,579
Taking a shortcut

156
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,699
can get you what you want.

157
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,539
But I believe you can achieve that

158
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,419
and live the life you want

159
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,340
with your own capability.

160
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,688
We are both from ordinary families.

161
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,176
We can't possibly
give ourselves a better life.

162
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,579
Weren't you taking a shortcut
by dating Xin Jialiang?

163
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,260
That was pure love, huh?

164
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,659
Miss Zhu, what are you trying to say?

165
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,380
Don't tell the Xin family
about me and Xin Zhishan, okay?

166
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,819
If this gets out, Mr. Xin will
be divorced without getting a penny.

167
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,620
Then I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

168
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,179
You lead me
to find out about your affair.

169
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,220
And now you forbid me
from telling others.

170
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm sorry, Miss Zhu.

171
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,304
I have no interest in your affairs.

172
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,220
I have to go.

173
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,740
Chenghuan.

174
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:06,588
(Xin Jialiang)

175
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,539
Chenghuan, this is for you.

176
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,432
Who gave it to me?

177
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
A middle-aged man.

178
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:26,299
I told him to wait for you.

179
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:27,819
But he left this and went away.

180
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,140
(ICBC)
He said you'd get it.

181
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,500
Chenghuan, which tenant is so generous?

182
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,740
It looks like
you're going to make a fortune.

183
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,179
Thanks, get back to work.

184
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:39,800
See you.

185
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:50,840
(Mr. Xin)

186
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,340
Mai, you got the card, right?

187
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,380
Just go ahead and use the money.

188
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,579
Tell me if you need anything.

189
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,380
Mr. Xin, I can't...

190
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,179
Sorry, the user you are calling
is currently unavailable.

191
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,220
Add more vinegar to the fish next time.

192
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,980
I like it sour now.

193
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

194
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,380
Hello, Mr. Xin.

195
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Hi, Dad.

196
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,779
Dad.

197
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,699
How come you're home for dinner today?

198
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,900
Homemade food is the best.
That's why I came back.

199
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,779
Of course, the dishes outside
are too greasy and salty.

200
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,299
It's time to come home
for cleansing. Here.

201
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,140
Why am I busy out there all day?

202
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,656
I'd like to come home if it weren't
for those social obligations.

203
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,832
Jialiang.

204
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,699
Has Mai contacted you recently?

205
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,020
No. We've broken up.
Why would she contact me?

206
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,064
She should be ashamed.

207
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,860
- Watch it.
- Am I wrong?

208
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,740
You've turned
my relationship into a mess.

209
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,800
Are you happy now?

210
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,260
Why are you yelling?
If it's over, it's over.

211
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,380
She's just an ordinary girl.

212
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,699
Do you have to be so into her?

213
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,179
Let me tell you. You've broken up.

214
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,459
You'd better sever your ties.

215
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,779
Delete all her contact information.
Do you hear me?

216
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,100
Hear that, Jialiang?

217
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Your mom will set you up
with someone else.

218
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,380
That's right. You know better, Dad.

219
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,579
With our family background,
what kind of girl can't he get?

220
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,900
Mai Chenghuan wants respect.

221
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,779
She wants to be looked up to

222
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,020
and refuses to be a submissive wife.

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,299
That Mai family is quite a joke.

224
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,620
They have no money
but they've got a temper.

225
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,819
You talk too much.

226
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:06,904
Where are you going?

227
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:11,140
I'm teaming up with my friends.
They're waiting.

228
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,380
Jialiang, sit down.

229
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,659
You're thirty years old now.

230
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,579
Focus on your career and your job.

231
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,740
All you do is dating girls
and playing games, nothing serious.

232
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,020
Alright, it's rare for you
to come back for dinner.

233
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,819
Don't be mad.
The porridge has gone cold.

234
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:38,819
(Zhu Baoqiao)

235
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,539
(Honey, I've dealt with Chenghuan.
You can rest assured.)

236
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:45,880
What's wrong? Is it work?

237
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,059
It's nothing.

238
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,059
Where's my wine? Bring it over.

239
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,699
Don't drink at home.

240
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,500
You drink out there for work.

241
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,140
Have some porridge at home.

242
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,419
Wang.

243
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,019
I will have dinner at home from now on.

244
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,136
Okay.

245
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,259
Ms. Wang, get something my husband likes

246
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,459
for grocery tomorrow.

247
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,820
Okay, I got it.

248
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,219
Come on, dig in.

249
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:19,739
Jialiang, dig in.

250
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,979
Here you go, Jiali, your favorite.

251
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,419
Dig in. They are getting cold.

252
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,019
How come you're here?

253
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,659
I don't want to
have midnight snacks alone.

254
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,259
I figured you'd still be working.

255
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:18,300
Mr. Yao, you suddenly
offered me midnight snacks.

256
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,620
Just tell me what it is.

257
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,979
Don't meddle with
Xin Zhishan and Zhu Baoqiao.

258
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,100
How do you know?

259
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,659
You wouldn't tell me.
But I could investigate.

260
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,540
I'm not interested in their business.

261
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,900
Instead of the drama of my ex's family,

262
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm more interested
in my clients and my work

263
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,820
to lay a good foundation for promotion.

264
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:50,820
I don't care about
those people and things

265
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,659
that have nothing to do with me.

266
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,580
You are quite clear-headed about it.

267
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,580
But Mr. Yao, how come you're interested

268
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,499
in a gossip that doesn't concern you?

269
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,300
Are you up to something?

270
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,259
Like what?

271
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,900
I promised Grandma
to take good care of you.

272
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,259
I don't want to get scolded.

273
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,540
Come to me if you need anything.

274
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,820
Once bitten, twice shy.

275
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,259
I'm traumatized.

276
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,979
But if you really want to
impress your grandma,

277
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,060
why not sign a renewal contract?

278
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:43,219
Consider it a contribution

279
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,459
to my way out of misery.

280
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,100
Mai Chenghuan, you're really good at
taking advantage of the situation.

281
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,860
Once we're done,

282
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,340
I'll print a copy of the contract
for you to sign.

283
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,300
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

284
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,624
(Mom)

285
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:07,620
Mom.

286
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,659
Huan, come back now.
The water pipe broke. We're flooded!

287
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,936
Hello, Huan.

288
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't panic.

289
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,179
Mr. Liu, our water pipe broke at home.

290
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,820
Can I go home to fix it?

291
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,179
But I need that lawyer's letter tonight.

292
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,344
I can do it at home
and send it to you by tonight.

293
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,499
Okay.

294
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,584
Thank you.

295
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,340
What are you doing?

296
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,144
Pick up Zao's books.

297
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:50,179
The water is leaking.

298
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,860
What happened, Mom?

299
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,179
Huan, hurry.

300
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,739
The books. Zao's computer!

301
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,380
Don't go! I'll turn off the power
in case of electric leakage.

302
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,540
Electrocute me.

303
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,620
Come on. Don't move.

304
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:07,620
Hurry up. Save the books.

305
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,140
Did you call Zao? Get him here!

306
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,699
It's a mess here.
Why is he still at work?

307
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:16,140
I called him.
He's getting a mechanic here soon.

308
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,939
Your shoes. They're destroyed.

309
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,259
How much do they cost?

310
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,259
Mom, forget it.

311
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,620
How can you go to work?

312
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,780
Did you put away our important papers?

313
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,820
Yeah, I did.

314
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,864
That's good enough.

315
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,900
Huan, bring a larger piece of cloth.

316
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,699
- This pipe is cracked.
- Okay.

317
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:35,060
- I'll wrap it up.
- Let me.

318
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,152
Block it.

319
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:42,019
I told you to replace this drain.

320
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,939
You were so reluctant,
and now it's blocked.

321
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:48,419
And you're blaming me?
You're never at home.

322
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,620
Where were you guys?

323
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,219
There was nobody at home.

324
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,900
I had to get discounted groceries
from the market.

325
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,019
How would this happen
if someone was at home?

326
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,979
Mom, that's enough.
Let's deal with the problem first.

327
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,699
- Hurry.
- Will this do?

328
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,259
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

329
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,780
The books...

330
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,060
Dad, Mom, the repairman is here, hurry.

331
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,100
- Alright.
- It's inside.

332
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,780
How did you get flooded?

333
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,939
- This water pipe broke.
- Mao.

334
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,820
The sewer is also blocked.

335
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,739
I suggest you stay in a hotel tonight.

336
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,499
You can't stay here.

337
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,860
A hotel? It's too expensive.

338
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,459
- It's fine.
- No.

339
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,419
Sir, please help us drain the water

340
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,780
so that we can stay here.

341
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,060
Mom, he won't
be able to finish it today.

342
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,419
Let's stay in a hotel.

343
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,259
Don't worry about the money.

344
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,499
You'll spend more money

345
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:37,499
if you stay here and get sick.

346
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,100
Zao, stay here with the worker.

347
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,219
Mao and I will take
Dad and Mom to a hotel.

348
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,499
Okay, go ahead. I got this.

349
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,979
- We'll switch later.
- Okay.

350
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,540
Dad, let's pack up and go to a hotel.

351
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,699
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mom.

352
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:50,744
Sir, how's it going?

353
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,300
Look at you. You're soaked.

354
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,739
Did you pick up everything?

355
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,259
Yeah, I did.

356
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,060
Alright. Go tidy up first.

357
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,900
Mom, the medicine will be ready soon.

358
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,939
It's pricy here, isn't it?

359
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,060
I got it with points. It costs nothing.

360
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,340
You have a lot of points?

361
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,419
She has points.

362
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,060
Mrs. Mai, you're fully soaked
and you caught a cold.

363
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,488
You're sneezing too. Drink this, okay?

364
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:23,620
It's hot.

365
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,820
Hot. Let it cool for a bit first.

366
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Mom, you always say I don't wear socks.

367
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,900
Look at you sitting there without socks.

368
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,419
You'll catch a cold. Get under.

369
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,499
Okay.

370
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:35,979
Let's cover her.

371
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Tightly.

372
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,900
What kind of life is this?

373
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:45,259
Mom, don't worry. Zao just called me.

374
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,900
The repairman has cleared the drainage

375
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
and fixed the broken pipe.

376
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,459
We've lived there for so long.

377
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:54,019
The hardware gets old. It's alright.

378
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,900
Comfortable, so comfortable.

379
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,780
Yu, bathing at the hotel
is much cozier than at home.

380
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,140
Cozy, right, Dad?

381
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,560
No, I'm going home.

382
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,580
What are you doing?

383
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,219
I'll see if they fixed the pipes

384
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:11,459
but broke something else.
I'd better go and have a look.

385
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,739
Just stay and rest.

386
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:15,860
Don't go anywhere. Zao is there.

387
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,380
You'd only cause more trouble.

388
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,419
Exactly.

389
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:22,140
"Exactly"? Go away.
Why don't you check on it?

390
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,780
But Zao is there.

391
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,780
Yeah, right. If you're competent,

392
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,659
our life wouldn't be like this.

393
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:32,060
How am I not competent?

394
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:38,100
I married you. It means
I'm fully competent, right?

395
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
One person who's not competent

396
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,780
marries someone
who's even less competent.

397
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,419
How can they live well?

398
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,419
Here, Mr. Mai.
Have something hot to drink.

399
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:53,528
Thank you.

400
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:00,300
Huan, you see?

401
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,419
Life is like this without money.

402
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,620
Mom, don't say that.

403
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I think you and Dad lead a happy life.

404
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,100
Many people envy us.

405
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:16,259
I have good news. My lease renewal rate
is high this month.

406
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,540
I'll get a bigger bonus. Don't worry.

407
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,580
As long as we're together,

408
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,380
there's nothing we can't do.

409
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,699
Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Mai.

410
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:30,419
You have raised Huan and Zao so well.

411
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,860
It's time for them to take care of you.

412
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,699
Don't worry about anything tonight.

413
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,060
Just have a good sleep here.

414
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,699
Besides, you have me, right?

415
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:44,380
Alright, Huan, Mao, go back and rest.

416
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,100
I'll stay with your mom.

417
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,120
Who needs your company?

418
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:53,419
Alright, Mom,
have a good rest with Dad today.

419
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,060
I'll check on Zao to see
if he needs my help.

420
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,179
Don't stay up late.

421
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:01,219
Good night.

422
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:19,300
This flood ruined our house.

423
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,300
It also brought up all the grievances
my mom had for over 30 years.

424
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:25,900
My mom always complains about

425
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,300
our house being small and old.

426
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,939
But she's reluctant to stay in a hotel.

427
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:34,488
The older people are like that.

428
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,259
They're stingy with themselves
but generous with their children.

429
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,620
They just want a lifetime of peace.

430
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,336
It's my fault that I can't
provide them with a better life.

431
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,820
You've done well enough,
so don't blame it on yourself.

432
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:55,860
Tell me if you're short of money.
Don't burden yourself.

433
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,659
No need, I have money.

434
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,939
Let's visit Chengzao.

435
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,620
No need. You have to
open the shop early tomorrow.

436
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Go back and rest.

437
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,419
Can you manage on your own?

438
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,620
Of course. I really appreciate it.

439
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,820
I'll treat you to a fancy meal
once it's over.

440
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,856
Okay.

441
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,300
Huan, you have to get up early
for work tomorrow.

442
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,820
Go to the hotel and sleep.

443
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,939
Leave it to me.

444
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,459
As if you don't have to
get up early for work.

445
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,780
Don't act like a stranger.

446
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,019
We'll be done earlier
if we work on it together.

447
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,219
Let me see.

448
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,300
Your PC was soaked in water.
I doubt it can be fixed.

449
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,580
I'll buy you a new one.

450
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,259
Don't waste money on me.
I'll try to fix it first.

451
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:49,939
It's just that
I haven't backed up some data.

452
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,179
Now it's all ruined.

453
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,979
Zao, a PC is an essential tool for work.

454
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:05,659
You can't make do with it.

455
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,259
Moreover, you've been using this

456
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,820
since college.
It's time to get a new one.

457
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,939
We can't save money on that.

458
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,620
Alright, you're the best.

459
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,179
Then I shall comply. Thank you.

460
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:20,739
Where did you learn that?

461
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,780
Wait. When did you get scratched?

462
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Just now. It's nothing.

463
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,768
Stay put. Don't touch water.

464
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,400
- It may get infected.
- It's fine.

465
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,340
I'll get you a bandage. Don't move.

466
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,219
Huan, what are all these? Your toys?

467
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,699
How come this is still here?

468
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,140
These are not mine. They're all yours.

469
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,100
- Mine?
- Yeah.

470
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,699
How come I don't remember them?

471
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:07,259
You were at Grandma's
until you turned six.

472
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,540
Mom wanted to bring you back every year,

473
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,860
but she couldn't because of work.

474
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,140
So she bought you many toys

475
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,100
at the Town God Temple
during the Spring Festival,

476
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,019
hoping that you could play with them
when you came back.

477
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,784
I remember playing with this secretly.

478
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:27,820
She nagged me all night,

479
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,900
saying that
I wasn't allowed to touch it.

480
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,060
I don't even remember
that she bought these for me.

481
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,100
Of course not.
You never played with them.

482
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:47,224
You were so distant
when you just came home.

483
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,179
We asked if you wanted anything.
You always said no.

484
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,019
So Mom put them all away
because you might not like them.

485
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,140
I thought she had thrown them away.

486
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,100
But she kept them for you.

487
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,440
Here.

488
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:12,380
I was worried that
they'd send me back to the village,

489
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,820
so I didn't dare to ask for anything.

490
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,300
Zao, don't you think that the bandage
sometimes resembles Mom?

491
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,219
It's wrapped separately and unique.

492
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,100
Her love for us is also unique.

493
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,832
She tends to our wounds
when we are injured.

494
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,900
Of course, she may sound harsh

495
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:39,608
and she expresses her love
in an extreme way.

496
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,340
But her love for us is beyond doubt.

497
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:53,784
I thought that we were unlucky
to have water leakage.

498
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,064
But it actually made me
understand Mom better.

499
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,328
Take a good look.

500
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,140
Huan, your apartment was flooded.

501
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,136
And my ceiling was ruined.

502
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,160
Yeah.

503
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,380
You'll have to bear the repair cost.

504
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,900
I am truly sorry.

505
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,219
W-What are you talking about?

506
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:48,659
The developer installed the pipe.

507
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,419
Now it's broken.

508
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,820
Ask the developer for compensation.
What does it have to do with us?

509
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,780
Don't talk nonsense. My son is a lawyer.

510
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,096
- Mom.
- So you must be reasonable.

511
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:01,259
Other people's pipes didn't break.

512
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,820
It was your pipe that broke.

513
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,060
Look what happened to our house.

514
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,459
These books are my treasure.
They're soaked in water.

515
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,060
What should I do?

516
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,219
Stop making a fuss.

517
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:14,840
Or I'll call the police to resolve this.

518
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,896
- Mom.
- What did you say?

519
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,140
Dad, take Mom upstairs first.

520
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,232
- Let's go.
- Take her upstairs.

521
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:19,288
- Sir.
- What should I do?

522
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:20,739
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

523
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,499
Sorry, sir. I will take care of it.

524
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:26,300
The repairman is fixing our pipe now.

525
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,659
I'll ask them
to check your place as well.

526
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:32,659
I'll invite the aunties
from the community office

527
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,780
to help us resolve this matter later.

528
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,019
What do you think?

529
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,780
Alright, you're a good girl.

530
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,499
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

531
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,459
I've roughly calculated the cost
of redoing the floor drain,

532
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,939
laying the pipes and the waterproofing.

533
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,580
The longtang structures are all wooden

534
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,200
which requires
termite-resistant materials.

535
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,900
It's about 100,000 yuan.

536
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,300
What? 100,000 yuan?

537
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,179
Be careful.

538
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,620
It's just the floor
and the wall for a tiny flat.

539
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,499
100,000 yuan?

540
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,259
Listen, my daughter manages a hotel.

541
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:20,179
She deals with maintenance workers.

542
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,979
- Be honest, okay?
- Come on, ma'am.

543
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:25,459
How long will it take if we want

544
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:27,060
a thorough renovation?

545
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,820
This is basically a thorough renovation.

546
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,792
At least one or two months.

547
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,060
One or two months? So long?

548
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,860
Thank you, sir.
We will think about it and contact you.

549
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,340
- Okay, stay in touch.
- Thank you.

550
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,368
Goodbye.

551
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:47,459
It's a tiny flat. He surely wants to
drag it out to get more money.

552
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,739
Don't be fooled.

553
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:53,060
Mom, our apartment is quite old.

554
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,939
I'd love to take this opportunity
to renovate it

555
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:58,979
and get some new home appliances.

556
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,820
I've wanted to buy you
a dishwasher for a long time.

557
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,580
A dishwasher? How big is it?

558
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,300
Will it even fit in the kitchen?

559
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,660
Besides, is it that easy to make money?

560
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,139
There are cheaper ones. We can choose.

561
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,340
Also, we can get
several renovation teams,

562
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,300
review their plans,
and select the most economical one.

563
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,380
I'll rent a house for a short term.

564
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,539
We can move there temporarily.

565
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:25,848
Rent a house?

566
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm not going. Why bother?

567
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,139
Your dad said this place
would be demolished.

568
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,139
What if it gets demolished

569
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,139
once it's renovated?
Isn't it a waste of money?

570
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,780
Your mom has a point.
Let's hang in there.

571
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,099
Besides, we will buy
a new house, decorate it,

572
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:45,080
and furnish it after the demolition.
It's a lot of money.

573
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,104
Yeah.

574
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,340
I know, Dad.

575
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,579
But the problem is that
our place just got flooded yesterday.

576
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:54,619
He said the water pipes
needed inspection,

577
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,180
the floors needed renovation
and the wires had aged.

578
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,900
How can we live like that?

579
00:35:00,939 --> 00:35:02,979
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

580
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,499
It's better to make do
than to waste money.

581
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,380
Huan.

582
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,099
You know your mom.

583
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,539
I think we should try to hang in there.

584
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:22,380
You were busy all night.
Aren't you going to work today?

585
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,579
I took a few hours off.

586
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,099
Get going. I'll handle the rest.

587
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,180
Okay, I'll come back
to help you after work.

588
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,139
- Alright.
- I'm off, Dad.

589
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,939
I'm off, Mom.

590
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,256
Morning.

591
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:45,624
Morning.

592
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,300
Is everything okay at home?

593
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,059
It's just fine. Don't worry.

594
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:54,232
Water leakage in old houses
is hard to deal with.

595
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:57,619
You can accommodate your parents here.

596
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,059
I can offer you the lowest price.

597
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,979
Mr. Yao, we can't afford it
even if it's 50% off.

598
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm just trying to help.

599
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,579
Thanks. I'll ask for your help
if we're desperate.

600
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,760
I'm off to work.

601
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,539
Sir, here's the weekly report.

602
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:40,088
He Dong, do our engineers
take external renovation orders?

603
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,019
Theoretically, it's not allowed.

604
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:47,340
But we have
long-term engineering partners.

605
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,939
Why? Want to renovate your place?

606
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,139
Mai Chenghuan's house got flooded.

607
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,619
I see. I'll make a few calls

608
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,340
and you can take the team there.

609
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,059
Neither of us can do that.
Let Sherry do it.

610
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,780
Do as Mai Chenghuan requests.

611
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,939
Offer the lowest price
so that she can afford it.

612
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,220
Sir, honestly, I think you should just

613
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,059
give her a red envelope.

614
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:19,740
I've never seen you
beating around the bush with a girl.

615
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,700
She's stubborn and won't accept help.
She may turn me down.

616
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,900
But you can't
win over her heart like this.

617
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,619
Your methods are outdated.

618
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,459
I'm not trying to win her over.
I'm looking after my subordinate.

619
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,539
Mr. Yao, why don't you look after me?

620
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:37,860
Get back to work.

621
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:56,139
Mai Chengzao, why haven't you
sent me the lawyer's letter?

622
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,059
I sent it to the group chat last night

623
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,579
and sent you a copy separately.

624
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,499
The client's demands have changed.

625
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:05,740
No one notified me.

626
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,419
We had a meeting late at night.
Did you lose your memory?

627
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:13,272
Something happened at home last night.

628
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,459
I remember now.
The whole company worked overtime.

629
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,099
But you slipped away
before eight o'clock.

630
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,392
Do you have any work ethics?

631
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,820
Mr. Liu, I asked for leave yesterday,
and you agreed.

632
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,860
When did I agree?

633
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,900
Did any of you hear me
grant him leave? Did you?

634
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,459
Mai Chengzao, let me tell you.

635
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:47,059
As a lawyer,
you have to speak with evidence.

636
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:51,180
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry. This is my fault.

637
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,860
Could you please tell me
the demands so I can revise it?

638
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,459
What's there to revise?
How do you work with that attitude?

639
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,619
Wang, work on it.

640
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,099
Okay, I'm on it.

641
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,660
Mr. Liu, the report
on the copyright case...

642
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,059
No, no, I don't trust you anymore.

643
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:08,660
Just sit here from now on

644
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,380
and watch how everyone works, okay?

645
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:17,499
Mr. Liu, wait.

646
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,552
(Liu Yuquan)

647
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,059
Mr. Yang from Maohe
has asked to see you many times.

648
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:44,579
Should I arrange a meeting with him
before the reception?

649
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,696
No need, let him wait.
It will allow me to raise the price.

650
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,539
Alright, no problem.

651
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:59,380
Mr. Luo, Mr. Liu has some
misunderstandings about me.

652
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,660
He's suspended all my work.

653
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,939
I'd like to transfer to another group.

654
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:09,340
You want a transfer? Do you know
how many cases Mr. Liu has?

655
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,380
Others are desperate
to get into his group.

656
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,139
Chengzao, I don't have time
to teach you.

657
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,780
To put it bluntly,

658
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,019
if it weren't for your connection
to the Xin family,

659
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,860
do you think you could have
joined Mr. Liu's group?

660
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:34,040
Okay, then please ask Mr. Liu

661
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,139
to settle all my wages
and allowances for the completed case.

662
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,336
Liu told me that
you made up a ridiculous excuse

663
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,780
about your house being flooded
to avoid working overtime.

664
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,900
You have the nerve to ask for payment?

665
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,900
We both know
who is right and who is wrong.

666
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:00,459
Everyone out there

667
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,380
is trying their best to stay.

668
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,059
That's why no one steps forward
to tell the truth.

669
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,939
Fangyuan is a law firm.
Justice lies in the heart of the people.

670
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:11,579
This is the principle of law.

671
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,539
Don't think you can treat everyone
like a fool because you're the boss.

672
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,059
Chengzao.

673
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,820
Chengzao, wait.

674
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:44,920
Tian Feng.

675
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,019
They've gone too far.

676
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,656
Sorry, I didn't speak up for you.

677
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,539
It's okay, Tian Feng. I chose to quit.

678
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,900
Thank you for looking after me.

679
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,700
I didn't do much. Do you have any plans?

680
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,939
I'll look for another job.

681
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,740
It won't be easy because
the campus recruitment period is over.

682
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,579
I will keep an eye out for you.

683
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,340
Thank you. I will figure something out.

684
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,499
Alright then,
you'd better get back to work.

685
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm fine. Don't worry.

686
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,900
Don't lose heart. Keep it up.
