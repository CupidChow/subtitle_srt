=Episode 25=

3
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,930
Stay here and calm down.

4
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,331
Such a temper at such a young age.

5
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,171
Leave any issues to us, the police.

6
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,531
I can't calm down even a bit.

7
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,624
Officer, this fraudster is outrageous.

8
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,570
He exploited my sympathy to commit fraud

9
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,691
and even had the audacity to extort me.

10
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:09,816
I'd have been deceived
had I not been cautious.

11
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,880
People like him
deserve to be taught a harsh lesson.

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,010
Sit down.

13
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,251
Officer, my head still hurts.

14
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,131
I'm a bit dizzy.
It could be a concussion.

15
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,680
I need to go for a check-up.

16
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,290
Sure. I'll send you to the hospital
to rid the people of harm.

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,411
After all, I'm loaded.

18
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,496
Zhang Ziyu.

19
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,080
Yao Zhiming.

20
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,971
Apply this to reduce the swelling.
Use medication when you get back.

21
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,440
That punch didn't land well.
So frustrating.

22
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,570
All right, isn't it enough
that you've swollen his face?

23
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,251
You care about me so much.

24
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,768
I thought you were going to lecture me.

25
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,251
I'd lecture you,
but there's a proper time for that.

26
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:08,450
Yao Zhiming,
don't think of me as a child.

27
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,251
I'm already in college.

28
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:12,931
What should I think of you as?

29
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:20,091
Of course, as a charming,
elegant, and mature woman.

30
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,360
What a bummer.

31
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,304
Where is she?

32
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,691
I called her. She's still in a meeting,
so I came over first.

33
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,691
Okay, I see.

34
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,050
So I'll go with you.

35
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,330
I was your guardian abroad.

36
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,770
But we're back in China now.
Go home and get some rest.

37
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,091
Where should I go?

38
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,850
Yao Zhiming, come back here.

39
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,010
What's the point of that?

40
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,651
The occupancy rate is still low.

41
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:04,770
The Marketing and Sales Department
is starting to work with

42
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,371
other housing platforms

43
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,691
and has customized
promotional strategies

44
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,131
to increase the occupancy rate.

45
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,730
What about the project?
Won't you consult with that secretary?

46
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,691
I've had a meeting with his secretary

47
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,890
about these issues.

48
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,330
Wang, what do you say?

49
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,330
We're still awaiting feedback regarding

50
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,691
what we need support with.

51
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,491
Fine. Fire them if it doesn't work.

52
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,530
In fact, their team

53
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,371
didn't do so well in the past year.

54
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,931
- Follow up on it.
- Okay.

55
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,080
What did his secretary say?

56
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:36,890
What is the feedback?

57
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,371
I've conveyed your thoughts.

58
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,410
What do you think we should do?

59
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,464
What...

60
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:44,371
Ms. Zhang...

61
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,811
Alright. Let's continue tomorrow.

62
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,832
Okay, Ms. Zhang.

63
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,251
It's not a holiday. Why are you back?

64
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,090
Yao Zhiming has come back.

65
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,570
I'm bored alone out there.
So I've decided to drop out.

66
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,811
What do you mean?

67
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,931
How can you quit?

68
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,530
What are you going to do?
You're only twenty years old.

69
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,090
I've already dropped out.

70
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,584
Right now,
I'm a well-known travel blogger

71
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,931

Come on, dig in.

108
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,290
Yeah, this one is correct.

109
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,650
Carry it out accordingly.

110
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,632
Mom, leave it there. I'll eat later.

111
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,211
It'll affect your appetite if you work

It's okay. We'll talk once I get there.

115
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,091

117
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,331
Hurry up and dig in.

118
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,410
Weren't you always
longing for the hometown dishes?

119
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,410
But you're not reading
the Anhui Cuisine Cookbook I bought.

120
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,491
You usually have Shanghainese cuisine.

121
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,251
We only have stinky mandarin fish
and a few other dishes.

122
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,131
What's there to learn?

123
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,930
But I like them.
I'll have them if you make them.

124
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,050
Besides, when we're not home,

125
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,451
you can cook for yourself and Dad.

126
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:29,010
If I cook those,
you must eat at home more often.

127
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,288
I don't have much appetite

128
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,571
when I eat alone at home.
It doesn't matter what I eat.

129
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,410
Mom, why not utilize
your cooking skills?

130
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,731
I'll set up
a short video account for you.

131
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,290
You'll be a middle-aged chef vlogger.
How about that?

132
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,491
Short videos?
I don't know how to do that.

133
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,491
It's okay. I'll sign you up
for the senior university.

134
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,890
There are lots of courses.
It's quite fun.

135
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,211
Check it out. You might be interested.

136
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:02,571
Senior university? I can't do it.

137
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,091
You can. Just check it out.

138
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,410
Okay, I'll do as you say.

139
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,690
Great. Fantastic. Fabulous.

140
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,851
Huan, well...

141
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,690
Mrs. Zhou sent me
a few photos some days ago.

142
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,290
Some of these young men
look very promising.

143
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,451
Will you take a look?

144
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,290
Check them out. Look.

145
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,890
Especially this one.
Look, he's good-looking.

146
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,091
Nice family background.

147
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:39,451
And he has a good character.

148
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:42,611
Okay, Mom. I have to go to work.

149
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,690
Everyone's waiting. I'm done here.

150
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,091
Wait, just take a look.

151
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm running late, Mom.

152
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:49,656
Huan, going to work?

153
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:50,680
Yes, Dad. Bye.

154
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,491
She didn't eat?

155
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:02,211
She's back, but her mind is not here.

156
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,451
She's the owner of a big hotel now

157
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,690
with greater responsibilities.

158
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,571
Yao Zhiming is also out early
and back late every day, isn't he?

159
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,672
Mai, why don't you
drive our daughter around?

160
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:20,890
Me?

161
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,371
Yeah, I feel more at ease
if you're by her side.

162
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,770
Yu, are you trying to make me

163
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,851
spy on our daughter?

164
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,930
How could you think that?

165
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,770
You're being paranoid.

166
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,731
Where's my breakfast?

167
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,690
Here. She didn't eat hers. Have it.

168
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,050
Fine, I'll have it.

169
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,530
Yeah, use your wrist. Draw W and M.

170
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,131
W, M, W, M, W.

171
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,611
Go back and forth.

172
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,690
W, M, W, M.

173
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,731

176
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,131
Yu, what are you doing?

177
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,890
I'm learning tea ceremony.

178
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,024
M, W.

179
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,770
It seems you've learned a lot

180
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,770
from the senior university
that Huan signed you up for.

181
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,930
It's quite enriching.

182
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,131
They teach tea ceremony, baking,

183
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,440
(and editing.
Short video editing. It's great.)

184
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,930
(Right, I will film a video)

185
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,851
(and edit it to show you.)

186
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,336
I could learn
anything she signed me up for

187
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,992
except rock climbing.

188
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,131
Rock climbing?

189
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,571
Yeah, rock climbing.

190
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,571
Forget it, I'll pass.

191
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,810
You forgot the rope.

192
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:26,371
Anyway, our daughter
cares so much about you.

193
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,890
I don't get to learn
even if I want to. Keep it up.

194
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,410
Are you jealous?
Of course, I'll keep it up.

195
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,050
I will do my best.

196
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,290
I will show Huan
my progress and improvement.

197
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,050
She's doing quite well.
I have to keep up the pace.

198
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,690
Then no one would say

199
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,851
that I'm dragging her down.
That would be embarrassing.

200
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,971
Is dinner ready? What's for dinner?

201
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,131
Don't you see I'm busy?
Cook for yourself.

202
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,690
There are instant noodles. Go ahead.

203
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,008
Sure, dinner's on me. Keep practicing.

204
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,091
W... And what?

205
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,290
W... And...

206
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,656
W... Whatever.

207
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,152
Mr. Mai.

208
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,331
Hello, Mr. Yao.

209
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,290
Keep it down.
Your auntie is already asleep.

210
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,971
Huan signed her up
for a senior university.

211
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,410
She comes back home
exhausted every time.

212
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,731
That's perfect.
I brought you something nice.

213
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,810
What is it?

214
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,571
This is really nice.

215
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,530
You're tending
to the flowers at this hour?

216
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,930
You see, someone has to tidy up

217
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,248
this huge garden, right?

218
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,890
Besides, I've got
nothing else to do after work.

219
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,200
I might as well look over the flowers.

220
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:05,810
It uplifts our mood to see nice flowers.

221
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:10,890
Mr. Mai, you are so patient.

222
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,456
And you are able to keep Ms. Liu happy.

223
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,888
Can you teach me a few tricks?

224
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,010
You're seeing someone?

225
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:23,331
Better safe than sorry.

226
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:28,211
When it comes to pampering the wife,
you've asked the right person.

227
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,131
I truly have my ways in this regard.

228
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:34,611
Whatever sustains a marriage

229
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,200
is not a matter of one day or two.

230
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,320
It's about decades of persistence.

231
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:47,211
Take these flowers
and plants for example,

232
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:50,731
you must take great care of them.

233
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,131
I bring them out
to the sun every morning

234
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:59,611
and ask your auntie
to bring them back in at noon.

235
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:01,571
They must be sunned.

236
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,530
But they can't be exposed
to the sun for too long.

237
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,224
So, no matter what you do,

238
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:11,544
put your heart into it
and that's the key.

239
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,211
Yeah.

240
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:16,890
Look, once you take good care of them,

241
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,731
they will reward you

242
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:24,010
by blooming to the full.

243
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,410
Mr. Yao, I must thank you for something.

244
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,864
You went through a lot of trouble

245
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,331
to reconcile Huan with Wanyu. Thank you.

246
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,131
Here.

247
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,808
Take this pot of flowers.

248
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,331
It's a token of appreciation.

249
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:47,371
Thank you, Mr. Mai.

250
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:50,890
All you need to do is
water it regularly.

251
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,056
Okay.

252
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,771
She locked the door.

253
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,611
Sis.

254
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:47,250
Open up. We are right at the entrance.

255
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:51,730
Alright, coming. Just a second.

256
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:56,890
Why didn't you tell me you'd come?

257
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,571
I'd tell Mai to pick you up.

258
00:17:58,571 --> 00:17:59,970
Qiu is on summer break.

259
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,011
His dad and Fang
made some time to come over.

260
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,170
Two hours by high-speed train.
It's just a nap away.

261
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,331
Come on in.

262
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:09,490
Shoes off?

263
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,930
- No need.
- It's fine.

264
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,331
It's okay. I will clean up.

265
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:18,851
Take a seat. I'll make some tea for you.

266
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:19,864
Alright.

267
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,490
It's so nice.

268
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,970
Be careful, Qiu.

269
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,410
Here, have some tea.

270
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,131
You don't have to do this.

271
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,131
It's okay.

272
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:39,170
This is the good tea Huan got me.

273
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,184
Really?

274
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,371
- Try it.
- Nice tea.

275
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,571
It has a fragrance.

276
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,656
Smells good, right?

277
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,450
It's nice.

278
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,851
Have some more.

279
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,170
- Yu.
- Nice tea.

280
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,131
You used to live
in a small house in the longtang.

281
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:58,571
But you've moved into
such a villa in no time.

282
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,970
And you used to worry
that she wasn't doing well.

283
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,210
I worry about my little sister, okay?

284
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,930
Jie, where is your wife?

285
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:14,410
They had a quarrel.

286
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,291
Why did you blurt it all out?

287
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,490
What's the big deal?
She's my little sister.

288
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,890
- It's okay.
- We're family.

289
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,696
Your big sister can't keep a secret.

290
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,851
It's fine.

291
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,970
Keep an eye on Qiu.
He may break something.

292
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,144
- Qiu.
- Qiu.

293
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,210
It's okay, come here, Qiu.

294
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,410
Sit here with Grandma.

295
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,970
Let Grandma take you
to a big restaurant later, okay?

296
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:38,776
Okay.

297
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:39,890
Be good.

298
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:43,490
I heard that Chenghuan
took over a huge hotel.

299
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,424
She's just a young lady.
Can she manage it?

300
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:51,291
Of course. Kids these days
are really smart. They learn fast.

301
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,690
She's doing quite well.

302
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,571
Let's have lunch at her hotel.

303
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,690
- Alright.
- Okay.

304
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,771
- Okay.
- Have some tea.

305
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,611
What a magnificent place.

306
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:05,730
Looks good, huh?

307
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,730
So pretty.

308
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,170
It's over 100 years old.

309
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,131
Look at these stairs,
all made of solid wood.

310
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,970
Yeah, it's picturesqueness.
This is amazing.

311
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,730
There are over 100 staff members.

312
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,650
Huan is overwhelmed.

313
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,680
Cui.

314
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,811
Ms. Liu.

315
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:25,571
Hello, please get two rooms
for my sister and brother-in-law.

316
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:26,648
Nice to meet you.

317
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,752
Shall we get a suite?

318
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,851
With two bedrooms and a living room.

319
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,170
No problem. This way please.

320
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,192
Okay.

321
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:38,232
A luxury suite.

322
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,250
Alright.

323
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,051
Give us something
with the best view of the lawn.

324
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,051
Rest assured, the view is excellent.

325
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,611
The deposit would be 5,000 yuan.

326
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,371
Can we forego the deposit?

327
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,890
And the room charge...

328
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:04,811
Ms. Liu, we have a reservation system.
Everything must be recorded.

329
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,571
I can't make a reservation
for you privately.

330
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,256
It's our hotel. I'll tell Huan...

331
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,490
Yu, is it too much trouble?

332
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,450
Actually, a small room will do.

333
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,291
- We'll manage.
- It's no trouble.

334
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,051
Come on, bigger rooms are cozier, right?

335
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,051
We're already in a fancy hotel,
aren't we?

336
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,051
Exactly, it's no big deal.
We own the hotel.

337
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,890
Book the room.
I'll talk to Huan about it later.

338
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,730
It's not like we can't pay.

339
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,168
Ms. Liu, it's not up to me.

340
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:39,051
How about I get Miss Mai here?

to inform everyone about the raise.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

Don't say that.
It's a recognition of your hard work.

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,210
I believe it can bring us
high-quality customers.

357
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,490
This is a good approach.

358
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,811
We can focus on
our featured wedding services.

359
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:33,690
We can establish it as our core service

360
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,851
so that people think of Xing'anli

361
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:40,690
whenever they decide to host
a Shanghai-style wedding. Alright.

362
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,576
Come in.

363
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,680
Miss Mai.

364
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,600
Something came up.

365
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,571
Go ahead. I'll wait for your proposal.

366
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,091
We'll revise it together next week.

367
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:54,104
Alright.

368
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:58,210
What's wrong, Mr. Cui?

369
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,690
There are some relatives
of yours in the lobby.

370
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,930
Your mom won't pay the deposit.

371
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,450
I don't mean to embarrass them.

372
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,728
But if every relative
tries to be special,

373
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,450
we'll have to break all our rules.

374
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,170
Huan, I don't mean to
make things difficult for you.

375
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,571
Just put on a show. I will pay.

376
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:23,011
Mom, you could have told me

377
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,531
and let me arrange it.

378
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:27,650
Rest assured.
Auntie has been so kind to me.

379
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,410
I'll foot the bill
for all their expenses this time.

380
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,051
- Auntie.
- Huan.

381
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:37,304
Uncle, Cousin, I didn't know you came.

382
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:39,032
Say hi to Auntie.

383
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:40,051
Hello, Auntie.

384
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,250
Dou.

385
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,424
Qiu.

386
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,970
What's wrong with me?
Qiu has grown up. So cute.

387
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,170
Huan, you must be busy.
Did we cause you trouble?

388
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,650
Not at all, Auntie.

389
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,450
You haven't checked in, right?

390
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,410
I'll get you a room first.

391
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,851
Okay.

392
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:58,970
Our local dishes at Xing'anli are great.

393
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,611
Have you eaten?
Would you like to eat first?

394
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:02,851
- Okay.
- Alright.

395
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,410
Let's have food first.

396
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,331
- Mom, take them inside.
- Okay.

397
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,450
Leave it here, Uncle.

398
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,531
Alright.

399
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,930
We'll take care of it.

400
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,490
Let's have something tasty, Qiu.

401
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,811
Get these to their room.

402
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:15,928
Okay.

403
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,531
Mr. Cui, I know your concerns.

404
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:25,011
To rank among
the top ten characteristic hotels,

405
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,450
standardized management is imperative.

406
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,650
I'll be the role model.

407
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,291
All their expenses
will be charged to my account.

408
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:34,840
Alright.

409
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:42,210
Sir, there's been quite a fuss
in Xing'anli recently.

410
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,571
Ms. Zhang has been
working from home these days.

411
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,611
She's been making reports
to the headquarters.

412
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:53,970
What's that attitude?

413
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,051
I don't care.
If anything goes wrong, it's on you.

414
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,064
Yao Zhiming.

415
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,450
Why haven't you contacted me?

416
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,730
Zhang Ziyu, I'm at work.

417
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,291
Isn't it a lunch break now?

418
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,450
He Dong. Have Mr. Mai send her back.

419
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,011
We must take good care of Miss Zhang.

420
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:34,650
Did you hear that, Yao Zhiming?

421
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,690
I've come all this way.
You have to treat me to a meal.

422
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,811
My takeout has arrived. I'll get it.

423
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:50,930
What do you want to have?

424
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:55,250
I'll have whatever you like.

425
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,851
That's it?

426
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:08,504
That's it. Stir-fried shrimp.
Sweet and sour ribs.

427
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:11,051
Three shrimp noodles.
Authentic local dishes.

428
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:16,091
This is my first meal back in Shanghai.

429
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,450
You're brushing me off with casual food
instead of a fancy meal.

430
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,490
Doesn't it hurt your conscience?

431
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,640
No, it doesn't.

432
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,531
It's quite good.

433
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,051
Your mom says you dropped out.
What's going on?

434
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,210
It's a temporary absence.

435
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,872
She doesn't know where I study.
I'm just messing with her.

436
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,450
Don't gamble with your life
just to upset your mom.

437
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,531
I didn't. I know what I want very well.

438
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,811
Mind the boundaries.

439
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,291
Yao Zhiming, you've changed.

440
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,811
Didn't we share food when we were kids?

441
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,410
How old were you?
And how old are you now?

442
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,170
We need boundaries.

443
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,331
There's one way to keep things the same.

444
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,131
Zhiming, be my boyfriend.

445
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,851
Look, after all these years,

446
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,811
I don't even remember
what my dad looks like.

447
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,571
My mom is never there.

448
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,771
Only you have kept me company.

449
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,811
You're there to share my success

450
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,851
and handle my mistakes.

451
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,531
I can't find

452
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:09,331
another person
who is so good to me in this world.

453
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:14,930
Ziyu, I've said that we are family.

454
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,640
The only possible relationship
between us is that of siblings.

455
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,851
It's okay. I've imagined it
countless times in my mind

456
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:46,210
before I say it out loud.

457
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,512
I thought you'd say
kids like me don't know love.

458
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,571
But judging from what you just said,

459
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,970
you didn't talk down to me
like I was a child.

460
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,131
Nor did you deny
or disregard my affections.

461
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:00,571
I'm not frustrated at all.

462
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,091
On the contrary, I'm surprised.

463
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,571
I like you even more now.

464
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,811
That's enough. Dig in.
Go home after this.

465
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,051
Okay, I'll go to your place.

466
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,170
No, my house is crowded right now.

467
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,170
Crowded? What do you mean?

468
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,851
(The black tea is nice.)

469
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:26,210
- Thanks.
- Here, Zhihong.

470
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,960
- Five-star quality.
- Five-star quality.

471
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:31,131
Sweet and sour fish.
Steamed shrimp with scallion oil.

472
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:32,890
Get your specialty dishes.

473
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,890
I got them all.

474
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,131
Sis, Zhihong.

475
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:36,490
Hello, Mai.

476
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,450
Here he comes. You finally made it.

477
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,170
- It's been years.
- Yeah.

478
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,930
We must have a few drinks today.

479
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,992
Yeah.

480
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,928
Yeah, let's have Moutai.

481
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,890
- Moutai?
- Okay.

482
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,690
No need. I don't want Moutai.

483
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,490
Let's have yellow wine.
It's good for blood circulation.

484
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,410
No, Fang has gout.

485
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,011
He can't drink anything.

486
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,170
Why are you so worried?

487
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,210
Chenghuan can afford
such a pricy liquor now.

488
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,051
Let your uncle bask in your glory, too.

489
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,690
It's a happy day.

490
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,440
Have a few drinks with my dad.

491
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,331
- Bring a Moutai.
- Okay.

492
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:13,880
My sister is frugal with herself
but very generous with her family.

493
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:19,051
Zao has become so mature.
He's speaking up for his sister.

494
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,970
Fang Jie is also mature.
Look how well they grew up.

495
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,136
They grew up like real brothers.

496
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:29,450
Yeah, they've both grown up.

497
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,170
Yu, how time flies.

498
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,571
I chased Zao all over the street
for stealing money back then.

499
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,611
In the blink of an eye...

500
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:43,450
Zao stole money? W-What happened?

501
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,811
Yu, they were kids.

502
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:50,531
They were just naughty.
It was a misunderstanding.

503
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,250
Zao has always been a good kid.

504
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,210
He would hand over the coins
he found on the street to the police.

505
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,131
- Uncle must have remembered it wrong.
- You're right.

506
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,851
Huan, you have no idea.

507
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,170
Zao was quite something
when he was little.

508
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,088
I took the blame for many things he did.

509
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,410
Let me tell you everything
during the meal.

510
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:17,851
Have some tea.

511
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:22,371
Enjoy the meal.

512
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:25,210
I have a meeting coming up.
I have to go now.

513
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,410
Have something first.

514
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,771
It's alright.

515
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:28,771
You're leaving?

516
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:30,210
He's busy.

517
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,291
I will see him out.

518
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,450
Have some water.

519
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,811
Zao.

520
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,496
Tell me. Was Fang Jie bullying you

521
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:43,416
when you were in the hometown?

522
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:46,968
It wasn't exactly bullying.

523
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,040
It's just that he stole Uncle's money
and made me take the blame.

524
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,401
Uncle gave me a beating.

525
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:54,840
And that doesn't count as bullying?

526
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,800
You didn't steal the money.
Why did you admit to it?

527
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:01,240
I didn't know before.

528
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,174
Now we must make it clear.

529
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,161
Or our parents will believe it.

530
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,878
Huan, listen. I wasn't bullied.

531
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Fang Jie wanted to bully me.

532
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,961
But I judo-threw him
straight to the hospital.

533
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:14,054
He deserved it.

534
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:18,040
I didn't tell you because I was worried.

535
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,481
You and our mom are skilled fighters.

536
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,721
There would be trouble
if you rushed over

537
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,641
to beat him up.

538
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,641
Alright, Huan, I'm fine. Don't worry.

539
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:30,441
Keep them company.

540
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I'll have Mr. Cui
pack something for you.

541
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,481
Have it on the way.

542
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:36,600
No need. I have to go.

543
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,720
Be careful.

544
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,040
Hello, this way please.

545
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,952
Chenghuan.

546
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:48,840
It's okay now. Thank you.

547
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,224
Hello, are you looking for me?

548
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,441
You might not remember me.

549
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:57,240
I helped you with your homework
when you visited your hometown.

550
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:06,360
My second uncle, Fang Zhihong,
is your uncle. I'm Fang Da.

551
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,080
What a coincidence.
Nice to meet you. You're here...

552
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,120
Uncle sent me a message
this morning but I didn't see it

553
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
until I got off work.

554
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,840
- It's okay.
- So I'm late.

555
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,681
They're inside.
Let me take you in, this way.

556
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,641
Everyone, meet Fang Da,

557
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:25,040
my older brother's child.

558
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,840
Yeah, Huan. Da runs
a wedding planning company in Shanghai.

559
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,921
You should talk.

560
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,800
You might be able to help each other.

561
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,761
Yeah. Here's my business card.

562
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:37,600
Da...?

563
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,641
(Huixue Wedding Planning)
Auntie, do you remember that

564
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,401
you took Chenghuan home

565
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,800
and my mom left me
at Uncle Zhihong's home, too?

566
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,880
You cooked for me the entire summer.

567
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,800
That was you?

568
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,040
Yeah.

569
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,161
- Da.
- I remember him.

570
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,961
He's grown up so much.
Look how handsome he is.

571
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:57,040
Really, time flies.

572
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,408
You are from Huixue Wedding Planning.

573
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,464
Yeah.

574
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:03,721
Have you bid on our project?

575
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,472
Yeah, actually, I knew that
you were the boss of Xing'anli.

576
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,480
I was quite surprised.

577
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,521
But I found it inappropriate
to reveal our tie right away.

578
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,521
It would be like cheating.

579
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,400
So I figured I'd better focus on my job

580
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
and wait for your response.

581
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,681
It's okay.
You don't have to be so cautious.

582
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:25,440
After all, business
is about performance.

583
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,561
Yeah, let's talk more
when you're available.

584
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,561
I'd love to work with you one day.

585
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:32,761
No problem.

586
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,521
Alright, that's enough.

587
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:37,121
You don't get married
and talk only about work.

588
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,681
Fang Da is a guy. So it's fine.

589
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,081
But Chenghuan is a girl.

590
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:44,761
Getting married and having children
is the proper thing to do.

591
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:48,041
Huan just took over such a big hotel.

592
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,280
There's a lot of pressure.
Marriage can wait.

593
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,721
Says who? Zhihong is quite right.

594
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:55,880
Times are different now.

595
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,360
For girls, work is important
but so is life, right?

596
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,161
Chenghuan is almost thirty, right?

597
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,840
And she's still single.

598
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,681
She's too busy for a relationship.

599
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:13,761
Yu, Huan doesn't have time, but you do.

600
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,721
Quit the senior university.

601
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:17,641
Go to the matchmaking corner in the park

602
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,800
and look for some
potential matches for Huan.

603
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,241
You know, that's how
I found my daughter-in-law.

604
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,601
Look how old Qiu is.

605
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,721
I've done that.

606
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,721
I showed her so many photos.

607
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:37,280
But she just didn't like anyone.
She has high standards.

608
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:41,241
Fang Da is still single, right?

609
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
Yeah.

610
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:54,480
Uncle, Auntie,
the times have changed now.

611
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,681
A woman can
focus on her family if she wants to.

612
00:35:57,681 --> 00:36:00,681
But she can also focus on work.

613
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:03,440
Right now, I want to focus on my work.

614
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,000
So, don't worry about me.

615
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,521
Uncle, Auntie, I've been working
at the wedding company

616
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:10,681
for a long time.

617
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,720
I've seen too many couples
splitting up right after the wedding.

618
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,960
We should leave it to fate

619
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,440
and just be happy.

620
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,320
Da, what you're saying
is wrong. I disagree.

621
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,241
One must get married, right?

622
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:26,521
There's a right age for everything.

623
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,360
You can only be happy
with a good job and a nice family.

624
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,440
A happy marriage life helps you

625
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,761
- focus on work, right?
- Right.

626
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:36,480
Look at how happy I am with my husband.

627
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,920
We're happy.

628
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,601
That makes our children happy, right?

629
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,664
Yeah.

630
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:44,681
Chenghuan, your mom is right.

631
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:47,440
The most important thing for a girl

632
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,880
is her family, isn't it?

633
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:54,480
We've seen more of everything
than you've had hot dinners.

634
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,081
We know what's best for you.

635
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,552
Yeah.

636
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:02,161
- Drink.
- Uncles, Aunties.

637
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,721
Let me toast

638
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:07,880
to our joyful reunion today

639
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,761
and to the well-being

640
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,681
and happy future of our big family.

641
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:14,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

642
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,576
Cheers.

643
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,264
- Good wine.
- Qiu, have you eaten enough?

644
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:19,320
Yeah.

645
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,480
Let's go back to the room.

646
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,681
- Fang Da.
- Be careful.

647
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:27,041
When will you invite us for a meal?
Mai should come too.

648
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,840
I'll definitely show you hospitality.

649
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,800
Fang Da is such a good kid.

650
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,480
And you are in the same line of work.

651
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Who knows. You might work together.

652
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:39,161
I see, Mom. You don't have to worry.

653
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:40,761
I'm too busy with work

654
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,081
to take everyone out for fun.

655
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,440
Take them everywhere and use my card.

656
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:50,880
Look, Huan wants you
to have a great time.

657
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,681
Huan, thank you.
You've gone to a lot of expense.

658
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:59,320
Don't say that, Auntie.
I've been working non-stop lately

659
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,761
and couldn't accompany you.

660
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,081
I'll take you out for fun
once I'm done with work.

661
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,761
What kind of job is this, Huan?

662
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:08,761
You can't even rest on the weekends.

663
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:10,761
Take care of yourself, okay?

664
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:14,280
Exactly, all she does
is work and earn money.

665
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,000
She never takes care of herself.

666
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:22,241
Being busy is good.
Huan is contributing to society.

667
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,000
Unlike me.

668
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:28,400
I've spent my life around the stove,
kids, and my husband.

669
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,960
Isn't it the same for me?

670
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,081
We are well as long as they are well.

671
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,041
Auntie, take good care of yourself.

672
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,920
What matters is your happiness.

673
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm not as lucky as your mom.

674
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:44,960
Don't say that, Auntie.

675
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,641
Mom, take Auntie

676
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,440
- to get some rest.
- Alright.

677
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,721
- The room is ready.
- Okay.

678
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,561
Okay, she's busy. Let's go.

679
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:12,081
Excuse me, pretty.

680
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,328
Do you know where Yao Zhiming lives?

681
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:15,384
No idea.

682
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:16,601
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

683
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:25,681
It's a nice day. Let's buy some fish.

684
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,280
Okay.

685
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,521
Excuse me, ma'am.

686
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:32,561
Do you know where Yao Zhiming lives?

687
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:33,761
- No.
- No idea.

688
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,960
Alright, go ahead and have fun.

689
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,360
I'll join you after I've cooked.

690
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,816
They can't do without me.

691
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:46,880
- Without me...
- Ma'am.

692
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,721
No, no, thanks.

693
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,081
I won't buy anything.

694
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,304
I'm not selling something.

695
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,000
So what do you want?

696
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm asking for directions.

697
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:01,121
Asking for directions? Well, go ahead.

698
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:04,280
Do you know where Yao Zhiming lives?

699
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,480
Who are you to him?

700
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
I am his...

701
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,104
What?

702
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,184
Girlfriend.

703
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:21,688
(Ms. Liu)

704
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,041
Hello, Ms. Liu.

705
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:36,280
It's so good. I want another bowl of it.

706
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,081
You want more? You've had two bowls.

707
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,840
You may look thin,
but you can really eat.

708
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,121
Do you ever gain weight?

709
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:56,081
Auntie, I won't eat
your food for free. I have money.

710
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,920
You're just like Yao Zhiming,
talking about money all the time.

711
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:04,121
I won't take your money. Just eat.

712
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:14,008
Drink this. My daughter
likes it very much. Have it.

713
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,096
Auntie.

714
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:18,601
Is this your daughter?

715
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,641
Yeah, what about it?

716
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,161
She's so pretty.

717
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:24,161
Well, look who her mother is.

718
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:27,800
Zhang Ziyu, how come you're here?

719
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:32,134
Yao, why didn't you tell me

720
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:35,761
you've got a girlfriend?
She can really eat.

721
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:39,280
Auntie, she is Zhang Peisheng's
daughter, not my girlfriend.

722
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
Y-You are...

723
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,241
Auntie, don't listen to him.

724
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,480
I am his girlfriend.

725
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:49,480
Even if I'm not now, I will be one day.

726
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,800
Auntie, don't listen to her.

727
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,440
- Come here.
- I am his girlfriend.

728
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,201
- Come here.
- Remember, I'm his girlfriend.

729
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,601
Auntie, I'm his girlfriend.
Don't forget that.

730
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,320
Yao Zhiming, why are you kicking me out?

731
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,761
We had each other's back abroad.

732
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:05,721
Now, you won't even invite me home.

733
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,761
Are you living with
a whole bunch of people

734
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,161
because of that pretty lady?

735
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,480
- Mind your own business.
- Tell me.

736
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,641
- Don't come again.
- Who is she?

737
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:15,920
Yao Zhiming, open up.

738
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,320
You won't tell me, huh?
I'll ask He Dong.

739
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,641
Mom, I'm back.

740
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,641
Look at you. You didn't
come home for dinner again.

741
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:44,561
Yao Zhiming must be busy too.

742
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:46,480
But he came home for dinner.

743
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,041
You know what?

744
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,241
Zhang Peisheng's daughter
came looking for Yao Zhiming today.

745
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,480
She said she was his girlfriend.
