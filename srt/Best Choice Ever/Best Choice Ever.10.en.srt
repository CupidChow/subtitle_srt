=Best Choice Ever=

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,338
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,061
But today, I finally realized

4
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,540
that there are no friends
or relatives in the workplace.

5
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,861
No, Chenghuan, don't think like that.

6
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,980
Mr. Yao was planning to recommend you
to the headquarters of Yueda

7
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,900
after the tendering conference.

8
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,900
With a tarnished reputation?

9
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,141
I don't need that.

10
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,421
(I am the director of Yueda Group.)

11
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:37,620
(With such critical evidence emerging,)

12
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,220
(should I still be concerned
with your feelings?)

13
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,261
(You say I treat you as a pawn.
What are you?)

14
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,821
(Are you an employee of Yueda Group)

15
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,060
(or a follower of the Xin family?)

16
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,220
Hello, is it the Security Department?

17
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,581
Get the surveillance footage

18
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,301
of the Administration area of this month

19
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,460
here, right now.

20
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:31,301
(I thought we were like family because
we took care of Grandma together.)

21
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,981
Grandma.

22
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,141
Hello, Mr. Yao.

23
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,660
- Where is my grandma?
- She's out with friends.

24
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,821
- Hello, Zhiming.
- Grandma.

25
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,861
Come on, dance with Grandma.

26
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,980
- Okay.
- Thank you.

27
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,220
Grandma, be careful.

28
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
Zhiming, how come
you have the time to visit me today?

29
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,061
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

30
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,821
Grandma, didn't
Mai Chenghuan come today?

31
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,701
- No, why?
- It's nothing.

32
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,300
I think there is something.

33
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,821
Did you bully Chenghuan
against my advice?

34
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,821
Grandma, did she complain to you?

35
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,061
I can explain it.

36
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,300
You've underestimated her.

37
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,300
She only shares the good news with me.

38
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,501
Then I'm a bit confused.

39
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,061
I thought she had the guts to

40
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:19,381
turn down the Xin family
because you've got her back.

41
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
I told you that
she didn't know anything.

42
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,021
But you didn't believe it.

43
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,420
Who would you ever trust in this world?

44
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,501
I thought you were being partial.

45
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,021
I like both of you the same.

46
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,821
And you're my grandson.

47
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:46,501
You always see people
as self-interested.

48
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,220
You can't take
a pessimistic view of people

49
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,181
just because you've seen bad things.

50
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,381
This world is full of surprises.

51
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,220
The sunflower seeds
are black on the outside.

52
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,420
But they're white inside.

53
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,741
Here. I planted these.
They're fresh and sweet.

54
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,100
Grandma, Mai Chenghuan
has never been through challenges.

55
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,701
Her integrity hasn't withstood any test.

56
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:28,300
Only a heart forged with
steel and concrete

57
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,460
makes someone
stand out in the workplace.

58
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:34,381
I taught her a lesson today.

59
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:39,340
Your theories might not be correct.

60
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,141
Chenghuan may look frail on the surface,

61
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,381
but she's strong-willed.

62
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,701
She's a competitive child.

63
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,540
Wait for the repercussions
if you keep treating her that way.

64
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,220
Go ahead, I'm off to dance.

65
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,021
He Dong, ask our HR

66
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,540
if there's a suitable position
for Mai Chenghuan.

67
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,248
Pick a good one.

68
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,767
(Zhang Peisheng)

69
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,581
I've applied to headquarters
for an anti-corruption investigation.

70
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,021
Unfortunately,
we have internal problems.

71
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,141
I wonder if the higher-ups
will take action against Dennis.

72
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,340
The information leak was an accident.

73
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,100
The kickback list is real.

74
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,460
The headquarters resents corruption.

75
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,860
Dennis surely can't stay.

76
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,900
Congratulations in advance, Ms. Zhang.

77
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,860
As for Mai Chenghuan...

78
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:20,100
I thought she was just
an innocent young girl.

79
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,100
But she played both sides this time.

80
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,181
Don't tell me
this was also part of your plan.

81
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,900
The information leak was an accident.

82
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,580
She was framed.

83
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,741
I will get to the bottom of this.

84
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,904
Feeling guilty?

85
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,501
Mai Chenghuan is the key element
in securing Xing'anli.

86
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,660
You're playing with her feelings.

87
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,461
Just don't end up staying
because it gets real.

88
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Xing'anli will be

89
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,381
the stepping stone for my promotion
back at the headquarters.

90
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,300
I'll leave everything to you here

91
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,261
and return to headquarters
to achieve my ambitions.

92
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,461
- I wish you success.
- Thank you.

93
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,741
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed
is not available.

94
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,221
Stop calling.

95
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,261
I bet Xin Jialiang
won't turn on his phone.

96
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,080
Mao.

97
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,221
I've been working
so diligently all these years.

98
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,780
How did I end up like this?

99
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,501
Xin Jialiang is really worthless.

100
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,300
He disappeared

101
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,741
and shifted the blame on you.

102
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:45,381
He doesn't even have the courage
to face the problems.

103
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,461
If you want to break up with him,

104
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,300
I wholeheartedly agree.

105
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,341
And that boss of yours, Mr. Yao.

106
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,900
He's not decent either.

107
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,900
He put you in a difficult position.

108
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,660
If you want to vent your anger,

109
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,940
let me handle it.

110
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,420
If you want to splash paint on his car

111
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,341
or put up a banner outside his office,

112
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,621
leave it to me.

113
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,660
Actually, Yao Zhiming
hasn't done anything wrong as a leader.

114
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,900
After all, this is the workplace.

115
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:21,660
But Huan, we can't
take the blame for no reason.

116
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,940
Zao, why did you come?

117
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,861
I asked him to come over
to keep you company.

118
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,660
Don't hold back in front of us.

119
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,981
Cry if you want to.

120
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm not going to cry.

121
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:37,660
It doesn't solve any problem.

122
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,741
So what do you want?

123
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,580
I just can't accept it.

124
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,660
I don't want to leave the company

125
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,900
as someone
who leaked the base price list.

126
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,700
Okay, Huan, where do you want to start?

127
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,981
Sherry, log into my work PC
and check my email.

128
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,660
Chenghuan, the IT department

129
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,141
sent someone
to pick up your PC this afternoon

130
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,621
for investigation.

131
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,221
Our surveillance footage is also sealed.

132
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,861
Okay, I got it.

133
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,141
Are they trying to destroy the evidence?

134
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:26,780
Huan, is it possible to seek
a breakthrough from someone else?

135
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:32,900
Someone else?
Actually, there is someone.

136
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,700
Nice coffee?

137
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,540
I know what you want to ask.

138
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,780
Then I'll get to the point.
Why did you do that?

139
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,101
Sorry, no comment.

140
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,021
At least tell me

141
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,540
when you received
that whistleblower email.

142
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:23,540
Zhu Baoqiao, you were
such a top student in college

143
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,180
that the teachers were proud of you

144
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:26,900
and our peers envied you.

145
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,381
But I don't envy you at all right now.

146
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:37,341
Mai Chenghuan,
should I call you naive or upright?

147
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,060
Profit matters the most
in the workplace.

148
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,101
You don't aspire to this.

149
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,741
Tell me. What's the point?

150
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,180
None of this would have happened

151
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,221
if you had agreed to work with me.

152
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:53,221
Not everyone is like you, Zhu Baoqiao.

153
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,060
If I had agreed to join hands
with you back then,

154
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,741
that would have been a grave mistake.

155
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:18,861
- Assistant He.
- Chenghuan.

156
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,741
Mr. Yao reviewed
all the surveillance footage.

157
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,700
There is a piece of good news.

158
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,621
Someone indeed
sent an email from your workstation.

159
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,540
- But...
- But what?

160
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,700
Just tell me. What is the bad news?

161
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,501
This person wore a hat in disguise.

162
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,820
We couldn't see the face.

163
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,021
Assistant He, can you
send me that surveillance video?

164
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:45,540
- Okay, I'll send it to you now.
- Thanks.

165
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,981
You leaked the base price list.

166
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,621
You sent that email, huh?

167
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,341
You can only see a figure there.

168
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:14,900
What makes you say it's me?

169
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,221
Mai Chenghuan,
don't be like a cornered dog.

170
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,221
Although you wore a hoodie,
sweatpants, and a mask,

171
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,780
I wouldn't be mistaken about your ring.

172
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,861
Many people in our company wear rings.

173
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,540
What makes you think it's me?

174
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,940
Even if you want to shift the blame,

175
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,021
at least fix your story.

176
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,981
Fine, what about the bag you carried?

177
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,940
- What bag?
- The bag you carried that day.

178
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,141
I wasn't carrying a bag...

179
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,501
That's right,
you weren't carrying a bag that day.

180
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,981
Mai Chenghuan, you tricked me.

181
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,141
A tooth for a tooth.

182
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,288
(Recording)

183
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,420
Do you have anything to explain?

184
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,700
Mr. Yao, I'm sorry.

185
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,341
Someone from Deshan lured me into this.

186
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,540
- It won't happen again.
- That's it?

187
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:21,741
Chenghuan, I'm all alone

188
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,141
with no one to rely on.

189
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,580
I didn't intend to frame you.

190
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:30,141
Besides, isn't your boyfriend
the young boss of Deshan?

191
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,900
I sent the email in your name

192
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,101
to help you earn appreciation.

193
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,021
I don't need such appreciation.

194
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,420
"Thanks a lot."

195
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,741
Chenghuan, I'm really sorry.

196
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,820
Give me one more chance.

197
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,300
I won't make
the same mistake again. Please.

198
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,741
Chenghuan, how about this?

199
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,621
Wu You is also a senior employee.

200
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,580
You've worked together for years.

201
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,940
Can you forgive her this once?

202
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,141
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Zhu.

203
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,141
I can't forgive someone
who has set me up repeatedly.

204
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,580
And I wasn't the only victim here.

205
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,420
She dragged
the entire company down with her.

206
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,300
If you want to cover up

207
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,221
such dishonest actions for her,

208
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,700
how do we defend justice
and gain trust in the future?

209
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,420
Call the police.
I will do it if you don't.

210
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,461
Go ahead.

211
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,540
Right now, I'm standing
in this prime office building.

212
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,700
I come in and out of this luxury hotel
which costs people a fortune.

213
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,861
I seem to be prestigious
with a leisurely life.

214
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:48,341
But what's the truth?

215
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,981
The truth is I live in Songjiang

216
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:56,580
and spend hours every day
commuting on the subway,

217
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:01,501
pretending to be
in the same world as you people

218
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:03,540
who never leave the city center.

219
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,741
And those people outside...

220
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,380
Some sit in high positions.

221
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,780
Some have connections.

222
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,501
Some sit in their positions,
waiting to retire.

223
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,300
But we are humans too.

224
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,981
We also have ambitions and desires.

225
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,340
We're desperate
to break through the glass ceiling.

226
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,701
What's wrong with that?

227
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,901
I just want to stay in Shanghai
through my efforts.

228
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,421
Is that so difficult?

229
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,421
You think I'm a local Shanghainese,

230
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,820
so I must have a better life than you?

231
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:53,380
My tall little brother
is still sleeping on the balcony.

232
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,941
My dad's shirt has turned yellow
but he was reluctant to get a new one.

233
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,100
And my mom

234
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,221
couldn't even turn around
in the tiny kitchen.

235
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,901
There's nothing wrong
with having ambition or desires,

236
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,540
or wanting to win.

237
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,780
I also want to get promoted.
I also want to make money

238
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,540
to provide a better life for my family.

239
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,820
But every penny I've earned is clean.

240
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,421
I would never trample
on anyone for my desires.

241
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,820
So sorry, I can't forgive you.

242
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,580
I don't want to.

243
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,701
Mr. Yao, please handle this matter.

244
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,820
Make an announcement.

245
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:47,540
Wu You is fired and handed over
to the police. Go ahead.

246
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,421
Let's go, Wu You.

247
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,501
What is it? Anything else?

248
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:09,300
Mr. Yao, I request a transfer.

249
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,741
Where to?

250
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,021
Anywhere away from you.

251
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:18,340
Alright, the hotel apartments'
property management.

252
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:23,981
Deal.

You're back so early today.

268
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,780
Great, hurry up. The food is still warm.

269
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,501
Look, I steamed clams and eggs for you.

270
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,580
And there are pig trotters you like.

271
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,901
Honey, hurry up. Dinner is ready.
Our daughter is back.

272
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:42,501
- Dad.
- Chengzao is not home yet.

273
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,901
Let's not wait for him.

274
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,181
He always comes home late after work.

275
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,300
How come he's still like a kid?

276
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,580
You should talk to him.

277
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,501
These are all Huan's favorite dishes.

278
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,540
- Dig in.
- Have some pig trotters.

279
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,540
Huan, what's wrong? You look bothered.

280
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:17,181
- Nothing.
- Is it the tendering conference?

281
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:21,780
No, Mom, that went quite well.

282
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,100
It's just that I've been
working overtime

283
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,501
and haven't had much homemade food.

284
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,501
I feel so happy
to taste something you cooked finally.

285
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,540
What's the big deal?

286
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:35,580
Just give us a call.

287
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,501
We can deliver the food to you.

288
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,620
Yeah, I'll deliver the food.

289
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,780
Did Jialiang win the bid?

290
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,021
Mom, I'm starving.

291
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,941
Can we not talk about work? Let's eat.

292
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,181
Okay, let's not talk about work.

293
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,780
Then let's talk about the wedding.

294
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,741
Seriously, can't you see
your daughter is exhausted?

295
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:01,140
Huan, hurry up and eat.

296
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,540
And have a good sleep.

297
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,261
We won't talk about anything today.

298
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:07,060
We'll talk another day, okay?

299
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,221
Dig in.

300
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,620
Come on, dig in.

301
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,540
Here, have a pig trotter.

302
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,780
- You're really getting transferred?
- Yeah.

303
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:31,021
Didn't you prove that Wu You set you up?

304
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,620
Mr. Yao is really ruthless.

305
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,501
I applied for the transfer.

306
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,100
I won't bother
speculating about Mr. Yao.

307
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,741
And Sherry, walls have ears.

308
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,340
Be more careful
about what you say from now on.

309
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:52,780
I heard that Ms. Zhang and Mr. Yao
filed a complaint to the headquarters.

310
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,981
An email has come

311
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,741
about Dennis's suspension investigation
this morning.

312
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,461
They have achieved their purpose.

313
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,820
Why can't they spare you?

314
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,021
They transferred you
to property management.

315
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,741
just to look fair and just

316
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,540
to shut the other employees up?

317
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,780
Anyway, I don't want to work with them.

318
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,140
I'd rather start afresh than stay here.

319
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:19,060
You had a great future ahead.

320
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:21,860
But you're getting transferred.

321
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,540
So unfortunate.

322
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,540
I hope you can get over it soon.

323
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:27,820
The salary has been reduced.

324
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:30,780
At least you have a home
and don't need to pay rent.

325
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,981
Are you really trying to comfort me?

326
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Alright.

327
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,380
No matter what,
it's a luxurious hotel apartment.

328
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:43,741
I heard that the residents
are high-end business professionals.

329
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,661
You might meet some elites.

330
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,501
I get it.

331
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:51,221
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- That would be great.

332
00:23:53,060 --> 00:24:00,060
- Chenghuan, you're leaving.
- Yeah.

333
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,461
What should I say about you?

334
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,941
A word of advice.

335
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,820
Don't act so willful out there.

336
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:15,981
Even if you can deal with

337
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,261
any problem,

338
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:19,580
always try to protect yourself.

339
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,981
Amicability brings wealth.

340
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,421
I understand, Mr. Zhu.

341
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,261
Thank you for looking after me.

342
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,820
Rest assured,
I will do well wherever I go.

343
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,820
Let us know if there's anything

344
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,181
we can do for you.

345
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Take care. I'm off now.

346
00:24:55,221 --> 00:25:00,580
- Go back.
- Work hard.

347
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:03,832
Go back.

348
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,620
Oh right, I forgot to tell you.

349
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,221
Dennis has been suspended.

350
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,661
He's being transferred
back to Switzerland.

351
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,340
Do you have to be so harsh?

352
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,181
You've got what you wanted.

353
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,021
I need to train well

354
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:35,741
to prepare for the next tough battle.

355
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,780
Then you do need to train well.

356
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,620
All your little plots have been exposed.

357
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,421
The little bit of fondness
Chenghuan had for you

358
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,860
is all gone.

359
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,941
You really need to

360
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,181
work on your scores again.

361
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,941
Sir, don't tell me that this is intended

362
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,380
as compensation for Chenghuan.

363
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,981
Come on, bro.

364
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,181
Don't deal with it

365
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:14,661
as if it's a breakup, okay?

366
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,981
Besides, you're treating Chenghuan

367
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,741
much harsher than
how you treated your ex-girlfriends.

368
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,780
Look, Katrina.

369
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,461
You got her a job and resources.

370
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,421
But you demoted Chenghuan directly.

371
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:32,261
From a hotel to property management.
Isn't it a huge fall?

372
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,340
Should I let her stay at Botticelli

373
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,661
and suffer from gossip?

374
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,060
So Mr. Yao, you meant to help Chenghuan?

375
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:43,340
By transferring her
to property management?

376
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:46,780
Didn't you introduce her to a place
with less work and more pay?

377
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:50,140
She doesn't need that.
Let her accumulate experience.

378
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,661
The lower a spring is pressed,
the higher it bounces back.

379
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:56,261
There are elite residents there

380
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,941
with connections and resources.

381
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,540
Let her gain experience
and see the world.

382
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:06,421
You're truly insightful.

383
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:08,181
But it's a pity.

384
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,981
You're thinking ahead.

385
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,941
- But she may not get it.
- I'm off.

386
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,261
Mr. Xin, the police
have arrested the mole.

387
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,741
Secretary Zhu was exempt
from legal sanctions because

388
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,100
the bribes were not huge.

389
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:30,300
But once this scandal gets out there,

390
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,540
it will affect
our next round of financing.

391
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,661
I suggest that
the HR department terminate

392
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,540
the labor contract with Secretary Zhu.

393
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,741
- Get her here.
- Okay, Mr. Xin.

394
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,661
- Mr. Xin.
- Hand in your resignation.

395
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,860
- What? Are you kidding?
- What?

396
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,860
You really want me to resign?

397
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:30,340
Can't you use cash for bribery?

398
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,021
You had to use a card?

399
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,741
You lack professional sensitivity.

400
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,501
If your mistake
imposes any negative effect

401
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,140
on the company,

402
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,461
you know the consequences.

403
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,128
Hello.

404
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,540
Qian Duoduo, where are you going?

405
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,421
Someone's towel warmer
has malfunctioned.

406
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:14,540
The pipe burst.

407
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,820
I have to check it out.

408
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,060
Run faster.

409
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,620
(Zhang Xinyue)
Are you Manager Zhang?

410
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:24,780
- You are...
- I'm Mai Chenghuan from Botticelli.

411
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,421
I know you, the scapegoat, right?

412
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,860
I didn't mean that.

413
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,181
I'm a bit blunt when I speak.

414
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:33,461
Don't take it to heart.

415
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,340
Come on in.

416
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,140
Wang, meet the newcomer, Mai Chenghuan.

417
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,221
Hello.

418
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,661
- I've noted it down.
- Here's your seat.

419
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,181
- Leave your things here.
- Okay.

420
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,860
We're part of the Yueda Group,

421
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,501
but what we do here is hard work.

422
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,741
It's different from the hotel upfront.

423
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,620
You're new here
so you may not be used to it.

424
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,540
Tell me if you have any issues, okay?

425
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,860
Don't worry, Manager Zhang.
I will be fine.

426
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,100
I will work hard wherever I go.

427
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,421
Alright, let's take a look
at your battlefield.

428
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:07,461
- Okay.
- Let's go.

429
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,181
The first floor has the front desk,
lobby, and reception area.

430
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,340
The top floor is for the café and bar.

431
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,540
The middle floors are guest rooms.

432
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,140
A housekeeper is responsible for
two floors and 16 residents.

433
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,181
We provide
one-on-one customized service.

434
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:22,661
One-on-one customized service?

435
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,741
Simply put, we must meet every tenant's

436
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,421
individual needs.

437
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,300
You have to befriend them.

438
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,140
Observe them and listen to them.

439
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:34,300
More importantly, feel what they need.

440
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,461
Make sure your service is flawless

441
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,100
- so they can pay the fee on time.
- Understood.

442
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,261
Oh, and we have a perk here.

443
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:47,820
All the residents
rate the housekeepers every month.

444
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,580
From one to five, three is a pass.

445
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,100
A quarterly tally of 15 points
can be exchanged for a day off.

446
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,340
Understood. I'll do my best.

447
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,140
But you might need to

448
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,661
put in some extra effort on Room 513.

449
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,820
She hasn't paid
her property fees for a year.

450
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,421
Why?

451
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,100
The reason is a bit complicated.

452
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:12,100
I can only say that her demands
for the service are somewhat high.

453
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,820
So when is she at home?

454
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:16,421
She works in overseas tourism.

455
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,860
She works at night
and rests in the morning.

456
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,100
She's there after noon.

457
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,620
- Got it.
- Take care of it soon.

458
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,501
Let me show you around.

459
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
This route is at the lowest price.

460
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,380
That's it. Who are you?

461
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,661
Hello, Ms. Chen,
I'm the new housekeeper, Mai Chenghuan.

462
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:48,421
Ms. Chen.

463
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,421
Want the property management fee, huh?

464
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:58,300
Okay, let me complain
about the service issues.

465
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,741
First, why can't the delivery
be brought upstairs?

466
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,780
You said it was to
protect our privacy and safety.

467
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,461
Sure, bring them up for us.

468
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,661
Don't let me do it every day by myself.

469
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,100
Also, this door lock
has been broken for at least a year.

470
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,941
You only fix it and never replace it.

471
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,860
But you don't fix it properly.

472
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,661
I get locked out every other day.

473
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,820
Also, when I moved in,

474
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,221
you promoted yourself

475
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,580
by saying that you would
hold residents' mixers.

476
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:27,860
But you never did.

477
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Not a single one of these issues
has been addressed.

478
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,380
I haven't enjoyed your services.

479
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,300
Why should I pay the fee?

480
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,100
Understood, Ms. Chen.
I have noted everything down.

481
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,340
There have been some personnel changes.

482
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,100
We will make improvements
to our services.

483
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,780
- Improvements?
- Also, Ms. Chen.

484
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,860
I have joined the group chat
for our building.

485
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,100
Search for "Mai Chenghuan"
and you'll find me.

486
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,421
Come to me whenever you want something.

487
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:57,140
I will do my best
to provide you with the best service.

488
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,620
Alright, I'll give you
a chance to improve.

489
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,461
Go to Xintiandi

490
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:08,580
and buy me a cup of that
trending handmade bubble tea.

491
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:10,221
Hot, with less sugar.

492
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,221
It would be best if you could
bring it back within an hour.

493
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:17,901
What are you waiting for?
Isn't it one-on-one service?

494
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,340
Also, if you buy two cups of bubble tea,

495
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,300
they give you a free dessert.

496
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,620
I only want one bubble tea.

497
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,181
Find someone to share the order

498
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:27,021
and bring that dessert to me.

499
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,461
Ms. Chen.

500
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,941
Ms. Chen, your bubble tea.

501
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,701
So slow? I wanted it in an hour.

502
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,501
Look, it's gotten cold.

503
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,701
Sorry, there were too many people.

504
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
I did my best.

505
00:33:57,221 --> 00:34:00,021
I also brought you the dessert.

506
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:04,620
- Bring my parcels upstairs.
- Okay.

507
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,381
- Take these for dry cleaning.
- Alright.

508
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,301
Walk my dogs. Don't let them fight.

509
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,941
Come closer, come on.

510
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,700
Don't bark.

511
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,501
Don't bark. Don't fight.

512
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,981
What's wrong? Don't fight.

513
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,580
Let's go home.

514
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,540
Don't bark. Let's go.

515
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,180
You go first. Sorry about that.

516
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,060
Go ahead. Thank you.

517
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,540
It's okay. They don't bite.

518
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Ms. Chen, I took them for a walk.

519
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,301
Back already? Mommy missed you so much.

520
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,740
Come on in.

521
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,981
- Okay, I'm good. You can go back.
- Ms. Chen...

522
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,381
- Why are you here?
- I just moved in. What's wrong?

523
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,740
Don't you live in the hotel?

524
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:38,260
You're in charge of this floor?

525
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:42,301
Come over and help.

526
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:50,021
What a bad luck. I ran into him again.

527
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,861
Okay, Mr. Yao. I've fixed your light.

528
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,220
If there's nothing else,

529
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,180
- I'll take my leave.
- In such a hurry?

530
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,381
Do you need anything else?

531
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,060
- No.
- Mr. Yao, I'm in charge of 16 units.

532
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,301
I'm not your personal secretary.

533
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,580
If you have no other matters,

534
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,660
I won't disturb you.

535
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,861
Also, please kindly rate

536
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,660
my service on the app. Thank you.

537
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:47,540
- The water dispenser is broken.
- Alright.

538
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,861
Mr. Yao, we deliver water
to you every day.

539
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:22,341
You don't have to buy water.

540
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:25,781
I'm used to this brand.

541
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,100
Do you know that

542
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,461
this water can't be heated?

543
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:30,580
Once heated,

544
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,260
the mineral
will clog the water dispenser.

545
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,660
Can you solve the problem?

546
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,140
I will bring citric acid tomorrow

547
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,461
and clean it thoroughly.

548
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:40,461
That should do it.

549
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,861
Mr. Yao, is there anything else

550
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,580
that is broken in the apartment?

551
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,861
I'll fix them for you.

552
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,540
- There shouldn't be any.
- That's great.

553
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,861
May I go now?

554
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:00,821
Mai Chenghuan,
I will give you a five-star rating.

555
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,461
I believe you'll do your job well
as a secretary

556
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,180
or a housekeeper.

557
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,861
Is it the typical "carrot and stick"?

558
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,620
You can say so.

559
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:17,180
Yao Zhiming, I don't want to
talk about what happened before.

560
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,140
Now that I'm here,

561
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,620
I'll work steadily and start over.

562
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,740
I hope we both mind our own businesses.

563
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,060
You don't need to feign such concern.

564
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,301
- I don't need it.
- Alright.

565
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,140
Feel free to ask me

566
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,060
if you have any questions at work.

567
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,660
No need, what I learned from
my last position is to never believe in

568
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,580
empty promises,

569
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,461
especially those
from leaders and customers.

570
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:48,260
Here's one last piece of advice for you.

571
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,781
Start with what the customer
needs most urgently.

572
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,501
You don't have to do everything
as the housekeeper.

573
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,008
Thank you.

574
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,301
Chenghuan may seem frail on the surface.

575
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,381
But she is strong-willed.

576
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,421
Wait for the repercussions
if you keep treating her that way.

577
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,464
Chenghuan.

578
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,280
Chenghuan.

579
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:34,660
What's wrong, Chenghuan?

580
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,540
You got pissed off by 513?

581
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:39,781
Calm down.

582
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,941
You know, Mrs. Chen has driven away

583
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,580
three housekeepers.

584
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,461
She's a real trouble.

585
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,781
So don't get upset or angry.

586
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:57,540
(Start with what the customer
needs most urgently.)

587
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:09,981
(Anyi International Travel
Series B financing over 430 million)

588
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,140
I guess

589
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,501
it's because she posted ads
in the group chat last time

590
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:17,060
and the housekeeper stopped her.

591
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,501
That's why
she took her anger out on you.

592
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:22,021
Ignore her. Let her burn herself out.

593
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,821
Now I get it.

594
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:29,560
I see.

595
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:41,140
- Sherry.
- Chenghuan.

596
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:44,660
Is there a wine tasting
at the hotel in a couple of days?

597
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:45,861
Yeah, what about it?

598
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,301
Can you help me get a ticket?

599
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:52,140
- Sure, no problem.
- Thanks.

600
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:00,260
Alright, Ms. Zhang, rest assured.

601
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,660
Okay, that's it. See you tomorrow.

602
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:09,781
Everyone's here.
Where's your apprentice?

603
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,700
How dare he miss this important meeting?

604
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:18,740
Mr. Luo, you assigned
Mai Chengzao to me.

605
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,060
He has a poor
educational background. And at work...

606
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,341
He doesn't even have a proper attitude.

607
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,220
Mr. Luo, I'm sorry.

608
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,861
Mr. Liu sent me to the factory area

609
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:40,660
rented by the client
early in the morning.

610
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,501
The factory is in the suburbs.

611
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,540
I arrived late because
it was a long way here. Sorry.

612
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,861
I forgot that I had sent you out.

613
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:52,580
My memory gets blurred
when there's too much on my mind.

614
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,781
I'm absolutely serious
about teaching students.

615
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,660
Will you assign me another student?

616
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,660
I'll train them both.

617
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:01,021
In that case,

618
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,620
you'll mess up all your work.

619
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,781
Alright, tell us about the case.

620
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,220
Speak.

621
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,461
Mr. Luo, the client requests

622
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:20,220
a detailed legal opinion on fire safety.

623
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,180
It was the first time
Mr. Liu let me work on my own.

624
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,981
I took it very seriously.

625
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,981
I went on-site as a job applicant

626
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,981
to inspect the factory area.

627
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,821
These are photos from the scene.

628
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,901
I analyzed it

629
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,220
(Legal opinion)
and wrote a legal opinion. Here.

630
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,100
Liu, you are already
the most senior lawyer at our firm.

631
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,901
Pay attention to work.

632
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,461
Don't let the newcomers
push you to the sidelines.
