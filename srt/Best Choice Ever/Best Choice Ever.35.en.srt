00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,059
=Episode 35=

3
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,898
Mr. Zhang, thank you.

4
00:01:31,898 --> 00:01:34,178
We were lucky to have your help today.

5
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,298
You're welcome.

6
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:36,699
Miss Mai, rest assured.

7
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,378
Your brother is a talented young man.

8
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,779
He has done sufficient

9
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:40,898
preparations for this case.

10
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:42,699
I believe it will go smoothly tomorrow.

11
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,178
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,258
I'll count on you tomorrow, Mr. Zhang.

13
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:46,779
Thank you.

14
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,018
Alright then, I will take my leave.

15
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:48,658
Okay.

16
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:53,419
Zao, how do you feel?

17
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,538
Are you confident about tomorrow?

18
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,139
Don't worry, Huan.

19
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:58,298
Mao and I

20
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,458
will definitely bring Dingding back.

21
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:03,499
I believe in you.

22
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,219
Stay relaxed tomorrow.

23
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,258
Everything will be fine.

24
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,339
Dad, Mom.

25
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:14,939
Why did you come back early?

26
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,339
Mrs. Mai.

27
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,378
Mom.

28
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,339
Here's the thing.

29
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,739
Zao and Mao have been meaning

30
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:33,658
to tell you,

31
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,578
but there are complications...

32
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:36,258
Huan.

33
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,378
Let me do it.

34
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,538
Dad, Mom.

35
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,459
Mao and I are together now.

36
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,138
The case I mentioned before

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,138
is the case for Dingding's custody.

38
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:59,299
I know you might be worried.

39
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,978
We wanted to wait until after the case

40
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,138
to tell you.

41
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:05,818
So...

42
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:26,299
Mao's trial is tomorrow, right?

43
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:29,418
Yes.

44
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,939
Good luck.

45
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:41,779
It's reassuring to have
the child by your side.

46
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:06,739
Mom.

47
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,779
Can you come out?

48
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,339
We are quite worried about you.

49
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,899
Actually, this is my fault.

50
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:18,578
Mao and Zao wanted to tell you,

51
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:20,458
but I told them

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,099
to wait until you are
back from your trip.

53
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,739
Who knew

54
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,258
you would come back today?

55
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,578
I actually think it's quite nice, Huan.

56
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,939
This sudden encounter

57
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,179
felt like a pleasant surprise to me.

58
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,179
- Yeah, it makes sense.
- Right? Yu.

59
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:44,138
Yes, Mom.

60
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,179
Besides, Zao has grown up now.

61
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,778
He knows what he should do.

62
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,859
Give him a chance.

63
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,258
Don't worry, Mom.

64
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,138
Yu, this is how I see it.

65
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:03,939
We've watched Mao grow up as a child.

66
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:06,258
We know her inside and out, right?

67
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:08,898
Besides, she's our goddaughter.

68
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,539
Now the goddaughter
has become our daughter-in-law.

69
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,299
Two families have merged into one.

70
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,299
That's a good thing, don't you think?

71
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:19,939
I know.

72
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:48,258
But Dad,

73
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,539
why did you and Mom suddenly
come back from your trip?

74
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:55,218
It was your mother's first trip.

75
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,419
She probably wasn't used to it.

76
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,179
Or perhaps because there were
too many people on the bus

77
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,939
and she didn't feel very safe.

78
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,059
Suddenly,

79
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:04,698
she insisted on coming back.

80
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,979
There was nothing I could do.

81
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,258
Just like that?

82
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,179
Have Mao and Zao left?

83
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,218
Yes.

84
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,419
How is Ms. Liu?

85
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:17,979
Zhiming.

86
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:21,018
Why don't you go in
and try to persuade her?

87
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,419
You are her future son-in-law.

88
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:27,138
There's a saying in Shanghai
that a mother-in-law

89
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,018
likes her son-in-law more
the more she sees him.

90
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,578
You go. It's fine.

91
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:31,619
He?

92
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,338
Mr. Mai.

93
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:34,218
I think

94
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,419
we should let her have some time alone.

95
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,739
Indeed, things happened suddenly.

96
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,378
Maybe she will come around tomorrow.

97
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,539
Zhiming is right.

98
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,338
Let's not try to convince her today.

99
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,818
Let's leave her alone for a while.

100
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:46,859
You're right.

101
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,218
Let's go.

102
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:14,552
(Birth Certificate)

103
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,378
My greatest wish right now

104
00:07:58,419 --> 00:07:59,739
is for our Zao

105
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,018
to bring a girlfriend home

106
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:03,099
sooner rather than later.

107
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,739
My son has grown up.

108
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,059
Even Zao

109
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,258
is settling down.

110
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:34,899
Mom.

111
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,098
Mom.

112
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,419
This is so lavish.

113
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:48,858
(I'm going to buy groceries.)

114
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,738
(Everyone should come back
for dinner tonight.)

115
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,618
Dad, look, Mom left a note.

116
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,218
She went to buy groceries.

117
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,019
How was she last night?

118
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,978
When I went up to sleep,

119
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,299
she was already asleep

120
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,899
and I didn't dare to wake her.

121
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,179
But looking at this,

122
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:12,419
I think your mom has come around.

123
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,618
Look.

124
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,698
She prepared such
a lavish breakfast for us.

125
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,419
It means she's in a good mood.

126
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,019
That's right.

127
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,259
So tonight,

128
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,218
everyone should
cancel their appointments

129
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,899
and come back
to have dinner with Ms. Liu.

130
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,059
That's the spirit.

131
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,379
- Okay.
- Come, let's eat.

132
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:40,818
All done.

133
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,458
What's the matter?

134
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:45,218
It's morning, but you look troubled.

135
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,779
Are you worried I won't win the lawsuit?

136
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,698
No.

137
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:52,818
I just don't know

138
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,818
how to face Mrs. Mai.

139
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,139
Zao, Mom is okay now.

140
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,379
Good luck with the lawsuit.

141
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,818
Come back home for dinner tonight.

142
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:12,899
Did you hear that?

143
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:15,738
Really?

144
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,179
You can relax now.

145
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:17,978
Let's go.

146
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,059
Really?

147
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:28,379
You heard my sister.

148
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:29,818
The most important thing today

149
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:31,379
is to get Dingding home.

150
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:32,659
Let's go.

151
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:35,978
We got this.

152
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:36,899
We got this.

153
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,818
Dad, you'll have to wear
the diaper from now on.

154
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,059
- How many times has it been today?
- With Dad's situation now,

155
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,578
we can't always take leaves, right?

156
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,419
Why don't you resign
and take care of him full-time?

157
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,259
Why does it have to be me?

158
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,779
If anyone should resign,
it's you. He's your dad.

159
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,698
But I earn more.

160
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:03,818
Don't we have kids at home?

161
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:04,899
You can take care of them all.

162
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:05,779
Right?

163
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:07,698
What? You can do it.

164
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:08,698
But I earn more.

165
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:09,779
I make a bit more money, right?

166
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:38,379
Mom.

167
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:40,899
What's wrong?

168
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,818
How come you're able to come back
during the day today?

169
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,618
Xing'anli isn't that busy today.

170
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:47,578
And I've come back
to tell you some good news.

171
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,779
Zao has won the lawsuit.

172
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:54,659
That's great.

173
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,618
Zao is with Mao now

174
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,939
to pick up Dingding.

175
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,379
They'll be back tonight.

176
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,659
Okay.

177
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:12,218
Mom, I know.

178
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:15,218
Zao being with Mao

179
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,218
makes you uncomfortable.

180
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,818
And I understand your concerns.

181
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,019
But Mao is someone
you've watched grow up.

182
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,899
You know her through and through.

183
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,299
They are together

184
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,618
because they genuinely like each other.

185
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,179
The most important thing is

186
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:33,618
during this time,

187
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,338
I've seen the two of them...

188
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,059
I didn't say I disagree.

189
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,978
Look, I am the narrow-minded one.

190
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,299
I knew my mom is the most understanding.

191
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,259
Huan.

192
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,818
Now that Zao's matter has been settled,

193
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,779
I can rest assured.

194
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:59,379
Your marriage with Zhiming

195
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,019
needs to be brought up on the agenda.

196
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,659
Career is important,

197
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,098
but

198
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:10,458
it's not good for a girl
to have children too late.

199
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:15,818
Having children will affect your career,

200
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,139
but you can't not have them.

201
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,899
- But after giving birth...
- Mom.

202
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:21,779
- Mom.
- Give birth...

203
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,698
What are you nagging about?

204
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:25,218
What's the matter?

205
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:27,419
It's nothing.

206
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,618
I'm actually quite happy.

207
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:34,978
I'm relieved.

208
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:41,818
You've all grown up.

209
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:46,259
But I'm old now.

210
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,899
I can't help you with anything.

211
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:54,218
I can only nag all day.

212
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:55,939
You're talking nonsense.

213
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:57,578
You're not old.

214
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,818
In my heart, you're always
the youngest and most beautiful.

215
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,779
Stop overthinking every day, alright?

216
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:05,698
Mom, don't worry.

217
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,299
Even if Zao and I start a family later,

218
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,659
we will be good to you.

219
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:10,779
You will always be

220
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,379
the stabilizing force in our home.

221
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,259
Remember to be a bit nicer to Dad.

222
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,218
I got it.

223
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,659
Tell Zao

224
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,858
to invite Mao and Dingding for dinner.

225
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,858
That's great.

226
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,218
If I tell Zao,

227
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:34,498
he'll surely be thrilled.

228
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,139
Why aren't you going to work?

229
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:42,978
Go to work.

230
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,818
Stop nagging around here.

231
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,098
Hurry up.

232
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,299
Quickly, someone will
look for you, go on.

233
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,578
Now you think I'm nagging.

234
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,019
Got it.

235
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,338
Here, I'll give you a kiss.

236
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:57,338
See you tonight.

237
00:14:59,019 --> 00:14:59,818
I'm off.

238
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,259
I'll tell Zao now.

239
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,019
Mom.

240
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,019
Did you miss me?

241
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:32,659
Yes, I did.

242
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:33,618
You did?

243
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,338
Good baby.

244
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:38,299
Song Huaimin.

245
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,419
Can you play with Uncle Zao for a bit?

246
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:44,779
Dingding.

247
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,539
Did you miss me?

248
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,139
Yes, I did.

249
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:48,939
You did?

250
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,458
Why do you look so sour?

251
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,618
Although we're no longer
husband and wife,

252
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,939
we're still Dingding's parents.

253
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:00,578
- You can visit regularly.
- Are you hot?

254
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:01,299
Nope.

255
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,179
But please, have some grace.

256
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,098
Be a good father.

257
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,218
I hope you'll have some grace as well.

258
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,218
Try to come alone

259
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,618
to pick up the child.

260
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,179
Dingding.

261
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,179
Listen to Mom.

262
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,179
Goodbye, Dad.

263
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,019
Shall we go have a feast?

264
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:27,818
Yay!

265
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:29,818
We should go home to eat.

266
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,098
My sister told me

267
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,539
that Ms. Liu had prepared
a Manchu-Han Imperial Feast for us

268
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,818
as a celebration banquet.

269
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,338
I've now won the lawsuit

270
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,338
and I've protected
the person I care about.

271
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,419
I think there's nothing
for Mom to worry about.

272
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:48,539
Let's go home now

273
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,019
and give my parents an explanation.

274
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,738
Thank you for all you have done
for Dingding and me.

275
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,818
Mom, I'm hungry.

276
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:02,899
Dingding is hungry.

277
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,619
Come on, let's get on the plane.

278
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,419
Let's go.

279
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:11,778
What do you want to eat later?

280
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:12,419
Anything's fine.

281
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,619
What do you want to eat?

282
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,698
You'll make me nauseous later.

283
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,209
(Wedding Schedule)
Miss Mai. Our wedding schedule is booked

284
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,339
until the end of the year.

285
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,659
Many customers are inquiring about dates for next year.

286
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:27,058
We can open up reservations
for the following period.

287
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,099
Every department is working
together harmoniously

288
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,179
and professionally.

289
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,579
I have great trust in everyone.

290
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:35,179
Since being named one of the top
ten featured hotels,

291
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:38,018
our business at Xing'anli
is getting better and better.

292
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,218
Thanks to everyone's joint efforts,

293
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,778
we have achieved such results today.

294
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,619
Mr. Cui, Duoduo.

295
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,058
Hurry home after you finish work today.

296
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,139
- Okay.
- Okay.

297
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,099
You should rest early too.

298
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,899
Rest early.

299
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:49,538
Let's go.

300
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:02,099
Mr. Yao, it's time to get off work

301
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,258
and go home for dinner.

302
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,018
Okay, Mr. Mai and I will
come to pick you up.

303
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,698
Guys, thank you for your hard work.

304
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,258
Except for those
who need to stay on duty,

305
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,298
the rest of you

306
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:21,819
can clock out when it's time.

307
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:24,579
I do not advocate
for unnecessary overtime.

308
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:29,099
You must also learn
to balance work and life well.

309
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,258
Here, let me translate it.

310
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,018
What Mr. Yao means

311
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,018
is that the new East China Region
should take on a new outlook.

312
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,218
Work should be efficient,

313
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:43,419
and life should be rich and colorful.

314
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:44,819
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

315
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,738
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

316
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:02,579
Yao.

317
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,099
How does it feel to be a driver?

318
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,099
Not bad.

319
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:08,419
Mai,

320
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,218
how do you feel?

321
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,298
Great.

322
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,939
Grandma, we're back.

323
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,939
Dingding, go find Grandma.

324
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:24,978
Mrs. Mai.

325
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:25,778
Mom.

326
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:29,619
Mom.

327
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,419
Where did Grandma go?

328
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,099
Mom.

329
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,659
Such a sumptuous meal.

330
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,339
Do you like it, Dingding?

331
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:39,139
There are so many dishes.

332
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:40,018
Sit down.

333
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:44,859
Mom's not upstairs.

334
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:46,939
Did she go out?

335
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:48,099
That's weird.

336
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,458
She never goes out at this time.

337
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,339
She should be waiting at home for us.

338
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,619
It's okay. I'll give her a call.

339
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,058
You haven't washed your hands yet.

340
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,419
Go wash them in a moment.

341
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,099
Right.

342
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,058
Her phone is turned off.

343
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,619
Maybe it's out of battery?

344
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:05,298
Alright.

345
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,218
Let's wait.

346
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:08,619
Wait until she gets back.

347
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:09,498
- Okay.
- Okay.

348
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,218
Go wash your hands, Dingding.

349
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:13,659
Uncle Zao will take you
to wash your hands, come on.

350
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:17,458
Take a seat, come on.

351
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:29,738
Hello, the number
you have dialed is switched off.

352
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:43,258
Hello, the number
you have dialed is switched off.

353
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,778
It's been turned off the whole time.

354
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:47,778
Where could she go this late?

355
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,419
Huan, we've been waiting so long.

356
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,778
Let's not wait.

357
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,099
Let's go look for her.

358
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,179
Alright, let's split up
and search for her.

359
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,339
Go to the places Mom usually visits.

360
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,738
Zhiming, wait at home for us.

361
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,498
Okay, be careful.

362
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,778
I'll take Dingding to my mom's place.

363
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,018
He has kindergarten tomorrow.

364
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,419
Then I'll come back to meet up with you.

365
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:11,579
Okay.

366
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,619
Let us know as soon as she comes back.

367
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:14,778
Time to get up.

368
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,139
Come on.

369
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,058
Hello, excuse me,
may I ask you something?

370
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,778
Have you seen this person?

371
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:32,579
No, I haven't.

372
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:33,498
Thank you.

(Wanjiayan Store)

374
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,978
Mr. Wang, have you seen my mother?

375
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:41,698
No.

376
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,139
I haven't seen her.

377
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,978
Zao, have you found her?

378
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:47,859
No.

379
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,899
Let's check out the longtang up ahead.

380
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,339
Hands out flat.

381
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,419
Out flat, right?

382
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,819
Wang, Wang.

383
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,619
Have you seen my wife?

384
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:58,778
I haven't seen her all day.

385
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,258
She hasn't come by at all today?

386
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:01,298
- Nope.
- We haven't seen her.

387
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:03,099
Thank you, thank you.

388
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:08,738
If you see Yu,

389
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,458
tell her to come home.

390
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,139
Okay, okay.

391
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:12,058
We're looking for her.

392
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:12,579
Thank you.

393
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:14,339
Hello, He Dong.

394
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:17,179
Go to the police station
and report it now.

395
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:18,419
Ms. Liu is missing.

396
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,099
Yes.

397
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:22,778
Okay, hurry.

398
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,498
Excuse me,
I'd like to ask you something.

399
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,179
Have you seen this person?

400
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:55,179
No.

401
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,218
Thank you.

402
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:57,298
You're welcome.

403
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:01,419
Zhiming.

404
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:02,458
Hello, Chenghuan.

405
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,419
I think you should come back.

406
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:05,939
I think Ms. Liu

407
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,579
has run away from home.

408
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:10,619
I'm coming back now.

409
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:13,579
Zhiming.

410
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,579
Huan said that you

411
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:16,978
asked us all to come back.

412
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,778
Did you find her?

413
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,579
I noticed that Ms. Liu
didn't take the keys with her

414
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,258
and the family portrait
in the living room is missing.

415
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:25,698
I looked for it in many places

416
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:26,698
and didn't find it.

417
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:28,179
So I think maybe Ms. Liu

418
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,298
planned to leave.

419
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:31,819
Planned to leave?

420
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:32,538
Zhiming.

421
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:33,619
Huan.

422
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,339
Dad.

423
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:35,778
How is it?

424
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,579
I went to the central park,
but she wasn't there.

425
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,218
The family portrait
in the living room is gone.

426
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,859
Did your mom take it?

427
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,498
Huan. Huan.

428
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:46,179
How, how is it?

429
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,419
We asked many neighbors
near the old house

430
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:49,698
and they said they hadn't seen her.

431
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:50,698
Two ladies mentioned seeing

432
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,419
her on the street the other day,

433
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,899
and she looked a bit pale.

434
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,218
She didn't respond to them.

435
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:57,659
That's strange.

436
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:02,899
Is that her? Let's go.

437
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,498
Hello, your parcel.

438
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,018
Thank you.

439
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:15,298
Excuse me, I'd like to ask

440
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:18,018
when Ms. Liu ordered this.

441
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,978
Around noon, probably after lunch.

442
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:22,218
She said it was important

443
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:23,778
and asked me to deliver it after dinner.

444
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,179
I'll leave if that's fine.

445
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:25,899
Thank you very much.

446
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:27,778
It's from Mom.

447
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,018
Let's take a look.

448
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,458
(Was the dinner delicious?)

449
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,738
(No matter how delicious, there's no
fortune to taste it anymore.)

450
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,218
(Today I stand watch
for the last shift.)

451
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:52,659
(Tomorrow you'll have
to learn to look after yourselves.)

452
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,538
(Because I have already left.)

453
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,058
(I am sick.)

454
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,258
(But I have come to terms with it.)

455
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,218
(I have taken care of you all
for most of my life.)

456
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:05,899
(In my final moments,)

457
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,379
(I want some peace and quiet time)

458
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,179
(to see the beautiful
mountains and rivers.)

459
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,419
(Who knows? If my mood improves,)

460
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,218
(the illness might just go away.)

461
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,859
(You don't need to worry
too much about me)

462
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:21,778
(or look for me.)

463
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:23,939
(This is my own choice.)

464
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:27,099
(I hope you can respect my decision.)

465
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,018
(Finally, let me give you
a few more pieces of advice.)

466
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,379
(Huan, Zao.)

467
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,298
(Take more time to care
for your Dad when you can.)

468
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:38,659
(Now that you both have partners,)

469
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,419
(he is the only one left alone.)

470
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,778
(He'll get lonely.)

471
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:46,659
(Take him out to have fun
when you have time.)

472
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,218
(Fishing)

473
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,939
(traveling and such.)

474
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,579
(If he wants to drink a little,)

475
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:53,899
(just let him.)

476
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:55,298
(It's no big deal.)

477
00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:58,619
(Don't miss me too much.)

478
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:00,899
(Love, your mom.)

479
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:37,778
Mom.

480
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:40,738
In a little while,

481
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,419
I will come to be with you.

482
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,939
I used to call you 'Mom'

483
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:52,058
to please you.

484
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,579
But today, I mean it from my heart.

485
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:00,339
Mom.

486
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,978
You, as the spirit in heaven,

487
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:05,339
please bless Mai,

488
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,538
bless the children,

489
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:11,619
and bless our family.

490
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,179
Mom.

491
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,218
You must be lonely

492
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,939
up there.

493
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:32,738
In a little while,

494
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:35,939
I will come to be with you

495
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:41,339
and take good care of you.

496
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,698
It's all my fault.

497
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,458
Your mom was having problems

498
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,619
with her health,

499
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:01,139
and I didn't even notice.

500
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:03,579
I was careless.

501
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:05,939
It's all my fault.

502
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:08,179
Zao.

503
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:10,538
Dad.

504
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:16,058
Dad, this isn't your fault.

505
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:20,379
None of us noticed or realized it.

506
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,859
The most important thing now
is to find Mom.

507
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,538
Don't break down before we find her.

508
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:28,659
Dad, please think again.

509
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,778
Is there any place else
Mom might have gone?

510
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:34,819
We've looked everywhere we should.

511
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:35,939
Where else could she be?

512
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:40,538
The police just called me.

513
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:42,659
They said they found Ms. Liu's
ticket purchase records.

514
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,058
They said she went to Anhui.

515
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,179
Anhui?

516
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:47,258
- Anhui?
- Anhui.

517
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:49,298
Did they mention where
specifically she went in Anhui?

518
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:51,218
Ji-Jixi?

519
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,458
Isn't that my mom's hometown?

520
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:56,619
Quickly, call her sister.

521
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:57,379
Right, right.

522
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,978
I'll call Auntie. Maybe my mom has gone
back to her hometown.

523
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:14,978
Huan.

524
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,258
How come you have time to call me?

525
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:18,498
Are you all doing well?

526
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:19,939
We're good.

527
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,899
Auntie, are you at home now?

528
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:24,339
Did my mom, did my mom go to see you?

529
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,819
Has your mom returned to her hometown?

530
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,218
I don't know.

531
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:30,859
We brought Qiu to Wuyuan for fun.

532
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,899
Jie should be at home now.

533
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,379
I'll ask right away.

534
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:35,778
Okay, okay.

535
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,218
Then I'll hold, Auntie.

536
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:38,458
I'll just wait like this.

537
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:39,738
Fang.

538
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:41,579
Make a call to Jie.

539
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:42,978
Why don't you do it?

540
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,139
Come on.

541
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:45,819
Call him.

542
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:49,018
He will go and ask Fang Jie.

543
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:52,018
Hello, Jie,

544
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:54,179
has your auntie come to our place?

545
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,058
Has she called you?

546
00:29:58,698 --> 00:29:59,538
No.

547
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,139
Huan, Jie said your mom
hasn't been there,

548
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,819
nor has anyone called him.

549
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:08,099
I did send a message to your mom before,

550
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,579
asking her to come home if she had time.

551
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,099
But she never came.

552
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,778
Huan, what exactly is going on?

553
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:15,859
What happened?

554
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:18,298
Grandma, I'm going to take a bath
and go to bed.

555
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,379
It's okay. It's fine, Auntie.

556
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,939
I, I had a fight with my mom.

557
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:26,458
My mom is a bit angry
and might have gone into hiding.

558
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,018
Aunt, if my mom calls you

559
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,738
or if she comes to look for you,

560
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,458
please tell me right away.

561
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:34,099
Okay, okay, got it.

562
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:35,619
Don't worry for now.

563
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:36,978
Huan.

564
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,819
Aunt wants to have a word with you.

565
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,058
You young people are busy
working all day and night.

566
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,738
Your mom has it hard.

567
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,819
You should be more considerate of her.

568
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,819
I know, Aunt, don't worry.

569
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,218
Grandma, I'm going to take a bath
and go to bed.

570
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:57,058
Aunt, go take care of Qiu first.

571
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:57,899
Grandma.

572
00:30:58,738 --> 00:30:59,819
Then, goodbye.

573
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,738
This temper of Yu, you know.

574
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,339
She has a quarrel with her daughter,

575
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,659
and she disappears.

576
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:10,058
It's okay. That's how she is.

577
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:12,819
Where could she go?

578
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,379
Mom didn't go to Aunt's house.

579
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,258
Is it possible she went
back to Shang Village?

580
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,738
Grandma's old house is there.

581
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,339
Right, right.

582
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,258
It's possible.

583
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,058
Mom might have gone
back to the old house.

(Jixi North Railway Station)

585
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:50,579
Where are you going?

586
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:51,498
Shang Village.

587
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:53,619
Shang Village is so far.

588
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:54,778
It takes more than two hours.

589
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:56,179
I'll be making a fruitless trip back.

590
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,379
Sir, I will pay
for the round-trip, okay?

591
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:01,579
Get in, get in.

592
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:02,619
Thank you.

593
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,698
Zhiming.

594
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,218
Today, you come with me to the old house

595
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:15,218
and see if Mom is there.

596
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:15,579
Okay.

597
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:16,379
Let's leave now.

598
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,579
Wait, you all have work.

599
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,619
I'll go. I'll go to Shang Village.

600
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,099
No, let us young people will go.

601
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,139
- Let's go together.
- We'll go.

602
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:25,738
Stop talking, just listen
to me today, okay?

603
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,179
Tonight, Zhiming and I will go there.

604
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,218
Everyone else, stay at home.

605
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:30,419
Dad, tomorrow morning,

606
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,018
take Zao and Mao to the hospital

607
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:34,298
and check my mom's medical records.

608
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,379
Let's keep in touch.

609
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:36,899
Zhiming, we leave now.

610
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:38,538
Really, just the two of you?

611
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:40,139
Be careful on your way.

612
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,139
Don't worry.

613
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,379
Drive safely.

614
00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:44,498
Did you bring the car keys?

615
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:45,099
I did.

616
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,218
Hello, the number you have dialed
is switched off.

617
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:10,419
Dad.

618
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:12,899
Mom.

619
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:16,379
I'm back.

620
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,779
Mom.

621
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:02,538
I'm back.

622
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,259
I'm back.

(Anhui Transportation Holding Group)

624
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,819
Hello, the number you have dialed
is switched off.

625
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,299
I'm fine. I'm pretty good.

626
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,419
It's just a stomach ache.

627
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:47,419
Mom.

628
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:50,098
Why didn't you say goodbye to me?

629
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:03,299
Have something to eat.

630
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:06,618
It's been so long.

631
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:08,578
You should eat something

632
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,859
before you wreck your body.

633
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:14,658
Rest assured.

634
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,498
Your mom will definitely be fine.

635
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,018
I just feel very guilty.

636
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:25,939
Recently,

637
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,658
I have noticed that something
was off with my mom.

638
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:33,899
But it was habitual thinking. I thought
she was worrying over nothing.

639
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:38,978
Give me the car keys.

640
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,498
You've been driving all night.

641
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:43,538
Let me drive.

642
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,219
Give me the car keys. I'm okay.

643
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:25,699
Zhiming, this way.

644
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,018
This is it.

645
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,339
The door isn't locked.

646
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,779
It's locked from the inside.
My mom must be inside.

647
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:49,058
Wait a moment.

648
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,739
Be careful, Zhiming.

649
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,259
Can you open it?

650
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:25,138
Ms. Liu.

651
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,018
Mom.

652
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,819
Mom, are you inside? It's Huan.

653
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:35,699
You, if you're inside,
can you open the door, please?

654
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,978
Mom, even if you are sick,

655
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:44,578
you have to come back with me
so we can get you treatment.

656
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,658
Do you know how worried and anxious

657
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:50,178
Dad and Zao are at home?

658
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,339
Zhiming and I didn't sleep all night.

659
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,699
We drove over here overnight

660
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,018
because we were worried.

661
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:57,178
Can you please stop being so selfish?

662
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:58,498
We are a family.

663
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:00,538
Can't we just talk things over nicely?

664
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:02,779
Mom?

665
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,419
She's inside.

666
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,419
Mom.

667
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,699
Mom, are you okay? Mom?

668
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,259
Mom.

669
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:23,939
Liu Wanyu!

670
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:30,138
You scared me!

671
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:33,618
How can you be so selfish?

672
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,299
How could you just leave
without a care and only a letter?

673
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:40,978
Do you know how worried
everyone has been about you?

674
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,699
Dad was so worried he cried.

675
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:46,299
We thought something
had happened to you.

676
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,739
Can't you stop being so capricious?

677
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:51,498
Can't we just talk
about it face-to-face?

678
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,819
Did you hear me?

679
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:00,779
I'm asking if you heard what I said.

680
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:06,779
I have given

681
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:10,138
my whole life to this family.

682
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:12,658
You've grown up.

683
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,138
You can take care of your dad now.

684
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:22,978
I just want to be alone and quiet.

685
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:35,899
Didn't you say
you wanted your own space?

686
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:41,098
I want my own space too.

687
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,058
Zao.

688
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:36,699
Hey, Huan, I've got Mom's report.

689
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:38,458
It shows there's a tumor in her lung.

690
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,339
But it can't be diagnosed
with just a CT scan.

691
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:41,819
A further biopsy is needed.

692
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:43,658
Come on.

693
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:44,859
Huan.

694
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:47,219
Have you found your mom?

695
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,419
I'll take it.

696
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,859
Hey, Mr. Mai, we've found Mrs. Mai

697
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:57,739
