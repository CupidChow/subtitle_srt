=Episode 12=

3
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:45,211
Have this "Forget Your Worries",
and your troubles will...

4
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:02,172
Chicken legs and wings on discount.
Come and take a look.

5
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,612
Chicken wings on discount.

6
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:12,451
Mao and Zao took turns to cheer Huan up.

7
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,731
But she's still so upset.

8
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,932
She just broke up.

9
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,532
It's never easy to get over it.

10
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:24,851
Besides, she's been
dating Jialiang for years.

11
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,451
It's bound to be a tough ordeal.

12
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:33,451
I can see that
Huan can't let go of Jialiang.

13
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,851
You know our daughter.

14
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,851
She would rather break up

15
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,851
than let you suffer the slightest.

16
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,851
I didn't ask them to break up.

17
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,611
I didn't want them to.

18
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,772
How I wish they could stay together.

19
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,411
It's all my fault
that I spoke so recklessly

20
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,171
at their place that day.

21
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:58,332
I got carried away

22
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,812
and put my daughter in a dilemma.

23
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:04,332
Should I

24
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,131
apologize to them in person tomorrow?

25
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,131
Just leave it be.

26
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,372
I think

27
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,571
Huan knows what she's doing.

28
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,851
Of course, she does.

29
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,932
But I'm worried about her.

30
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:27,171
I wouldn't worry if she's all right.

31
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,252
Ma'am.

32
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,571
How are you?

33
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:12,731
How come you're here?

34
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,052
What brings you here?

35
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:18,132
I'm usually busy driving

36
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,892
with little free time.

37
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,731
And I-I'm not good with words,

38
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,532
so I dare not come often

39
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,411
to bother you.

40
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,291
Don't be nervous.

41
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:30,851
Come in and sit.

42
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:52,611
You've sent Chenghuan
to keep me company over the years.

43
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:55,291
I really appreciate it.

44
00:04:56,851 --> 00:05:00,251
If you have
something to say, just say it.

45
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,731
I would like...

46
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:05,731
I would like you

47
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:09,092
to help us give Huan some guidance.

48
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:12,132
What have you pressured her into again?

49
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,291
Here's the thing.

50
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,692
Chenghuan's mother

51
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,212
agreed to help

52
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,532
the Xin family with their business.

53
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,092
But she knows nothing about it.

54
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:29,851
In the end, the deal fell through
and Huan was demoted

55
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:32,532
to be an apartment manager.

56
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,892
She also fell out with Jialiang.

57
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,371
My wife was worried about our daughter,

58
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,371
so she went to our in-laws' place

59
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,452
to explain everything.

60
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:44,811
But they ended up

61
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,731
fighting again.

62
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:51,811
Huan wanted to defend her mom

63
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,851
and broke up with Jialiang on the spot.

64
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:57,731
She hasn't eaten
or drunk anything or opened up

65
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,012
for days.

66
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,652
She said she was fine.

67
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:03,851
But how is that fine, right?

68
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:08,132
It's the trouble
you've caused as her parents.

69
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:12,132
Why would you expect me
to tidy up your mess?

70
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,332
You're right.

71
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:17,251
W-We don't know how to comfort her.

72
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,931
Huan is an honest child.

73
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,371
She's been very serious

74
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,731
about this relationship.

75
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,731
Now they've broken up.

76
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,972
I'm sure it hurts more than anything.

77
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:31,692
It was her first love.

78
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,092
She listens to you.

79
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,132
Please give her some advice.

80
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,611
Please.

81
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,051
It's been years.

82
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:44,811
Mai.

83
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:46,731
You've aged too.

84
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,012
Alright.

85
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:54,171
I'll talk to her when she comes.

86
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:56,931
Thank you.

87
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,692
Thank you so much.

88
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,171
Don't mention it.

89
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,572
Well...

90
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:07,092
I will leave you to rest.

91
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,171
J-Just stay.

92
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,092
Okay.

93
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,051
Goodbye.

94
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:32,772
Grandma.

95
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:36,251
Come here. Hurry.

96
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,212
Grandma, you scared me to death.

97
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,491
I thought something happened
when you called me.

98
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:42,212
Are you okay?

99
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,972
It's not me who's in trouble. It's you.

100
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:46,092
Look at your leg.

101
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,491
You fell?

102
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:49,892
Does it hurt?

103
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:50,972
It's just a minor injury.

104
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,731
- Sit.
- It'll be fine in a couple of days.

105
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,652
A minor injury is still an injury.

106
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,251
Look at you.

107
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,332
If I hadn't called you,

108
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,291
you wouldn't have told me.

109
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,051
I know.

110
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,371
My sweetie has been mistreated.

111
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,171
Grandma.

112
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,131
Go ahead and cry.

113
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,771
It'll be better once you cry it out.

114
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,052
Grandma.

115
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:47,371
My family and Jialiang's family

116
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:50,052
are too far apart.

117
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:54,131
There's no way to resolve it anymore.

118
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,891
Actually, I don't regret breaking up.

119
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,771
I'm not afraid of breaking up.

120
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,332
I just feel that

121
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:09,052
I've invested three years
of my life in this relationship

122
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:12,292
but it ended in such a nasty way.

123
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,891
It's hard to accept.

124
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,131
And it upsets me.

125
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,011
Grandma.

126
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,092
I used to think that

127
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,891
people become stronger
as they grow older.

128
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,891
But now, why do I feel that

129
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,771
we get more vulnerable as we age?

130
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:37,251
It's okay.

131
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:38,812
Here.

132
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,531
Huan,

133
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,292
I'm in my eighties.

134
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,491
I've had two marriages

135
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,731
and have met countless people.

136
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,692
This child, Jialiang,

137
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:02,812
has a decent character

138
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,611
and a fine family background.

139
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:08,692
The two of you
have deep feelings for each other.

140
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:11,412
But he lacks

141
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,692
a backbone.

142
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,692
If I'm in a relationship
with someone like that,

143
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,452
I would say,

144
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,692
it's good to say goodbye

145
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,771
and the next one will be better.

146
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,491
Grandma.

147
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,812
Where did you learn all this?

148
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,172
It's quite trendy.

149
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,651
I have to

150
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,371
keep up with you in conversation.

151
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,491
You see.

152
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,412
If you hurt your leg,

153
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,052
Granny will rub it for you.

154
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,011
If your heart is broken,

155
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,292
just come to Granny.

156
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:55,932
This is your safe harbor.

157
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,212
Grandma.

158
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:02,131
Life

159
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,851
is long.

160
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,251
Birth, aging, sickness, and death.

161
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,972
Unreciprocated love.

162
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:10,692
A breakup

163
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,491
is nothing more

164
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,212
than a trip and fall.

165
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,692
Don't be disappointed in yourself.

166
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,851
And don't let those who look down on us

167
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:22,812
get smug.

168
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,891
We are free to cry,

169
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:30,412
but we must cry with good reason.

170
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,531
After the pain and tears,

171
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,972
just get back up. All will be well.

172
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,692
We must always

173
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:47,771
look forward.

174
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:49,812
Rest assured.

175
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:55,812
Granny's got your back.

176
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,452
My darling, don't cry.

177
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:10,332
I will treat you to something nice.

178
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,692
Okay?

179
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,011
Okay.

180
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,172
Good day, ma'am.

181
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,172
Hello, be casual.

182
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,371
Good day, ma'am.

183
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,092
Hello.

184
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,440
Grandma, how come everyone in Xing'anli

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,932
knows you?

186
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:33,812
You know I often come here for tea.

187
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,572
You're so popular.

188
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,052
This is our newly developed
braised pork.

189
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,371
Have a taste.

190
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,212
Call me if you need anything.

191
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,452
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

192
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,891
This is their new dish.

193
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,812
Try it and see if it's tasty.

194
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,452
It's so nice, Grandma.

195
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,011
So you brought me here for delicacies.

196
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,251
You really know how to enjoy life.

197
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,651
When you feel down,

198
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:15,891
eat properly.

199
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:19,412
We are friends over meals.

200
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,651
Then I'll take advantage of you
to enjoy meals.

201
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,212
Go ahead.

202
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:26,531
Dig in.

203
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,212
Huan.

204
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:31,572
How's your work going?

205
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:35,011
Being demoted to the apartment
means a pay cut.

206
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,531
- Do you want me to...
- Grandma.

207
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,352
It's fine for me

208
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,371
to work there.

209
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:42,851
I was demoted.

210
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,932
But everyone is nice to me.

211
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:47,491
I even got a five-star rating last week.

212
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:48,692
Don't worry about me.

213
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,531
I know.

214
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,891
You know

215
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:54,452
what you're doing.

216
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:58,972
It's just a pity.

217
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,412
I was hoping to work at Botticelli

218
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,452
and get a promotion.

219
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,771
Listen to me.

220
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:10,851
Your hard work

221
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:14,131
may not be rewarded immediately.

222
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,131
But don't get discouraged.

223
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,731
Because you never know

224
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,371
when your good fortune will arrive.

225
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,531
I won't forget it.

226
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:28,891
How is it?

227
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:32,052
Did I manage to boost your morale?

228
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,692
I'm so high-spirited now.

229
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,011
Dig in.

230
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,531
Darling, I've missed you so much.

231
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:57,371
Stop it.

232
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:58,972
We're at the company.

233
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,771
There's no one here.

234
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:04,092
Why did you come here?

235
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,891
I missed you, that's why.

236
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,932
I quit the job as you told me to.

237
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,092
This is not what you promised me.

238
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:16,771
You said you liked me
and wanted to be with me forever.

239
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,011
We are both well aware

240
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:20,651
of what that's

241
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:22,052
supposed to mean.

242
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,371
I'll visit you

243
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:27,972
if you behave.

244
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:31,052
But if you keep coming to the company,

245
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,651
we'll have to break up.

246
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,572
So when will you visit me?

247
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,692
I've learned to make a new dessert

248
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,011
just for you.

249
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,172
I'm busy.

250
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,212
I have a dinner meeting today.

251
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,467
(Delete this album?)

252
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:13,091
How come you're so nice

253
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,172
to bring me bird's nest soup?

254
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,091
You taught me well.

255
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:21,251
I think you need a good scolding.

256
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,571
Look what you've done.

257
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,531
Grandma, I'm sorry.

258
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,251
I haven't taken good care of Chenghuan.

259
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:32,091
But I have made arrangements.

260
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,011
I have faith in her.

261
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,412
It's just that

262
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:37,011
the leisurely job position

263
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,571
has undermined her sharpness.

264
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,251
So I transferred her

265
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,412
to the apartment to reshape her.

266
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,652
You're going to promote her?

267
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,692
She is my precious.

268
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:52,412
Don't just give lip service

269
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:55,491
and then forget about it.

270
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:57,692
I may be getting on in years,

271
00:17:58,132 --> 00:17:59,932
but I'm still keeping an eye

272
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,412
on everything.

273
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:04,011
Alright, Grandma, rest assured.

274
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:06,212
I'm not good at comforting people.

275
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,172
But I do have plans for Chenghuan.

276
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,051
Long-term plans.

277
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,771
Once you hand over Xing'anli to me,

278
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,811
I will manage it with care

279
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:16,811
and transfer her over

280
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,251
as a promotion.

281
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,091
Zhiming,

282
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:26,051
does it count as a threat?

283
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,011
Of course not.

284
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:29,612
I believe

285
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,692
that this is the best arrangement.

286
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,212
What about now?

287
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,251
Chenghuan is in low spirits
after the breakup.

288
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:50,571
You haven't traveled in a long time.

289
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:52,692
And Yueda happens to have developed

290
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:54,132
a new project near Shanghai,

291
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,212
which is also a renovated hotel.

292
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,251
I'll take you there for a visit

293
00:18:58,491 --> 00:18:59,652
and some fun.

294
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,011
You're trying to tie me down

295
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,412
with Chenghuan.

296
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,331
It seems like a leisurely trip,

297
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:10,531
but you intend to use this case

298
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:13,251
to show me
the possible future of Xing'anli.

299
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:16,612
This is your true intention, isn't it?

300
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:23,612
Grandma.

301
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,291
This will be the new landmark.

302
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:27,892
It'll be meaningful.

303
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,472
(Xing'anli Garden Hotel
M&amp;A Business Plan)

304
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:40,531
Zhiming,

305
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,771
when have you ever
valued meaningfulness?

306
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:47,932
Grandma.

307
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,612
Xing'anli is a stepping stone
for my promotion.

308
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,331
To me,

309
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:54,972
it is the most important

310
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,972
and indispensable piece.

311
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:00,892
You want power,

312
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,372
status,

313
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,452
and victory.

314
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:08,612
Grandma.

315
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,091
There's no reason to wait.

316
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:11,652
Let's go this weekend.

317
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,491
Ask Chenghuan.

318
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:14,972
I'll make the arrangements.

319
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,011
I'll think about it.

320
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:21,531
Alright.

321
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,731
Grandma, have some more.

322
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,652
Mom, what are you doing?

323
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,051
N-Nothing.

324
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,731
I got you some milk.

325
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,372
Have the milk and go to bed.

326
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,412
Okay.

327
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:53,852
Is there anything else?

328
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,291
Nothing.

329
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,051
There is something.

330
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,212
Well, this weekend,

331
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,692
the ladies in our dance troupe

332
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:03,051
want to organize

333
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,571
a cooking class. Will you come?

334
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:06,972
This...

335
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,212
Hold on, Mom. It's Granny.

336
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,771
Hello, Granny.

337
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,212
Huan, are you free this weekend?

338
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:17,612
This weekend?

339
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,452
Yeah, I am.

340
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,251
Let's go for a trip.

341
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,051
Okay.

342
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:28,692
Mom.

343
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,331
Go with her and have a good time.

344
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:32,771
Take good care of her.

345
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,692
Bring a jacket. It's still chilly.

346
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,132
Go to sleep.

347
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,452
I see.

348
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,291
(He Jing Nursing Home)
Huan, what are you wearing?

349
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:58,011
Are we going for a trip or a training?

350
00:21:58,652 --> 00:21:59,892
Granny, I've looked it up.

351
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,972
The sun will be fierce
and there will be mosquitoes.

352
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,771
And the small stream is full of leeches.

353
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:07,412
Your outfit is suited for Wukang Road.

354
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,272
I'm a professional, so you should

355
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,091
listen to me when it comes to mountains.

356
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,652
I wasn't in awe of your profession.

357
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:17,731
I apologize.

358
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:20,091
Follow my instructions from now on.

359
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:23,412
Grandma, just a second. I'll get a cab.

360
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:26,612
No need. I've booked one.

361
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:32,692
Grandma.

362
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,132
Zhiming will foot the bill this time.

363
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,612
It will help iron out
the conflicts between you.

364
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:43,692
What are you wearing?

365
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,491
Could you please open the trunk?

366
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,011
Grandma, just a second.

367
00:22:57,932 --> 00:22:59,091
Why are you upset?

368
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,600
There are plenty of men.

369
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,011
How do you know?

370
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:06,491
Let me help you.

371
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,892
No, thanks. You are a generous sponsor.

372
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,011
I got this.

373
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:16,331
You know what?

374
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:18,491
I've come to impress Grandma.

375
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:19,932
Don't hold me back.

376
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,531
Seriously, you're everywhere.

377
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:22,452
Of course.

378
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:24,811
Come on.

379
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:27,331
Be careful. There are valuables inside.

380
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:31,692
Did you hear something break?

381
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:33,852
Did it break?

382
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:36,251
I told you to be careful.

383
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:39,571
Oh no.

384
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:41,652
The dehumidifier is broken.

385
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,011
What did you bring that?

386
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,251
None of your business.

387
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:46,972
Grandma has rheumatism.
It's damp in the mountains.

388
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:56,972
Sorry about that.

389
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:12,331
Grandma, are you alright?

390
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:13,212
I'm fine.

391
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,491
Yao Zhiming.

392
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,531
It's a bad route.

393
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,491
The GPS shows another path.

394
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:25,652
It's a detour,

395
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:28,132
but it's flatter.

396
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,291
Let's take that road.

397
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,291
I've been taking this path for a year
and now you said it.

398
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:34,452
This road is the best choice.

399
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,172
A year?

400
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,692
You think you're humorous?

401
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,811
You didn't ask me earlier.

402
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,251
Can you drive slower?

403
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:47,091
It's making me feel sick.

404
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:49,811
Mai Chenghuan.

405
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,051
It's just a breakup.

406
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:53,531
Why are you picking on me?

407
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:54,932
Am I not driving slowly enough?

408
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:56,932
Yao Zhiming.

409
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,771
Let's stick to the facts.

410
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,892
What does it have to do with my breakup?

411
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:03,571
You're clearly a bad driver.

412
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,852
Yeah, right.
You drive so well. Take the wheel.

413
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,212
No problem, pull over and I'll drive.

414
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,811
What a bickering pair.

415
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:14,452
I will sign you up for the Open Mic

416
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,251
to perform stand-up comedy, okay?

417
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,172
No, thanks.

418
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,251
I don't want to either.

419
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,972
"I don't want to either"?

420
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,612
Even if I formed a team

421
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,852
to do stand-up c-c-comedy one day,

422
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,051
I wouldn't invite you.

423
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:30,132
I'm too good to be your teammate.

424
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:33,331
Stand-up c-c-comedy.

425
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,372
You'll form a team for stand-up comedy?

426
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:36,472
You're too good for me,

427
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:37,452
but not Xin Jialiang.

428
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,132
But they disagree with you.

429
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:40,531
What was that?

430
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,852
Y-You're mimicking me, huh?

431
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,184
You're mocking me?

432
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:45,811
Also, stick to the point.

433
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,172
Why did you bring him up?

434
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,892
What's wrong with you?

435
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:50,531
Everything's wrong with me.

436
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:52,612
I dare you to mention him again.

437
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:53,491
Xin Jialiang.

438
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,251
Again.

439
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,172
Xin Jialiang.

440
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:56,920
You...

441
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,011
Enough, stop arguing.

442
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,892
We're out for fun. Stop arguing.

443
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:04,452
Okay, Grandma.

444
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,051
I'll apologize to Chenghuan.

445
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:08,892
Chenghuan,

446
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,811
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:12,731
Grandma, did you see that?

448
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:14,051
That look on his face.

449
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,932
He didn't mean it at all.

450
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,692
What? Grandma, don't listen to her.

451
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,811
I was very sincere. Don't slander me.

452
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:24,731
You know what?

453
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:27,091
I refuse to accept your apology.

454
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:31,640
Tacky.

455
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:33,491
Tacky.

456
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,011
Grandma.

457
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,892
Yueda owns two traditional-style

458
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:03,932
luxury hotels.

459
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:05,172
One is in Singapore.

460
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:06,972
And the other is here.

461
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:10,011
Chenghuan, what do you think?

462
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,091
It's pretty nice.

463
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:15,652
It's luxurious.

464
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:17,731
I can see that it costs a huge fortune

465
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,051
and great efforts.

466
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:21,011
But Grandma.

467
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,932
The original architecture

468
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:24,531
had quite a charm.

469
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:26,571
But the renovation

470
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,612
took something out.

471
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:29,731
It's quite a pity.

472
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:33,051
That's right.

473
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:38,571
Why did you come in again?

474
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:39,892
I told you to play outside.

475
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,652
Kiddo.

476
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:45,172
Have some candy.

477
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,892
Share them with your friends, okay?

478
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:47,852
Thank you.

479
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:48,892
Go ahead.

480
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:54,331
Yao Zhiming, give me your ID.

481
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:55,852
I'll go check in.

482
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,372
Miss Mai, this way please.

483
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,224
I'll be back, Grandma.

484
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,132
Grandma.

485
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:05,852
What do you think of this place?

486
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,531
I don't quite like the way it looks now.

487
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:12,251
The renovation has taken away its soul.

488
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,612
Hotels like this,

489
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,291
be they in the mountains or by the sea,

490
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,291
in Shanghai or London,

491
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:19,571
are quite the same.

492
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:22,531
Grandma.

493
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,291
Business

494
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,852
is always about
output, input, and return.

495
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,331
Yueda has empowered this place

496
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:33,811
and turned this remote area
into a tourist site.

497
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:35,011
I'm confident that

498
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,944
we can make Xing'anli a top luxury hotel

499
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:40,412
even more high-end
and luxurious than this.

500
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:43,251
You're very much like your grandfather.

501
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:45,612
He always had the best strategies

502
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:48,251
and never missed a beat in business,

503
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,251
seeking to maximize benefits
in everything.

504
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:53,692
Actually, I've benefited greatly.

505
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:57,251
I think being a decent person

506
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:59,331
is just like cooking.

507
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:01,212
If you only seek

508
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:02,452
instant benefits,

509
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,331
then the cooking loses its soul.

510
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,011
The diners won't be willing

511
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,132
to pay for the dishes.

512
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:10,852
Yeah.

513
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:13,692
Grandma, you talk about souls,

514
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,652
emotions, and the human touch.

515
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:18,412
You might as well
tell me to be Mai Chenghuan.

516
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:24,771
Let's go.

517
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:36,731
How is it here?

518
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:40,771
Do you want the truth?

519
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,531
Then I'll say it.

520
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,491
This may be Yueda's luxury resort,

521
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,652
but the services are not so good.

522
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,172
Be more specific.

523
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:52,051
Look at the front desk staff.

524
00:29:52,212 --> 00:29:54,412
Some wear their name tags. Some don't.

525
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:57,172
And the cleaning staff

526
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:58,852
are crossing the lobby

527
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:00,852
and not sticking to the side.

528
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:03,731
The front desk
is not managing things well.

529
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,132
And look at these pastries.

530
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,771
Obviously wholesale,

531
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,132
cheap and not fresh.

532
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,972
All these expose
your operational standards.

533
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:14,731
A customer spends thousands
to stay for one night.

534
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:16,251
They are not fools.

535
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,932
M-Mr. Yao.

536
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:22,531
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,531
The hotel just opened.

538
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:25,852
The staff

539
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:27,811
we hired are mainly locals.

540
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:31,212
I believe these details

541
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,372
Miss Mai mentioned will be addressed

542
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,412
with regular training.

543
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:37,531
It's okay. No need for that.

544
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:39,612
Let's replace all the staff.

545
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,811
That's not what I meant.

546
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,132
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

547
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:47,412
Miss Mai, I've taken note of your words.

548
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:48,892
I will work on it now.

549
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,412
You don't have to be so extreme.

550
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,291
Drastic measures aren't cost-effective.

551
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,412
The hotel needs a set of standards.

552
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:04,892
These staff are locals.

553
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:07,212
How can they make a living
if you fire them?

554
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:08,251
Why do I care?

555
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,491
A hotel should be customer-oriented

556
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:11,452
or employee-oriented?

557
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,571
You are self-oriented,

558
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:15,811
always

559
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:16,811
prioritizing profit.

560
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,531
Are you still kids?

561
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,892
How did you manage
to argue about a hotel?

562
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:23,972
The wine is not bad.

563
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:26,612
Come and try it.

564
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:28,696
- Grandma.
- You can't drink.

565
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:36,612
Be careful, Grandma.

566
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,051
There are rocks here. Be careful.

567
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:39,692
Okay.

568
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,771
How is it? Fine environment, right?

569
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,932
It's nice.

570
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,571
Breathe some fresh air here.

571
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:54,011
We can't have it

572
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:55,212
back in Shanghai.

573
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:03,571
Grandma.

574
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:05,731
You've sweated a lot.

575
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,132
Have some water
to replenish your strength.

576
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:08,652
Okay.

577
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:12,051
Grandma, here.

578
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,172
Yao Zhiming, do you want water?

579
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:20,852
I don't mind sweating.

580
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,412
It's just that my feet hurt a bit.

581
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,331
Really?

582
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:27,852
Grandma, let me hold you.

583
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,132
No need.

584
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,331
We're here to hike.

585
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:33,331
How can I hold on to you?

586
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,091
Carry her things.

587
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:36,852
Be careful.

588
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:37,731
Take it slow.

589
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:38,491
Okay.

590
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,652
Come on, give me the bag.

591
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:42,652
Can you manage?

592
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,452
Of course.

593
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:47,251
Then I'll leave it to you.

594
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:53,372
Why are you carrying so much stuff?

595
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,652
Interesting question.

596
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:58,692
You drink branded water.

597
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,852
Do you expect to
buy food in the mountains?

598
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:02,172
If it's heavy,

599
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:04,771
eat and drink everything
and it'll be fine.

600
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:10,811
Hello.

601
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:12,932
Send the supplier details

602
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:16,011
of Tianhe Home Furnishing
for the next quarter to my email.

603
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,051
Supplier details

604
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:20,731
of Tianhe Home Furnishing
for the next quarter.

605
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:21,972
Hello?

606
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:23,571
He Dong.

607
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,091
Look at him.

608
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:27,132
He's in the woods,

609
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,172
but he's still bound by work.

610
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:30,612
Can you hear me?

611
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:31,932
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

612
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,892
There's something wrong with him.

613
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:37,652
Mai Chenghuan, I can hear you.

614
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:39,692
I'm your boss. Show some respect.

615
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:44,571
Sir, have you watched
any domestic soap drama?

616
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,652
There are many overbearing CEOs

617
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,291
just like you.

618
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,731
What nonsense.

619
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:54,731
Hello?

620
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:56,932
Can you hear me?

621
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:59,132
Send the supplier details

622
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:02,132
of Tianhe Home Furnishing
for the next quarter to my email.

623
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:05,811
Grandma, be careful.

624
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:08,332
Are your feet still hurting?

625
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:09,171
Just a little bit.

626
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:10,292
Still hurting?

627
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:13,091
Take it slow.

628
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:15,332
Grandma.

629
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,091
Sit over there to take a rest.

630
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:18,932
Alright.

631
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:22,932
Alright.

632
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:23,972
It's okay.

633
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:24,852
Sit here, Grandma.

634
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:30,732
I'm Ultraman.

635
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,211
Little Ultraman.

636
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:36,531
Why don't you play at the hotel?

637
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,932
Mom and Dad said I couldn't play there

638
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:40,491
or they would get scolded.

639
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:42,852
Why is that?

640
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,571
Do they work at the hotel?

641
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:45,651
Yeah.

642
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:53,332
Sir, look, you did a good deed.

643
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,892
It's good that
you built a luxury hotel here.

644
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:57,611
You helped the nearby villagers.

645
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:00,171
They work right at their doorstep,

646
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,372
and their kids won't be left alone.

647
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:03,131
So nice.

648
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,772
Kiddo.

649
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,452
Ultraman doesn't exist at all.

650
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:11,292
It's just a lie.

651
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:14,211
Only a kiddo like you
would believe in light.

652
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:20,651
Hey.

653
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,412
Yao Zhiming, now I'm sure

654
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:24,332
you have some serious issues.

655
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:25,691
I was telling the truth.

656
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,491
There's no Ultraman

657
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:28,531
or philanthropist.

658
00:35:28,812 --> 00:35:31,091
We must establish ourselves on our own.

659
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,892
I know what you're trying to say.

660
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:35,372
But I will still replace the staff.

661
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,252
Chenghuan.

662
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:52,611
Thank you for inviting me to a massage.

663
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,211
That long journey down the mountain path

664
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,932
really hurt my legs.

665
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:01,051
You're welcome, Granny.

666
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:03,372
If...

667
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:08,611
If it were only you and me
traveling this time,

668
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,011
it would be quite pleasant

669
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,772
to enjoy the scenery.

670
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,892
I know Zhiming

671
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,372
very well.

672
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,372
He's not bad by nature.

673
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:24,691
He's not bad by nature.

674
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:26,491
But he is cold-blooded and scheming.

675
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:29,571
He doesn't even
protect the innocence of children.

676
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:33,651
Maybe it's because
no one ever treated him well

677
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,852
when he was a child.

678
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:39,772
Day by day,

679
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:41,892
he grew up.

680
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:43,772
But deep down, he was still

681
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:47,651
that child who suffered hardships.

682
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:50,611
So he doesn't know

683
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,932
how to treat others.

684
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:01,252
Did Yao Zhiming suffer a lot
when he was young?

685
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:13,051
Kiddo.

686
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:15,732
Ultraman doesn't exist at all.

687
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:16,852
It's just a lie.

688
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,211
Only a kiddo like you
would believe in light.

689
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:25,252
A successful man
who has suffered childhood trauma.

690
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:55,131
Successful man.

691
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,011
Successful man, time for dinner.

692
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:00,651
Granny is waiting for us.

693
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,892
Granny is waiting...

694
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:11,772
Mai Chenghuan.

695
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:13,732
Yao Zhiming, what's wrong?

696
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,531
Yao Zhiming!

697
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,691
Yao Zhiming!

698
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:22,892
Someone.

699
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:25,131
Hey, excuse me!

700
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:26,252
Come over, please!

701
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:28,171
What's wrong?

702
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,131
My friend passed out.

703
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,091
Please get an ambulance.

704
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:32,852
Yao Zhiming!

705
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,651
- Yao Zhiming!
- Oh no.

706
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:35,852
It's getting dark.

707
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,252
There are no lights at night.

708
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:39,171
The ambulance crew
doesn't know the road.

709
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,571
It may cause a delay.

710
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,571
D-Do you have a first aid kit?

711
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,852
Or any medical personnel?

712
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:45,972
No, we don't.

713
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:48,491
But we know the mountain roads.

714
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,091
Shall we take him to the hospital?

715
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:51,091
Okay, that would be great!

716
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,292
- Let me get help.
- Okay.

717
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,412
Yao Zhiming!

718
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,571
Yao Zhiming, you're scaring me!

719
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,372
Yao Zhiming!

720
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,211
Yao Zhiming, hang in there.

721
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:03,531
Hang in there.

722
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:46,372
You woke up.

723
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:49,892
It's kidney stones. Let me get a doctor.

724
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:51,691
It's nothing.

725
00:39:52,412 --> 00:39:53,452
No need.

726
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:01,452
Let me get you some water.

727
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:07,852
Thank you.

728
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,452
Hello, He Dong.

729
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:14,131
I've reviewed
the new supplier's profile.

730
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:15,732
Skip their salespeople.

731
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,772
Contact Mr. Ye directly.

732
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:26,852
Tomorrow morning,
the meeting will proceed as usual.

733
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:28,691
Schedule the afternoon meeting too.

734
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,372
I'm going to send you feedback...

735
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:38,332
Mr. Yao, the world
doesn't end without you.

736
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:39,812
But your kidneys

737
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,772
won't make it if you don't drink water.

738
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,972
Put down the phone
and take good care of yourself.

739
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,252
Don't be so dramatic.

740
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,051
I had a bad fever due to

741
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:52,011
altitude sickness while hiking abroad.

742
00:40:52,011 --> 00:40:53,452
I still finished the work.

743
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,611
I'm not that fragile.

744
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:56,852
Work is endless.

745
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:58,412
But you only have two kidneys.

746
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,211
If you don't follow the doctor's orders

747
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,531
and rest well,

748
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:05,531
there will be consequences.

749
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:09,491
Is that a threat?

750
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:10,772
Me threatening you?

751
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,691
Why would I do that?

752
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:15,932
Why do I care
if you're self-destructive?

753
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:18,292
But

754
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,011
you wouldn't want
the whole company to find out

755
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,051
that Mr. Yao

756
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,772
passed a one-carat kidney stone, right?

757
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,131
Where is Grandma?

758
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:32,491
She came to see you last night.

759
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:33,688
Since you were okay,

760
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:35,211
I sent her back to rest.

761
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:38,932
I've finally realized
it's not good to live alone.

762
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:40,171
If anything happens,

763
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:42,732
no one will notice
because you live alone.

764
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:44,292
That would be terrible.

765
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:46,332
How could no one notice?

766
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:52,252
Hey Siri, my stomach hurts.

767
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:53,691
I need help.

768
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:57,131
Okay, master. I found a hospital nearby.

769
00:41:57,252 --> 00:41:58,491
It's 20 meters from you.

770
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:01,332
Siri, can you take him there?

771
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:04,171
Sorry, please repeat that.

772
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,651
Yao Zhiming.

773
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,452
If the hotel staff
hadn't helped yesterday,

774
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,332
I couldn't have carried you alone.

775
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:17,531
There was no emergency plan.

776
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,772
These clumsy methods

777
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:20,932
won't achieve much.

778
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:22,491
They can only pray for forgiveness.

779
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,491
Yeah, the hotel does have many issues.

780
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:29,171
But the front desk manager said that

781
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:30,812
they'd make things right.

782
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,412
The hotel staff

783
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:34,611
are mostly villagers from nearby.

784
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:37,412
It's a rare job opportunity for them.

785
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,691
Give them some time.

786
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:41,131
I believe

787
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:43,011
as long as they are proactive at work,

788
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:44,452
they will do better.

789
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:47,491
Also, you fainted yesterday.

790
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:50,011
The ambulance staff
didn't know the mountain road.

791
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,852
The hotel staff

792
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:53,812
brought you here.

793
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,372
Without them,

794
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,171
we don't know what you'd be like.
