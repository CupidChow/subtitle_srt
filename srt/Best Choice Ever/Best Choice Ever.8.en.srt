3
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,356
Jialiang and Chenghuan

4
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,235
are about to get married.

5
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,556
As their parents,

6
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,435
we can't let Chenghuan suffer with us

7
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,395
once she marries Jialiang.

8
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,476
M-Maybe we can talk about it

9
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,996
with Huan's dad once he's back.

10
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,636
I-I almost forgot something important.

11
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:53,836
What is it?

12
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:55,556
I'm also here

13
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,916
for Chenghuan's

14
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,675
younger brother, Zao.

15
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:00,196
Zao?

16
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,756
My son-in-law's law firm

17
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,196
is one of the big names in the industry.

18
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,156
Zao is about to graduate, isn't he?

19
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,316
It's really tough
for graduates to find jobs.

20
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,596
Hundreds and thousands of them
may compete for one position.

21
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,636
Exactly.

22
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:17,156
I was thinking.

23
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,795
If you don't mind,

24
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:19,835
we can ask Zao

25
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,515
to work for my son-in-law
to gain some experience.

26
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:24,636
It's a top priority

27
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,316
for a young man to get a job.

28
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,156
Look.

29
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,316
Fangyuan Law Firm.

30
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,675
I think Zao has mentioned it.

31
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:37,955
I even said that

32
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,275
it was a good name.

33
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,955
- Really?
- He's interning right there!

34
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,036
I just knew it.

35
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:45,675
We're meant to be family.

36
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,476
I'll tell my son-in-law

37
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,675
to end Zao's internship
and make him a formal employee directly.

38
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,356
That's great!

39
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,115
You have no idea

40
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:57,316
how hard it is for them to get jobs now.

41
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:57,995
Yeah.

42
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,436
He may be interning,

43
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,675
but it doesn't

44
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:01,795
secure anything, right?

45
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:03,156
- Exactly.
- He may end up

46
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,356
being disappointed.

47
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,115
Yeah.

48
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,356
Now I can rest easy.

49
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,636
Rest assured.

50
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,316
Alright, then. Rest assured.

51
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,715
I'll try my best

52
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:22,715
to talk to Mr. Yao.

53
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,555
I know he has a temper.

54
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,756
It's okay. I'll just... You know.

55
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,076
I'll speak for you.

56
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,596
You're too kind.

57
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,275
Theoretically,

58
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,036
I should deal with him in person.

59
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,156
No. Don't.

60
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,515
You don't even know him.

61
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:39,876
It's pointless, right?

62
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,076
Then I'll leave it to you.

63
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:42,555
No problem.

64
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:45,715
We are family, after all.
We should help each other.

65
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,156
Have some water.

66
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:48,156
- Okay
- The water.

67
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,156
The stove.

68
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:50,916
Easy.

69
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:52,395
It may get burnt.

70
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:53,756
I forgot about it.

71
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,955
It's okay. Thank goodness.

72
00:03:58,955 --> 00:03:59,835
It's fine.

73
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:00,275
Okay.

74
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,115
Just right.

75
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,595
Is Mr. Yao here?

76
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:42,475
Mr. Yao.

77
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,475
I'm looking for Mr. Yao.

78
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:04,636
Mr. Yao.

79
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:05,752
- Excuse me.
- Yao...

80
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:07,116
You are...?

81
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:08,475
Where is Mr. Yao?

82
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,275
Sorry, Madam.

83
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,835
We're at work here.

84
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:11,955
So, you...

85
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:14,996
Mr. Yao.

86
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,076
Ms. Liu.

87
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,035
I-I need to talk to you.

88
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:19,876
Take a seat.

89
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,515
Bring some water.

90
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,236
Madam.

91
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,955
This place is great.

92
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,475
Ms. Liu, are you here

93
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,515
to buy insurance?

94
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,756
I got distracted.

95
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,955
Sorry, sorry.

96
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,196
Mr. Yao.

97
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,236
You've known Huan for so long

98
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,915
but I haven't ever cooked for you.

99
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,196
I made smoked fish for you.

100
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:51,715
It's as good as

101
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,955
what you get at restaurants.

102
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:55,515
Try it.

103
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,355
Thank you.

104
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,436
Ms. Liu.

105
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,915
Go ahead. What is it?

106
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,595
Well, it's nothing much.

107
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,955
I-I'll just cut to the chase.

108
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,796
I came to talk to you

109
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,116
about the Xin family's business.

110
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:17,035
Our family and the Xin family

111
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,835
are still not so harmonious

112
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,636
or coordinated

113
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:24,275
on some matters,

114
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,756
but we will surely become one family.

115
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,395
They wanted me to visit you

116
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,676
to see

117
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:34,475
if you could support them
in their business.

118
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,715
I was thinking.

119
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,236
It would be good
for you to support them.

120
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,636
You'd have one more

121
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,595
person to trust, right?

122
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,515
Ms. Liu, it's not that
I don't want to help you.

123
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:46,955
I'm curious.

124
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,035
Does Mai Chenghuan know about this?

125
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,076
She's very stubborn about

126
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,556
keeping work and personal life separate.

127
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,395
How did she come around it?

128
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,395
It's her marriage we're talking about.

129
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,756
It's no trivial matter.

130
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,155
As her mother,
I can make decisions on her behalf.

131
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:09,395
Holiday for me after this month finally.

132
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,475
Right, when is the wedding?

133
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,715
I'm an expert
in choosing wedding dresses.

134
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:14,915
I'll go with you.

135
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:15,876
I'm not in a hurry.

136
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:16,676
Chenghuan.

137
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:18,756
Your mom came to see Mr. Yao.

138
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:20,676
Take a look.

139
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:21,475
Oh no.

140
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:24,155
Send me that document.

141
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:25,275
It's on my desktop.

142
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,996
The password is my birthday.
Just open it.

143
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,796
So, please help the Xin family

144
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,756
with their business.

145
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,155
The two of us...

146
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:39,715
Mom, what are you doing here?

147
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,955
I-I...

148
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,196
I heard you mentioning
the Xin family's business.

149
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:48,556
What did you tell Mr. Yao?

150
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:50,955
Here's the thing.

151
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,876
It's about the tender meeting...

152
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,715
- Mr. Yao...
- Tender meeting?

153
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,436
Mom, this is my workplace.

154
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:02,876
Mr. Yao is my boss.

155
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,275
How can you approach him
for something like this?

156
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,515
Mr. Yao didn't disagree with it.

157
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:09,515
Mr. Yao, right?

158
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,116
Mr. Yao, I'm sorry.

159
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,915
I'll tell Xin Jialiang

160
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,955
to focus on the design.

161
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,236
Do what you need to do

162
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,636
with the tender meeting.

163
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:18,715
Sorry about that.

164
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:19,636
Mom, let's go.

165
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,355
Wait, I'm not done.

166
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:22,035
Let's go.

167
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:24,955
Mr. Yao, have the fish.

168
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:25,756
Take care.

169
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,987
It's okay.

170
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,156
Sir.

171
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,396
This fish has taken the bait

172
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,436
as you said.

173
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,556
And it's smoked fish.

174
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:50,076
It looks good. Have a try?

175
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,556
No, thanks.

176
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:53,316
Seriously...

177
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,955
What are you doing?

178
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,115
Mom, tell me.

179
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,316
What did you say to Mr. Yao?

180
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:01,115
Nothing much.

181
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,480
I barely said anything and you arrived.

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,196
No way.

183
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:05,916
I heard you

184
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,076
talking about the tender meeting.

185
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:09,196
What's going on?

186
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,235
Nothing.

187
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:14,235
We happen to know Mr. Yao
in this line of work.

188
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:15,436
Huan.

189
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,235
Mrs. Xin came in person to make peace.

190
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,755
She showed her respect.

191
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,835
We shouldn't act aloof.

192
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:25,475
Why can't Mr. Yao
do business with the Xin family?

193
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,316
He has to do it, anyway.

194
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,835
So,

195
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,556
Xin Jialiang's mom asked you

196
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:34,635
to talk to Mr. Yao
about the tender meeting, right?

197
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:37,875
Mom.

198
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,635
How can you be so confused?

199
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,436
You agreed to what she said
and rushed over?

200
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,556
Why didn't you tell me?

201
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,595
I've told you so many times.

202
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,916
I'll deal with the Xin family myself.

203
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,355
I've been working hard at the hotel

204
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,472
for seven years.

205
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:53,595
With you doing that,

206
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,516
how can I continue working here?

207
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,076
What's the big deal?

208
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,280
I was doing this for you.

209
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,176
Listen to me.

210
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:03,316
I have agreed to help her.

211
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:05,115
And what a coincidence

212
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:06,595
that your brother Zao

213
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,312
is interning at the law firm

214
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,196
opened by her son-in-law.

215
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,396
She was quite generous.

216
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,396
She promised to
make Zao a formal employee right away.

217
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,516
That was perfect.

218
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:15,276
Mom.

219
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,316
Why did you drag Zao into this?

220
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,196
Well...

221
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,676
The elevator. Come on.

222
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:23,955
It's here. See you.

223
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,196
See you.

224
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,916
Mrs. Mai doesn't know the rules.

225
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,235
But Chenghuan is pretty reasonable.

226
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,676
Are you sure you'll sacrifice her?

227
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:41,556
Maybe it's good for her

228
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,036
not to get married to him.

229
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,156
I think

230
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,595
the Xin family is not worthy of her.

231
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,475
They're free to break up.

232
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,676
But it's different when you

233
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:52,995
break it up for them.

234
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,115
Mai Chenghuan has her choices to make.

235
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,196
Notify Zhu Zheng.

236
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,475
Make Mai Chenghuan my private secretary.

237
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,995
She'll report directly to me

238
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,955
and be in charge of
the upcoming tender meeting.

239
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:12,036
You sure are scheming.

240
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,316
What's going on?

241
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:37,156
Chengzao's job is settled.

242
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,235
Huan's marriage is settled.

243
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,595
These are great news.

244
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:43,796
Why are you pulling long faces

245
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,076
as if I've done something wrong?

246
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:47,436
Mom,

247
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:50,235
how can you
approach Yao Zhiming for the Xin family

248
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,156
without my sister's permission?

249
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,396
Your sister is shy.
She'd feel embarrassed.

250
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:58,516
What's wrong with me doing it for her?

251
00:11:58,755 --> 00:11:59,835
Huan, tell us.

252
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,276
Don't you think the Xin family
showed us enough respect

253
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,635
and gave us a way out?

254
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:09,516
Mom.

255
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,516
Do you really think

256
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,995
she came to make amends
so that I'd marry her son?

257
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,156
Don't you know better?

258
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,755
I know.

259
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,595
You're worried about Zao's job.

260
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,115
At least ask for his opinion.

261
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:24,952
You did the same when I graduated.

262
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,835
You went straight to

263
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,875
Auntie Zhang Peisheng behind my back.

264
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,556
And all these years,

265
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:33,316
my colleagues have been
calling me the "favored one".

266
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,196
You're doing it again

267
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,316
with Zao.

268
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,396
Keep it down.

269
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,955
What's there to doubt
when the Xin family

270
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:43,355
is smoothing things over?

271
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,336
You're an outstanding lady.

272
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,916
They are definitely trying to keep you.

273
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,156
Zao, with your second-tier
university degree,

274
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:52,076
it wouldn't be so easy to stay

275
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,516
at such a good law firm.

276
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,755
In that case,

277
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:55,768
they help us,

278
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:56,856
and we help them.

279
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:57,784
This is how you

280
00:12:57,784 --> 00:12:59,715
use your "collections".

281
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,355
Connections.

282
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:03,595
Yeah, connections.

283
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,715
Mom, I can't argue about my diploma.

284
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:15,475
But you shouldn't have
interfered in my sister's affairs.

285
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:16,916
She never wanted to mix

286
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,595
work and personal matters.

287
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,835
Don't give me that.

288
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:22,156
So ridiculous.

289
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:24,568
Do you really want to sleep

290
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,840
in this foldable bed forever?

291
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,024
Do you really

292
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,336
want to shower forever

293
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:30,436
in a tiny bathroom

294
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,875
where you can't turn around?

295
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:33,955
If I didn't work so hard,

296
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,316
when would our life start to improve?

297
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:42,076
Come on, have some fruit.

298
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:44,276
What happened

299
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:45,635
to our family vibe?

300
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,196
So much tension.

301
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,796
Here, have more fruits.

302
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:50,316
Calm down.

303
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,715
Honey, I think you've been

304
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,076
quite irritated these days.

305
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,436
Have more fruits.

306
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,475
You are irritated.

307
00:13:58,556 --> 00:13:59,736
Both Zao's job

308
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,875
and Huan's marriage are serious matters.

309
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,595
But you don't have a clear stance

310
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,835
on either of them.

311
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:09,036
Where are you guys going?

312
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:13,436
We're going out
for a heart-to-heart talk.

313
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,475
Mom, please calm down.

314
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:21,355
Come on.

315
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:23,796
I've told you.

316
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:26,115
Remove this for a proper wash.

317
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,192
You keep forgetting.

318
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:28,955
Can't we remove it while eating?

319
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:29,676
Look.

320
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:34,715
What time do you go to work tomorrow?

321
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,344
You know what time

322
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,436
I start work.

323
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,755
Get some pricy gifts tomorrow.

324
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,156
Gifts? How pricy?

325
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:45,475
At least four figures.

326
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,635
For Jialiang's mother?

327
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,680
I don't know what she likes.

328
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,196
I'll leave it to you.

329
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:54,276
No, it's for Mr. Yao.

330
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,235
Mr. Yao?

331
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:55,995
Yeah.

332
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,955
Tomorrow, kneel if it's needed...

333
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,436
Don't kneel for real.

334
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:01,176
Anyway, no matter what you do,

335
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,835
express your gratitude to Mr. Yao.

336
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:04,835
You hear me?

337
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,635
Zao.

338
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,475
Tell me what you think

339
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,715
about becoming a formal employee.

340
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:38,316
Chenghuan.

341
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,115
It wasn't easy for me
to get into the law firm.

342
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,755
But all my colleagues

343
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:46,196
graduated from
prestigious schools abroad.

344
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,076
They look down on me.

345
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:50,196
I'm holding back my frustration

346
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,875
and trying to prove myself

347
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,595
by working my way up.

348
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,835
But I didn't know that

349
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,995
Mom accepted the Xin family's help.

350
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,316
I lost all my ambition.

351
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,995
I know how you feel.

352
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,635
Ms. Zhang Peisheng got me my job.

353
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,076
So, no matter

354
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,556
how hard I've worked
or how outstanding I've been,

355
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,196
once I made the slightest mistake,

356
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:17,676
they'd call me the "favored one".

357
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,355
I wasn't treated fairly.

358
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,715
It really upsets me.

359
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:29,076
My colleagues were questioning
how I got into Fangyuan.

360
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,635
And now,

361
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,875
I'm confirmed as a connection hire.

362
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,556
I'll just wait to get roasted.

363
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:38,235
Zao.

364
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,076
Others gossip about me all the time.

365
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:43,516
But I want you to know

366
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,115
that you got into

367
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,276
this law firm on your own.

368
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:49,516
It has nothing to do

369
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:50,835
with the Xin family,

370
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,316
with Mom, or with me.

371
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,995
So don't mind what others think.

372
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:57,955
Of course,

373
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,475
if you really can't stand it there,

374
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:01,755
don't suffer it.

375
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,476
I want to tell you that

376
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,516
whatever happens,
I'm always here for you.

377
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,835
We won't live off the old.
But you can live off me.

378
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,476
Huan, it was already
quite an achievement

379
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,716
to intern at Fangyuan Law Firm
with my educational background.

380
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:22,195
I aspire to work

381
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,476
at a major law firm.

382
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:25,036
I won't give up easily.

383
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,835
Of course, I know.

384
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,556
My little brother is capable.

385
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,635
I'm just worried that

386
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,875
the Xin family would hold power over you

387
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:38,675
if I accept this full-time contract.

388
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,595
Why would they?

389
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,716
You're outstanding enough

390
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,516
to become a formal employee on your own.

391
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,076
What does it have to do with them?

392
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:50,796
But they stirred up so much trouble.

393
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,875
All this talk
of prestigious families is superficial.

394
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:55,796
I don't want you to suffer there.

395
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,155
Zao,

396
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:58,915
don't worry about me.

397
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,276
I'll deal with them.

398
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,476
Trust me, okay?

399
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,276
Dig in before it gets cold.

400
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,796
Slow down. It's all yours.

401
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:16,716
Let's get takeouts for our mom and dad.

402
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,076
They have the best noodles.

403
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,036
Dig in, Huan.

404
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:27,796
You can ask for more.

405
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,036
It's enough.

406
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:36,888
(Good Noodles)

407
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,236
Chengzao, congratulations
on becoming a formal employee.

408
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:45,996
From now on, we'll be colleagues.

409
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:46,808
Congratulations.

410
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:47,635
Chengzao.

411
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:49,756
I'm glad you joined us officially.

412
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,915
I knew he'd make it.

413
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,716
- Look at you...
- Excellent.

414
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,956
I've got an announcement to make.

415
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,115
Chengzao has become
a formal employee in advance.

416
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:00,756
Bubble teas on me.

417
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,276
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

418
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,115
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

419
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:05,635
Give out the bubble tea.

420
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:07,115
Come on.

421
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:08,835
Sit here.

422
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,355
Mr. Liu...

423
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,516
Sit.

424
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:16,556
Mr. Tian is taking you out
for fieldwork this afternoon?

425
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:17,395
Yeah.

426
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,956
Well, it seems

427
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:19,996
too hot today.

428
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,236
Just stay.

429
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,036
I'll give Mr. Tian a heads-up.

430
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:24,716
Just stay here,

431
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,516
collect reports and enjoy the AC.

432
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,675
No need for that, Mr. Liu.

433
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:28,756
What do you mean?

434
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,064
Get him a bubble tea.

435
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,675
Chengzao, take mine.

436
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:33,595
Thank you.

437
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:34,635
You're welcome.

438
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:35,716
Sit.

439
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,635
Impressive. I didn't know
you had the connection.

440
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,915
Why did you even ask me
for an interview?

441
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:49,756
It's not like that, Tian Feng. I...

442
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:51,675
I get it. No need to explain.

443
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:53,595
I have a phone meeting.

444
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,556
Join me for the fieldwork later.

445
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:06,635
She's here.

446
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:10,036
Happy promotion to you.

447
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:12,956
Happy promotion to you.

448
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:15,996
Happy promotion to you.

449
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,236
What's going on?
I was gone for a minute.

450
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:20,195
How come it's my birthday now?

451
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:21,875
It's not my birthday.

452
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,395
It's not your birthday.

453
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,796
It's your promotion day.

454
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,395
P-Promotion?

455
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,036
What do you mean, Mr. Zhu?

456
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,516
You don't know yet?

457
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,675
No.

458
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,956
Okay, listen up.

459
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:34,595
Mr. Yao has

460
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,476
transferred you

461
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,835
to administration as a senior secretary.

462
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:42,155
You'll report directly to him.

463
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,516
Here is the transfer notice.

464
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:46,556
Congratulations.

465
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,435
Let me share some of your good fortune.

466
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:50,236
Me too.

467
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:52,440
You have got your promotion.

468
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,716
Now you just have to
marry into a wealthy family.

469
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:55,956
Remember us when you're rich.

470
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,195
Chenghuan, to be honest,

471
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:01,635
I was quite reluctant

472
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,076
to let you go.

473
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:08,756
But I am happy for you
from the bottom of my heart.

474
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,155
All of you, remember.

475
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:12,756
Mai Chenghuan

476
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:14,915
is your role model.

477
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:17,635
Work hard and everyone
has a chance to get promoted.

478
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:18,516
Chenghuan.

479
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:20,516
Work even harder

480
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:21,835
in the new post.

481
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:22,712
You have a bright future.

482
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,556
No, Mr. Zhu...

483
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,195
I'm not sure

484
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:27,276
how I've been

485
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:28,675
promoted.

486
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:30,276
But no matter where I go,

487
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,195
I'll remember that

488
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:34,195
you gave me the chance to learn.

489
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:35,355
Actually,

490
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:39,316
I-I find it slightly regretful.

491
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,236
I have so much

492
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,115
to teach you still,

493
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,395
but you are transferred.

494
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:47,544
Who will carry on my spirit?

495
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,476
Let me translate that.

496
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,024
Mr. Zhu is saying

497
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,976
that he'll have to do all the work

498
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,716
without you around him.

499
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:56,756
So straightforward.

500
00:21:58,595 --> 00:21:59,395
Alright.

501
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,595
Well... Chenghuan.

502
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,956
Shouldn't you
treat everyone to afternoon tea?

503
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,155
Yeah, Huan.

504
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,395
No problem.

505
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:07,476
Let me know what you'd like to have.

506
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,115
That's great, thank you!

507
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:09,835
Alright.

508
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:11,476
You guys, help Chenghuan

509
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,996
sort out her personal belongings.

510
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:13,435
Go ahead.

511
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:13,915
Let's go.

512
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,155
No need. I got this.

513
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,996
Chenghuan, let us do it.

514
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,236
Just look at her.

515
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:22,996
She's marrying into a wealthy family
and getting promoted.

516
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:25,195
I'm so jealous.

517
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:28,435
Yeah.

518
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:31,115
Both her husband and boss

519
00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:32,756
are supporting her.

520
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,435
Who gets to be so lucky?

521
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,756
Thank you so much.

522
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,956
Mai Chenghuan

523
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:39,435
may seem uncompetitive.

524
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,516
But in reality,

525
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,756
she's having

526
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:45,996
the loftiest aspiration.

527
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:05,796
Hello?

528
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:09,155
Sorry, there were too many orders today.

529
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,635
I can't dispatch it today.

530
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:12,435
Can I dispatch it tomorrow?

531
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,195
Tomorrow. I promise.

532
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,195
Rest assured.

533
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:17,835
Okay, thank you for your understanding.

534
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:19,195
Okay, bye.

535
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:22,595
She threw away the flower
without even looking at it.

536
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:23,435
It's so pricy.

537
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:24,875
Stop it, you guys.

538
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:27,276
Let's go.

539
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,835
She doesn't like you.

540
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:29,996
Alright, I got it.

541
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,675
I'm so tired.

542
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,595
Alright, you dance quite well.

543
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,635
You've been peeking, huh?

544
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:15,076
Why didn't you make a call?

545
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:18,115
I did. You just didn't hear it.

546
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:19,355
Come on.

547
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,476
The orders have swamped me.

548
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,875
I didn't have time to check my phone.

549
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,996
You've been working all day, too.

550
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:28,856
And you're helping me?

551
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:30,076
It's okay.

552
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:32,915
It's mental work during the day.

553
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,395
And it's labor work here

554
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:36,355
for a change.

555
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:38,395
Wait.

556
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,395
It's labor work for you, huh?

557
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,236
Mai Chengzao.

558
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,355
Okay, there is another stack
of cardboard boxes.

559
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,224
Help me pack them all today, okay?

560
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:48,395
Sure, no problem.

561
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:49,996
Get to work.

562
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:56,756
Take your time.

563
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:58,556
Let me rest for a bit.

564
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:09,996
Mr. Yao.

565
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:14,435
Take a seat.

566
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:21,595
These are the targeted invitations.

567
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,115
Have a look.

568
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:29,016
(Yueda Botticelli Hotel
Bidding Invitation Letter)

569
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:33,036
Any questions?

570
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:36,556
Mr. Yao, well...

571
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:38,915
Get to the point.

572
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,516
I prioritize efficiency.

573
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,316
Then I shall be straightforward.

574
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,076
Why did you promote me?

575
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:51,556
That's not straightforward.

576
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:53,476
You meant to ask

577
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:55,115
if it had anything

578
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:56,956
to do with Deshan Home Furnishings

579
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,595
and whether I was trying
to tie them down

580
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,796
through you.

581
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,516
You're truly straightforward.

582
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:08,076
Indeed, I do have such concerns.

583
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:09,956
Think it through.

584
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,635
Who is the dominant party

585
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,236
and who is the subordinate?

586
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:17,996
Who needs whom?

587
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:19,835
We are the dominant party.

588
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:20,956
It's just that...

589
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:21,796
It's just what?

590
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,155
If the leader decides

591
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,796
to use your connections,

592
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:27,875
it shows your value.

593
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,875
If you hesitate

594
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,595
over everything at work,

595
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:33,956
you will never succeed.

596
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:37,875
In a word, can you do it or not?

597
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:40,675
Do you want a promotion?

598
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,435
Of course, I do.

599
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:44,716
Then work on it.

600
00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:48,996
I got it. I'll handle it professionally.

601
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,036
I'm really nervous for her.

602
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,435
This is not an easy matter

603
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:10,276
to deal with.

604
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:15,155
No one can resist
the temptation of power.

605
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:18,076
People stick to the bottom line because

606
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,195
they haven't ever obtained power.

607
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:28,915
Mr. Xin.

608
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:30,796
I'm Yao Zhiming.

609
00:27:32,115 --> 00:27:33,316
I have entrusted

610
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,276
the tendering meeting to Mai Chenghuan.

611
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:37,756
Looking forward to our cooperation.

612
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,435
Hello, I'm from Botticelli.

613
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:48,516
Is Mr. Xin here?

614
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,076
Let me check. Just a second.

615
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:52,435
None of the sample drafts

616
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:55,476
we sent this year received any feedback.

617
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:57,915
(Baby)
Our designers are so anxious.

618
00:27:58,435 --> 00:27:59,956
I'm also worried.

619
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,675
Sorry, Mr. Xin is on a business trip.

620
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,115
It's okay, I'm here
to deliver an invitation.

621
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,675
Please give it to him.

622
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:08,476
Okay.

623
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:13,875
Huan.

624
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,112
Miss Mai, hello.

625
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,956
Hello.

626
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,395
You're here for the proposal?

627
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:21,476
You know each other?

628
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,835
We met at Mr. Wang's dinner party.

629
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,355
Take good care of her.

630
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:26,675
She's my wife.

631
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:29,476
Now I get it.

632
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,076
I have a meeting. See you.

633
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,796
Now he gets it.

634
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:33,595
Come with me.

635
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:35,996
Why didn't you

636
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,875
tell me that your mom would visit mine?

637
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:41,036
My mom went to see your mom?

638
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:42,875
Didn't you know?

639
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:44,076
No.

640
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:48,316
She wanted my mom
to bond with Yao Zhiming.

641
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:51,516
My mom went directly

642
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,435
to Mr. Yao's office
for the tendering meeting.

643
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:57,155
Your mom even helped Zao
become a formal employee.

644
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,276
Didn't you know?

645
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,316
She made Zao a formal employee?

646
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:01,595
That's a good thing.

647
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,915
Didn't you hear what I said?

648
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,956
Is that the point?

649
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,115
You should ask

650
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:08,875
for my permission to approach my mom.

651
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,796
You could have just told me about it.

652
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,355
Yeah, my mom did wrong.

653
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,915
I have to get it.

654
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,355
Hello.

655
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:18,195
I see.

656
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:19,716
Alright, right away.

657
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,835
Say sorry for me.

658
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:25,076
Well...

659
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,355
My mom made a mistake.

660
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:29,276
I'll talk to her when I get back.

661
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:30,155
Forget it.

662
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:31,875
Go for the meeting.

663
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:33,635
Okay, Huan, I'm off.

664
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:34,680
They're waiting.

665
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,996
See you around.

666
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:37,595
Drive safe.

667
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:39,155
I mean, be careful.

668
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:53,516
Mai Chenghuan?

669
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,516
Long time no see.

670
00:29:58,716 --> 00:29:59,635
Zhu.

671
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:01,355
What are you doing here?

672
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:02,996
I work around here.

673
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,316
Have you had lunch? Want to join me?

674
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,036
Sure, let's go.

675
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:08,556
What a surprise to see you here.

676
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:15,595
I didn't expect that

677
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:17,835
you'd be Mr. Xin's secretary.

678
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:21,556
This is fate.

679
00:30:21,592 --> 00:30:23,556
I was working at the exhibitions

680
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,635
and happened to be hosting Mr. Xin.

681
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,996
I was thinking about changing jobs.

682
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:31,195
So, I introduce myself to him.

683
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:34,756
You volunteered
to be our class president

684
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,355
in college

685
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,435
and won the election.

686
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:40,155
After all these years,
you're still so brave.

687
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,875
Deshan's future boss lady
is praising me.

688
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:44,516
I'm flattered.

689
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:49,835
You know about me

690
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,316
and Xin Jialiang?

691
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,355
Of course.

692
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:54,155
First of all, congratulations.

693
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:56,675
Even I know about it as an employee.

694
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,435
The Xin family
must hold you in high regard.

695
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:00,395
Little Boss Lady.

696
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:04,835
Don't call me that.

697
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,716
I didn't know about his background.

698
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:10,516
Anyway,

699
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:11,875
it involves too much.

700
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,595
We're in a chaos.

701
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:14,556
Forget it.

702
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:20,476
It's been a chao for me, too.

703
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:22,556
What's wrong?

704
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:26,635
That director surnamed Yao
who got into your hotel out of nowhere

705
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:28,956
may terminate cooperation with Deshan

706
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:30,835
through this bidding.

707
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:32,595
I haven't rested

708
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:34,956
for weeks because of that.

709
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:38,516
Mr. Yao hasn't mentioned
anything like that.

710
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:44,076
Mr. Xin's father has been
so worried about this.

711
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:46,195
If we can't secure Yueda,

712
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,276
Deshan will lose its biggest client

713
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:49,756
and might as well close up.

714
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,476
Is it that serious?

715
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:53,556
Yeah, I'm not kidding with you.

716
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,635
Chenghuan, let me remind you.

717
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,276
If you marry into the Xin family,

718
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,875
you'll be sharing
weal and woe with them.

719
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:04,756
Since you're working at the hotel

720
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:06,155
and have firsthand information,

721
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:07,355
help the Xin family

722
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:08,716
as much as you can

723
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,996
to gain status in the family.

724
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:17,036
Zhu, thank you for the reminder.

725
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:20,675
But work must be separate
from private life.

726
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:23,115
Work-related matters are confidential.

727
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,635
I can't abuse my power.

728
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:26,796
Besides, my rank is not high enough.

729
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,675
And as you know,

730
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,835
we have no right to interfere with

731
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:32,236
or change

732
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:33,635
our bosses' choices.

733
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:35,956
Chenghuan.

734
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,395
This bidding
is essential to the Xin family

735
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:40,996
and Deshan.

736
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,276
Will you think twice?

737
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:48,556
Zhu.

738
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:50,996
I have work to do. I have to go.

739
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,236
It's my treat today.

740
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,236
I'll ask Mao out next time

741
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:55,316
and we can meet.

742
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,115
Okay.

743
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:57,076
See you around.

744
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:04,915
Thank you.

745
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:15,756
Still so hypocritical
after so many years.

746
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,236
Mrs. Mai doesn't know the rules.

747
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,516
But Chenghuan is pretty reasonable.

748
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,276
Are you sure

749
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:51,595
you'll sacrifice her?

750
00:33:58,516 --> 00:33:59,316
Mr. Yao.

751
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:00,516
Mr. Yao.

752
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:02,996
I didn't dare to disturb you

753
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:04,036
while you were busy.

754
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:07,716
I've sent out the invitations today.

755
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:08,595
Also,

756
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:10,996
do you have any suggestions
on the recruitment standards

757
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,956
for our suppliers?

758
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,036
No, it's already perfect.

759
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:19,476
Rest early.

760
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:27,115
Mai Chenghuan.

761
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,315
A family like the Xin's

762
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,916
will only allow a woman to thrive

763
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,396
in the kitchen or the garden,

764
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:39,036
and nowhere else.

765
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:24,876
Madam, sit here.

766
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:25,795
Thank you.

767
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:27,195
Thank you.

768
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:43,476
Zao.

769
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:45,115
Get in the car.

770
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,356
Mao?

771
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:50,516
Good morning!

772
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:50,996
Morning.

773
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:52,076
You haven't had breakfast, right?

774
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,476
I brought you a sandwich

775
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:55,635
and some probiotics.

776
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:56,916
It's good for digestion.

777
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:57,675
Thank you.

778
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:01,476
I heard you've become a formal employee.

779
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,115
Why didn't you mention it at my store?

780
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:06,396
You are awesome.

781
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,396
I couldn't brag about it because someone

782
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:09,516
helped me with it.

783
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:12,115
Is your work going well?

784
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:15,876
Yeah.

785
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:17,996
I don't need to

786
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:19,235
butter anyone up or work overtime.

787
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,235
And everybody praises me.

788
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:24,996
Mao.

789
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,755
Don't you sleep very late?

790
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,476
Why did you get up early to pick me up?

791
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,755
Well, your sister

792
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:33,235
sent me a message late last night.

793
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:35,476
Mao.

794
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:37,752
The Xin family courted my mom

795
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:40,916
to lobby with Yao Zhiming
to collaborate with our hotel.

796
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,635
They even made
Zao a formal employee directly.

797
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,436
I'm worried that
Zao's colleagues would be

798
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:47,675
badmouthing him for that.

799
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,076
He only shares good news

800
00:36:50,235 --> 00:36:51,635
and never tells us anything bad.

801
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:54,315
Find out how he's doing for me.

802
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:57,916
I told her I wouldn't care.

803
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,155
But those who ignored me

804
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:02,795
the day before started complimenting me

805
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:04,996
right on the next day.

806
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:08,155
I think...

807
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:09,155
Let me tell you.

808
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:10,715
They are like that.

809
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:11,795
It's not your problem.

810
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,715
I couldn't handle office politics.

811
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:15,996
So I opened a store.

812
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:18,876
Don't take it to heart.

813
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:21,836
I'm already a grown-up,

814
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:23,675
and yet I make my sister worried.

815
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:27,836
Do you find me childish?

816
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:30,076
Not at all.

817
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,235
It's good to have someone
worry about you.

818
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,076
I wish someone would worry about me.

819
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,755
Really?

820
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,235
What do you mean?

821
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,275
Text your sister

822
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:41,916
once you get to the company.

823
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,275
Don't keep her worried.

824
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,076
Let's go.

825
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:46,876
I'll take you to work.

826
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:03,436
Mom.

827
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:06,356
Stop pouring water yourself from now on.

828
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:08,356
You might knock into something.

829
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:09,595
I'm pregnant.

830
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:10,755
Who can take care of you?

831
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:16,436
What's wrong?

832
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:19,996
Still worried about your son's marriage?

833
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:24,235
Your dad asked me to meet
Chenghuan's mom to make Mr. Yao

834
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,315
go easy on us during the bidding.

835
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,836
But I heard that Mai Chenghuan

836
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,996
got promoted to be in charge of

837
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,556
the tender meeting yesterday.

838
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:34,635
What do you think that means?

839
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:36,916
I knew she'd be very shrewd

840
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:38,315
despite

841
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:40,235
her innocent appearance.

842
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,235
She pretended not to want anything

843
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:46,556
and held our family business
in her hands.

844
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,795
She really thinks far ahead.

845
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:53,195
But your little brother likes her.
What can we do?

846
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:55,556
And it's even worse now.

847
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,836
With your dad's consent,

848
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,235
he's been running after her every day.

849
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:04,476
We should steer him
in the right direction all the more.

850
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:06,076
She's got a firm grip

851
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:07,556
on him before they get married.

852
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,155
What if they're married?

853
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:11,275
We may have to support her

854
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,675
and her entire family.

855
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:14,616
Maybe they will count on us

856
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,235
to help her brother start a family

857
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,476
and everything.

858
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:19,675
Look, didn't we just help her brother

859
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,195
become a formal employee?

860
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,876
Maybe I underestimated that girl

861
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:29,755
and their entire family.

862
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:35,635
Mom.

863
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:37,195
- Be careful.
- It's okay.

864
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:40,155
Mom, do you remember
what we talked about?

865
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:41,356
What?

866
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:43,315
Doesn't she want to keep her integrity?

867
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:46,115
Then I'll have Luo Mingli
prepare a prenuptial agreement.

868
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:48,235
I'll show respect if she signs it.

869
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:49,315
Otherwise,

870
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:50,556
her little scheme

871
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,675
will be exposed.

872
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:54,516
That's not nice.

873
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:56,675
Besides,

874
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,396
your dad still needs favors from them.

875
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:00,595
So what?

876
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,396
She chose to act high and mighty.

877
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:03,795
Let her keep pretending.

878
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:18,836
Hello.

879
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,088
Hello.

880
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,155
I'm Zhu Baoqiao from Deshan,
the secretary of Mr. Xin.

881
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,195
We met at the supplier conference once.

882
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:29,115
Can you spare me a second?

883
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:49,076
Baby, I'm almost at your company.

884
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:50,595
Come and see me, will you?

885
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:56,195
I'm working.

886
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:57,255
(Baby Liang)

887
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:07,595
You want me to get you the bid document
for the tender meeting?

888
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:11,715
You might as well

889
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:13,635
talk to Mr. Xin's girlfriend.

890
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,996
Mr. Yao thinks highly of Mai Chenghuan
and has promoted her

891
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,155
to the Administrative Office.

892
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:21,795
It's much easier

893
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:23,315
to ask her for help.

894
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,115
Wait.

895
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:27,675
Just hear me out

896
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:28,795
before you leave.

897
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:36,155
You and Mai Chenghuan

898
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,115
got enrolled at the same time, right?

899
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,675
She is about to become
the lady boss of Deshan

900
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:43,436
and live in a large flat

901
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:46,516
while you're still living
in an old house in the suburbs,

902
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:48,675
commuting three hours
by metro every day.

903
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,315
Are you content?

904
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:54,635
What can I do even if I'm not?

905
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,675
I can't get you a position
in the company.

906
00:41:58,396 --> 00:41:59,795
But I might be able to

907
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:03,556
offer some practical help.

908
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,836
Does it show my sincerity?

909
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,996
I'll show greater sincerity
if you help us with the bidding.

910
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,396
It could help you improve

911
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:16,956
the housing situation.

912
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:22,195
Your boss is so lucky to have

913
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:24,635
an employee like you.

914
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:27,235
I'll take your kind words.

915
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:31,556
But it's a matter with great risk.

916
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:34,916
If something goes wrong,
I'd lose not only my job

917
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,675
but also my reputation.

918
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:38,115
Of course.

919
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,656
With great risk comes great reward.
