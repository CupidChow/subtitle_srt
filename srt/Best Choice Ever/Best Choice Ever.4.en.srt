=Episode 4=

3
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,140
Miss Mai, I didn't know your preference.

4
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,699
Do you prefer strong-flavored,
light-flavored, or sauce-flavored?

5
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,660
I took the liberty of deciding.

6
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,380
Come on, let us all toast to Miss Mai.

7
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:46,860
Since you are in such
high spirits today, Mr. Wang,

8
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,699
let's make it quick
and cut to the chase.

9
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:50,979
I will toast to you with this drink.

10
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,899
I'm sorry, everyone. My apologies.

11
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
I'm late. Mr. Wang, right?

12
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,899
Mr. Wang, let me briefly
introduce myself to you.

13
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,300
I am Mr. Yao's assistant.

14
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,899
You can just call me He Dong.

15
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:08,059
Mr. Yao has repeatedly instructed me

16
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:12,380
to join Miss Mai, Mr. Wang,
and all of you for a meal

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,579
and entertain everyone here.

18
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,220
- Mr. He.
- You flatter me.

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,660
- Come on, sit.
- Alright.

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,139
Waiter, add a set of bowls
and chopsticks.

21
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,940
- What are you doing here?
- To protect you.

22
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,500
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry for being late.

23
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,780
It's okay. No problem.

24
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,180
(I've just arrived. If you're so anxious,
why not come and see for yourself?)

25
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,180
(Cut the chatter and keep me posted.)

26
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,900
Now that everyone is here,

27
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,859
let's all raise our glasses together.

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,259
Mr. Wang, please wait a moment.

29
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,739
You see, there are
so many gentlemen present

30
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,299
drinking with a lady.

31
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,019
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

32
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:01,220
So, Mr. Wang, I will drink this
on behalf of Miss Mai.

33
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,819
Here, Mr. Wang, toast to you.

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,660
Since everyone is happy today, Mr. Wang,

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,859
let's drink heartily. Cheers.

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,180
I told you to keep me posted.
Where are you?

37
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,539
- What's the situation now?
- Bottoms up.

38
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,139
- Chenghuan.
- I...

39
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,579
I've drunk up. Do as you please.

40
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,819
I thought I was protecting you.
But why did you...

41
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,180
Chenghuan, you hide it well.
You are a good drinker.

42
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,979
Well, since that's the case,

43
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,739
I cannot make
Botticelli lose face, can I?

44
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,100
Here, Mr. Wang, toast to you.

45
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,699
Here, Mr. Wang, let's raise a glass.
Toast to you, cheers.

46
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,579
Mr. Wang, I'm impressed.

47
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,020
Since everyone is so happy today

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,700
and Assistant He is here,

49
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,739
I'll get straight to the point.

50
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,539
Mr. Wang, I am aware
of your Deshan factory

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,419
and I've studied your samples.

52
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,780
Also, I have also compared
the cost of raw materials

53
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,220
with other similar factories.

54
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,140
As to Deshan Home Furnishings' estimate
for the 520 Gift Pack,

55
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,379
I'm very clear

56
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,299
about the profit and cost.

57
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,220
As per industry practice,
every project has a rebate.

58
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:48,379
Mr. Wang, just remove the rebate

59
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,780
and give us an honest price.

60
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,299
Miss Mai, truly a heroine.

61
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,499
As soon as I saw you, Mr. Wang,
I knew you were a person with vision.

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,939
You can see things
from a long-term perspective,

63
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,179
and that's a great thing.

64
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,419
I am going to make an exception
and reduce the price.

65
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,939
But for how much, let me think.

66
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:22,580
10%?

67
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,179
Mr. Wang, your phone is ringing.

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,979
10%?

69
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,379
Mr. Wang, Mai Chenghuan
is my girlfriend.

70
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,020
For every discount you give her,

71
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,900
I'll have my dad give you
that much of a raise in salary, alright?

72
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,220
10% is not enough.

73
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,179
Let's make it 20%.

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,820
Mr. Wang, if you can really
give me this price,

75
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,739
we will report it to Mr. Yao then.

76
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:02,299
- No problem.
- Thank you, Mr. Wang.

77
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,939
- We did it.
- Miss Mai.

78
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,780
I will have someone revise the estimate
and send it to you via email.

79
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,140
- Yes.
- Thank you, Mr. Wang.

80
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Mr. Wang, in that case,

81
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,900
we will propose a toast to everyone

82
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
on behalf of Botticelli.

83
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,140
(Yao Zhiming)
Come on, Mr. Wang, thank you.

84
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,939
(Yao Zhiming)
Looking forward to working together.

85
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,499
Mr. Wang, are you alright?

86
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm fine, but Miss Mai
is indeed a good drinker.

87
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,979
I was outdrunk by her. Later, we...

88
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:48,100
♪I walk alone on the path
on the outskirts♪

89
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:54,539
♪The path on the outskirts♪

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,179
- ♪I brought the cakes♪
- Mr. Yao.

91
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,700
Mr. Yao, you're finally here.

92
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:07,020
Let me introduce you. This is Mr. Wang?

93
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,140
- He Dong.
- They've left.

94
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,859
I'll settle this with you later.

95
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,739
Mr. Yao, He Dong has drunk too much.

96
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,340
Mr. Yao, I have completed
my task for today.

97
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,900
Guess how much
of a discount we negotiated?

98
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,580
It will be 20%.

99
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,460
Mr. Yao, what do you say?

100
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,979
Chenghuan, Mr. Yao can't drink much.

101
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,939
I'll drink it on his behalf.

102
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,939
Come on, Chenghuan, I'll drink.

103
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,059
Mr. Yao can't take it?

104
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,660
- Come on.
- Let's drink, then.

105
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,800
Come on.

106
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,460
Who says I can't handle it?

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,900
See, I told you he couldn't handle it.

108
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,499
I didn't expect it to be this bad.

109
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,739
Why would he do that?

110
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,460
This restaurant is so close to the hotel
and it's hard to get a cab.

111
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,460
He's lying here
like a double-door refrigerator.

112
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,939
We are not able to carry him.

113
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,140
I've got an idea.

114
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,979
Sir, I'll return this cart tomorrow.

115
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,059
- Don't break it.
- Of course.

116
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,060
- Slowly.
- Thanks.

117
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,100
Slow down. Be careful.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,580
- It's okay.
- Watch your step.

119
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,820
Watch the road. Wait.

120
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,768
- What's wrong?
- My shoe came off. Let me get it.

121
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,300
Actually, He Dong, I've been tolerating
your socks for a long time.

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,659
Why would you do that?

123
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,340
Well, they look a bit...

124
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,100
These are formal suit socks.
People all wear them with suits.

125
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,540
- He must've drunk a lot.
- So much.

126
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,220
We can't just pull him back like this.

127
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,580
- What if a colleague sees us?
- What should we do then?

128
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,540
Use your jacket to cover him up a bit.

129
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,899
Come on, hold him.

130
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,540
Wait a minute. Aren't you going to take
this opportunity and get a picture?

131
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,820
- Sounds good.
- Acting like you don't want to. Here.

132
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,540
- Take it for me.
- I will.

133
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,340
Hold on, okay, one, two, three.

134
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,100
Another one, three, two, one. Come on.

135
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,340
Only you can come up with this.

136
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,139
Chenghuan, do you need help?

137
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,499
- No need, no need.
- Thank you.

138
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:50,300
He Dong, do you have his room card?

139
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
It's in his office.

140
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,540
Get it then. I'll take him up.

141
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
We'll meet up there in a bit.

142
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,379
- Can you do this alone?
- Yes, I can.

143
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,700
- Then I'll go there.
- Go ahead.

144
00:09:58,619 --> 00:09:59,736
Stop staring.

145
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:12,659
Turn off the lights.

146
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,460
What are you doing?

147
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,464
Yao Zhiming.

148
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:19,820
Come on, Yao Zhiming.

149
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,019
This bed is so hard.

150
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,300
I'll change it for you in a bit.

151
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,940
This bed is so small.

152
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,540
I want a different bed.

153
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,540
Put your hands on my shoulder.

154
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,420
One, two, three, go.

155
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:41,779
Come on. Let's go.

156
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,100
Chenghuan, what are you doing?

157
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,700
- I'm choking him.
- Why are you choking him?

158
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,779
No, I was helping him.
He fell off the cart on his own.

159
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,259
Let go. His face is turning purple.

160
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,300
Mr. Yao. Mr. Yao.

161
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,379
That's not how you do it.

162
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,060
This is how you pinch the philtrum.

163
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,300
He's breathing. He is.

164
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,540
He's not dead. Come on.

165
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,019
- Come on, turn him over.
- Quickly.

166
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,899
There's an assassin.

167
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,100
There's an assassin.

168
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,019
- Get up first.
- I can't.

169
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,019
I can't get up.

170
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,460
He's on my leg.

171
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,100
He's sitting on my leg.

172
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,580
Wait. I'm wearing heels.

173
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,100
I said don't let him drink.

174
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,499
Get up first.

175
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,300
He's on it now. He's up.

176
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,180
- It works.
- What are you doing?

177
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,300
We're sitting on a waterbed,
a new model waterbed.

178
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,019
- Let's go.
- Waterbed?

179
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,100
Yes, a waterbed, right.

180
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,659
What's a waterbed?

181
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,340
This bed is so soft.

182
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,820
I'll go get a towel for him.

183
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,820
Assistant He, I'll leave now.

184
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,928
Wait a moment.

185
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,032
Be careful.

186
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,659
- Tip.
- I don't want it. Put it away.

187
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:57,019
That's not enough? Take them all.

188
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,180
No, I really don't want your money.

189
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,420
Okay, you can go now.

190
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,739
I'm going to swim.

191
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,899
Go swimming? Where?

192
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,899
He Dong, Yao Zhiming
is taking off his pants.

193
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,540
Mr. Yao, she's still here.
Don't take off your pants!

194
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,619
I didn't see anything. I didn't.

195
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,180
Come on. Lie down. Oh, my God.

196
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,460
I want to swim.

197
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,540
Stop stripping.

198
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,300
Cover yourself.

199
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,499
Well, Assistant He, I'll leave now.

200
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,139
- Come back, Chenghuan.
- What's wrong?

201
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,460
Leave his wallet.

202
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,820
Right. Here you go. See you.

203
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,659
- Wait.
- What now?

204
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:35,064
I'm taking off my pants.

205
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,340
Leave the wallet

206
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,779
but we can split the money.

207
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:39,859
Let's take the tip.

208
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,540
No. I don't want it.

209
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,779
Just take it back. And I've sent
the estimate to your email.

210
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm leaving now.

211
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,659
Be careful.

212
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,619
She's gone and you're not stripping.

213
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,739
What are you doing this for?

214
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:07,420
A sincere collaboration price. Good.

215
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,899
Rebate information?

216
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:40,899
You're awake. Come on.

217
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,820
Have some water.

218
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,139
How did I get back?

219
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,820
You don't remember anything?

220
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:57,700
Last night,

221
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,540
Mai Chenghuan and I pushed you back.

222
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,220
Do you know what you did last night?

223
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,340
You were undressing
in front of Mai Chenghuan.

224
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,700
If I hadn't stopped you,
you'd have taken off your pants.

225
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,899
But it was cute. I'm just saying.

226
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,580
You were even posing on that cart...

227
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,300
What? Undressing?

228
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:16,739
Impossible.

229
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,499
You don't believe it?

230
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,460
Here. I've got it on camera.
See for yourself.

231
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,499
Look, when we were pushing you,

232
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,940
you were posing, see?

233
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,420
What are you doing? Let's go.

234
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,899

is taking off his pants.

235
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,019
There's a video here. Let me show you.
Take a look.

236
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,936
Get out of here.

237
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Take a look at this. You'd like it.

238
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:44,899
No, go away.

239
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,300
It's not a photo. It's serious stuff.

240
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,360
Come on.

(520 Gift Pack Rebate Information)

242
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:19,512
Come in.

243
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,779
- Mr. Yao, you wanted to see me?
- Have a seat.

244
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,460
Did you have a good rest last night?

245
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I did. Why?

246
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,619
Nothing, just my daily regards.

247
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,100
I didn't take the tip you gave me.

248
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,060
I gave it all to Assistant He.

249
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,540
I received the email.
You did a great job.

250
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,859
No, no, I just completed the task
assigned by my leader.

251
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,100
Alright. You can leave it at that.

252
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,499
- Just make sure the event goes well.
- Understood.

253
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,460
Did you need anything else?

254
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,340
Why don't you leverage
your boyfriend's connections

255
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,859
and negotiate for the lowest price?

256
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:55,460
I just feel that relying on myself
is more dependable, isn't it?

257
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,300
Apart from one's work skills,

258
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,100
connections are also very important.

259
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,779
I agree with you on that.

260
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,300
But my relationship with my boyfriend...

261
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,260
Perhaps some connections

262
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,740
are too precious and vulnerable

263
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,740
to be used.

264
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,740
- This is for you.
- For me?

265
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,899
Open it. You deserve it.

(Honeymoon Suite Deluxe Dinner for Two)

267
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,939
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Yao.

268
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,939
Now I can finally invite my parents

269
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,379
to experience the hotel where I work.

270
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
They've never stayed
in such a nice hotel before.

271
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,139
You're quite easy to be satisfied.

272
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,340
Yes, we work hard

273
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,859
to give our families
a better life, don't we?

274
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,980
Thank you, Mr. Yao. If that's all,
I'll take my leave.

275
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,768
Thank you.

276
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,139
Commanding the little bunny
and then giving it a carrot again.

277
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,340
Another day, happy and content.

278
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,008
What's wrong?

279
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,400
What's wrong?

280
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,060
- My tip.
- Coming.

281
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,699
Sorry about that. I'm coming.

282
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,740
- Huan, you're back.
- Yes.

283
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,768
- Cannon takes cannon.
- A good move.

284
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,540
Take this back.

285
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,500
You're brimming with happiness.
What's the good news?

286
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,419
- It's good news for you.
- Oh, is it?

287
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,500
- Do you want to give my mom a surprise?
- Sure.

288
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:13,500
- I won't go.
- Last Valentine, we went to Old Uncle's

289
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,939
and you called me stingy and cheap.

290
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,820
This is a luxury dinner
at a high-end hotel.

291
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
Are you still not satisfied?

292
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,459
No, I said no. Just cancel it.

293
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,139
It's been booked. We can't cancel.

294
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,500
How much do you make a month?

Going to a deluxe honeymoon suite?

296
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,100
You're so frivolous.

297
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Cancel it.

298
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,699
Mom, I'll tell you the truth.

299
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,740
It was me
who asked Dad to take you there.

300
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,699
This is a benefit
of my company, and it's free.

301
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,939
You're lying. Company benefit?

302
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,980
In all the years you've worked,
I haven't seen you get many bonuses.

303
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,859
Your hotel is so expensive.

304
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,859
There's no way they have
this kind of benefit.

305
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,419
Here, this is our company's invitation.

306
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,540
This voucher is different
from the one sold externally.

has parachuted in our company.

308
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,500
It's Mr. Yao, the one
my father drives for.

309
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,939
He thinks highly of me.

310
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,939
He wrote all this himself, look.

311
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:12,300
Really. To Ms. Liu Wanyu
and Mr. Mai Laitian.

312
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:14,899
I didn't lie to you, did I?

313
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I wanted my dad to give you a surprise.

314
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,939
But you were so stubborn.

315
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,179
Liu Wanyu is a difficult person.

316
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,939
So hard to please.

317
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,659
Old Uncle's was cheap,

318
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,300
but she is not even satisfied
with this luxury hotel. Who knows?

319
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,060
I was only thinking about the family.

320
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:34,300
There will be times when we need money.

321
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,379
Would you go now?

322
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,179
This is our daughter's credit.

323
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,980
Why would you take it?

324
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,859
Now go and cook
the sweet and sour ribs as punishment.

325
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:48,100
Daddy is going to make
sweet and sour ribs?

326
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,500
- I'll have an extra bowl of rice.
- Come on.

327
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,740
Want to have a bite of my cooking, huh?

328
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,060
To be honest, back then,
it was this dish

329
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,780
that captured her heart.

330
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,300
However, she cooks it
better than me now.

331
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,740
At first, I thought he was
really good at cooking.

332
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,859
Turns out he could only
cook this one dish.

333
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,540
Sweet and sour ribs.

334
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,139
Alright, I'll take care
of dinner tonight.

- Embarrassing.

342
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,540
It has everything, including seafood.

343
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,060
Seafood, huh? Do you have
lobsters, Boston lobsters?

344
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,219
Is there any, um, sa...

345
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,260
Sashimi.

346
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,939

- There is.

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,664
- Welcome, this is your lottery ticket.
- Thank you.

351
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,419
- So beautiful.
- Mom and Dad, this way.

352
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:20,459
- Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.
- Huan. Hello.

353
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:23,500
- Let's take a picture.
- Dad, where did you get that hat?

354
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,740
Do you know what "Old Gentleman" means?

355
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,540
It refers to someone like me.

356
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,939
Not at all. You look like a doorman.

357
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,740
My presence by your side
makes you stylish.

358
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,459
I'm doing it to highlight
your strengths, okay?

359
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,459
Alright, your number is 66.

360
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,540
66, "all goes well".

361
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,300
You'll win a prize in a while.

362
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,980
- There is a lottery?
- There are prizes?

363
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,060
- Exactly,
- There's food, drinks, and also prizes.

364
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,100
It's like pancakes falling from the sky.

365
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,859
- Pies.
- Pancakes with fillings, alright?

366
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,899
- Okay.
- I'll take you inside.

367
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,060
- Help me pass these out.
- This is awesome.

368
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,139
It's amazing. Where's the buffet?

369
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:57,300
It's on both sides.

370
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,699
Let's go. That's right.

371
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,859
I skipped lunch and I need to eat
enough to compensate.

372
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,540
You will be satisfied.

373
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,740
Mom and Dad, you go eat first.

374
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,780
I'll go to the backstage.

375
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,100
Okay, go back to your work.

376
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,379
- Call me if you need anything,
- Sure.

377
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,980
- Come on over.
- It's over there.

378
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,939
Chenghuan, it shows that today's meal
coupons inside the venue are sold out.

379
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,300
But the event is about to start now,

380
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,659
but less than half entered the venue.

381
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:24,020
Sold out? Then,
ask the IT Department for help

382
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,459
and send an invitation message
to the customers' group.

383
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:28,939
Notify the PR Department
to watch their angle

384
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,459
and don't let the venue look too empty.

385
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,219
There's still time.

386
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,139
- Let's delay the event a bit. Go.
- Got it.

387
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,060
You'll have to check that area again.

388
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,939
We need to quickly replenish
the drinks and desserts.

389
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,379
Wu You, how is the preparation going?

390
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,020
Almost done.

391
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,740
But the guests are running short.

392
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,740
We are working on that.

393
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:53,459
Mr. Yao, the actual number of guests
who have arrived is indeed a bit low.

394
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,659
but I've notified the backstage

395
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,379
to send a reminder to the guests.

396
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,939
Chenghuan, don't tell me you've dipped
into your own pocket

397
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,459
to ensure the success
of the first event.

398
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,139
Chenghuan, if you really
paid out of your own pocket,

399
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,980
remember to seek reimbursement
from Mr. Yao later.

400
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:13,820
After all, you are the designated
person in charge by Mr. Yao.

401
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,580
Are you sure
all the tickets are sold out?

402
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,659
They are indeed sold out.

403
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,340
Mr. Yao, don't worry. I'll go
and verify the situation again.

404
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,179
What happened?
Why did the lights go out?

405
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,939
Why are the lights out?

406
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,580
Sherry, what's going on?

407
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,500
Why is a group of people dancing here?

408
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,219
Sir, sir, what are you doing?

409
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,980
- What is he...
- Sir, are you...

410
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,780
Your Highness, your knight
has come to your rescue.

411
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,859
She's on your right. Two o'clock.

412
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,859
You, you guys...

413
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,419
Surprise.

414
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,139
- Jialiang.
- Jialiang.

415
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,859
That's Xin Jialiang. What is he doing?

416
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:04,888
What are you doing?

417
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,580
Mrs. Mai, Mr. Mai.

418
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,659
Great, you're here too.

419
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,139
You can witness it together.

420
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Witness what?

421
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,939
I see. I see.

422
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,459
- Keep going. Go ahead.
- What did you see?

423
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:28,260
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
I'll take a bit of your time today.

424
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,060
Just a little bit, sorry about that.

425
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,459
- Sorry. My apologies.
- Jialiang.

426
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,139
What exactly are you doing?

427
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,859
Huan, I will always be your knight.

428
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,780
I will protect you, always and forever.

429
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,859
- A diamond ring.
- This young man knows what he's doing.

430
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,619
- Go get Mr. Zhu here.
- Okay.

431
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:24,419
- Let's see how Mai Chenghuan saves it.
- Alright.

432
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:30,419
Mai Chenghuan, will you marry me?

433
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,540
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

434
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,260
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

435
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,859
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

436
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,500
- Get up first.
- I won't.

437
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,300
- Marry him.
- Get up and let's talk outside.

438
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
I'll get up if you say yes.

439
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:50,619
Just get up now.

440
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:51,899
- I won't.
- Get up.

441
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:52,952
Say yes first.

442
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,859
- Did you get hurt?
- Are you okay?

443
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:01,100
Mai Chenghuan, come here for a moment.

444
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,899
What are you doing?

445
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,459
- Well done.
- Sorry, Mr. Zhu.

446
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,820
Don't say sorry to me.

447
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:10,500
You should say what you are
going to do now.

448
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,740
- I...
- Who are you?

449
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,500
- Who are you?
- Calm down.

450
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,459
Who are you
and why are you yelling at her?

451
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,740
Mr. Zhu, I'm sorry

452
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,060
- You are that Zhu, right?
- No.

453
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,300
You're paying Huan that little,

454
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,980
so what makes you think
that you can yell at her?

455
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,179
- Xin Jialiang.
- Try that again.

456
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:26,060
I dare you to yell at her
or bully her again.

457
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,459
- Sorry, Mr. Zhu.
- I'll call security.

458
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,459
Come out with me and put the sword down.

459
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,459
- Crazyhead.
- Put it down.

460
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,419
- Bullying my Huan.
- Everyone, it was

461
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:34,820
- Don't indulge him.
- a small show.

462
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,340
A skit. The event continues, alright?

463
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,260
- He was yelling at you.
- Let go of this.

464
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,300
- Let go.
- I'm furious.

465
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,060
Give me the sword, Xin Jialiang.

466
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,100
Can you stop causing trouble?

467
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:50,063
Wait.

468
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:52,580
Does he often bully you?

469
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,939
No, he doesn't.

470
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,780
He's my boss, and he usually
helps me out, okay?

471
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,459
Huan, you are angry again?

472
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,740
- Give it to me.
- Huan.

473
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,179
You mentioned roses, and I've sent them.

474
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:12,179
I've also given you
the discount for the Gift Pack.

475
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,179
I've also booked
all the tickets for your 520 event.

476
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:18,060
- Don't be mad, okay?
- You gave me the discount?

477
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:20,459
You didn't want to show our connection,

478
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,859
- so I secretly had Mr. Wang lower it.
- You...

479
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,459
Jialiang, our theme today
is about parental love.

480
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,459
It's about warmth.

481
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,659
Do you know how long it took me
to come up with this theme?

482
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,740
But just now, you made a scene

483
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,859
and ruined all my efforts.

484
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,020
Huan, you wanted romance,
and I gave it to you.

485
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,340
You wanted performance,
and I helped you.

486
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,020
You wanted stability,
and I proposed to you.

487
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,939
What do I need to do
for you to be satisfied?

488
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,300
Xin Jialiang, were you even

489
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,980
listening to me just now?

490
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:11,179
Dear friends, please move
to the center position.

491
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,939
I have to go back to work.

492
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,419
Just go home, and we'll talk later.

493
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
So, will you say yes or not?

494
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,939
Like I said, I'm going back to work.

495
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,340
Don't be mad. Put it down
if you're working.

496
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,419
Huan, listen to me.

497
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,899
Jialiang put on such a grand gesture
to propose to you.

498
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,419
- Don't make the wrong decision.
- Mom.

499
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,939
Can you please not join in the chaos?

500
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,899
- Listen to me.
- Let's discuss it when she's home.

501
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,379
Stop it for now.

502
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:50,500
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, I'm sorry.
I've messed up again.

503
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,939
No, no, no, Jialiang, you are okay.

504
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,980
Actually, I think

505
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,300
the buffet in the hotel
isn't that great anyway.

506
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,540
How about you come home with me

507
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,899
and I will cook you a delicious meal?

508
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,740
- Awesome.
- Okay, come on.

509
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,419
- Thank you, Mrs. Mai.
- You're welcome. Let's go.

510
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,820
- Thank you, Mr. Mai.
- Let's go.

511
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,139
Next up is the long-awaited
lottery draw session.

512
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,699
Please pay attention
to the number plates in your hands.

513
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,619
She truly has the fate
of a leading lady.

514
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:23,699
She has the prince of Deshan
as her protector. So jealous.

515
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,939
Today our grand prize is

516
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:28,379
one night in the Presidential Suite
at the Botticelli Hotel.

517
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,179
Looking for Mr. Yao?
He left out of anger.

518
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,340
Let's see who the lucky one is.

519
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,219
No. 66, is No. 66 here?

520
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,980
Is No. 66 present now?

521
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,820
Come on, eat more.

522
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,340
- Thank you, Mrs. Mai.
- Is that enough?

523
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,859
Yes, it's so delicious.

524
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,980
I thought Huan's cooking
was really tasty.

525
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:06,419
But your cooking is even better.

526
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,300
Does it run in the family?

527
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,139
Absolutely amazing.

528
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:11,699
Thank you.

529
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,659
I was planning on staying
at the hotel tonight.

530
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,740
So we didn't prepare much food at home.

531
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:19,459
You should come again another day,

532
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,980
and I'll cook you something good.

533
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,699
- Take it slow.
- Our house is small.

534
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,219
Apologies for that.

535
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,740
No way.

536
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,780
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, to tell you the truth...
Thank you, Mrs. Mai.

537
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,139
Ever since I was little,

538
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,060
my parents have been particularly busy.

539
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Especially my dad, who I couldn't
see even once a week.

540
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,219
So a family atmosphere like yours

541
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,260
is what I've dreamed of having.

542
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,740
Yes, that's different.

543
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,899
Your parents are in big business.

544
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,340
We... I'm just a housewife, right?

545
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,459
Her dad is always
behind the steering wheel.

546
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,060
This is what we've done with our lives.

547
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:59,379
But what we do is not important.

548
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,619
What's important is that
Huan is very excellent.

549
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,980
We're proud of her.

550
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,540
Yes, we're proud of her.

551
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,299
Come on. Slow down.

552
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,580
Here, drink this.

553
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,860
Don't choke. Alright.

554
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,060
I know why Huan can be so great.

555
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,139
It's because she grew up
happily in your love.

556
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,659
Jialiang does have a way with words.

557
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,739
One can tell right away
that your parents raised you well.

558
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,699
Speaking of your parents,

559
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,139
should we meet with your parents?

560
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,819
That's great, Mrs. Mai.

561
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,699
My parents will surely come to visit.

562
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,659
Alright, that's really good.

563
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,139
Jialiang, her father and I

564
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,139
have worked hard for our lives,
and for what?

565
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,619
It's all for Huan to have a good life,

566
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,659
to marry well, and to live happily.

567
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,699
What are you doing? What?

568
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,860
- What's the matter?
- What?

569
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,460
- I swear...
- Alright, you don't have to stand up.

570
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,940
It's hard for you to stand up. Stop.

571
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
No, it's fine.

572
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,619
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, I swear

573
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,339
that if Huan marries me,

574
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,139
I'll definitely make her happy.

575
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,100
She'll do whatever she wants to do.

576
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,259
If she doesn't want to work,
I'll support her.

577
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,139
Huan, you're back.

578
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,699
- Do you need help?
- No, thanks.

579
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,776
You're back.

580
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,420
Huan, you're back.

581
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,060
- Ms. Zhou.
- Congratulations.

582
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,020
I heard you found a very rich boyfriend.

583
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,699
- I'm flattered.
- Your mom brought your boyfriend home.

584
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,860
All people in the alley know about it.

585
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,739
Huan, I'm very happy
for you to marry well.

586
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,020
Don't ignore us in the future.

587
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,299
Ms. Zhou, I'll go home now.

588
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,299
She won't let someone support her.

589
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:57,580
Yes, she won't want that.

590
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,819
Xin Jialiang, what are you doing here?

591
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,580
I invited him here.

592
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,339
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

593
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,819
You've called him over here.

594
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:12,139
Huan, Jialiang proposed to you
in front of so many people.

595
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:15,060
And he even brought a ring.

596
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,980
So I needed to see him and ask him

597
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,580
about a meeting between parents.

598
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,940
Mom.

599
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,739
Marriage is a matter
between Jialiang and me.

600
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,299
Can you please not interfere
and let us make our own decisions?

601
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,020
Huan, you are being willful.

602
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,540
Jialiang is so good to you.

603
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,139
You have been together for three years.

604
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:33,380
If it were me, I'd have long...
Just say yes,

605
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
No, Mom, that's not the same thing.

606
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,619
How come I can't make you understand?

607
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:41,739
Mrs. Mai, I was being
inconsiderate today.

608
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,860
Huan, don't be angry.

609
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:46,020
You've had a long day.
Sit down and eat now.

610
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,020
I'll leave now. Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

611
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:50,779
Are you full yet?

612
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,699
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai, goodbye.

613
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,100
- Xin Jialiang.
- Have some more...

614
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,380
Come outside with me.

615
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:05,819
Goodbye, Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

616
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,060
Good, come again.

617
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,860
- Okay.
- Sorry, sorry.

618
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:18,060
Huan, speak nicely,
and don't get worked up.

619
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,219
Mr. Dull. I want
to take a photo with you.

620
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,139
No, I can't take a photo with you.

621
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:38,540
Besides, I'm a knight,
not a doll, and I'm busy.

622
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,299
Look, my child is young.
Just indulge him.

623
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,980
I really can't.

624
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:49,580
Buddy, if you ask me,

625
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,259
my answer would be no.

626
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,980
But I listen to that lady there.

627
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,380
If she says yes, then I can do it.
Go and ask her.

628
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,940
Miss, can I take a photo with Uncle?

629
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,299
- Y-Yes.
- She said yes.

630
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:07,659
Come on, let's take a photo.

631
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,739
Come on, strike a pose.

632
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,139
- Come on.
- One, two, three, cheese.

633
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,339
Come on, another one.

634
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,779
That's awesome.

635
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,460
- Say thank you.
- Thank you, Uncle.

636
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,339
- You're welcome.
- Alright, goodbye.

637
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:24,540
Wait. Remember something.

638
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,139
Call me Big Brother, not Uncle.

639
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:29,819
- Goodbye, Big Brother.
- Goodbye, buddy.

640
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,380
At your age, it's natural for them
to call you Uncle. Shameless.

641
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Huan, I'm sorry.

642
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,739
Do you still remember this?

643
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,299
Why do you still have this?

644
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,940
Of course, I kept it.

645
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:57,739
When we first met,

646
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,739
it was at the cafe next to your hotel.

647
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,540
I forgot to charge
my phone the day before.

648
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,699
I couldn't even show
the presentation to the client.

649
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,540
I was so anxious back then

650
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:13,259
and right when I was
sweating bullets, you showed up.

651
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,940
You gave me this power bank.

652
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,819
Like an angel,

653
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,940
you spread love to the world.

654
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,860
That's a bit exaggerated.

655
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,299
I just saw you were
all flustered and alone,

656
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,060
so I lent a hand, that's all.

657
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,779
There's another secret
that I haven't told you.

658
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,500
Actually, my phone
was fully charged later.

659
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,420
But I told you it wasn't

660
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:41,299
and I still needed to use
your power bank.

661
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,060
Because only by doing so,

662
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:47,299
can I get your contact information.

663
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,619
You know what happened next.

664
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:53,460
Each time I would say I forgot to bring it
and I'd give it to you next time.

665
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,739
After back and forth like this,
you became my girlfriend.

666
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,739
Huan, I found it yesterday.

667
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,139
I hope this power bank

668
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,739
can continue to charge our relationship.

669
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,060
Baby, please don't cry.

670
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,060
Please don't cry.
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

671
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:38,808
What did you do wrong?

672
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,420
Are you talking
about the last time or this time?

673
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,139
Regardless of that,

674
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,819
I was wrong and I won't
dare to do it again.

675
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,900
I will always listen to you.

676
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,100
Whatever you say goes.

677
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,299
Xin Jialiang, do you think that I can

678
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:01,540
forgive you like this every time?

679
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
No, not at all.

680
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,020
You've made such a fuss today
and called so many people there.

681
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:06,299
How much did it cost?

682
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,179
How will you live
after spending all this money?

683
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,100
It's not like I don't earn a salary.

684
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:17,139
You have forgiven me, right?

685
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,980
I didn't say that. I'll have to see
how you behave in the future.

686
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,860
Rest assured, I will behave well.

687
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:25,739
This outfit is exhausting.

688
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,299
It's really weighing me down.

689
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,299
I'm glad you've forgiven me.

690
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,580
- Great.
- What are you doing?

691
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,020
Come on, you've forgiven me.

692
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,860
- What?
- I was wrong.

693
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,540
- Don't come over.
- You've forgiven me.

694
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,659
- I was wrong.
- I haven't forgiven you.

695
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,299
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

696
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,380
Xin Jialiang, where is the ring?

697
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:46,940
It's with your mom.

698
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:55,020
It's so beautiful.

699
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,100
Put it on, and let me have a look.

700
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:03,900
It really looks good.

701
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:11,940
Time really flies.

702
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,420
My daughter is getting married.

703
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,619
I really can't bear to see you
marry into another family.

704
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Mom.

705
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,460
It's not like I won't come back
after getting married.

706
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:33,540
I'm just getting married

707
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,060
and starting a family together
with someone on an equal basis.

708
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,100
Even if I do get married,

709
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,380
I'm still your baby.

710
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,980
Of course.

711
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,580
You will always be my baby.

712
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:50,020
No matter how old you are,
you're still my baby.

713
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,339
Even when you have your own baby,
you'll still be my baby.
