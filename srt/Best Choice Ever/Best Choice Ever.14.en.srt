3
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,204
Zao, I bought some fitness equipment.

4
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:43,844
Can you help me assemble it after work?

5
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,445
Sure, no problem. I'll be right over.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,240
(Economic Law)

7
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:10,424
Mao.

8
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,285
So fast. Are you not working today?

9
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,405
I'm on an outside assignment nearby.
Where is the stuff?

10
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,152
That one.

11
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,684
There's also this one
with a wave pattern. Do you like it?

12
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,605
How is it?

13
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,216
Almost done.

14
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,045
Have some water. Thanks.

15
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,112
No, thanks.

16
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:57,364
Zao, you seem a bit off today.

17
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:58,725
Did something happen?

18
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,084
No, nothing.

19
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:04,165
If anything's wrong, you can talk to me.

20
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:05,964
It's really nothing.

21
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:09,368
Okay, it's ready. Give it a try.

22
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:13,804
Thanks. Have some water.
Let me see if it's okay.

23
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,325
- It's good.
- Good, right?

24
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,285
What would I do without you?

25
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,845
What suddenly made you
decide to buy this?

26
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:29,364
I've been sitting and drawing every day
and haven't had time to exercise.

27
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,484
If this continues, I'll get so fat.

28
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,484
But at your pace, I don't think
you'll lose much weight.

29
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,084
Find me some dynamic music.

30
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,376
I'll practice for 30 minutes
with it, okay?

31
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:44,084
Okay. Does this work?

32
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:46,165
Yes.

33
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:52,484
I gotta make a plan to lose weight.

34
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,484
For the next month,
30 minutes every day.

35
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:56,568
You'll supervise me, okay?

36
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,684
No problem.

37
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,005
- Deal.
- Keep up.

38
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's do it.

39
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:04,964
It's not even a minute yet.

40
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,205
Mao, I'll go now.
Call me if you need anything.

41
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,845
Okay, take care.

42
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:36,845
Another order.

43
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,684
You've got bunny ears.
How much did you earn this month?

44
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,364
With a few more orders each day,
I'll hit 10,000.

45
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,205
- Keep it up, dude.
- Be careful.

46
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:45,208
I'm going.

47
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:57,244
100,000 for a complete house renovation.

48
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,208
(199,592 in total)

49
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:07,765
How can 199,000 be called 100,000?
It's just clickbait again.

50
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:11,165
Hi, Chenghuan.

51
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:13,845
Sherry, how come you're here?

52
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,085
I haven't had a chance to greet you
since you transferred here.

53
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,765
Am I not welcome?

54
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,085
How could that be?
Let's have lunch here. It's my treat.

55
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:24,645
Just kidding. I heard your pipes burst.

56
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:29,405
Yesterday when I handled the work with
Ms. Zhang from the Engineering Dept,

57
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,124
I asked her about
the outsourced engineering team for you.

58
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,444
They just happen to be available.

59
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,645
If you need it, I'll send you
their phone number.

60
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,645
Our hotel has high demands,
so they must be trustworthy.

61
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,884
As for the budget,
just go by your requirements.

62
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:43,444
I really need it, Sherry.

63
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,965
I am deeply grateful beyond words.

64
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,965
Don't be a stranger.

65
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,364
We've been through thick and thin.
It's the least I can do.

66
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,564
I recommend them,

67
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,765
but it's up to you
whether to use them or not.

68
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:56,324
I know. I'm already grateful.

69
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:58,845
I'll work out the budget
and then call them.

70
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,324
I'll be going.

71
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,085
Aren't you going
to have lunch here with me?

72
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:06,104
No, I have a date
with a handsome guy. Bye.

73
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,045
Bye.

74
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,684
Mr. Yao, it's done.

75
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:33,304
With Sherry's help,
Chenghuan said yes immediately.

76
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:34,872
Do you need me to help you?

77
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:38,045
Like letting her know
what you did to her?

78
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:39,960
No need.

79
00:06:56,924 --> 00:07:00,085
What brings you here, Mr. Yao?

80
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,405
I'm here to refer a client to you.

81
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:07,605
Some of my overseas friends want
customized tours. Contact them.

82
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,285
I'm really thankful to you, Mr. Yao.

83
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,444
You're a nice neighbor.

84
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,244
One more thing.

85
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:20,645
The superintendent of our floor
has been here for some time now.

86
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,244
I think she has done an excellent job.

87
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,645
Shouldn't we show some appreciation?

88
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,484
Are you talking about Mai Chenghuan?

89
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,004
That girl is good. She does a great job.

90
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,124
Our relationships
have improved thanks to her.

91
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,244
Why don't we give her a red envelope?

92
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,405
It isn't appropriate,
and she won't accept it.

93
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:42,324
We can give honor instead,
and you're the most suitable to do it.

94
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,880
Honey, got it.
I just finished talking with Mr. Xin.

95
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,364
I'll go back right away. Okay.

96
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,364
Why the close watch?

97
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:53,605
She's too young and she's just pregnant.

98
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,045
She's watching me so closely all day.

99
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:03,165
So you have a baby. Congratulations!

100
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:07,285
For us businessmen, when the family
prospers, so does wealth.

101
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,405
By the time the little one grows up,

102
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,725
I reckon I'll be long gone.

103
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,564
- Come on.
- I'm really envious of you.

104
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:17,684
Your son and daughter
have grown up. So great.

105
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:19,645
Thank you.

106
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,965
- Alright.
- Goodbye.

(Test Results)

109
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,844
Mr. Xin, since you
do not want to get a divorce,

110
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,804
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

111
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:53,645
I haven't told you
about my pregnancy before.

112
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,564
I have now decided to terminate it.

113
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:11,724
Sorry, the number you have dialed is...

115
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,200

119
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,204
Do you have to?

120
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:56,204
Can't we just talk things out?

121
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,645
I can't even see you!

122
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,245
Should I be talking to the air?

123
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:04,245
Come one. Haven't I come? Let's sit.

124
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,245
Aren't you afraid of me
causing you trouble anymore?

125
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,645
Come on. It's not trouble.

126
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:20,204
I'm delighted to have
one more child at an old age.

127
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,204
What do you mean?

128
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:29,604
Have this baby.
Since fate has brought it to me,

129
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,885
let's bring it into the world
to have a look.

130
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:34,564
- Really?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,645
Thank you on behalf of the baby.

Baoqiao.

133
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,724
Recently, I've been so busy
with the company's affairs,

134
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,872
so I haven't been able
to take care of you much.

135
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:52,525
From now on, feel free
to say whatever you want.

136
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:57,525
I don't want anything else.
I just want you.

137
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,405
When will you give me
and the baby a home?

138
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:10,005
Baoqiao, we can talk about anything,

139
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:12,525
except for this matter.

140
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,125
What do you mean?

141
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,444
If you don't get a divorce,
what about me and the baby?

142
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:20,696
Keep it down. Don't make it worse.

143
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,405
I don't care. Let's have it out here.

144
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,525
Are you going to divorce or not?

145
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,005
Lower your voice.
Let me tell you, Baoqiao,

146
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:32,645
I promise to be responsible
for you and the baby,

147
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,456
but you must know your place.

148
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:37,645
Otherwise, you go ahead.

149
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,456
Xin Zhishan,
what do you mean? I haven't...

150
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,525
What do you really mean?

151
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,444
Drop the act. Stand up.

152
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,165
Did you hear that?

153
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:59,285
Doctor! Help!

154
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,885
Okay, got it.

155
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,365
Don't break it. It's good, right?

156
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,444
- There she is.
- Chenghuan.

157
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:10,525
- Chenghuan.
- Chenghuan.

158
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,604

Look, problem-solver, dedicated service.

160
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:21,564
Chenghuan, this is a banner sent to you
by all the tenants on the fifth floor.

161
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:24,604
Thank you
for your care after you joined.

162
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,245
Keep up the good work.

163
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,765
Thank you, Ms. Chen.
I will continue to do my best.

164
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,765
And Manager Zhang,
if you are going to rotate positions,

165
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,084
you better not transfer
Chenghuan to another floor.

166
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,885
She has spoiled all of us.

167
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,444
Ms. Chen,
you can rest assured about that.

168
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,924
The floor that Chenghuan is in charge of

169
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,365
- now has the highest renewal rate here.
- Really?

170
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,125
I'm counting on her to set
an example for the others.

171
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:51,005
You got all this right after you
came here. You're outshining all of us.

172
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,485
I'm no match for you.

173
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:56,084
Thank you. I wouldn't receive
this honor today

174
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,264
without you guys. Thank you.

175
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,564
Mr. Yao, what can I do for you?

176
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,204
I've come to get the renewal contract.

177
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:12,165
That's perfect. Mr. Yao
is a tenant on the fifth floor too.

178
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:15,844
Ms. Chen, Mr. Yao, how about
we take a photo with Chenghuan?

179
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,564
We can hang it on the wall.
It will look nice.

180
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,204
- Mr. Yao.
- Sure. Come here, Mr. Yao.

181
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:23,245
Come on, Chenghuan.
Stand in the middle. Come.

182
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:30,045
Ready, three, two, one, cheese!

183
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:35,084
Mr. Yao, thank you for your renewal.

184
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:39,324
And you contributed
to that honorary banner, right?

185
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:42,684
I'll buy you
some coffee sometime. Thanks.

186
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:44,924
Being so generous now?

187
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:49,964
Yeah, the group highly
values the customers' feedback.

188
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:53,125
Besides, that banner is worth 300 yuan.

189
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,640
You did me a great favor.

190
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,384
So you're not mad at me anymore?

191
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:04,084
If I were still angry,
I would be too petty.

192
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:07,604
Besides, being angry
is just wearing me out.

193
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:14,204
Let me tell you, a period of time
in a junior position is enough.

194
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,765
I transferred you here
so that you could build your network

195
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,765
and turn it into your resources
in the future.

196
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:20,765
I know that, Mr. Yao.

197
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:24,684
Sorry.

198
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:30,488
Hello, Miss Zhu, what's it?

199
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,844
Chenghuan, Mr. Xin had a stroke.

200
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,924
Mr. Xin had a stroke?
But why are you calling me?

201
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,564
I broke up with Mr. Xin.

202
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:48,204
But he refused and came to see me.

203
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,365
Anyway, we had a fight and then he fell.

204
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,084
He's being resuscitated right now.

205
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,045
I can't afford the surgery fee.

206
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:58,444
Can you come and help me?

207
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:01,525
If you don't know what to do,

208
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:03,924
call the Xin family.

209
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,645
Why would you call me?

210
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:10,885
Chenghuan, Mr. Xin is like this
because of me. His family...

211
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,765
It's urgent,

212
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,564
and you are my only friend now.

213
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:17,604
Please, come help me, Chenghuan.

214
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:19,365
I'm sorry, Miss Zhu.

215
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,844
I'm at work right now.
There's nothing I can do.

216
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:25,645
I think you should call
the Xin family now

217
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,245
instead of calling me.

218
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:35,165
Mai Chenghuan, I'm telling you,
don't get involved in this mess.

219
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:40,684
I know. Mr. Yao, I'll go to work now.

220
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,904
(Zhu Baoqiao)

221
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:09,285
The number you have dialed is busy.
Please try again later.

(Jialiang)

225
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:32,485
The number you have dialed
is unavailable. Please try again later.

226
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:46,245
Xin Jialiang, your father had a stroke
and is now in the hospital.

227
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,964
Here's the address.
You'd better go check on it.

228
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,168
(Zhu Baoqiao)

229
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,668
(The intersection
of Xule Road and Xuyao Road)

230
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:17,564
Manager Zhang.

231
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:22,040
I've got a personal matter today.
May I take a leave?

232
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,644
- Okay.
- Thank you

233
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:31,228
(Bank card)

234
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,040
I knew for sure you would go.

235
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,804
You've decided
to wade into this mess, right?

236
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:53,176
I am going, but not
to wade into the mess.

237
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,485
It's to repay a debt.

238
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:01,445
Have you ever thought about it?
She's Xin Zhishan's mistress.

239
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,884
How can she not even afford
tens of thousands for surgery?

240
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,364
I don't care about what she wants to do.

241
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,005
Anyway, I'm just going
to repay the money.

242
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,364
Other matters are none of my business.

243
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:16,056
That's the right attitude,
but let me remind you of something.

244
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:19,844
Always keep vigilant.

245
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,424
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Yao.

246
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,324
Later, drop me off
at the entrance before you park.

247
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:29,804
Okay.

248
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,528
(Outpatient Department)

249
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,045
Chenghuan, you're here.

250
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,124
What's the situation now?

251
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:47,644
He's still in resuscitation.

252
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:51,485
I don't know why he fainted.

253
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:53,765
Is Xin Zhishan's family here?

254
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,840
Here.

255
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,164
An acute cerebral infarction.
A mechanical thrombectomy is needed.

256
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:02,045
Who is the family member? Please sign
the consent form for the surgery.

257
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:07,324
Doctor, is there a high risk
with this surgery?

258
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,045
Any surgery carries risks.

259
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,884
Especially considering
the patient's age,

260
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,205
there could be unforeseen events
during anesthesia and the surgery.

261
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,604
So you need to be mentally prepared.

262
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:19,644
I-I-I'm not feeling well.
I need to use the restroom.

263
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,804
Where are you going? Zhu Baoqiao!

264
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,485
Can you sign it?

265
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:27,804
Doctor, let me call and ask
when the others can arrive.

266
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:28,856
Okay.

267
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,485
Hello?

268
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,404
Xin Jialiang, when will you get here?

269
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:39,245
The doctor needs you
to sign a surgery consent form.

270
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,245
It's an emergency. Can you sign for me?

271
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,005
We'll listen to the doctor.

272
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,045
Hurry up.

273
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:47,324
Doctor, it will take
another half an hour.

274
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,084
We can't wait for that long.

275
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:52,604
Can we proceed with the surgery

276
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:54,124
before they arrive and sign?

277
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,445
No. The patient is
in a very bad condition.

278
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,765
You'd best make a decision right away.

279
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,485
If we don't rescue him promptly,
his life will be in danger.

280
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:07,704
Make a decision soon.

281
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,324
Give it to me.

282
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:19,768
Page two. Hurry up.

283
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,324
Doctor, it's all on you.

284
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:38,424
Okay.

285
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:44,005
Mai Chenghuan, are you crazy?
Why are you always playing the good guy?

286
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,804
Do you have to come to the rescue
whenever your friend messes up?

287
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:51,685
It will be too late
when the Xin family arrives.

288
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,725
Right now, there's a life
at stake in front of me.

289
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:56,725
I can't stand by.

290
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,164
What if he can't be saved?

291
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,404
Do you know what that means

292
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:04,844
if he can't be rescued?

293
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:10,005
I haven't thought that much. I just...

294
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:14,765
I can't just stand by idly
when this happens to anyone.

295
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:19,084
Let's go to pay the money and leave.

296
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:35,485
Chenghuan, how is Mr. Xin?
Has the surgery been done?

297
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:39,844
You're worried now?
Where did you go earlier?

298
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:43,445
I was just scared.
I came out to calm down.

299
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:45,164
Thank you.

300
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:48,525
You hid away when being asked to sign.
Once it's done, you show up again.

301
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,604
Mr. Xin has a good eye,
finding such a smart person.

302
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:57,324
Chenghuan, the doctor just mentioned
that the surgery was very risky.

303
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:59,965
It happened when Mr. Xin came to see me.

304
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:02,925
If I signed, the Xin family
would come to me.

305
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,965
Let me tell you,
they'll come to you sooner or later.

306
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:09,644
- Huan.
- How is my dad?

307
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,884
Mai Chenghuan just signed
the surgery consent form for you.

308
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,048
Mr. Xin is still in the ER.

309
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:14,804
- Thank you
- Thank you.

310
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:16,124
Hurry and go.

311
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,765
Hello, doctor.

312
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:24,644
Chenghuan, Mr. Xin and I will definitely
remember your kindness today.

313
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,680
Please keep it a secret for us.

314
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,804
I knew it was you.
You shameless thing seduced my dad.

315
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,564
Jiali.

316
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:36,124
Zhu Baoqiao, I'm telling you, no way.

317
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:39,445
After figuring out the financial records
between you and my dad over the years,

318
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,644
I will settle accounts
with you to the last penny.

319
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,205
You just wait to face a lawsuit.

320
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:46,604
All you think about is money.
Your dad is still in the operating room.

321
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:49,765
Look at you. Even one's own kid
wouldn't do much.

322
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,205
You're blaming me now?

323
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,324
I'm pregnant!

324
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:58,965
Listen well. I'm carrying
your father's baby.

325
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:02,644
Mom.

326
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:03,804
I'll beat you!

327
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:04,888
Mai Chenghuan!

328
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:13,404
Mai Chenghuan? I wondered
why it was you who notified us.

329
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,404
So you're in cahoots with this mistress.

330
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:18,200
You had been colluding
all along, hadn't you?

331
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,644
Don't go spouting
malicious accusations, okay?

332
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:24,124
Am I? You tried to seduce
my brother and failed.

333
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,445
And then you wanna take revenge on us.

334
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:28,364
Fine. I won't let it go with you today.

335
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:32,404
Mai Chenghuan, who do you think you are?

336
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,084
Why do you have to be
at odds with our family?

337
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,124
Why do you persist in making things
difficult with our family?

338
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,336
I won't let it go with you today.

339
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,285
Xin Jiali, listen.

340
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:44,568
Mai Chenghuan rushed here and signed
the consent form to save your dad.

341
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,124
What right do you have to talk nonsense?

342
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:50,965
And where did you pop out from?
What's it to you?

343
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,685
Mai Chenghuan's business is mine.

344
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:56,644
Xin Jiali, your dad
is being resuscitated inside right now.

345
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,604
Could you please stop slandering me?

346
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,844
I came here today

347
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:03,324
because I saw your dad
with Zhu Baoqiao previously.

348
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:05,884
This is the hush money your dad gave me.

349
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:09,525
I came here to return the money today,
not to be humiliated by you.

350
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,525
I'm returning the money to you now.

351
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:15,884
Also, please don't come to me
with your family's issues anymore.

352
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:32,005
So it's true that cornered animals
are the most dangerous.

353
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:36,564
I tolerated them
because I loved Xin Jialiang.

354
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:41,445
I no longer do it
because I've completely moved on.

355
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:44,884
I don't want to have anything
to do with the Xin family anymore.

356
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,884
You can still smile?

357
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,804
That is a relieved smile.

358
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:57,765
The time I spent with him
was like an illusion.

359
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:02,285
I thought I had seen through them
the day we broke up.

360
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:05,272
I didn't expect there to be aftershocks.

361
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:10,005
It's good that you figured it out.
Just consider it as a lesson.

362
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:13,324
The lesson is quite expensive.

363
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:18,205
But come to think of it,
during the days I spent with him,

364
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:20,152
I experienced more joy than sadness.

365
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:23,844
So I haven't lost out.

366
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:28,445
Arguing even brought out insights, huh?

367
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:32,084
Oh, right. Thank you for today.

368
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:35,404
Without you, my face
would probably be battered.

369
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:37,804
I owe you a favor.

370
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,445
If you ever need anything,
just let me know.

371
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,084
I need you to return
the favor right now.

372
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:47,925
Your three shrimp noodles.

373
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:48,984
Thank you.

374
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:58,685
Give it a try.

375
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,136
I've been here for so long

376
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:05,084
and haven't had
authentic three shrimp noodles. Thanks.

377
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,685
You've got the right person.

378
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:10,124
I often eat at this noodle shop.
It's quite small,

379
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:12,765
but it's one of the few in Shanghai
that still uses genuine ingredients.

380
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,765
It was a long drive and a long queue.

381
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:19,164
If it's not good, you'll be to blame.

382
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:20,164
Rest assured.

383
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,765
That's not how you eat it.
Give it to me.

384
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:32,844
You need to mix it up
so that the flavors meld. Taste it.

385
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,045
How is it?

386
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:44,644
Not bad.

387
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,285
This is quite a skillful noodle dish.

388
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,324
You can only get it
one month out of the year.

389
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:52,472
And it requires Taihu Lake shrimp
and complex preparation.

390
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:55,604
Now with high rent and expensive costs,

391
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:58,725
many restaurants resort
to using half-finished products.

392
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:01,324
Only this one still insists
on hand-making.

393
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:05,884
Good things come from slow processes.
It's a limited-edition dish.

394
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:08,084
I can taste the dedication in it.

395
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:12,725
I spent 128 yuan on it,
quite the splurge.

396
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:14,404
Eat it up to appreciate
my thoughtfulness.

397
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:16,084
Didn't you just get
your performance bonus?

398
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:21,005
That's not much. I've just taken
a pay cut and a demotion.

399
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:25,164
Love can't fill your stomach,
but your salary can pay the bills.

400
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,164
For me, making money comes first.

401
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:31,564
You've got the right idea,
Mai Chenghuan.

402
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,604
No. 36, sweet and sour ribs!

403
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:37,884
Ours.

404
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:42,525
Thanks.

405
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,324
You've had a busy day today.

406
00:27:58,324 --> 00:28:00,205
How about taking a day off tomorrow?

407
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,965
The full attendance bonus
is 1,500 yuan each month. Bye.

408
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:10,725
Thanks for today.

409
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:44,525
Zhiming, how's the progress
in Xing'anli?

410
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:47,005
I'm working on the Xing'anli project.

411
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:51,844
Zhiming, the headquarters still only
wants me to be the acting president.

412
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:55,925
If we don't press our advantage
and make some achievements,

413
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:59,245
there's a possibility that a new
president might be parachuted in.

414
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:01,144
At that time, my position is not secure.

415
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:04,404
You might also miss out
on your chance for promotion.

416
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:05,685
You need to be clear on this.

417
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:06,925
I have my plan.

418
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,884
How is it? Any discomfort

419
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,045
like dizziness or nausea?

420
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,604
You've recovered well. Have a good rest.

421
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:39,884
Doctor, how is my dad?

422
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,604
Nothing serious, but you need
to pay attention to his emotions.

423
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:44,164
Make sure he doesn't get agitated again.

424
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:45,564
Okay, thank you.

425
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:54,844
Mom, let's go in and see my dad.

426
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:05,604
I won't go in.
You and your sister stay with him.

427
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:11,124
He is sick now. Can't we talk
about that thing after he's discharged?

428
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,084
I don't want to see
that person ever again.

429
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:25,976
Mom.

430
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,804
Why did our family become like this?

431
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:40,164
Chill out. There's no escaping
the inevitable.

432
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,765
Let's go see our dad.

433
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,404
How are you, Dad?
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

434
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:55,604
My phone.

435
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:06,205
Call Chenghuan.

436
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,005
Put it on speaker.

437
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:28,525
Hello?

438
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:33,884
Hello, Chenghuan, I'm much better.

439
00:31:34,564 --> 00:31:39,164
The doctor said
if it had been half an hour later,

440
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:44,084
it would have caused
irreversible damage to my brain.

441
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:48,525
Thank you for signing
on my behalf, Chenghuan.

442
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:51,245
You're welcome, Mr. Xin.
It's good that you're recovering.

443
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,072
You're a good girl.

444
00:31:54,765 --> 00:32:01,564
We were foolish
and hurt you and your family.

445
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,412
I sincerely

446
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,285
apologize to you. I'm sorry.

447
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:16,564
It's all in the past.
You don't have to say sorry.

448
00:32:16,564 --> 00:32:23,416
I sincerely want to give you
a big red envelope.

449
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:28,324
But I know you.

450
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:33,525
You definitely won't accept it.

451
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:40,120
That's why I'm shamelessly calling you.

452
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:47,285
I hope you can accept it.

453
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:51,364
Mr. Xin, I already
broke up with Jialiang.

454
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,685
I definitely won't accept
your red envelope.

455
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,485
Besides, anyone in my place

456
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,448
would have done the same thing.

457
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:02,445
Now that you're alright,

458
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:05,604
I'll go to work. Take care of yourself.

459
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:16,205
Dad, what would you like to eat?
I'll go and buy it for you.

460
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:20,644
Do you still care about me?

461
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:26,124
Do you even think of me
when you're playing games?

462
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:30,364
Dad, how can you say that?

463
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:35,064
Your mistress ran away too, didn't she?

464
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:45,725
You can't even hold
a candle to Chenghuan.

465
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:52,804
Get out. Get out.

466
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,644
Dad, don't get angry. We'll leave.

467
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:01,164
I'm right outside. Call me
if you need anything. Go.

468
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:06,844
Dad, rest well.

469
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,064
Mao.

470
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:17,365
I'm here.

471
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:26,965
Mao, you really are something.

472
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,325
Putting the expensive Australian Pearls
at the door.

473
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,525
Don't you worry someone steals it?

474
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:33,084
Who do I need to worry
when I've got a heroine around?

475
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:34,965
What happened to your head?

476
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,764
I just bumped my head.
It's nothing serious.

477
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,564
You went to clean up
the Xin family's mess, right?

478
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:48,644
Spending a lot of time
and effort saving a life.

479
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:53,525
The "heroine" is an understatement.
I should call you the Bodhisattva.

480
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,724
Alright, stop making fun of me.

481
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:59,672
It was an emergency.
You would have gone too if you were me.

482
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,805
Neither of us is heartless.

483
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:06,124
That's not necessarily true.
It depends on who the other person is.

484
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:10,365
How much longer will it take you
to thread all these pearls?

485
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:16,045
It's wedding season.
I've been swamped with too many orders.

486
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:21,764
Mao, seeing you like this now
truly makes me happy.

487
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:23,764
I need to hurry up
and catch up with you.

488
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:32,525
(Jialiang)
Look.

489
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:36,564
He still has the nerve to call you?

490
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:43,965
Your former father-in-law cheated
with your college roommate.

491
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:47,604
And your ex-boyfriend
is like the gum on a shoe.

492
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,204
This plot is way too melodramatic.

493
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:52,045
I think so, too.

494
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,164
But look on the bright side.

495
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:57,204
At least it was discovered
before the marriage.

496
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,445
Cutting the losses in time
and making a graceful exit.

497
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:01,244
That is the adult world.

498
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:06,325
In the past, if someone was born poor
and married a poor guy, it'd be awful.

499
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:09,365
They'd be looked down upon
by relatives and friends.

500
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:11,485
Now the times are different.

501
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,284
At the very least, we can make
a living with our own hands.

502
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:16,760
You've grown up.

503
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,204
Oh, right. I have something for you.

504
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:22,845
What is it?

505
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:27,325
Is it beautiful?

506
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,764
For me?

507
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:30,365
Aren't colored gems in fashion lately?

508
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:33,845
So I set an orange gemstone
for you. Is it beautiful?

509
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:36,564
So pretty, Mao.

510
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:39,644
I wanted to give it
to you on a special day.

511
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,204
It was custom-made for you.

512
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:45,400
Open it and have a look.

513
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:48,764
I can even put a photo inside.

514
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:50,764
Right. What do you think?

515
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:54,005
I really like it too much.

516
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,845
Mao, I will cherish it.

517
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:02,904
Are you free now? Could you help me
thread some pearls?

518
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:07,485
Of course. Since I've accepted
your necklace, I will help you.

519
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:11,845
Great. Take this tool.

520
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,965
You need to put
the thread on. Let me do it.

521
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:28,005
Jialiang, have some water.

522
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,564
Will our mom and dad
really get a divorce?

523
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:45,925
Hard to say. I just saw our mom
sitting alone in the living room

524
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:48,084
without saying a word.

525
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:52,965
I just realized how shrewd our dad was.

526
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,244
He got our mom out of the company early.

527
00:37:57,084 --> 00:38:02,445
We know little about the company.

528
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:04,885
If they really get divorced,

529
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:09,284
it's hard to say
how the assets will be divided.

530
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:13,525
I don't want my family to be destroyed.

531
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:20,536
Jialiang, not to criticize you,
but you really let me down.

532
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,885
I've got married,

533
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,445
so I don't know much about the company.

534
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,405
But our dad has already
put you into the company,

535
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,124
and you know nothing.

536
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:32,764
With a bit of care, you would
at least know our dad got a mistress.

537
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:39,325
How about going to Mai Chenghuan?

538
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:42,724
Why?

539
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:44,045
Marry her.

540
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:54,365
I'd like to,
but it's not possible anymore.

541
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:58,485
Why isn't it possible? It is,
as long as you still love her.

542
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:03,724
And we all heard our dad call her
today to express his thanks.

543
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:06,405
Mai Chenghuan saved our dad.

544
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:08,325
He owes her a favor.

545
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,845
If you two get back together now,

546
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:14,204
he wouldn't ignore our family, right?

547
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,752
You're not over Mai Chenghuan, are you?

548
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:21,604
Our dad values
family inheritance the most.

549
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:25,445
As long as you work hard
and have a family,

550
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:28,525
there's still hope for our family.

551
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:36,405
Yu, did you buy
too few ingredients today?

552
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:39,805
If the two of them come home
to eat tonight, it won't be enough.

553
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,624
Right, you didn't buy any meat.

554
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:45,965
Meat, meat. I'd buy plenty
if I had the money.

555
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,445
You know the expenses we have coming up.

556
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:52,365
We should be thrifty
to make ends meet, understand?

557
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:54,124
They're at Lane 111, so lucky.

558
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:55,564
Yes.

559
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:57,688
Mrs. and Mr. Mai, let me tell you.

560
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,485
Do you know the neighboring Lane 111
is going to be demolished?

561
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:01,925
What about us at Lane 113?

562
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,405
It wasn't included.

563
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:07,325
How could that be? Lane 111, Lane 113.

564
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:09,485
It's just a few steps away.
How could it not be included?

565
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,164
Yeah, we have bad luck.

566
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:15,445
Lane 111 is going to be demolished.
So is Lane 113 soon.

567
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:18,124
- In a few months
- Keep daydreaming.

568
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:20,644
By that time, our family
would have collapsed already.

569
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,845
Mrs. Mai, don't be angry.
It's not a very bad thing.

570
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:27,084
At least we can continue
to be neighbors, right?

571
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:28,824
You're happy.

572
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:37,325
- She's in a mood. See you.
- See you.

573
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,805
Zao, why did you come
from that direction?

574
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:51,405
Isn't the subway station on this side?

575
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:57,485
Huan, I am just as worried
about our dad and mom as you are,

576
00:41:57,485 --> 00:41:59,164
so I came back early.

577
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:02,644
Why did you buy so much stuff?

578
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:06,244
Double portion.
Just to be well-prepared.

579
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:10,405
Zao, there have been so many things
happening at home recently.

580
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,885
I haven't had the time to care
about you. Is your work going well?

581
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:16,124
You always leave work early.
Has your leader said anything to you?

582
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:22,488
The family is in a mess.
I can't let you handle everything.

583
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:25,485
Anyway, I can work from home as well.

584
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,365
Huan, pass it to me.

585
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:31,724
- Can you handle it?
- Yes, come on.

586
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:33,084
I can do this myself.

587
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:36,005
Is there a subway station
or a bus station? Have you asked?

588
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,604
Dad, Mom, we're back.

589
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:43,284
I think I'll spend
all my life in this house.

590
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:44,365
This is my fate.

591
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,164
Dad, what happened to my mom?

592
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:53,485
The neighboring Lane 111
is going to be demolished.

593
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:57,084
But Lane 113 is not. She's upset.
