00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,944
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,760
Dad, what's wrong with mom?

4
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,884
The neighboring Lane 111 is demolished,

5
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:39,096
but the Lane 113 we live in is not.
She's upset.

6
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:43,928
Zao, go downstairs to fetch water.
I'll wash the vegetables later.

7
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:45,043
Okay.

8
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,368
What's the matter?

9
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,164
Are you okay, mom?

10
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:00,763
It's fine. No worries.

11
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,483
Get out of here. I'll clean up.

12
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,004
- Come.
- Peace in pieces.

13
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,683
Let me see if your hand is fine.
And this hand.

14
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:17,764
Our family has fallen on hard times.
What bad luck!

15
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,168
Mom, eat while it's hot.

16
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,364
There are two poached eggs for you.

17
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:34,723
Eat up.

18
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,003
I don't want to eat. It's so hot
and our fridge is broken.

19
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,963
The food in the fridge
will go bad tomorrow.

20
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:49,283
I planned to move it to the fridge
of our neighbor, Mrs. Wang.

21
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:51,000
But her fridge is full.

22
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,648
Now, we can only buy a small amount
of food every day.

23
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,216
It is so hot.
When will our life get better?

24
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,360
Mom, it's just an accident.

25
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,240
Anyway, our house won't be demolished
at the moment.

26
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,160
How about we fix up our house?

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,283
Otherwise, it will happen frequently.

28
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,296
It's really dangerous.

29
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:14,044
What? Do you know how much it costs
to fix up a house?

30
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,764
It's easier said than done.

31
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,843
If it could be fixed,
it would have been done.

32
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:30,244
Huan, what's really going on
between you and Jialiang?

33
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,952
Mom, you already know the answer.

34
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,764
Why don't you reconsider it?

35
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,484
I really regret it.

36
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:49,660
In a fit of anger, I said those words
that upset them. Huan.

37
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:55,883
I know you can't get over Jialiang.

38
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:59,608
Mom, you didn't say anything wrong.

39
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,723
Also, how many times have I told you?

40
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,963
I have nothing to do
with the Xin family anymore.

41
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,443
Don't...

42
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,163
Don't be silly, okay?

43
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:15,403
You have nothing to do with them?

44
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,168
If you marry Xin Jialiang,

45
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:21,368
you won't have to live

46
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,056
in a dilapidated house
with many problems.

47
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:28,536
Let me make it clear.

48
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:31,448
It's not for me but for your own good.

49
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,072
I hope you can live a better life.

50
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,984
As for me, I'm used to it, right?

51
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:40,536
I've lived in this dilapidated house
with your dad for over 30 years.

52
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,520
And I have spent most of my time
in the tiny kitchen.

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,404
I'm used to it. What else can I pursue?

54
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:46,484
I did it all for my daughter and son.

55
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,323
Enough, mom.

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,980
I'll hire workers to repair our house.
Don't worry about it.

57
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,540
I will figure out a solution
for our house, okay?

58
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,992
You figure out a solution?
What can you do?

59
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,821
Even if you resolve it,
it'll just be temporary.

60
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,660
You can't resolve it permanently.

61
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:19,381
How much do you earn each month now?

62
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,300
You work for a lifetime
and can't even afford

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,340
a bathroom downstairs.
Do you understand?

64
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,501
Can you start over now
if you give up on Xin Jialiang?

65
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,821
You're a single woman aged 30.

66
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,261
Enough, mom,
why did you bring it up again?

67
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,581
Mom, don't pressure Huan.

68
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:42,300
Alright, Huan will hire workers
to repair our house.

69
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
She's doing great enough.

70
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:47,832
Don't overthink

71
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,621
when something happens
and you get scared.

72
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,621
Stop it. Only I'm overthinking, alright?

73
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:01,741
And the Mai family is different.

74
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:06,581
The three of you are noble,
lofty, and glorious,

75
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,181
while I'm the only one
who's tacky, alright?

76
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,272
Yu.

77
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:20,888
Your mom is upset

78
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,072
because our house can't be demolished.

79
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,780
It's all my fault, anyway.

80
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:39,896
I'm not capable enough
to provide my family with a good life.

81
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,560
That's not true. It's not your fault.
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,941
Zao, stay here and keep dad company.

83
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:52,181
I'll go look for mom.

84
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:15,141
Mom, I was wrong.
I shouldn't have spoken so harshly.

85
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,780
Please don't be angry, okay?

86
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:23,100
Mom.

87
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,120
How could I not be angry?

88
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,540
I can't give up pursuing a better life.

89
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,136
Otherwise, I'll be slack
for the rest of my life,

90
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,741
and there will be no hope
for our family.

91
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:37,496
I can surrender to hardship.

92
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,776
but you can't.
You must live a good life.

93
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:51,340
Mom, I'm okay
with my life the way it is.

94
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,741
Anyway, wherever you are, I'll be there.

95
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,941
If the house is broken, we'll fix it.

96
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,392
We do it slowly,
and it will be repaired.

97
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,621
Everything will be fine
as long as our family is together.

98
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:05,261
Fix it? You can fix it now,
but can you fix it for a lifetime?

99
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,832
Alright, you go. Don't follow me.

100
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:18,488
Hello, when can my fridge be delivered?

101
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, please deliver it
as soon as possible. Thank you.

102
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:34,141
A banner, 300 yuan,
and renewal commission, 2,000 yuan.

103
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,660
1,800 yuan after tax.

104
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,472
(Account Overview,72454.75 yuan)

105
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:05,592
(Transfer from Zao)

106
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,341
Why did you transfer money to me?

107
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,101
I want to do my part for the family.

108
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,832
You just started working.
Where did you get the money?

109
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,461
I earned it by being a tutor.
What do you say?

110
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,820
As my name shows,
I do things as early as possible.

111
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,501
I have money now.

112
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,861
Don't pretend to be rich.
Take your money back.

113
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,940
Huan, can you not be like this?

114
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Whether good or bad things happen,
you always hide them from me.

115
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Am I still a part of this family?

116
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,940
Anyway, our house can't be demolished.

117
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
You can spend it on the renovation.

118
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:47,576
And you don't save much money.
Let me help a bit.

119
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,780
Besides, you used to
give me pocket money.

120
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,420
If you don't need my money,
you save it for me.

121
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Give it back to me with interest later.

122
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,512
Alright, I won't reject your kindness.

123
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,144
I'll take the money.

124
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,060
Time to sleep.

125
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,221
Good night.

126
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,341
Chengzao, you've been doing great.

127
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,264
Work harder,
and I'll reward you next time.

128
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,712
Thank you, supervisor.
I will continue to work hard.

129
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,584
Dad, how come you're making breakfast?

130
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,300
Your mom went to bed late last night.
Let her sleep more.

131
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,141
Today, I'll show you my cooking skills.

132
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,261
Come on. Eat while it's hot.

133
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,341
Huan, come on.

134
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,501
Dad is making breakfast?

135
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:25,900
Today's soup dumplings are tasty
with thin crusts and lots of filling.

136
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,221
Take one bite
and get a mouthful of soup.

137
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,060
They're delicious and juicy. Come on.

138
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,341
Dad, I'm running late for work.

139
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,660
I'll finalize
the renovation company today.

140
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,381
Then there will be several plans.

141
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:37,820
You can choose from them.

142
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,512
Huan, wait a minute. I'll go with you.

143
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,660
Let's go.

144
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,816
Wait.

145
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:49,021
For each of you. Eat it on the way.

146
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:51,000
Your mom told me about this last night.

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,101
- Okay.
- Okay.

148
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,820
- It's well-prepared.
- I gotta go, dad.

149
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,741
I'll eat it.

150
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,021
(Sanheli)
You don't have to get off work early.

151
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:08,141
I'm close to home.
You just focus on your work.

152
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,300
Don't let anything affect your work.

153
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,512
Got it, Huan.

154
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,944
You take this and be safe on the road.

155
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,501
You too.

156
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:31,576
(Partner Service Center)
At ease.

157
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:34,820
Attention! Now, let's shout our slogan.

158
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,981
Delivery!

159
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,341
The hungrier, the faster!

160
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,501
Delivery!

161
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,660
The more you eat,
the more handsome you get!

162
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Applause.

163
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,912
Today, I would like to praise
the new delivery guy, Mai Chengzao.

164
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,940
Although he just started working,
he's been doing great.

165
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,376
Put on the champion helmet.

166
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:53,336
(With the helmet,
you will be safe and lovely.)

167
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,424
Applause.

168
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,261
Guys, be safe. Keep it up.

169
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:58,328
- Okay.
- Okay.

170
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,141
Hello.

171
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,981
- When will my food arrive?
- I will be there soon.

172
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,221
- Hurry up.
- Got it.

173
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,461
Chenghuan, hurry up.
Mr. Wang has rushed you many times.

174
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,021
I've arrived.

175
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:24,540
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting.

176
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,580
What took you so long?

177
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:31,381
The takeout can't be sent up,
so I had to fetch it downstairs.

178
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,261
I have spent so much money
to live in your apartment.

179
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,420
Am I the kind of person
who can carry such heavy items?

180
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Wang.
The takeout can't be sent upstairs

181
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,461
in response to concerns
over customers' privacy and security.

182
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,861
Besides, housekeepers can
deliver it for you.

183
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,861
You're Mai Chenghuan, right?

184
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:47,981
Yes.

185
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,381
Are you trying to teach me what to do?

186
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,060
Not at all, Mr. Wang. I apologize
for any inconvenience caused to you.

187
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,461
I will notify the cleaning staff
to clean it up right now.

188
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,420
- Room 412, hurry up.
- I wait again?

189
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,621
When can the cleaning staff come?

190
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,341
My friend is about to arrive.

191
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,216
The floor is messy,
and the smell is bad.

192
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,461
You're here. Why don't you clean it up?

193
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:11,141
No problem, I just think

194
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,660
that I can't clean it up thoroughly
by hand.

195
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,420
Let me quickly clean it up first.

196
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,060
Later, the cleaning staff
will clean it again.

197
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,928
Huan.

198
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,656
You...

199
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:26,861
Mr. Xin, I'm at work right now.

200
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,540
If you need anything,
please wait for me downstairs. Thanks.

201
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:36,621
Hello, sir.

202
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,861
I'll transfer 10,000 yuan to you.
Don't make it difficult for her.

203
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,341
You're insulting me with money.

204
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,580
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

205
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,221
Xin Jialiang, stop causing trouble
and leave right now.

206
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,261
20,000 yuan, and let me be alone
with her for a while.

207
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,021
- Xin Jialiang.
- Deal.

208
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:54,968
Thank you.

209
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,381
I didn't interrupt your work.

210
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:01,780
I had a deal with him.

211
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,568
I suggest you get back the money
you shouldn't have spent.

212
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,820
Of course, if you want to be the fool,

213
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,101
I have no objections.

214
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,660
Since you say so,
I will go and take it back later.

215
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,060
I cannot be a fool.

216
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,784
Mr. Xin, what brings you
to see me today?

217
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,261
Huan, I'm here to apologize.

218
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,381
My dad scolded me and my sister
at the hospital.

219
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,141
I think I deserved it.

220
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:35,381
I've thought a lot about it recently.

221
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,180
I promise if you want respect,
I'll give you respect.

222
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,580
If you need support,
I'll give you support.

223
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,741
I will do whatever you say.

224
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,900
I'll definitely cherish you. Can you...?

225
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,981
Xin Jialiang, we have already broken up.

226
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,660
You bear no relation to me,
so you don't need to apologize to me.

227
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,060
Yueda has fallen out with Deshan.

228
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,820
We've found another hotel
to partner with.

229
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,580
They need a liaison with the management,
so I recommended you.

230
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,496
(Lairui Hotel Group job offer)
The monthly salary is 30,000 yuan.

231
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:15,180
(for Mai Chenghuan)
Can you consider it?

232
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,680
Xin Jialiang keeps showing up.

233
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:30,900
What's he doing? Begging
to get back together shamelessly?

234
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,540
Aren't you afraid that Mai Chenghuan
will make the wrong choice again?

235
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,488
Isn't this the time for you
to show up like a hero

236
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:45,300
to save her from a desperate situation?
What are you waiting for?

237
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,820
After all this time,
you still don't understand her?

238
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,720
She looks soft,
but she is indeed strong willed.

239
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:59,221
She seems easy to sway,
but she's very assertive.

240
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,060
She won't turn back.

241
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,021
Indeed, my family has recently
encountered some difficulties.

242
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,820
This job is more tempting
than ever before.

243
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,820
It seems
I've finally done the right thing.

244
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,459
But I am no longer who I used to be.

245
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,100
Rather than working in a fancy office
as a well-connected girl,

246
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,860
I'd rather earn money diligently
on my own.

247
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,699
Jialiang, whether you

248
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:32,920
offer me this job

249
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,820
because of your dad's recognition to me

250
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,699
or your own guilt,

251
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,820
I will refuse it,
and I don't need it at all.

252
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,808
We have already broken up.
Don't come to see me again.

253
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,960
Boss, do you know if I like spicy
or sweet sauce

254
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,048
when I eat hot pots?

255
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:26,740
Why do I care?

256
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:32,580
Why? I don't even like hot pots.
Flavors don't matter to me.

257
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,500
I've been working for you for years,
but you still don't know that?

258
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,419
You have known Mai Chenghuan
just for a few months.

259
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,219
So, you think you know her pretty well?

260
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:49,780
I mean, what if Mai Chenghuan
really needs help?

261
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,419
As her brother,
you're just going to stand by and watch?

262
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:57,740
Shut up. After the meeting,
take me to the nursing home.

263
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,340
Feeling shy?
Will you ask your grandma for help?

264
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,659
Why are you so talkative?

265
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,260
Can the price be any lower?

266
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,899
It's already very cheap.
Sherry has told me.

267
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,100
Rest assured,
we are giving you the lowest prices.

268
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,860
I know, but...

269
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:27,659
Are you injured?

270
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,219
I'm fine. Is your car okay?

271
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,619
It's okay, as long as you're fine.

272
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,384
Thanks.

273
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,780
Why are you so late?

274
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,699
Madam, sorry about that.
I just had a little accident.

275
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,899
I was delayed for a few minutes.
Please don't give me a bad review.

276
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,459
Look, it's spilled.

277
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:54,379
Sorry, I didn't see it just now.

278
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,619
How about I pay you for compensation?

279
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,659
All right, just leave it at that.

280
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,100
Thank you, and sorry about that.

281
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,899
Huan, how come you're back so early?

282
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,219
Huan, you're frowning so deeply.

283
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,100
Don't fret.

284
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:18,139
I've taken on a big deal that will
be closed by the end of the month.

285
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,260
I will earn at least 10,000 yuan.

286
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,179
We can work together
to overcome any hurdles.

287
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,219
Well, I...

288
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,100
Huan, I...

289
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,939
When our house was flooded,
I took leave to go back.

290
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:23,939
But Luo Mingli deliberately hassled me.

291
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,179
I thought it pointless
to keep working under him.

292
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,899
So I resigned.

293
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,740
Huan, I'm already looking for a new job.

294
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,100
Delivering takeout is just a stopgap.
Don't worry about me.

295
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,419
After suffering so much injustice,
why didn't you tell me?

296
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:46,979
It's no big deal.

297
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,100
In the workplace,

298
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,300
newcomers are easy to be
taken advantage of.

299
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,820
I have experienced the trials
in the workplace.

300
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,219
Tell me.
How many orders have you finished today?

301
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,219
Not many orders.

302
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,820
Don't lie to me. I've checked online.

303
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,860
If you want to get the champion helmet,
you have to keep working without breaks.

304
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,139
Wow, you're quite professional.
You even know this.

305
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,500
Stop fooling me.

306
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:24,500
It hurts?
You must tell me when you're in trouble.

307
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,939
What did you say before?

308
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:29,179
You said if you were in trouble,
you'd surely tell me.

309
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,939
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,340
Actually, it is no big deal.

311
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,939
I have the internship experience
at Fangyuan Law Firm.

312
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:44,379
It's better than having nothing.

313
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,376
Huan, don't take all the responsibility
on yourself.

314
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,979
Can I help you share some of the burden?

315
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:54,179
I'm a son of the Mai family, right?

316
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,580
If you keep doing this, I'll lose face.

317
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,820
I feel very insignificant.

318
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:09,419
Zao, I don't do as well as you.

319
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,020
You do far better than me.

320
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,419
Huan, what's wrong?

321
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,080
Nothing.

322
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:30,860
I finished 90 orders today
and 101 orders yesterday.

323
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,979
I'll be honest with you,
and you don't keep things from me.

324
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Xin Jialiang saw me today.

325
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:43,459
He recommended a job for me.

326
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,139
If I compromised and accepted it,

327
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,232
I wouldn't have to
deal with tough clients anymore

328
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,020
or be obedient to them.

329
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,664
And I don't have to care about
the bonus of 2,000 yuan per month.

330
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:01,219
It feels like all problems
can be solved.

331
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:04,939
But you didn't accept it, did you?

332
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,219
I know our family is having a hard time.

333
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,100
You've worked so hard,

334
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,459
but I've been caring about my dignity.

335
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,340
I feel like I'm just being pretentious.

336
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:30,659
Can my dignity earn me bread and butter?
No, it can't.

337
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,088
Huan, I would have criticized you
if you had accepted it.

338
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,659
It's like a carrot-and-stick approach.

339
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,139
It doesn't hurt much
but it's extremely insulting.

340
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,740
Our family is not wealthy.

341
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,179
But we don't have to compromise.

342
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,500
And if you get used to it over time
and lose your pride,

343
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,580
perhaps in the future,
you may not even dare to speak up.

344
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,939
You have grown up,
knowing how to comfort me.

345
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,820
I should be the one taking care of you.

346
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:13,820
As your older sister, I didn't do well.

347
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,619
Huan, just say whether I'm right or not.

348
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,459
Yeah, you're right, typical of a lawyer.

349
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,179
You make me feel relieved
and free of any guilt.

350
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:33,340
No worries.
Our family has mom's cooking skills,

351
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,260
dad's driving skills,
my strength and sharp tongue,

352
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,300
and your unyielding spirit.

353
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,899
There are no difficulties
we can't overcome.

354
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,060
I've made up my mind.
Let's work hard together.

355
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,619
Let's renovate this old house first.

356
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:50,060
We'll buy a new house together
for Mom and Dad.

357
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,619
I'll make a down payment.

358
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:52,820
I'll pay the mortgage every month.

359
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,340
It sounds like we're already rich.

360
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,448
We definitely will be.

361
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:06,020
Right, don't tell Mom and Dad

362
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,540
about my delivery job
and getting injured.

363
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,219
Don't worry. I'm not foolish.

364
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,219
Apply this. Does it still hurt?

365
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,340
No. I feel better.

366
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,379
Grandma, have a taste.

367
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:34,540
A meat mooncake equals
four bowls of rice in calories.

368
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,820
I can't eat it.

369
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:41,500
I queued for over an hour
to buy it at a time-honored store.

370
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,939
I didn't expect you wouldn't like it.

371
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,899
You've been toiling in the mountains
for so long.

372
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,000
You should take good care of yourself
and drink water. Don't worry about me.

373
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,340
I wanted to keep you company.

374
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,100
Don't hide anything.
Just tell me what's on your mind.

375
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,780
Grandma, you're really smart.

376
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:10,659
I might not finish the task
you assigned me.

377
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:13,699
Tell me why.

378
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:18,260
Mai Chenghuan's house was flooded
because of a burst water pipe.

379
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,179
She's having a hard time.

380
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:22,020
Grandma, could you lend a hand?

381
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,979
How come she didn't tell me about it?

382
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:31,820
Chenghuan, do you need my help
with the things at home?

383
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,340
She told me nothing about it.

384
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,000
Wait, you live so close to her.

385
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:47,139
Why did you come here
and ask me to help her?

386
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:49,860
She is independent of outsiders.

387
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,580
So I think she might rely on people
who are close to her.

388
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,780
She rejected you?

389
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,659
No, but I knew that if I lent a hand,
she would reject me.

390
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,500
That's why I came to you for help.

391
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,459
Thank you, Grandma,
everything has been fixed.

392
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:10,552
No need to worry.

393
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,540
See, I knew she would say that.

394
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,808
Chenghuan has a strong personality.

395
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:21,276
Rest assured, she can handle it herself.

396
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:27,699
The fact that you came
to me is already a big improvement.

397
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:33,179
It seems you had a pleasant trip
with her.

398
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,540
I...

399
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,340
After all, she is related to my task
and your assessment target for me.

400
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,139
And it's concerning the evaluation of me
and my future arrangements.

401
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,979
Then you'll have to work hard.

402
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,100
Of course, I will.

403
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,939
Come on. Let's eat together.

404
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,219
Let's have something low in calories.

405
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,344
This one.

406
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,056
Great.

407
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:46,659
Boss, you've been fishing for so long,
but you haven't caught one.

408
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,979
Are you preoccupied with something?
Thinking about Chenghuan?

409
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,260
Grandma said that she could handle it.

410
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,500
If she didn't ask for help,
she wouldn't need it.

411
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:59,032
Chenghuan might not need help,
but we do.

412
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,664
Get to the point.

413
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,740
We're still missing something.

414
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,659
Grandma has her own thoughts
and plans about the Xing'anli.

415
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:17,780
No offense, but you,
as a biological grandson,

416
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,580
won't gain any benefits
from your grandma.

417
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,060
You might as well ally
with Chenghuan, her granddaughter.

418
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,300
Let her take the lead.

419
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,139
At worst,
you can give her a bit more of a bonus.

420
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,500
Let me remind you.
Grandma and you are related in blood,

421
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,419
but it means nothing
if you're not around her.

422
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,459
It can't
compare to long-term companionship.

423
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,832
Now is not the right time.

424
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,179
Why?

425
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,939
You care about quality, quantity,
efficiency, and economic effects.

426
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,540
That's your style of handling things.

427
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,699
Why have you become so indecisive now?

428
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,060
Something happened in Chenghuan's home,
and she's in a complete mess right now.

429
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm kindly reminding you.

430
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,912
You returned from abroad to catch fish.

431
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:09,260
Don't end up being the one
who is caught.

432
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,379
It will be a waste of bait.

433
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,860
What's wrong with you? Why didn't you
text me back or answer my calls?

434
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,379
How's your chat
with Mai Chenghuan going?

435
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,540
What do you think?

436
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,848
You've grown so tall,

437
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,659
but why are you of no use at all?

438
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,540
Don't you know what you have done?

439
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,179
If you fail, try it again.

440
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,780
If we can't fix this problem,
we'll lose our family.

441
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,139
Why does our dad love you, Xin Jialiang?

442
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:48,020
Is it because you're good at your job?

443
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,179
Is it because you're smart or obedient?

444
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,699
You can't even figure it out, can you?

445
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:55,820
Let me tell you. That's because you're
the only son in our family.

446
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,419
If our dad has another son,

447
00:32:58,419 --> 00:32:59,699
you will be not that important.

448
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,619
Dad won't give up on our family.

449
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,060
Forget it. Just hurry up
and contact Mai Chenghuan.

450
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,219
Come on. Here's my phone.

451
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,899
If you don't feel shame,
you contact her yourself.

452
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,260
Fine, I'll do it.

453
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,379
Yu, it's almost midnight.
Are you not sleeping?

454
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,979
You make the tea eggs tomorrow.

455
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:48,500
I can't sleep anyway.
I've been losing sleep.

456
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,592
What's wrong?

457
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,500
I've been thinking a lot lately.

458
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,580
Do you think it's just over
between Huan and Jialiang?

459
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,740
They haven't been
in contact for a long time.

460
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
It's quite a pity.

461
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:19,340
Since they've already broken up.
Let's not talk about it anymore.

462
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,860
Jialiang has his issues.

463
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,459
He doesn't show the slightest sense
of responsibility as a man.

464
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,019
I think he's not good enough for Huan.

465
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,379
I don't think so.

466
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,344
Jialiang is nice to Huan.

467
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,499
Besides, it's not easy
for Huan to find someone

468
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,899
like Jialiang who she knows so well.

469
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,740
Even though his family asked Huan
to sign a prenuptial agreement,

470
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,979
as long as Huan
doesn't divorce Jialiang,

471
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:58,899
Huan still can live a good life.

472
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,340
That's not right.

473
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,620
It's not a matter of divorce.

474
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,019
I can't explain it clearly to you.
I'm going to sleep.

475
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,579
You go to bed early.

476
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,979
(Xin Jialiang)
(Mrs. Mai, sorry for disturbing you so late.)

477
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:35,140
(My mom and sister were
out of line that day.)

478
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,616
(They know they were wrong
and asked me to apologize to you.)

479
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,220
(I've been in a lot of pain recently.)

480
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,140
(I love Chenghuan deeply
and can't be without her.)

481
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,860
(I hope you can give me another chance.)

482
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,340
(Mrs. Mai, I've discussed it
with my family.)

483
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,939
(The house is ready.)

484
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,979
(Tomorrow at 3 PM,
I'll take you to see it.)

485
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:02,780
(See the house? Should I go with Huan?)

486
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,459
Yeah, Room 1301.

487
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,220
Jialiang, where are you?

488
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,340
How come I don't see you? Jialiang.

489
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,579
Mrs. Mai, you're here.

490
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,700
Why is it you?
You're having Jialiang's phone?

491
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,780
Recently, Jialiang has been concerning
about Chenghuan.

492
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,300
He wanted to talk to you.

493
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,820
Unfortunately, he went out
and got a cold.

494
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,939
For fear of infecting you,

495
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:39,700
he had to ask me to see you.

496
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,140
I have nothing to talk to you.

497
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,459
Mrs. Mai, take a look at this house.

498
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,740
Look at the environment and the light.
Isn't it good?

499
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,459
It's suitable for a family to live in.

500
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,899
Whose family?

501
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,419
Of course, our family.

502
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:56,180
I was sorry about what happened
during our last meal.

503
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,300
Chenghuan is a good girl and
in a good relationship with Jialiang.

504
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
My family hopes they can be together.

505
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,740
Mrs. Mai, what do you think?

506
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,899
As far as I know, they have broken up.

507
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,140
Mrs. Mai, I'm sorry about what I did.

508
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,539
Could you please
give Jialiang one more chance?

509
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,059
I'm afraid my daughter is so assertive

510
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,780
that she won't listen to me.

511
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:28,120
I understand. Girls need
to feel secure, right?

512
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,899
How about this?

513
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,019
(Considering the years of relationship
between Jialiang and Huan,)

514
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:40,419
(I'll give it a try.)

515
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,112
Get up.

516
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,379
What are you doing?
Didn't you see I was sleeping?

517
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:06,180
Why are you sleeping in broad daylight?

518
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,740
Get up quickly. You're getting married.

519
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:09,700
With whom?

520
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,939
With your beloved Mai Chenghuan.

521
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:15,019
Okay, get out. Stop bothering me.

522
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,740
I've swallowed my pride

523
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,539
and tried so hard
to persuade her mom to help.

524
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,939
What have you done again?

525
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,099
Can you please stop making trouble?
I'm begging you.

526
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,939
Besides, I want to marry Huan,

527
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,780
not her mom.

528
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,379
Why do you keep bothering her mom?

529
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,660
Have you lost your mind?

530
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,340
If we win over Mai Chenghuan,
we will win over our dad.

531
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,260
And if we win over her mom,
we will win over Mai Chenghuan.

532
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,620
I'm telling you.
Her mom has promised me.

533
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,499
If Chenghuan has no problems,
you will be her groom-to-be.

534
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:50,899
I'm begging you. I mean it.

535
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:53,459
Can you please leave us alone?

536
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:54,860
You think I'm happy to step in?

537
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,300
I've lost face, said many sweet words,

538
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,700
and given away the house.

539
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,499
Finally, I've gained the favor
of Mai Chenghuan and her mom.

540
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:03,379
You decide whether
to get married or not.

541
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,288
I don't care.

542
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,700
Don't get too agitated.

543
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,220
I definitely want to get married.

544
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,300
But I just had a fight with Huan.

545
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:22,899
Isn't it awkward
to suddenly have an engagement?

546
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:26,740
Can you leave the matter to us, alright?

547
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,440
Please don't interfere anymore.

548
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,976
Give us more time

549
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:32,579
to get along well, okay?

550
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,899
Are you a fool? I'm so pissed off.

551
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,539
Calm down.

552
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,780
Let me explain why I'm in such a hurry.

553
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,939
I'm looking forward to seeing you
and Chenghuan have a child.

554
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:50,700
People say the eldest grandson
and the youngest son

555
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,539
are the apple of the Grandpa's eye.

556
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,459
If you had a son,
our dad could favor you

557
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,660
over an illegitimate child.

558
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,736
What does it have to do
with me getting married?

559
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,860
When will you get a bit smarter?

560
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,579
Let me tell you.
Opportunity knocks but once.

561
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,220
What are you talking about?

562
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,939
Mom, come out and eat.

563
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:29,880
Coming.

564
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,140
You should eat more. Eat this egg.

565
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,499
Eat up the egg.

566
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,539
You're dressed so formally.
Where are you going?

567
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,059
The dance team has arranged a new show.

568
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,660
Everyone has to wear a cheongsam
for today's performance.

569
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,379
I'll watch it later.

570
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,740
Okay.

571
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,539
I'm off to work, mom. You eat more.

572
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,260
- Are you full?
- Sure.

573
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,140
Be careful on the road.

574
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,620
Hello? Have you arrived?

575
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:11,579
Okay, I'll come to pick you up.
I gotta go.

576
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:16,860
I've finalized the time with Mr. Wang.

577
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,059
I'll notify her

578
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,632
to set time aside for you.

579
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:23,820
And one more thing.
Ms. Zhang has started to rush us again.

580
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,899
So, we have to hurry up
with the Xing'anli.

581
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:36,019
Careful. Don't hit your head.

582
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:38,180
Don't touch it, or it will stop.

583
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,300
Kids are careful.
Don't bump into things.

584
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,099
It's so grand.

585
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,979
This location is good. It is
by Suzhou River and next to the Bund.

586
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:51,019
I'll take you guys upstairs
to the main hall.

587
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:52,740
- It's very nice.
- It's great.

588
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,979
This hall is where wedding ceremonies
are held.

589
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,780
Look at that big screen up there,
like a movie screen.

590
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,860
- Yeah.
- Sir, hurry up.

591
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:03,832
You're off duty?

592
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:04,899
See you tomorrow, Chenghuan.

593
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:05,976
See you tomorrow.

594
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,820
Mom, what's up?

595
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:14,300
Huan, we'll eat together.

596
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,579
What? Why are we
suddenly eating together?

597
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:22,539
Your aunts and uncles have come
to Shanghai.

598
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,459
I want to do the honors.

599
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:29,180
They have come?
Okay, where are we eating?

600
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,340
Right at the B-Botticelli.

601
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,419
Botticelli? Why are we eating here?

602
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:38,979
They're from out of town
and haven't been to your workplace.

603
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,099
Let them enjoy a meal there.

604
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,620
Mom, you're just too concerned
about keeping up appearances.

605
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:48,979
They're our family.
We should treat them.

606
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:52,340
You come down.
We're waiting for you. Come on.

607
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,979
All right, I'll be there later.
