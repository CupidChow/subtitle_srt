3
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:02,667
Mai.

4
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,227
Mai.

5
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,348
Coming.

6
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,188
Glutinous rice balls.

7
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:12,148
So many? How can we finish them all?

8
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,428
Don't be silly. Take them to Huan.

9
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:16,827
Hurry up, or they'll get smushy.

10
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,227
Why don't you go?

11
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,267
I sent her so many videos

12
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,428
and messages,

13
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:26,148
but she only replied with a meme.

14
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,748
I won't disgrace myself
by approaching her.

15
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:29,707
Look at you.

16
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,947
You'd suffer just to save face.

17
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,227
You obviously care about her.

18
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,028
You keep checking her WeChat Moment

19
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,507
and send her short videos.

20
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:40,748
You think I don't know?

21
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,507
Hurry up and go.

22
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,667
Okay, is there any for me?

23
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,348
Eat when you come back.

24
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,428
Let me take a bite.

25
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:48,868
You...

26
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,468
Just a bite. It won't delay anything.

27
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,748
It's burning. Be careful.

28
00:02:54,987 --> 00:02:55,787
It's burning.

29
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:57,947
Tasty, huh?

30
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,068
Yeah, so chewy.

31
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:01,748
Hurry up.

32
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,908
I'm off now.

33
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:04,107
Keep them for me.

34
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:10,227
Have glutinous rice balls,
and we are all united.

35
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,868
Hello everyone, I'm Mai Chenghuan.

36
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:18,908
Based on

37
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,947
Ms. Chen Shuzhen's will,
I will take over Xing'anli

38
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,707
starting tomorrow.

39
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:26,348
I hope we can work together

40
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,028
to revitalize this time-honored brand.

41
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,348
I also hope

42
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,227
that you can support me
just as you supported my grandma.

43
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,468
I will do my best.

44
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:37,148
Welcome.

45
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,144
Someone really hit the jackpot.

46
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:43,947
If anyone has any questions,

47
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:45,507
please speak up.

48
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,547
Nobody wants to speak up. Then I will.

49
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,748
Madam, you just took over

50
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,348
and the hotel was tampered with.

51
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,507
I wonder if you have

52
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,107
offended someone.

53
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:57,148
We almost lost our jobs because of that.

54
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,748
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,547
Mr. Cui, it's alright.

56
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,348
You're Liao Gang, right?

57
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:04,827
You know me?

58
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,348
I reviewed all your profiles
before I got here.

59
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,628
So, I know every one of you.

60
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:12,107
Liao Gang.

61
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,827
You started as a doorman at Xing'anli,

62
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,868
and became the leading concierge
within three years.

63
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,147
You once saved a guest

64
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,748
who suddenly fell sick.

65
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:24,147
Madam, I know you've done your homework.

66
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,147
But that's all in the past.

67
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:28,027
There's no need to mention it.

68
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:29,507
To put it simply,

69
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,147
workers like us

70
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,827
want something tangible.

71
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:37,748
I understand.

72
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,347
You think I'm giving you false hopes.

73
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:41,548
To be honest,

74
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:44,308
Xing'anli is in a period
of tumultuous transformation.

75
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,147
My grandma has just passed away.

76
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,907
People are eyeing us intently.

77
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:51,068
I've read our business reports
in recent years.

78
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:52,947
Frankly speaking,

79
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,467
Grandma's management style

80
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,467
can no longer
keep up with market changes.

81
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,668
So, I've decided

82
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,467
to gradually adjust
the salary structure.

83
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,548
We will give you

84
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,308
reasonable salary.

85
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,068
I also hope

86
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,267
our management system can align with

87
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:10,228
that of a public company.

88
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,108
Regardless of your positions,

89
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,027
as long as you do well

90
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,748
and make certain contributions,

91
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:19,347
you will receive bonuses
and dividends accordingly.

92
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:21,147
- Dividends?
- Dividends?

93
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,960
Isn't that for the executives?

94
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,027
Everyone will have a share
once we go public.

95
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,308
That makes things easier.

96
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:32,108
This is the greatest sincerity
I'm offering.

97
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,347
I hope to continue Grandma's legacy

98
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,548
and become your family.

99
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,267
I also hope you can

100
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,548
think of your job here

101
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,267
as your life-long career.

102
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:42,788
So,

103
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,347
please work with me.

104
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,068
Well said.

105
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,707
Miss Mai, rest assured.

106
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,707
We promise we'll do our best.

107
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,308
Huan, is everything okay?

108
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,548
Do those department managers

109
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,147
comply with you?

110
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,668
Everything's fine, Dad.

111
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:17,548
I have to start somewhere, right?

112
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:19,587
Oh, right.

113
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,428
I saw on the internet the other day

114
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,947
that there was

115
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,947
food poisoning issue here.

116
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:28,428
Have you solved it?

117
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,827
Don't worry. We solved it.

118
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,827
Mr. Cui and the others

119
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,027
worked with me and resolved the matter.

120
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:36,868
Through this incident,

121
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:41,267
I experienced a sense of
achievement and belonging

122
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:42,748
I've never had before.

123
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,947
Dad, do you get it?

124
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,548
My whole life has been quite ordinary.

125
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,308
I haven't had any sense of achievement.

126
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,228
It's good that you had it.

127
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,628
Huan, I don't want you to be under

128
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:02,868
too much pressure.

129
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:05,707
I won't be.

130
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,428
But pressure is good.

131
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,907
It creates motivation.

132
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,548
Dad, you have to support me.

133
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,668
Of course, I do.

134
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,947
It's just that I've been driving
for Ms. Zhang for years.

135
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:19,548
I saw her

136
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:21,947
starting

137
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,428
from scratch.

138
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,548
It wasn't easy for her to achieve

139
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:28,707
such a huge success.

140
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,707
I'll take care of myself.

141
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:33,827
Dad.

142
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,068
Xing'anli and Yueda

143
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,147
have some

144
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:39,068
conflicts of interest.

145
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,947
If Ms. Zhang ever
asks you anything about Xing'anli,

146
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,748
just say you have no idea, okay?

147
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,907
Okay, I got it.

148
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,467
Of course, I'll side with you.

149
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:00,548
These are freshly cooked
glutinous rice balls

150
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,668
with sesame filling. Your favorite.

151
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,467
Remember, have meals on time.

152
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,027
I see.

153
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,827
Dad, how is Mom doing?

154
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,628
When you first took over Xing'anli,

155
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,308
she was absolutely thrilled.

156
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,508
We came

157
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,148
the other day

158
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,548
and caused you trouble.

159
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,467
After we returned,

160
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,148
she couldn't get over it.

161
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,068
It's fine. I'll talk to her.

162
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,467
Once I settle into

163
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:53,148
the job here,

164
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,747
I'll go back and talk with her.

165
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,747
Okay.

166
00:08:58,268 --> 00:08:59,747
You really need to talk.

167
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,308
It's tasty.

168
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,347
Take your time.

169
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,707
(Xing'anli, Mai Chenghuan, Pickup Code)
Lily, take this to the courier downstairs.

170
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:17,627
Alright, Mr. Yao.

171
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:27,867
Sir,

172
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,347
yesterday, I sent you
the operational plan

173
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:32,867
and the market layout

174
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:34,428
for the second half of the year.

175
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,707
Do you have any comments?

176
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,707
I'll revise my report

177
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,268
and submit it to the board.

178
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,148
Eric,

179
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,908
I trust your work capabilities.

180
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:46,028
But I also hope
that you hold nothing back from us.

181
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:47,508
Ms. Zhang said

182
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:52,068
you were planning to acquire Xing'anli.

183
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,428
I'm very interested.

184
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:54,548
Here's the thing.

185
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,747
Ms. Zhang has employed

186
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,308
some illegitimate tactics
against Xing'anli,

187
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:02,467
which made their current leader
strongly against the idea

188
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:03,908
of collaboration.

189
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,867
It takes time to persuade her.

190
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,908
Given your work capabilities,

191
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,308
one month should be enough.

192
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:11,908
Don't let me down.

193
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:21,028
Ms. Zhang really loves
playing dirty, doesn't she?

194
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,548
She instigated Amber
to give you the order.

195
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,308
It puts you in an awkward position.

196
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:26,308
Seriously.

197
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,908
Should we tell Mai Chenghuan

198
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,072
about it?

199
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,068
No need.

200
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:34,908
Tell me.

201
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,148

00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,627
Which one do you choose?

203
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:47,508
What would happen if I moved
into that western-style house?

204
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,947
What are you up to now?

205
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,548
May I ask how you manage to be...

206
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:58,227
so calm?

207
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,987
I brought your package in.

208
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:08,908
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

209
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,068

But if all of this comes
at the cost of your health,

218
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,028
I will give it up.

219
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,627
I seem to find something new from you,

220
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,788
which has never been found.

221
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:32,627
What is it?

222
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,788
Human touch.

(Xing'anli Garden Hotel Planning)

224
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,508
Come on in, Mrs. Wang.

225
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,827
Yu, your house is awe-inspiring.

226
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:13,947
I'm really impressed.

227
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:15,428
And this garden

228
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,347
could fit two dance troupes.

229
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,867
Such a garden and such a house

230
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,707
are rare even in Shanghai.

231
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:23,707
Yeah.

232
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:24,908
Look over there.

233
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,827
It's all connected.

234
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,947
That's enough with the garden.

235
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,947
Remember what I told you.

236
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,816
Find us some outstanding young men.

237
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:36,908
Those lads you introduced us
are not worthy of my daughter.

238
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,548
It's hard for outstanding young ladies
to find a match.

Think about it the other way around.

240
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,947
Huan doesn't have to
worry about money now.

241
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,428
But she is busy with work.

242
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:49,707
How about finding someone attentive
to take care of her?

243
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,107
He must be attentive.

244
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,028
But his career matters too.

245
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,107
Career matters.

00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,548
I get it.

247
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:57,668
- Mom.
- I won't forget.

No, thanks. I'm going home to cook.

Goodbye.

260

Visit us again.

261
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:21,508
See you.

262
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:22,508
You didn't even come in.

263
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:32,508
You didn't have to buy so much fruit.

264
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:33,707
And they're expensive.

265
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,308
Don't waste money on us.

266
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,068
These are not expensive.
I got them on sale.

271
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:53,707
Where is your luggage?

272
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:56,707
I didn't come

273
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,308
to stay here.

274
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:01,347
I want to talk to you
about renting a place.

275
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,508
Renting a place? You...

276
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:11,148
Y-You still

277
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,508
want us to move.

278
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:14,867
Yeah.

279
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,867
Didn't we talk about it?

280
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,548
This house belongs to Yao Zhiming.

281
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,747
We can't go on living here.

282
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,467
Buying a house
isn't an easy decision to make.

283
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:25,627
So

284
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,028
I've found a few short-term rentals

285
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,428
before buying a house.

286
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:30,908
Once you choose a place,

287
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:31,947
I'll buy it for you.

288
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,548
How much

289
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,508
does it cost to rent a house

290
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:38,467
with a garden in Shanghai?

291
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,987
- Why would you waste money like that?
- Huan, you're back.

292
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,512
Dad.

293
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,707
Why don't you go inside?

294
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,587
Don't get so excited.

295
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,227
She didn't come back to stay.

296
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:53,188
She came to make us move out.

297
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,028
Well...

298
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,107
We have to move out.

299
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:01,148
Right, Yu.

300
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,587
Mr. Yao is moving back in today.

301
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:05,908
Look.

302
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,428
Hello, there.

303
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,148
Mr. Yao is coming back to stay.

304
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:18,747
He likes to be alone.

305
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,788
Let's not bother him.

306
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:21,947
Take a look.

307
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:25,548
No, Huan, that's not what I meant.

308
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,028
I do want to move back in,

309
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,388
but I'm not asking
Mr. Mai and Mrs. Mai to move out.

310
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,148
We have plenty of rooms here.

311
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,867
You can stay as long as you like.

312
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,747
It's alright.

313
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,388
Really?

314
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,908
Listen, you heard what Mr. Yao said.

315
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,188
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

316
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,467
I can do some cleaning

317
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,867
since I'm around

318
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,347
to keep the place clean.

319
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:46,668
Yeah, Huan, I think Mrs. Mai is right.

320
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:48,227
Let them stay.

321
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:51,707
Well, Mr. Yao.

322
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:54,827
I'll take your luggage in.

323
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,028
Thank you.

324
00:16:58,296 --> 00:16:59,707
I'm going to wash some fruit.

325
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:00,908
Come in for some fruit.

326
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:01,867
- Come on.
- Okay.

327
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,468
Thanks.

328
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,468
Don't mention it.

329
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,147
Come on in.

330
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,548
- Come in.
- Yao, take a seat.

331
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:16,948
I'll wash the fruit.

332
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,468
Mai, make some tea.

333
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:19,468
Alright.

334
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,468
Mom, forget it.

335
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:23,448
Mr. Yao is moving in.

336
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:25,228
Tidy up the master bedroom

337
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:26,907
for Mr. Yao first.

338
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,147
Right.

339
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,548
But...

340
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,147
I kept the master bedroom for you.

341
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,708
It's full of your stuff.

342
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:35,788
How can you...

343
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,907
It's no problem, Mrs. Mai.

344
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,387
I can stay in any room.

345
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,827
Any room will do.

346
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,107
Any room? There is the attic.

347
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,308
That's inappropriate, right?

348
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,147
How about this?

349
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:49,748
Your dad and I will move out
of the second bedroom

350
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,308
and let Mr. Yao stay, okay?

351
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:52,387
We'll move to the attic.

352
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:53,228
No need.

353
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,468
I'll live in the attic.

354
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,907
It'd be too much trouble
for you to go up and down.

355
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:57,708
It's inconvenient.

356
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,468
That's inappropriate, Mr. Yao.

357
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:00,308
It's okay.

358
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,147
Okay, thank you.

359
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,187
Mom. It's Mr. Yao's house.

360
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:06,788
Now that he's moving in,

361
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,387
how can we let him live in the attic?

362
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,387
Sorry, Mr. Yao.

363
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,107
Anyway, I won't be living here.

364
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,748
I will pack up my things
and put them in the attic.

365
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,427
You can move in today.

366
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,587
But you'll have to move here.

367
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,468
It's not my decision to make.

368
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,788
He lent us his house for transition.

369
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:25,427
He's helping us.

370
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:28,028
Dad, here are the rental listings.

371
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,387
Pick one with my mom.

372
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:31,748
Hurry up and move out

373
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:32,748
to not trouble Mr. Yao.

374
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,028
Okay, I got it.

375
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,068
I see.

376
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,187
You just want me

377
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:37,988
to move out anyway.

378
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:41,548
Huan.

379
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,268
Mom.

380
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,988
I'm reasoning with you now.

381
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:44,907
Alright, Chenghuan.

382
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,667
Come out for a second.

383
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:49,347
Say no more. Stop arguing.

384
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,028
Come on.

385
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,548
Sorry, we troubled you again.

386
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:59,627
I'll persuade my mom
to move out as soon as possible.

387
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:01,427
It's okay.

388
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,667
Moving out is such a hassle.

389
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:05,387
Why don't you move in too?

390
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:06,427
Wouldn't that be better?

391
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:09,468
You know my mom.

392
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:10,827
She's always making a fuss.

393
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:12,587
And you are used to living alone.

394
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,508
You won't get along with her.

395
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,468
You won't enjoy living like that.

396
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:21,107
Stray cats aren't born
wanting to be strays.

397
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:25,508
How do you know I won't like it?

398
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:33,187
Alright, hurry home, stray cat.

399
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:34,748
I'm off.

400
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,028
Even though Mr. Yao moved back,

401
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,387
he didn't fight us for rooms.

402
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,268
He let us stay.

403
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,508
So stop being mad.

404
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,228
Right?

405
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:00,708
Here is the rental listing
Huan brought back.

406
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,427
This one looks fine. Take a look.

407
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,308
No.

408
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:04,147
Take a look.

409
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:04,907
No.

410
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:06,788
Dad.

411
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:08,827
What's wrong with Mom?

412
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,387
Who's made her angry again?

413
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,268
Mr. Yao moved back.

414
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,387
Your sister said

415
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,827
that since he moved back,

416
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,667
we should move out soon.

417
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:20,468
So she got upset.

418
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:22,988
Mom.

419
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,268
This house belongs to Zhiming.

420
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,068
If he wants to move back,

421
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:29,427
then it's quite reasonable

422
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,107
that my sister asks us to leave.

423
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,107
Exactly.

424
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,308
Exactly what?

425
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:37,147
Mr. Yao let us stay

426
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,788
because he was polite.

427
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:41,587
We shouldn't overstay our welcome

428
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,587
just because he is nice.

429
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,147
It'd be taking advantage of him.

430
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,387
How am I taking advantage of him?

431
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,907
I'm taking advantage of him?

432
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,228
Let's talk facts and reason, okay?

433
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:53,827
We've paid the rent for this house.

434
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:54,587
Right?

435
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:55,788
Say yes.

436
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:57,228
Yes.

437
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:59,347
Yao Zhiming agreed

438
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:01,468
for us to live here.

439
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,187
Right?

440
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,187
Yes.

441
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:04,187
Alright then.

442
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,228
What else do we need?

443
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,748
I don't know what got into...

444
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:07,988
Sorry.

445
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,748
I don't know what got into your sister.

446
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:11,948
Mom.

447
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,068
Stop it there.

448
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,988
Be the judge. Who's wrong here?

449
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,788
We are all family.

450
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,468
Why must we distinguish that?

451
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,988
My sister has some issues to deal with.

452
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,268
You can't tell, right? You decide.

453
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,308
Be the judge. Who's wrong here?

454
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,508
Hasn't Zao answered you?

455
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:34,627
Why should a family
talk about right and wrong?

456
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:37,708
Well, Huan

457
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,867
has her issues to deal with.

458
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:44,024
Whose side are you two on after all?

459
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,028
Whose side?

460
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:47,468
Come on, Mom.

461
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,308
I-I have an idea.

462
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:51,268
How about I move out

463
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:52,788
to accompany my sister?

464
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:56,068
Zao.

465
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,268
You don't want to live here, either?

466
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,788
No, Mom, that's not what I mean.

467
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,827
We can change our approach.

468
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,028
What approach?

469
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:08,268
I can stay with my sister
for a couple of days

470
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,667
and mediate the whole thing,

471
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:13,147
so that our family can reunite sooner.

472
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:13,867
Right?

473
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:15,768
Good idea.

474
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,508
It sounds

475
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,187
like a plan.

476
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:26,907
Listen, Zao.

477
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,788
Keep an eye

478
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:31,308
on your sister.

479
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:32,627
No, wait.

480
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,308
Scrutinize her words and actions.

481
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:36,268
Report to me if anything comes up.

482
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:38,627
I can tell you what to do next

483
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:39,907
at the first opportunity.

484
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:42,468
You can count on me.

485
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,308
Okay.

486
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,468
Huan.

487
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:54,187
Zao.

488
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:55,667
Wait a minute.

489
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,867
Why are you carrying luggage?

490
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:03,667
I'm moving here.

491
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,187
Don't talk nonsense. Hurry back.

492
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:07,587
I'm not talking nonsense.

493
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,788
I've heard about what happened.

494
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:13,427
I was planning to rent a place

495
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:15,708
for us all

496
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,268
and move over there.

497
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,587
I'll also live there

498
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:20,228
and have a good talk with Mom.

499
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:21,587
Look what happened.

500
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:24,387
I'll have to make the hotel
my home from now on.

501
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:29,187
Huan, I know you want to
stick to principles,

502
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:31,387
but you're caught in a dilemma.

503
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,268
Although I can't be of much help,

504
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:35,468
I can't stand by and watch you

505
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:36,387
suffer all alone.

506
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:37,827
It's okay. I'm fine.

507
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:40,468
After all, this is between Mom and me.

508
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,308
I don't want to drag you into this.

509
00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:44,667
Rest assured.
I haven't been fanning the flames.

510
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,827
I told Mom I'd try to persuade you.

511
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,268
That's what you told her?

512
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,708
With so much luggage?
Do you think she is foolish?

513
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:54,308
Mom allowed me to stay with you
for a couple of days.

514
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,627
Really?

515
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:58,068
Of course. Otherwise,
how could I have come out?

516
00:23:58,748 --> 00:23:59,667
Besides,

517
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:02,584
I've had enough of being like
an only child.

518
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,720
I'd like to be free for a while.

519
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,587
Alright, I'm hungry.

520
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:08,468
Treat me to dinner.

521
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:09,508
Why are you so stubborn?

522
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:10,667
Get me something tasty.

523
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,387
Zao.

524
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,667
You didn't need to move out.

525
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,068
Huan.

526
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:19,627
Mom doesn't want to move,

527
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,068
and Dad has to take care of her.

528
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,268
As your brother, I have to make a stand.

529
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,308
Besides,

530
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:26,627
we can't depend on Zhiming like that.

531
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:28,988
Zao.

532
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,667
You're suffering because of me.

533
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:32,827
Why don't I

534
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,508
get a guest room for you?

535
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:35,867
No need.

536
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,827
The guest rooms are for business.

537
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,147
If you can live in a dorm, why can't I?

538
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:40,867
Let's go.

539
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:44,667
Hello, Miss Mai.

540
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:45,867
This is Mai Chengzao,

541
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,468
my younger brother.

542
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,667
He will be staying
in the staff dorm for a few days.

543
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,867
This is the head
of our concierge department,

544
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,788
Liao Gang.

545
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:54,667
Hello, sorry for the inconvenience.

546
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,788
Hello.

547
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:59,228
Miss Mai, we welcome your family
to supervise our work.

548
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:01,308
I must hurry to tell the others.

549
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:02,308
We won't dare

550
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:04,268
to be late for work from now on.

551
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:05,508
I'm heading up.

552
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,508
Huan, he...

553
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,827
It's okay. That's how he talks.
Just ignore him.

554
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:12,988
Zao, I've been thinking.

555
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:14,347
Mom refuses to move out.

556
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,748
Our apartment isn't relocated.

557
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,228
We might as well

558
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,867
just buy a new house.

559
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:19,827
Take them

560
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,508
to see apartments when you're free.

561
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,788
Rest assured. Leave it to me.

562
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,468
Let me show you the dorm.

563
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:26,187
This way.

564
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,788
Hello, sir, good evening.

565
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:44,867
How's life in that house?

566
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,028
What's going on?
Why are you in the attic?

567
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:50,867
Are you trying to be Cinderella?

568
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:52,667
Where's the pumpkin carriage?

569
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:55,387
It's quiet up here in the attic.

570
00:25:56,468 --> 00:26:00,028
You went to join the bustle.
And you care to be left alone?

571
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,508
Is the mother-in-law hard to please?

572
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,468
I'm seeking tranquility
amid the chaos, okay?

573
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,187
Mai.

574
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:41,988
Listen.

575
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:44,587
I think there is noise downstairs.

576
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:50,907
Is it a rat?

577
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:57,748
Could it be a thief?

578
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,268
He came last night.

579
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,468
Now he wants to slip away.

580
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:29,107
Good morning, Mr. Yao.

581
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:31,228
Morning, Mr. Mai and Mrs. Mai.

582
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:32,748
Morning.

583
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,708
So it was you who were making
all those rustling noises.

584
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:40,948
I asked He Dong
to prepare you breakfast.

585
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:41,827
Have a taste.

586
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:44,187
These are

587
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,627
for us?

588
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,187
I'll be living with you.

589
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:49,308
It's my gesture.

590
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:51,627
This is too extravagant.

591
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,988
You don't have to do that.

592
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:55,788
We're taking advantage of you

593
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,708
by staying in your house.

594
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,268
And you... We...

595
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,867
Huan will scold us.

596
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,107
No way, Mrs. Mai.

597
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,587
It's just a breakfast.

598
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,708
Help yourselves.

599
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:12,748
Don't eat.

600
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:16,387
Why is he so nice to us?

601
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,867
He's letting us stay

602
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,468
and offering a luxurious breakfast.

603
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:22,347
Do you know what he's thinking?

604
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:23,387
It's okay.

605
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,468
Mr. Yao has always been nice to me.

606
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:26,028
No.

607
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,347
One should not harbor ill intentions,

608
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,468
but should guard against others.

609
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,268
Right?

610
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:36,907
So we're not eating? What a waste.

611
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,984
The daily turnover of the restaurant

612
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:43,268
has decreased by 40 percent
within a month.

613
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:45,548
The guest rooms
are half occupied as usual.

614
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:46,788
During the off-season,

615
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,788
it's tough

616
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:50,068
to increase the turnover

617
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,268
through walk-in customers.

618
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:57,308
We can't rely solely
on walk-in customers.

619
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,268
We need to aim

620
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:00,667
at large-scale business events.

621
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:03,788
This is the fastest and most direct way.

622
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:07,347
Mr. Cui, I was

623
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:08,948
in charge of the client sources
back in Yueda.

624
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:10,667
I'll figure something out

625
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,667
and take care of that.

626
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:12,788
But,

627
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,788
we've never held
large-scale business events.

628
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:17,268
I know your concerns.

629
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:19,748
But Xing'anli can't play it safe now.

630
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:21,268
We must expand.

631
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,748
So we must make an extra effort.

632
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,028
Mr. Cui.

633
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:27,627
I'll send you
the training plan once it's drafted.

634
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:28,427
Please train

635
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,468
all the employees.

636
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:31,548
Okay.

637
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,187
Sherry, it's me.

638
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,867
I need a favor.

639
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:43,867
I know you have many clients.

640
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:45,827
Is there any business event

641
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,867
Botticelli wouldn't take on?

642
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,548
Can you pull some strings?

643
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:01,268
My sister says we don't need to live

644
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:02,907
under others' charity
because we have money.

645
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:05,147
I've sent you some property information.

646
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:06,587
See if you like some places.

647
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,387
My sister said she'd pay for it.

648
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,864
(From Zao)

649
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,107
This is not bad.

650
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,867
I have a good daughter.

651
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:33,827
Look at this.

652
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,468
This child...

653
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,788
This child is quite fine.

654
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:42,988
So silly.

655
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,387
Why did he get so much carbohydrate?

656
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,427
How can we finish them?

657
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,548
It's quite tasty.

658
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,187
It's just too sweet.

659
00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:00,107
He doesn't get it.
I'll teach him properly.

660
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,308
Sweet things
are not good for the elderly.

661
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:05,068
A liquor company wants

662
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,427
to collaborate with us.

663
00:31:06,627 --> 00:31:08,308
When do you have time?

664
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,867
Let's schedule a meeting.

665
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:11,468
Okay, next week.

666
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,228
I'll make an appointment.

667
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:18,867
Where are you going?
Are you getting off work?

668
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,107
Do you enjoy working overtime?

669
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:22,268
No, I don't.

670
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,907
I just don't know what to do
if I get off work so early.

671
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,347
Remember that yoga instructor
the last time

672
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,468
we video-chatted?

673
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,028
Let's go get stretched.

674
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:31,907
No, thanks.

675
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:33,147
Where are you going?

676
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:34,107
Go home for dinner.

677
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,667
Go home for dinner?

678
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,667
Hello, Mr. Zhang, is the salmon
I ordered ready?

679
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:42,147
Okay, I'm getting it now.

680
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:55,387
I'm quite embarrassed.

681
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,867
We live in your house

682
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,988
and make you pay for food.

683
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:01,228
I made

684
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,788
all these special dishes.

685
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:05,387
Try them.

686
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:06,667
Yu.

687
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:11,468
Mr. Yao bought the salmon for us.

688
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,068
You bought salmon?

689
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:15,512
Do you prefer the steamed
or braised one?

690
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,867
Mr. Mai, this fish is best eaten raw.

691
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:21,308
I've heard of it. Eaten raw.

692
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:24,107
For sure I've heard of it.

693
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:28,028
But I don't eat raw things.

694
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,308
I-I'm scared of bacteria.

695
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:32,228
Mrs. Mai, rest assured.

696
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:35,068
This is air-freighted
New Zealand king salmon

697
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:37,228
from the purest waters.

698
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:38,667
It's very safe.

699
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,667
Rest assured.

700
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:43,347
It may have bacteria even if it's clean.

701
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:44,867
After all, it's raw.

702
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:47,028
It's not as good as our dish.

703
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:49,147
You see, it's braised.

704
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,548
And it's a bit spicy
with all these ingredients.

705
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:52,268
Stinky mandarin fish.

706
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:53,867
Stinky mandarin fish.

707
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,187
Traditional cuisine.

708
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:57,592
This is traditional Chinese cuisine.

709
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,028
This is...

710
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:01,028
Yeah, I've heard of that.

711
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,708
But Mrs. Mai,
you shouldn't have too much food

712
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,708
that has been pickled or fermented

713
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:08,667
for a long time.

714
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,347
It's bad for your health
and can cause cancer.

715
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:19,788
Oh, come on. It may cause cancer?

716
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,427
I've been having it for decades.

717
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:22,548
And I'm fine, look.

718
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,548
Mai has been having it for decades too.

719
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:26,228
Tasty, huh?

720
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:28,548
- Alright. I am fine.
- See? Alright. He's fine.

721
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:30,827
Yao, I bet you haven't tried it before.

722
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:34,147
It smells good. Let me get you a piece.

723
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:35,228
Give it a try.

724
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:38,827
It may be stinky but it tastes good.

725
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:39,827
Come on, try it.

726
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:42,308
Mrs. Mai, just leave it there.

727
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:43,308
You must try it.

728
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:43,627
Okay.

729
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:45,387
It's good. Traditional cuisine.

730
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:49,268
Mrs. Mai, try the sashimi.

731
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:50,228
I...

732
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,587
Here.

733
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:53,187
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

734
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:54,867
Well...

735
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,667
Let me try it.

736
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,948
What are you doing?

737
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:02,667
Have a taste.

738
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,748
- Dig in.
- Try it.

739
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:04,667
Give it a try.

740
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:07,187
Well...

741
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,028
This is surprising.

742
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,707
A company leader like him

743
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,468
works quite efficiently.

744
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,508
Look how he's doing the dishes.

745
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:26,747
He came back from abroad.

746
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:29,187
Youngsters who have studied abroad

747
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:31,428
have great living skills.

748
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:36,587
I find it quite suspicious.

749
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:40,147
Was the salmon good?

750
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,388
Yeah, I had six pieces.

751
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:44,747
I'll buy it for you more.

752
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,587
It's expensive. No big deal.

753
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,187
He's washing dishes there.

754
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:53,227
Is it inappropriate for us to sit here?

755
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:53,908
It's fine.

756
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:56,267
Let's go for a walk.

757
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:58,587
Yao, we're going for a walk.

758
00:34:58,707 --> 00:34:59,388
Okay.

759
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,508
Thank you.

760
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:01,307
No problem.

761
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:03,868
Rest early once you're done.

762
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,468
Okay.

763
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:13,267
Have some tea.
Ms. Zheng will be here shortly.

764
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,147
Thank you.

765
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,187
I know time is tight
and it's hard to book a hotel.

766
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:26,787
But it is

767
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:29,147
a special day for me and my husband.

768
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:32,828
Yeah, the wedding date can't be changed.

769
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:34,267
Try a bit harder.

770
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,468
Sorry, Miss Mai.

771
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:38,028
Some personal matters got me delayed.

772
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:38,828
It's okay.

773
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,227
I just heard you're getting married.

774
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,307
Congratulations.

775
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,227
Thank you.

776
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,828
Ms. Zheng. I'll be outside.

777
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:45,348
Okay.

778
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,548
I have read the proposal

779
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:49,707
you sent over.

780
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:51,267
I can see your sincerity.

781
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:52,747
So let me cut to the chase.

782
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:53,988
I prefer a bigger brand

783
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,548
that is more experienced

784
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:56,787
in holding business events.

785
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:00,348
I get it, Ms. Zheng.

786
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,908
For this business event,

787
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:04,548
we have conducted

788
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:07,227
comprehensive training
for all the staff members.

789
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,068
You don't need to worry
about the quality of service.

790
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:11,428
I know.

791
00:36:11,428 --> 00:36:14,348
Mingwei Daily Chemicals
is an established company in Shanghai,

792
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:17,227
with a profound corporate culture.

793
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:19,227
Taking that into account,

794
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,667
we complemented the plan.

795
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,948
Please take a look.

796
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,107
Meanwhile, we've reduced

797
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,187
the price

798
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:28,667
by another 10 percent.

799
00:36:28,908 --> 00:36:30,068
But rest assured.

800
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:31,508
We'll still offer

801
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:32,948
the best service at that price.

802
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,227
If there is anything...

803
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,388
Ms. Zheng,
Mr. Yao from Botticelli is here.

804
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:41,028
Mr. Yao, what brings you here?

805
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:41,707
Welcome.

806
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:42,548
Long time no see.

807
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:43,428
Indeed.

808
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,747
Ms. Zheng, go ahead and talk.

809
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,028
I'll wait for your update.

810
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,548
Okay. Thank you for making the trip.

811
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:55,227
No problem.

812
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,548
Go ahead.

813
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,187
Come on, Mr. Yao, take a seat.

814
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:02,428
Let's have tea

815
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,747
and discuss our collaboration.

816
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:04,428
Alright.

817
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:09,752
Chenghuan.

818
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:12,227
Headquarters assigned Mr. Yao
an important task.

819
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:14,948
We must secure
all the deals in the market.

820
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:18,348
It's okay, Sherry, thank you.

821
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:20,548
So what's your plan?

822
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:23,908
Move on to the next client.

823
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,548
We may have lost Ms. Zheng,

824
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,787
but we still have Ms. Zhang or Ms. Li.

825
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:30,028
Okay, that's it.

826
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:34,988
You are both related to Ms. Chen.

827
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:37,587
How can Mr. Yao
not show any consideration?

828
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:39,548
It's understandable.

829
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,828
He's also under pressure.

830
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:44,908
Chenghuan,
Botticelli is a foreign-funded

831
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:46,707
five-star hotel.

832
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:49,227
We can't compete with them

833
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,227
in holding business events.

834
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:55,548
Mr. Cui.

835
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:58,468
We have no advantage
in regular business events.

836
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,307
Could there be hope

837
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,627
if we offer something unique?

838
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,868
Unique?

839
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:06,787
What do you mean?

840
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:08,828
I'll think it over.

841
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,908
Go ahead with what you're doing.

842
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:10,707
Okay.

843
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,068
Miss Mai.

844
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:28,828
Mr. Yao, you ordered so much

845
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:30,747
to contribute
to the revenue of Xing'anli?

846
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,147
Yeah.

847
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,348
Give me a chance to apologize.

848
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:36,747
It's no big deal.

849
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:39,028
It's a fair competition. I'm not petty.

850
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:41,627
But since it's your treat,

851
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,948
I won't pass up a free meal.

852
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:48,028
I suddenly remembered

853
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,747
what my grandma once told me.

854
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:52,787
Don't eat alone.

855
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:54,868
I didn't get it.

856
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,348
But I think I began to get it

857
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,747
after my grandma passed away.

858
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:04,028
What did you get?

859
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:09,028
Eating alone is surviving.

860
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:12,068
Eating with someone is living.

861
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:17,147
I didn't expect

862
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:19,227
that you'd have
such an understanding of life.

863
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:25,828
So?

864
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,388
Do you have any plans

865
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:29,068
for Xing'anli?

866
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,187
Actually, I've been thinking.

867
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,388
Xing'anli is disadvantaged

868
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:35,787
in holding

869
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:37,548
business events.

870
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,227
But our strong point

871
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:41,828
is our local characteristics.

872
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,948
I've considered hosting weddings,

873
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,028
but the competition is too fierce.

874
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,667
We might not outperform others.

875
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:52,747
How do you know if you don't try?

876
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:54,828
Who knows?

877
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,747
Xing'anli has a unique style.

878
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:07,627
Shanghai-style weddings?

879
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:10,227
That may work.

880
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:12,747
It is an option.

881
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:38,468
Mr. Yao, it's you.

882
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,828
I thought it was my wife.

883
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,107
Mr. Mai.

884
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,828
Are you secretly drinking again?

885
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,468
She's gone dancing.

886
00:40:48,627 --> 00:40:50,147
I'm alone here.

887
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,147
Actually, I think she only

888
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,868
verbally forbids you from drinking.

889
00:40:57,028 --> 00:40:59,388
You don't need to hide it.

890
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:02,227
This is

891
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:07,587
a subtle matter about marital relations.

892
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:11,267
Would you like to hear about it?

893
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:13,068
I'm all ears.

894
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,267
Drinking is unhealthy.

895
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:22,348
So, your auntie doesn't let me drink.

896
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:28,028
But then, she turns a blind eye to it

897
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:30,028
and lets me drink a little.

898
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:31,428
Why is that?

899
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:33,707
Why?

900
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:36,028
Because of love.

901
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:40,068
You see, drinking is unhealthy.

902
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,587
Drinking too much is bad for health.

903
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:45,428
But she knows I like to drink.

904
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:47,267
Drinking makes me happy.

905
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:51,028
So, she turns a blind eye to it

906
00:41:51,627 --> 00:41:53,147
and lets me drink a little.

907
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,627
Isn't this love?

908
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:00,667
So, you have to drink behind her back.

909
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,988
Drinking openly right in front of her

910
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,227
would be taking advantage of her love

911
00:42:06,428 --> 00:42:08,147
and hurting her feelings, right?

912
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,627
Impressive, Mr. Yao.

913
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:14,068
You're really clever.

914
00:42:14,627 --> 00:42:15,828
Let me tell you.

915
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:20,587
No matter whether

916
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:23,787
she allows me to drink or forbids it,

917
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,227
she means well.

918
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:27,227
Right?

919
00:42:27,508 --> 00:42:28,307
So,

920
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:31,828
I listen to her in everything.

921
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:33,707
It seems

922
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,988
that Mrs. Mai has completed

923
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,828
a thorough brainwashing on you,

924
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:42,988
so that you convince yourself
before doing anything.

925
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:48,227
Mr. Yao, you're making fun of me.

926
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:49,348
No.

927
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:50,948
Mr. Mai, I think

928
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:53,147
you are truly wise.

929
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:55,388
I should learn more from you.

930
00:42:55,787 --> 00:42:57,068
You flatter me.
