=Episode 27=

3
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:31,229
Zao,

4
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,748
you are his uncle.

5
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,509
You should know better.

6
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:37,029
Apologize.

7
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,069
No need. We are all family.

8
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,149
It's not that serious.

9
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:44,069
Zao, just apologize.

10
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,149
Yu.

11
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,429
Let's go.

12
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:53,748
Zhiming,

13
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:55,509
I have thought about it.

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,108
Things are complicated at my home

15
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,628
and I don't want to get you involved.

16
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,988
Wait for me outside.

17
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:03,949
Okay.

18
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,589
Call me if you need anything.

19
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,548
Don't worry.

20
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:11,228
I told you.

21
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,068
Your aunt and uncle raised you up.

22
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,829
They are almost like your parents.

23
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,348
We must be grateful.

24
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,788
You've grown up now.

25
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,748
It's time for you to repay the kindness.

26
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,908
Apologize.

27
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,508
Zao, what's wrong with apologizing?

28
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,869
Will you not listen?

29
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,948
Is it so difficult to apologize?

30
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,429
What's wrong now?

31
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,549
You want my brother to apologize again?

32
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:39,709
My friend has already told me.

33
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,309
Just two little kids

34
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,869
had a fight.

35
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:43,948
It is normal.

36
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,589
But indulging him too much isn't right.

37
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,748
If parents don't discipline their kids,

38
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,228
once they graduate,

39
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,748
others will do it for them.

40
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:54,589
Liu Wanyu,

41
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,468
now your son and daughter

42
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:59,429
are bullying us together, right?

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,309
Fang, don't add fuel to the fire.

44
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,348
Zao,

45
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,029
if you don't apologize today,

46
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,188
it would show
I haven't taught my children properly.

47
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:12,109
Alright, let me apologize for you, okay?

48
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:14,748
Sorry, everyone.

49
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:15,788
I am really sorry.

50
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,869
Mom, what are you doing?

51
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:18,668
You...

52
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,989
Don't act like we're obligated to them!

53
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:22,788
I remember the years

54
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,468
after Grandma passed away.

55
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,109
Is that what you call taking care of me?

56
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,668
Mom.

57
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:36,228
Why do you always subconsciously
think I am the one at fault?

58
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:39,269
You never gave me a chance to explain.

59
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,829
Do you know how much
I have suffered over these years?

60
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,149
In this family,

61
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,188
I'm just not important, right?

62
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:55,709
When I was young,

63
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,788
you sent me back to our hometown.

64
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,468
It was you who didn't want me!

65
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:03,668
Now,

66
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,829
I have no reason to stay
at this home any longer.

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,228
Zao.

68
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:12,029
Huan,

69
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:14,468
sorry.

70
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:15,788
Zao.

71
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,029
Dad, have you realized it yet?

72
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,668
Their family
has been putting on an act for us.

73
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,228
One a big boss, the other a top lawyer.

74
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,589
It's obvious that they look down on us.

75
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,189
If you look down on us, just say it.

76
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,228
Why make all those good speeches?

77
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,029
Fang Jie.

78
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,908
Fang Jie, could you please stop talking?

79
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,228
As an adult, can you behave like one?

80
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,228
You're so happy to see us fight?

81
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,348
You stole money when we were little,

82
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,988
and you made Zao take the blame.

83
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,228
Do you dare to tell everyone?

84
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:43,988
Do you admit you led everyone

85
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,509
to bully Zao when we were little?

86
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,189
Huan,

87
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,189
is all this true?

88
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,308
Mom,

89
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,668
Zao didn't tell you
because he is sensible

90
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,308
and considerate.

91
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,468
But that doesn't mean
he should always be bullied like that.

92
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,269
Zao, are you okay?

93
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,228
Zhiming, I'm fine.

94
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,988
Could you please tell my sister later

95
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:14,668
to not worry about me?

96
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,269
I want to be alone for a while.

97
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,269
You took care of Zao when we were young.

98
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,269
I'm very grateful to you.

99
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:32,509
So this time,

100
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,308
we're glad you came here.

101
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,949
And we've gone all out
to make you feel at home.

102
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,428
But don't go too far.

103
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,389
Although we are relatives,

104
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:42,908
you should respect us

105
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,269
and have a sense of propriety.

106
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:45,749
If you really feel

107
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,908
uncomfortable here and want to go home,

108
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:48,908
do as you please.

109
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,908
Mai Chenghuan!

110
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,949
How dare you talk to me like that?

111
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:54,548
Can you please calm down?

112
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:57,629
Liu Wanrong, be clear
about which family you belong to.

113
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,988
You have no say here!

114
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,988
Uncle,

115
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,069
can you please not talk
to my aunt like this?

116
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:04,829
Mai Chenghuan,

117
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:06,829
almost 30, right?

118
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,348
You're not married
and don't want children

119
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,069
but try to be a "strong woman"?

120
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,348
I think you're just mentally disturbed!

121
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:17,269
And you say you won't associate with us?

122
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,668
Let me be honest with you,

123
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,069
I'm concerned
that you'd be a bad influence

124
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,749
on our grandson!

125
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,749
You!

126
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,589
What's the matter with you today?

127
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,908
You can take your anger out on me.

128
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,629
Don't make it difficult
for my son and daughter.

129
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,868
I was just about to scold you.

130
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,589
Back in the day,
you came to Shanghai alone.

131
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,788
You had a child
and left him with us to raise.

132
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,428
Little did you know back then

133
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,228
that it was your sister and I
who took care of the old and the young.

134
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,749
How much money did we spend on him?

135
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:41,589
Do you know that?

136
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,228
Yu kept sending money to us.

137
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,949
You can't just deny it.

138
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,389
That's just a small amount of money.

139
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,949
Now they're wealthy,

140
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,348
and they turn their backs, disown us

141
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,509
and want us to leave.

142
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,589
Ready to abandon all family ties, right?

143
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,228
Fine.

144
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,988
The money, the time and the effort spent

145
00:06:57,988 --> 00:07:00,868
all these years
on the old and the young.

146
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,868
You must reimburse me in full.

147
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,509
If you don't compensate,

148
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,149
I won't leave this place

149
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,108
and you'll have to support me
for the rest of my life!

150
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:09,589
What are you doing?

151
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,389
It is illegal to intrude
into a private home.

152
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,788
You want to be put into jail?

153
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:15,988
Wait, who are you?

154
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:17,908
None of us know you.

155
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,868
You're the one trespassing
into a residence.

156
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,908
Who am I? I'm the owner of this house.

157
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,468
What owner?

158
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,069
Isn't this house owned by Liu Wanyu?

159
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:28,108
You're fooling us?

160
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:30,949
Mai Chenghuan, whose house is this?

161
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,348
He is the landlord of this house.

162
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,788
We're just staying temporarily.

163
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,589
I'll give you three minutes
and call the police if you don't leave.

164
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,908
Fine, we'll leave. It's no big deal.

165
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:43,108
Let's go.

166
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,149
Liu Wanrong, go.

167
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:57,668
Yu,

168
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,428
I'm really sorry this time.

169
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,868
No, my bad.

170
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,589
Auntie.

171
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:25,668
Didn't I tell you to wait outside?

172
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:26,829
Why did you come in?

173
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,629
I just saw Zao a bit unhappy.

174
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,149
I was worried something was wrong.

175
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:32,349
So I came in to check.

176
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,749
Yes, Zao had a fight
with my mom and ran away.

177
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,948
Did he tell you where he was going?

178
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:40,828
He said he wanted some peace

179
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:42,469
and that you need not worry about him.

180
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,269
It's good that you came in today.

181
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,869
Who knows what might have happened
if you hadn't come?

182
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,149
But my uncle finally left.

183
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,548
Now he's gone,

184
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,269
and our home is finally peaceful.

185
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,349
But I think your aunt

186
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:06,109
might end up caught
in the middle and have a hard time.

187
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,509
My aunt

188
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,229
is a good person.

189
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,548
For decades, day in and day out,

190
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:18,349
she's sacrificed herself
to take care of her family.

191
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:19,989
But in the end,

192
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,948
the beneficiaries don't even say
a word of thanks,

193
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,629
and they even yell at her.

194
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,788
As well as my mom, which is the thing.

195
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,149
To tell you the truth,

196
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,548
I'm very angry. How can they?

197
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,308
It's the same with the older generation.

198
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,548
Most people

199
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,548
sacrifice everything for their families.

200
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,428
My mom is like this too.

201
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,749
Used to self-sacrifice

202
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:44,188
and giving out unconditionally.

203
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,788
But the key is,
she would turn this resentment

204
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:49,469
onto her family members.

205
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,828
Take Zao for example.

206
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:55,668
She's used to forgiving others
and blaming her family.

207
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,629
Actually, when I walked in the door

208
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,668
and heard her saying
those things to Zao,

209
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,948
I was pretty angry.

210
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,588
But later, when I saw her
being scolded by my uncle,

211
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,229
I felt sorry for her.

212
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:08,828
I wanted to speak up
for her and protect her.

213
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:10,668
But I just felt

214
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,869
that she somehow created this situation

215
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,509
by herself.

216
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,188
It's just a feeling
of helplessness, you know?

217
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,349
And I think, for 29 years,

218
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,588
I have been guilt-tripping,

219
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:27,269
which makes me quite uncomfortable.

220
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,629
I understand it all.

221
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,389
It's like parents

222
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:38,109
waiting for their children
to be grateful,

223
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,908
while the children are waiting
for them to apologize.

224
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:44,989
To tell you the truth,

225
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,948
I just hope my mom
can live her own life.

226
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:52,469
I don't want her to get trapped
in the unnecessary mess anymore.

227
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:58,788
Why don't we go back
and have a chat with your mom?

228
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,389
No.

229
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:11,788
I just don't know how to face her later.

230
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,389
My mom values relationships and family

231
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:17,389
and cares about her pride.

232
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:18,669
Because of this matter,

233
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,668
her relationship
with my aunt will become worse.

234
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:23,389
I don't know how to talk
to her when I go back.

235
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,948
Because I'm afraid

236
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,869
that we'll start arguing about values

237
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,349
and get into an endless loop.

238
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,109
Honestly, I'm quite scared.

239
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:40,428
Besides, my uncle

240
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:42,308
must have left a mess in Xing'anli.

241
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,269
I want to go back and check.

242
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:47,349
Okay.

243
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:50,188
I'll go back and soothe her.

244
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:51,389
Leave it to me.

245
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,149
You're quite experienced
in dealing with these things now.

246
00:11:58,428 --> 00:11:59,469
Actually,

247
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,469
I think Mrs. Mai is quite adorable.

248
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,149
I quite enjoy talking to her.

249
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:06,788
Alright, let's not talk about it.

250
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,229
I'll walk you there.

251
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:10,948
No need.

252
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,749
I want to walk and calm down by myself.

253
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,548
You go back.

254
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:18,509
Okay.

255
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,269
I'm leaving.

256
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,229
Hello, Huan.

257
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:31,269
Mao,

258
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:35,469
Zao had a fierce quarrel with my mom.

259
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:36,588
What happened?

260
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:38,308
It's nothing. Anyway, if he...

261
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,869
If he comes to you,
please comfort him for me.

262
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,708
Okay, I got it. Leave it to me.

263
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,588
Okay.

264
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,749
Mao, where's Dingding?

265
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:14,788
I bought him a cake.

266
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,389
He's tired from playing
and is sleeping upstairs.

267
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,428
You eat first.

268
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,269
I'll help you clean up here.

269
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,629
How is business today?
Were there many people?

270
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:33,708
Not bad.

271
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,869
Dingding didn't have much fun today.

272
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,229
We'll go again another day.

273
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,668
Zao, did anything happen today?

274
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,188
It's nothing.

275
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,469
You don't have to hide it from me.

276
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,588
What exactly happened? Tell me.

277
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:05,188
It's nothing.

278
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:09,948
It's just...

279
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,869
I had a fight with my mom.

280
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,428
Here, sit down.

281
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:26,109
Come on.

282
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,308
Was it because of Dingding?

283
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:35,668
No, it was not related to him.

284
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:38,908
It was my mom.

285
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,029
She asked me to apologize

286
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,469
before figuring things out.

287
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,349
I wanted to explain to her,
but she wouldn't listen.

288
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:47,188
She has always been like this.

289
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,668
Always disregarding my thoughts.

290
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:54,788
Let me tell you.

291
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:57,948
No mother wouldn't care

292
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:00,428
about her child's thoughts.

293
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,869
Besides, you know

294
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,188
your mother.

295
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,668
She gets more anxious than anyone
when something happens.

296
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,308
Moreover, she's not a bad person.

297
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,188
She is just

298
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,109
somewhat prideful.

299
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,948
Anyway, I won't be going home.

300
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,349
What are you doing,
throwing a temper tantrum?

301
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:25,908
Okay.

302
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,188
If you're not going home, stay with me.

303
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,989
Anyway, where I am is your home.

304
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:41,989
Thank you.

305
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:53,188
I told you so.

306
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:54,788
Keep a low profile.

307
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,149
Keep a low profile.

308
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,188
Alright.

309
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:58,948
Take your medicine.

310
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:09,188
I don't want others to say
I'm heartless and ungrateful.

311
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,708
I don't want others to bad-mouth me.

312
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:16,389
What now?

313
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:19,109
They turned against you,

314
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,269
and your son ran off.

315
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,548
You're satisfied now.

316
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,548
- Okay.
- Mrs. Mai, it was also my fault.

317
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,749
It was a good thing
that your relatives came.

318
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,229
Look, I messed it up.

319
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:31,788
But Ming,

320
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,908
you were indeed a bit too much today.

321
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:37,708
Yeah.

322
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:39,469
So I'm here to apologize to you.

323
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:41,668
Please calm down.

324
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,109
If you're still angry,

325
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,788
just take it out on me.

326
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:45,708
No.

327
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:47,948
Look.

328
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,548
Look at him.

329
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,109
So good.

330
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:54,948
After all this,

331
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,588
a man without the surname Mai

332
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:00,349
understands me better
than everyone in this family.

333
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,908
Some family members have left.

334
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,469
Some scolded me.

335
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,588
I didn't scold you.

336
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:08,469
Mrs. Mai,

337
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:11,388
there's no frictionless relationship
among relatives.

338
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,029
Don't overthink it.

339
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,628
It will be fine after a while.

340
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,269
It will be fine after a while.

341
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:26,308
Yu, I've transferred
the room fee for Xing'anli to you.

342
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,628
I've troubled you this time.

343
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:29,628
See?

344
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,229
It's all good now?

345
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,828
They're distant from us.

346
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,749
All my effort for nothing.

347
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,029
Mai,

348
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:41,989
has our daughter not been doing well

349
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:45,989
at work and feeling upset recently?

350
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,308
Of course not.

351
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,669
Taking over such a big hotel
at such a young age.

352
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:55,308
Mrs. Mai, Chenghuan
has been under much pressure recently.

353
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,229
Last month, the working capital

354
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,308
for Xing'anli
was just barely sufficient.

355
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:02,749
Really?

356
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:04,669
Ming,

357
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:08,068
please don't compete
with her for business anymore.

358
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,868
Okay, I'll listen to you.

359
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,548
I'll go upstairs.

360
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,909
What has got into him?

361
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,669
What?

362
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:33,348
Recently, he's been always like,

363
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:35,469
"Alright, okay,"

364
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:36,828
no matter what it is.

365
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,949
Let me tell you.

366
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,269
You're really something.

367
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,709
"Don't compete with our daughter
for business anymore."

368
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,868
How could you say that?

369
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,469
I was telling the truth.

370
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:51,108
Enough. Yu, listen.

371
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,989
You should reflect on yourself.

372
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,588
Take Zao for example, right?

373
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:02,348
He's been introverted, sensitive

374
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,469
and careworn.

375
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,989
When you talk to him,

376
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,029
you really need to be careful.

377
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,029
I have a headache.

378
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:12,949
What's wrong?

379
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:14,909
Lie down for a bit.

380
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:17,108
Lie down for a bit.

381
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:22,868
I really didn't expect Zao to be treated
so badly in the countryside.

382
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:34,308
What kind of people?

383
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,348
The child is naughty
and but what were his parents thinking?

384
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:38,709
We may not finish the cleanup
by the end of the workday.

385
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,068
Bad luck!

386
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:47,269
Miss Mai.

387
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,548
Let me clean up with you guys.

388
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,108
This is the closest to the bridal suite.

389
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,388
Let's hurry up and clean up.

390
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,709
We have customers coming in
for an engagement.

391
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,108
Miss Mai, you don't need to.

392
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,709
Leave it to me.
Don't get your clothes dirty.

393
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:07,469
It's fine.

394
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,709
This was done by my relatives.

395
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,989
I should take responsibility.

396
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,909
We will get it done faster
if we do it together.

397
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,548
I will give you
your overtime pay as usual.

398
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,148
Let's all finish early
and leave work together.

399
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:18,628
Okay.

400
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:18,949
Come on.

401
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:19,628
Okay.

402
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,308
Okay, that's about it.

403
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,308
It's finished. Go home.

404
00:20:58,429 --> 00:20:59,588
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

405
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,588
What took you so long?

406
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:13,388
I just...

407
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,348
I was just working inside
on something with the staff.

408
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,709
You've been waiting here for me?

409
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:23,108
If something like that happens again,

410
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,909
just come to me for my help.

411
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:28,229
And I've taken care of your parents.

412
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,429
Thanks!

413
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,628
This is a reward for you.

414
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,509
You give the same thing every time.
There's no novelty at all.

415
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,429
You don't like it? Give it back to me.

416
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,588
Who says I don't like it?

417
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,989
I like it very much.

418
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,108
As long as it's from you,

419
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:46,509
I will like it.

420
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,189
We're at the hotel entrance. Be careful.

421
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:53,429
So what?

422
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,749
Let's go. I'll take you to have fun.

423
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,949
Where are you taking me?
Is it a ride again?

424
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,388
You'll know once we get there.

425
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:03,509
How do you know this place?

426
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:05,148
I used to come here often.

427
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:07,709
I've seen it on your WeChat Moments.

428
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,269
Are you spying on me?

429
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:11,788
It's public, man.

430
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,909
That was so long ago.

431
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:16,308
You did a background check on me?

432
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,108
I just want to know you better.

433
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:34,909
Yao Zhiming.

434
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:36,828
What are you looking at?

435
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:38,189
Don't you put your feet in?

436
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,868
Waiting for you. Ladies first.

437
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:41,828
Ladies first?

438
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,588
You're afraid, right?

439
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:44,949
How could that be?

440
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,828
Do it.

441
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,709
I'm waiting for you.

442
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,949
Do it.

443
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,108
I didn't expect you
to be afraid of fish!

444
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,068
Well...

445
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,949
Aren't the fish that nibble
on dead skin too big?

446
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,068
Big?

447
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:02,269
As big as the fish you catch?

448
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:03,949
When I fish, I eat the fish.

449
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,509
Now they're eating me.

450
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,469
Fine, scaredy-cat.

451
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:10,669
I'll show you how it's done.

452
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:14,909
See that?

453
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:18,108
Easy. You can even dance inside.

454
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,548
Do you want to give it a try?

455
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,148
Give it a try.

456
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:27,148
Don't dawdle. Hurry up.

457
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,108
Okay, I'll try it.

458
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:28,669
Come on.

459
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:29,628
I'll do it myself.

460
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:30,388
Hurry up.

461
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,108
Do it.

462
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:34,068
How is it?

463
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:36,308
Not bad.

464
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,429
Isn't it pretty good?

465
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:40,348
Yao Zhiming,

466
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:41,628
these fish

467
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:43,788
are quite pitiful.

468
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,548
They can only eat dead skin every day.

469
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:48,828
Not really.

470
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:50,788
Don't think like that.

471
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,509
I find them quite cute, free and easy.

472
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,788
Your thoughts

473
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,068
really impressed me.

474
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:04,669
Huan,

475
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:07,469
would you like

476
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:09,548
to come back home with me today?

477
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,189
Did my mom send you?

478
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:15,709
No, I was just asking.

479
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,068
Yao Zhiming, I am already of age now.

480
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,269
I know how to handle

481
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,229
a lot of things myself.

482
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,669
So you don't need to worry.

483
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,788
Why do you act like my mom?

484
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:29,308
I just haven't figured out
how to face her.

485
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,388
So let's both cool down for a while.

486
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:33,628
Okay, I'll listen to you.

487
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,509
What species are these fish?

488
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,989
Don't you fish every day?

489
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:40,388
They must be called

490
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,388
dead-skin fish?

491
00:24:42,388 --> 00:24:45,068
Come on. There is no fish
called dead-skin fish.

492
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:28,348
Yu.

493
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:30,709
It's already midnight.

494
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:33,269
Don't wait anymore.

495
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,548
I messaged her and sent voice calls
on WeChat, but no reply.

496
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,229
It's so late and she's still not back.

497
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,509
Where do you think she's staying?

498
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,429
Huan told me she was

499
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,828
probably staying at a friend's place.

500
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,909
Staying at a friend's?

501
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:59,068
What kind of friend?

502
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,269
A classmate?

503
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:02,548
I don't know more.

504
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:03,469
Alright.

505
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:06,709
Don't wait anymore. She'll be back
in a couple of days. Be good.

506
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:08,229
Is it...

507
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:12,669
- Is it a classmate or a colleague?
- Probably a colleague.

508
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:13,788
Let's go.

509
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:16,509
You should ask clearly.

510
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:17,989
You are

511
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:19,308
always like this,

512
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:21,269
never taking
important matters seriously.

513
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:22,788
Careless.

514
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,669
What's wrong with you?

515
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,148
I said I would be here in ten minutes.

516
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,868
Is it necessary to rush me like this?

517
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,788
What happened?

518
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:49,229
Just say it and don't act mysterious.

519
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:49,949
What's wrong?

520
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,189
(Butterfly Pastries)
The butterfly pastries from Xing'anli?

521
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:56,628
Did you get a personal shopper
to queue and buy it?

522
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:59,628
Are you blind?

523
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:00,709
Take a good look.

524
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,348
Xing'anli's boss customized

525
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,148
the butterfly pastries for me.

526
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:08,548
Boss,

527
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,388
you're making serious progress

528
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,669
in your relationship

529
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,388
with her.

530
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,348
What are you doing?

531
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:17,709
Give me a piece.

532
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,828
Can't you get a personal shopper?

533
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:19,868
What personal shopper?

534
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:20,949
Look. Come on. Stop it.

535
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:21,588
Enough.

536
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:24,344
(Ms. Zhang)

537
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,108
Oh, my God.

538
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:28,868
She is really annoying.

539
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,949
She keeps asking
about the acquisition over and over.

540
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:32,909
Come on.

541
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:34,348
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

542
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:36,949
Mr. Yao has gone to meet a client.

543
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,148
He forgot his phone,
and I'm about to take it to him.

544
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:41,709
What stage has the acquisition
of Xing'anli reached?

545
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,628
The head office set
a one-month deadline for Eric.

546
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,229
It won't be finished directly
without internal communication, right?

547
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:49,348
Ms. Zhang, please don't worry.

548
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,108
I'll convey this truthfully to Mr. Yao.

549
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:54,709
Have Eric talk to me.

550
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,348
Otherwise, I will not be lenient.

551
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,588
Ms. Zhang,

552
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:07,909
you might have misunderstood.

553
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,429
My direct supervisor
is Amber from the headquarters,

554
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:11,388
not you.

555
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:15,348
So there's no need for you
to worry about the acquisition.

556
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,108
Are you trying
to draw a clear line with me?

557
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:21,308
It's up to you how you
interpret my words.

558
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:32,269
What do we do when the time comes?

559
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,709
I'll figure something out.

560
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,148
Give me a piece. I'm really hungry.

561
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:43,749
I...

562
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,269
I'll buy it myself.

563
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:47,509
Fine.

564
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:17,029
Is everyone here?

565
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,108
I'm cooking your favorite dishes today.

566
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:21,628
My specialty dishes.

567
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,148
Can you come home for dinner?

568
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:59,588
The wedding season is coming up soon.

569
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,868
The marketing department
is quite impressive.

570
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:03,909
They've got many high-quality orders.

571
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,229
So there would be
a good result, I guess.

572
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:09,148
Whether we can be rated
as a specialty hotel at last

573
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:11,348
depends on the performance
of this quarter.

574
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,548
So we may

575
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:15,029
need you to pay some extra attention.

576
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:18,348
Rest assured.
We're all on the same side.

577
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,348
If your hotel does well,
I'll benefit from it too.

578
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:22,949
So you can be completely at ease.

579
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:24,189
I will definitely give it my all.

580
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,709
Thank you. That's great.

581
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,388
What's the matter, little one?

582
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:33,148
Sir, your girlfriend
is really beautiful.

583
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,148
Buy a bouquet for her.

584
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,429
Little one, he's not my boyfriend.

585
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:39,909
There's nothing between us.

586
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:41,588
But your flowers are very pretty.

587
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,709
I'll buy a few bouquets myself, okay?

588
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,348
- Let me do it.
- No, let me.

589
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:50,548
Little girl,

590
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,628
I will buy flowers for this pretty lady.

591
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:54,348
30 yuan per bouquet.

592
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,148
Okay.

593
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:58,469
Good.

594
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:02,949
I will buy all
the remaining flowers for you,

595
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:03,989
and you can call it a day.

596
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,548
Thank you. I wish you happiness.

597
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,229
I wish you happiness too.

598
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,709
Can you give all these flowers

599
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:11,148
to passersby on behalf of my girlfriend

600
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,588
and wish them happiness?

601
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,429
- Bye.
- Bye.

602
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:19,989
(Duo, for this social practice,
I'll give you full marks.)

603
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:21,868
(Let's go home.)

604
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,308
Let me introduce myself.
I'm her boyfriend.

605
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,989
No wonder I sensed

606
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:35,588
something back then.

607
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:39,029
I was really too hurried
to make introductions.

608
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:40,588
Today I'll formally do it.

609
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,388
My boyfriend, Yao Zhiming.

610
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:43,588
Hello.

611
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,229
Yes, we shook hands last time.

612
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:49,828
Do you have plans in a bit?

613
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,949
We would like to treat you to a meal.

614
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,588
- And we'll talk more about work.
- No.

615
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:55,229
I will leave you two alone.

616
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,148
Chenghuan, I'll take my leave.

617
00:31:57,588 --> 00:31:58,348
See you later.

618
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:58,989
Bye.

619
00:31:58,989 --> 00:31:59,989
Bye, thanks for your work.

620
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,469
How come I smell on someone

621
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,669
a hint of jealousy?

622
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:11,308
It is indeed jealousy.

623
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:15,108
He can go into Xing'anli
while I can only wait outside.

624
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,388
I truly didn't know

625
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:22,989
that you were such a person.

626
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:25,868
You don't know me well enough.

627
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,348
You need to know me
better in the future.

628
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:28,429
Annoying.

629
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:29,709
Where are we going in a bit?

630
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:30,709
Let's go

631
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,388
to Zao later.

632
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:34,949
Go see him

633
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,788
with me

634
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:38,548
as his brother-in-law.

635
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,108
Let's go.

636
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,189
Yu.

637
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:53,429
Yu.

638
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,909
Sorry for coming back late.

639
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:56,588
Before getting off work,

640
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:58,588
Mr. Yao asked me to take
a client to the airport.

641
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:00,269
You know it was rush hour.

642
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,229
This round trip took almost three hours.

643
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,388
They haven't returned yet?

644
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,749
Do you think I should

645
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:13,788
give them a call one by one

646
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,628
and order them to come home
to eat immediately?

647
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,229
Sure, go ahead and call.

648
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:21,308
Show your skills then.

649
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:22,989
It's a test of your authority.

650
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:24,749
Anyway,

651
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:27,628
I sent voice messages and texts

652
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:29,229
to them,

653
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:30,788
and they ignored me.

654
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,388
You already sent them WeChat messages?

655
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:39,548
Then forget about it.

656
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:44,788
Where is your confidence now?

657
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:47,949
Aren't you going to command them?

658
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:49,788
Do it.

659
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:53,509
Braggart.

660
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:54,989
Blowhard.

661
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,388
I just wanted to make you happy.

662
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,909
It's alright. I'll eat with you.

663
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:03,788
Who needs you?

664
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,388
The ones who should come
to eat don't come.

665
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,949
The ones who should come
to eat don't come?

666
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,029
So I'm the one

667
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,228
who shouldn't come to eat?

668
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:31,588
What brings you two here?

669
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:41,829
We're together now.

670
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:49,789
Good. You're a real master, Mr. Yao.

671
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,989
You even won her over.

672
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,588
You're not bad, either.

673
00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:55,429
Haven't you got him charmed as well?

674
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,429
Yes.

675
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:02,949
Then come on.

676
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:04,949
A toast from your future in-law.

677
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:09,349
But I must say,
you two are quite something.

678
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:11,228
Keeping it a secret from me for so long.

679
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:12,748
If I don't ask, you won't tell, right?

680
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:15,228
One is my own brother,
and the other, my best friend.

681
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,188
How could you keep it in for so long?

682
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:20,309
No, Huan, I was afraid
you guys wouldn't agree.

683
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,469
I'm going to beat you up.

684
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,228
Why would you think I wouldn't agree?

685
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:27,429
I'm over the moon
that you two are together.

686
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,989
Haven't I always been secretly
supporting you guys?

687
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:32,148
But Zao,

688
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:35,108
I think you made
a very responsible decision.

689
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:36,829
You're a mature man.

690
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,188
No, the mature man is right there.

691
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,748
Zao is still young.

692
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:46,108
Alright. Should we talk
about something serious?

693
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,029
I think you two

694
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,349
should pay some attention to Ms. Liu.

695
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:53,509
She sent a message in the group.

696
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:54,588
No one has replied yet.

697
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,429
Zao, the day after tomorrow
is your birthday.

698
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:06,389
Can you come home for dinner?

699
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:14,949
Should you two

700
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:18,309
have a good talk with Ms. Liu?

701
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:22,029
I really think she meant well.

702
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,029
After all, you are all family.

703
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,588
Just have it out with each other.

704
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,188
But it's just a suggestion
from an outsider.

705
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:34,949
Just have a listen.

706
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,148
I think

707
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,188
you're right.

708
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,108
And now,

709
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,148
you're no longer an outsider.

710
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:54,389
Zao, tomorrow I'll go back
and talk with Mom.

711
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,989
Spend your birthday with us.

712
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:58,548
Ever since you came
to Shanghai as a child,

713
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,708
we've celebrated your birthday
together every year.

714
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,789
Okay.

715
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:07,789
Go back and have
a good talk with your mom.

716
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,389
Come on. Live happily

717
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,389
with your family.

718
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,188
Cheers.

719
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:16,949
Be happy.

720
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:30,548
Ming, you're back.

721
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,389
Mrs. Mai, you're still up?

722
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:35,588
What happened to your feet?

723
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:36,588
It's nothing.

724
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:39,829
I'm a bit tired today,
so the old injury is acting up.

725
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:47,548
I called Huan, but she didn't answer.

726
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,309
I called Zao,
but he didn't answer, either.

727
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:53,909
Neither of them came home.

728
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:56,389
Mrs. Mai,

729
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,909
Huan is working overtime.

730
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,628
She definitely won't come back tonight.

731
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:02,708
Zao is a young man.

732
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,748
It's normal for him
to go out and hang out with friends.

733
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,309
There's nothing to worry about.

734
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,748
It's all my fault.

735
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,588
How about I cook some dishes
and go see her at Xing'anli tomorrow?

736
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:17,989
She needs to strengthen her nutrition.

737
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:21,029
She often gets so busy
and forgets to eat.

738
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:22,389
And I'll take the opportunity

739
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:23,829
to ask her to persuade Zao.

740
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,108
Do you think this is a good idea?

741
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,108
Mrs. Mai, take my advice.

742
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:30,509
Don't go to Xing'anli
while she's at work.

743
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,548
That's your daughter's battlefield.

744
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:33,909
Give her some space.

745
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,389
I'm worried about her.

746
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,389
She always forgets to eat.

747
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,588
If this continues,
her health will deteriorate.

748
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:45,509
It's getting cold.

749
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:50,148
I'm afraid she'll catch a cold,
so I'll bring her some common medicine.

750
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:56,588
Time to sleep.

751
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,708
These are the next candidates' resumes.
Please have a look.

752
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,668
Miss Mai, I'm here again.

753
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,108
Since we've met,
I won't introduce myself again.

754
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,949
Have you thought
about the question I asked you?

755
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:14,989
The HR lady has told me

756
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:17,949
you are in an online competition.

757
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,949
Online marketing

758
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:21,188
is what I'm best at.

759
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:27,548
This is my answer.

760
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:28,548
You go ahead with your work.

761
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:29,228
Okay.

762
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,880
(Xing'anli Garden Hotel
Marketing Program)

763
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,309
Xing'anli is likened to settling down.

764
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,588
Coming to Xing'anli
has become a new way of urban living.

765
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,148
What do you think about it?

766
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,349
My first impression of Xing'anli

767
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,748
is a quaint and warm place.

768
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:49,469
It has a very homely feel.

769
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,949
In this increasingly modern city,

770
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:54,548
this kind of vibe is rare to see.

771
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,949
And considering the charm
of the old building,

772
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,469
I think we should
innovate on this basis.

773
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,188
It's not common to see people
who resonate so much with home.

774
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,108
My home

775
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,309
is just cold.

776
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,989
My mom has never cared about me.

777
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,108
In her eyes, I'm just like furniture.

778
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:21,748
So Xing'anli gives me
a strong sense of home.

779
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:27,748
I think Ms. Liu is very nice.

780
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,108
Why don't we switch places?

781
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:32,108
I really want to switch with you.

782
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,148
Every parent is the same.

783
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:36,628
They definitely love their children.

784
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:38,268
It's just that the methods differ.

785
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:39,628
Just like between me and my mom,

786
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:41,188
there are also many issues.

787
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:43,989
So you want to come to Xing'anli

788
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:46,068
in order to get Ms. Zhang to notice you?

789
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:48,949
I've thought it through.

790
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:51,108
I want to prove myself

791
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:52,349
and make her see me.

792
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:55,668
I really don't want
our relationship to remain like this.

793
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:00,909
Come to work next week.

794
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:02,268
Prove yourself.

795
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:03,628
Yes.

796
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:09,869
We're working on the evaluation
for the top ten specialty hotels.

797
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:12,748
Therefore, we need to strictly
implement standardization

798
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:15,148
to improve our service quality.

799
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:16,029
Miss Mai,

800
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,949
your relatives have made
the hotel a complete mess.

801
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,148
And now you're asking us
to standardize our services.

802
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:23,349
Is that appropriate?

803
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,708
Liao Gang, you know nothing.

804
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,268
We adhered to our hotel's policies

805
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:30,188
and procedures when accommodating
Miss Mai's relatives.

806
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,068
Miss Mai paid for it herself.

807
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:34,748
And no special treatment was provided.

808
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,469
They are my relatives.

809
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,588
But at the same time,

810
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,548
they are also our guests.

811
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:41,349
The reason for standardization

812
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,548
is because we can't determine

813
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:44,188
what kind of people come every day.

814
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,708
And this time,

815
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:46,869
it just exposed

816
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,148
significant problems
with our emergency measures.

817
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,708
The children were playing
with mud in the lobby.

818
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:54,268
Not a single staff member
stepped forward to remind them.

819
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:55,509
After the accident,

820
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:57,188
not a single staff member

821
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:59,188
approached to soothe the guests

822
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:02,148
or provide a reasonable explanation
or compensation,

823
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:03,429
which caused it

824
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,708
to escalate further.

825
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:06,949
I hope such a thing

826
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,748
will not happen again in the future.

827
00:42:08,748 --> 00:42:09,548
Yao Zhiming,

828
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:12,148
I am now working in Xing'anli.

829
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:13,789
Just reporting to you.

830
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:18,349
Ziyu, you...

831
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:19,949
What's wrong?

832
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,588
Ms. Liu, what brings you here?

833
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:23,509
I brought her food.

834
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,909
Chenghuan is in a meeting.

835
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:26,789
A meeting?

836
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:27,668
Also...

837
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,309
It's time to eat.

838
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,588
Based on this current goal,

839
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:38,708
I sent you an email

840
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:40,829
on the new performance appraisal system

841
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,588
we will implement in the future.

842
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:44,469
I hope we can in all aspects

843
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,228
align with five-star hotels.

844
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:47,748
What is all this?

845
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,829
When Ms. Chen was alive,

846
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:51,588
she never made these demands of us.

847
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:54,989
