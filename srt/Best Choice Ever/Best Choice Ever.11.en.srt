=Episode 11=

3
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:36,579
Mai Chengzao.

4
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,378
Do you know the rules?

5
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,139
There are rules in the workplace.

6
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,339
You must follow the rules
and respect your seniors.

7
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:48,579
Don't get carried away

8
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,098
because of your unrealistic connection

9
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,898
with the boss.

10
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,538
Are you trying to show off
in front of the boss?

11
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,098
Nice try.

12
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:21,978
Ms. Chen, I'm looking for you.

13
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,619
Here are your clothes, all cleaned.

14
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:33,779
Ms. Chen.

15
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:35,939
Ms. Chen, are you free now?

16
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,059
Go ahead.

17
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,179
Rest assured. I'm not here to rush you.

18
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:40,779
I brought you something.

19
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,339
Tonight, Botticelli
will hold a wine tasting party.

20
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,578
It will be attended
by those quality clients

21
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,138
who love fun and food.

22
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,578
Many of our apartment residents
will be there.

23
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:53,698
This is the invitation.

24
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,698
I owe you the property fee.

25
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,378
Yet you sent me a gift?

26
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,578
It's our fault
that I failed to make you satisfied

27
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:05,538
with our services.

28
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:09,299
Besides, I worked at this hotel,

29
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,299
so getting an invitation was not hard.

30
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,059
I hear you've started a business.

31
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:15,978
It must be challenging.

32
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,418
I think that maybe at this banquet,

33
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,418
you can meet some new clients.

34
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,978
If I can be of any help to you,

35
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,739
I will be very happy.

36
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,258
Do all housekeepers try so hard
to collect property fees?

37
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:29,179
On my first day here,

38
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:30,258
my manager told me

39
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:31,378
I would provide good services

40
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,658
only if I put myself in others' shoes.

41
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,378
Besides, you are the first resident

42
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:36,978
I attended to after I started working.

43
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,378
To be honest, I sincerely want
to become friends with you.

44
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,418
I assure you

45
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,939
even after you pay the property fee,

46
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,378
I will not reduce the quality
of my service.

47
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,219
Alright.

48
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,179
Since you're so sincere

49
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,019
and considerate,

50
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,258
I'll pay the fee when I have the time.

51
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,459
Ms. Chen, don't bother.

52
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,779
Here's the QR code for payment.

53
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,538
You can scan it.

54
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,538
I will bring the invoice
to you this afternoon.

55
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:05,619
Would that be okay?

56
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,578
Alright. That's it?

57
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:08,418
Yes.

58
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,378
Okay, done.

59
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,499
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

60
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,659
(Mr. Yao, are you there?)

61
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,539
(I'll clean the water dispenser
for you.)

62
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,939
(Also, thank you for the reminder.)

63
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:54,378
Zao.

64
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:56,619
Huan has been busy recently.

65
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,578
She rarely comes back for dinner.

66
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,338
She wouldn't even text me.

67
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,338
She got a promotion,
so she's a bit busy.

68
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,499
Dad, Mom, you eat first.

69
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:09,458
And take a walk after dinner.

70
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,578
I will clean the dishes later.

71
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,299
Don't interrupt.

72
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,258
Let's eat.

73
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,778
What about Jialiang?

74
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:16,778
How's Jialiang doing?

75
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,939
I haven't seen him
send your sister back lately.

76
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,939
Why do I feel

77
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,378
that something goes wrong?

78
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,419
No, everything is fine.

79
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,619
You talk to Huan.

80
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:30,939
The two of them...

81
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,099
Yu, why is this dish so salty?

82
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,179
Did you add salt twice?

83
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,698
How could that be?

84
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:41,818
- You taste it.
- How could I make such a silly mistake?

85
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,778
It tastes pretty good.

86
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,299
You are muddling things up again.

87
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,619
It's okay. I can fix it.

88
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:56,859
The floor was not even.

89
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:57,419
Okay.

90
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,299
It's not salty now.

91
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,338
It's delicious.

92
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,939
Mom, I'm back.

93
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,458
Huan, you're back.

94
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:11,578
Have you eaten?

95
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:12,898
Not yet.

96
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,898
There's food left for you on the table.

97
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,739
Where are Dad and Mom?

98
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:25,419
They went to the supermarket.

99
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:27,299
Washing the dishes?

100
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,659
Why have you been
working overtime recently?

101
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:32,859
Is work going smoothly?

102
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,218
It's alright.

103
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:36,818
It's a new working environment.

104
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:37,898
I need time to adapt to it.

105
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,979
How's Xin Jialiang doing?

106
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,739
Is he still playing ostrich?

107
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:56,818
Huan.

108
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:58,859
During dinner,

109
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,739
Mom keeps asking questions.

110
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,138
When will you tell Mom and Dad?

111
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,179
You definitely can't keep it a secret.

112
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:08,539
Huan.

113
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,179
I have to say something,
but don't get mad, okay?

114
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,299
Go ahead.

115
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,059
I don't think
Xin Jialiang is worthy of you.

116
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:25,059
And his family isn't right for you.

117
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,659
Do you know
what I think of Xin Jialiang?

118
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,659
He has no sense of responsibility.

119
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,018
From a man's perspective,

120
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,338
I despise men like him.

121
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,539
And his dad...

122
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,778
I know.

123
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:37,659
I'm aware of what you're saying.

124
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:40,338
Huan.

125
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,099
You have to make up your mind.

126
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,859
If you decide
to break up with Xin Jialiang,

127
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,619
you don't have to worry about me.

128
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,859
Actually, my job doesn't matter.

129
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:52,258
Anyway, I can resign from Fangyuan.

130
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:54,739
Don't be silly.

131
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,698
Don't let my relationship
with the Xin family

132
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,099
affect your own job.

133
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,018
Don't resign casually.

134
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,859
You just said that Xin Jialiang

135
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,059
was playing ostrich
with no sense of responsibility.

136
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,859
Now, nobody's judging you,

137
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,099
but you've thought of escaping.

138
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:09,739
No, I haven't.

139
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,299
Anyway, if anything happens,

140
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:15,739
don't hide it from me.

141
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,739
Don't always shoulder it alone.

142
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,338
I got it. Stop nagging.

143
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,338
You're as nagging as Mom.

144
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,739
Go and get me some rice.

145
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:31,859
Take a look.

146
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,659
These dumplings are good.

147
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,179
Let's buy two boxes later.

148
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:38,539
And stuffed buns and youtiao.

149
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,458
Huan and Zao both like them.

150
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,299
Got it.

151
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:48,498
Why did you interrupt me during dinner?

152
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,218
Didn't you notice

153
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,259
your son was trying
to change the subject?

154
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,419
I know.

155
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,419
That's why I felt something was off.

156
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,218
Huan is close to her brother.

157
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,498
There are things she doesn't tell us,

158
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,059
but she will tell her brother.

159
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,379
I think

160
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,939
Zao seems to know something.

161
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,939
I'll call and ask him.

162
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,299
Haven't you thought about it?

163
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,098
What did our son study?

164
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:19,179
He knows what should be said

165
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,659
and what shouldn't.

166
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,939
You won't get your way.

167
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,338
I think they had a fight.

168
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:27,458
Who do you mean?

169
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:30,098
Huan and Jialiang.

170
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,858
She doesn't want us to worry.

171
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,098
So, she and Zao keep us in the dark.

172
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:40,098
It's normal to quarrel
when they're dating.

173
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:40,939
Normal?

174
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,539
What's normal?

175
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:44,939
Normal...

176
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,019
Aren't you worried?

177
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,218
Geez.

178
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:50,019
If Huan's marriage isn't settled,

179
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,379
I feel uneasy.

180
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:52,618
Just think about it.

181
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,059
She's almost 30.

182
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,098
Time flies fast.

183
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,738
Besides, Jialiang has a good background.

184
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:00,139
It's not easy to meet a man like him.

185
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:01,179
Don't be silly.

186
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,059
Please.

187
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,939
You were wrong.

188
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,019
Huan is 29, not 30.

189
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,578
Lower your voice.

190
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:10,218
Alright.

191
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,419
Special price for dumplings.

192
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,218
On discount.

193
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:14,858
Hurry.

194
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,218
Two boxes.

195
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,379
Two boxes?

196
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,338
Okay.

197
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,458
Two boxes.

198
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,338
And this one.

199
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:26,858
Huan.

200
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,539
There's one thing,

201
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,059
but I don't know

202
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,539
if I should tell you or not.

203
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,098
What is it?

204
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,858
Mom found your secret money?

205
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:37,179
No.

206
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,539
So what is it?

207
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,659
Your mom went to see the Xin family
early this morning.

208
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:45,939
Why?

209
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,939
Hello, who are you looking for?

210
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,779
Hello.

211
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,179
Hello.

212
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,218
Mrs. Xin, it's me.

213
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,019
I'm here to give you some chili sauce.

214
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,578
Have you finished the sauce you had?

215
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:14,379
It's tasty, right?

216
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,218
Today, I've brought you smoked fish.

217
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:20,259
You didn't try it last time.
It's delicious.

218
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,139
Let her in.

219
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,139
This way, please.

220
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:26,818
Okay.

221
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,218
The house is so big.

222
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,498
Is Mrs. Xin home?

223
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,299
Yeah.

224
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,139
There's water in the yard.

225
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,218
This house

226
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,139
is so big.

227
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,858
This living room alone

228
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,578
is as big as my house.

229
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,698
I guess
the property fee must be expensive.

230
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,858
Mrs. Xin.

231
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,618
I brought you some smoked fish.

232
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:04,818
Look.

233
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,858
It is very delicious.

234
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:07,818
Try it.

235
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,978
If you like it, I can make more for you.

236
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:12,618
And here is the chili sauce.

237
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,419
It was made with a new recipe.

238
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,259
It tastes different
from the previous one.

239
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,379
Have a taste.
If you like it, I'll make more.

240
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:22,659
Mrs. Mai.

241
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,179
You're here today not for the sauce
and smoked fish,

242
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,059
but for Chenghuan, right?

243
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,019
You're right.

244
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,419
I knew it.

245
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,059
We think the same way.

246
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,019
Mrs. Xin.

247
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:41,899
Do you realize

248
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:44,120
that Jialiang

249
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,139
has acted differently lately?

250
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,299
Anyway, I found

251
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,379
Huan had been

252
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:57,738
in low spirits.

253
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,659
I wonder

254
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,098
if they had a fight.

255
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,899
Actually, it's normal
for them to quarrel.

256
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,939
No big deal.

257
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,978
I think

258
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,179
as parents,

259
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,059
we should start

260
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,019
the preparation for their wedding.

261
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,139
Like the place to hold the wedding...

262
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,379
They did have a fight.

263
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,779
Why did they fight?

264
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,338
Didn't Chenghuan tell you?

265
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,899
She never likes

266
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,218
to tell me any bad news.

267
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,498
I think

268
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,939
she is too ashamed to say it.

269
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,059
What?

270
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:54,539
Mr. Yao.

271
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,338
Well,

272
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:58,578
I'm sorry,

273
00:13:58,899 --> 00:13:59,779
but here's one thing.

274
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,019
After I drop you off,

275
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,498
I want to drive the car
to pick up my wife.

276
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,299
It's raining.

277
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,139
Where to?

278
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,659
Cuihu Villas.

279
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,419
You can pick her up on my way.

280
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,179
Thank you.

281
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,618
Do you know

282
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,179
how much loss Chenghuan has brought
to my family?

283
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,818
We are being magnanimous
by not holding her to account.

284
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,818
So, I have to

285
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,578
put their wedding on hold.

286
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:38,659
Because of this,

287
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:42,379
you don't allow Huan
to contact Jialiang.

288
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,059
You are wronging her,

289
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,379
slinging mud at her.

290
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,618
Mrs. Mai.

291
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,618
Don't confuse right and wrong.

292
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,059
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,379
Isn't it obvious?

294
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,818
You gave kickbacks to others.

295
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,899
You did it, but you

296
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:05,539
blamed Huan for making it public.

297
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:13,738
We're not on the same page.

298
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,019
You gave kickbacks to others.

299
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,738
You business people

300
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:19,458
have all messed up the market.

301
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,818
Do you know
who will bear the consequences?

302
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:22,978
It's us, the common people.

303
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:28,858
Mrs. Mai.

304
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,858
I can't make it clear to you.

305
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,818
Ms. Wang, see the guest out.

306
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,539
I haven't finished yet.

307
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,698
Let me tell you.

308
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,139
If I know you're that kind of person,

309
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,618
I shouldn't have introduced Yao Zhiming
to you.

310
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,139
You didn't win the bid?

311
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,939
That's great. You deserved it.

312
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,779
I was wondering why it was so noisy.

313
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:50,939
I thought I was sleeping
in a house in the longtang.

314
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,858
It turns out someone from the longtang

315
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,458
went to the wrong house.

316
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,698
It's so noisy.

317
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,179
Longtang?

318
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:00,059
So what?

319
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:01,698
What do you mean?

320
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,379
People from the longtang

321
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:05,899
are upright and of correct conduct.

322
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,419
We never play tricks,

323
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:08,779
not like someone here.

324
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:10,299
Let me tell you.

325
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,539
My daughter is hardworking and earnest,

326
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,899
a person who lives by her own efforts,

327
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,618
not like you,

328
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,299
staying at home, doing nothing,

329
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,098
living off your parents.

330
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,059
You...

331
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:20,899
Mrs. Mai.

332
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,738
My daughter is pregnant.

333
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,059
Please watch your words.

334
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:25,498
Pregnant?

335
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:27,299
So what?

336
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,818
Because you are pregnant,

337
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,858
I won't speak harshly.

338
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:32,858
Otherwise,

339
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,259
as an elder,

340
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:35,698
I will teach you a lesson.

341
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,098
Mom.

342
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,379
Now, you see the true colors
of the Mai family, right?

343
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,098
I asked Mai Chenghuan
to sign a prenuptial agreement,

344
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,098
and Jialiang blamed me.

345
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,498
What?

346
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,698
Prenuptial agreement?

347
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,179
You forced Huan

348
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:52,299
to sign a prenuptial agreement?

349
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,339
What's wrong with that?

350
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,379
If she doesn't want money, just sign it.

351
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:07,659
She didn't sign it, did she?

352
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,819
I've seen too many people like you
who want to reap without sowing.

353
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:12,258
You...

354
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:16,058
You actually asked Huan
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

355
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,819
This is too far.

356
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:20,458
You are out of line.

357
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,538
Mom, let's go home.

358
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:32,738
Huan.

359
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:34,379
Come here.

360
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:35,579
Tell me.

361
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,298
What did they do to you?

362
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,899
Mrs. Mai.

363
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,139
We did nothing to her.

364
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,579
Are you serious?

365
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:44,738
Without telling me,

366
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:45,619
you forced my daughter

367
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,819
- to sign a prenuptial agreement.
- Mom.

368
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:48,899
- Mom.
- What is this all about?

369
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:49,458
Mom.

370
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,099
Jialiang.

371
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,179
- Mom.
- Let me handle it, okay?

372
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,419
- Jialiang, come out.
- Let me handle it, okay?

373
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,379
Let's go home.

374
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:58,498
Let's go home.

375
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,498
Such an ill-bred girl.

376
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,859
Like mother, like daughter.

377
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,939
Xin Jiali, you shut up.

378
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,218
What? Did I say something wrong?

379
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,179
Alright, stop.

380
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,698
At the door,

381
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,298
I overheard your conversation.

382
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,218
Today should be the last time

383
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:33,458
I meet with the two of you.

384
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,379
Next,

385
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,498
I want to speak my mind.

386
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,738
If there is anything unpleasant to hear,

387
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,579
please forgive me.

388
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:43,738
Huan.

389
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:46,899
Why is it the last time?

390
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:50,458
Mrs. Xin.

391
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,379
Jiali.

392
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:54,619
I know

393
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,819
you've always looked down on me,

394
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:59,258
thinking I'm not good enough
for Xin Jialiang.

395
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,619
I thought

396
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:04,058
that with my effort and sincerity,

397
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,379
I could overcome the difference
in social status,

398
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,819
making me

399
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,899
and my family be treated fairly.

400
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,298
But now, it seems

401
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:15,899
that I was wrong.

402
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,619
You should already know

403
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:21,379
that I didn't disclose the bid.

404
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,058
The kickback list has nothing to do
with me too.

405
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:26,698
Now, things have been clear.

406
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,419
I have a clear conscience
towards your family.

407
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:32,218
I am an easy person to talk to.

408
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,099
But I have my bottom line.

409
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:37,698
My bottom line is my family.

410
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,258
You can look down on me

411
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:41,939
and underestimate me.

412
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,218
But you cannot insult my family,

413
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:45,498
my mother.

414
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:51,458
Even if I love someone very much,

415
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,139
I will not let my family suffer
even the slightest because of me.

416
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,819
Since everyone is here today,

417
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:02,619
let's make things clear.

418
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,298
Xin Jialiang.

419
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:12,738
From now on,

420
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:14,859
we are

421
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,939
over.

422
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,538
My association with your family

423
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,379
is ended.

424
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,419
Mom, let's go home.

425
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:31,939
Huan.

426
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,698
Huan.

427
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,298
Listen.

428
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:36,339
Let's go home.

429
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:37,659
Don't be impulsive.

430
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,139
You can't break up with him.

431
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:40,619
Listen to me.

432
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,738
Mom, let's go home.

433
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,859
Xin Jialiang, where are you going?

434
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,738
If you leave, then don't come back.

435
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,419
Alright, stop.

436
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,939
Jialiang is... You...

437
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,179
Huan.

438
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,179
What did I just say?

439
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,538
Huan.

440
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:09,659
Jialiang is following us.

441
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,498
He's quite pitiful.

442
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,179
You two should talk it over.

443
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:14,619
I know

444
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:17,298
I wasn't calm enough.

445
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,619
Mom, I've made it very clear.

446
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,179
Jialiang and I are over.

447
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,058
- Don't do this.
- Huan.

448
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,058
Huan.

449
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,819
Huan, you should talk to him.

450
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,738
Mom, wait for me up ahead. Come.

451
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,819
Huan, listen to me.

452
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,099
I'll be right back.

453
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,698
Talk to him nicely.

454
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:45,819
Don't worry.

455
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:12,819
Jialiang.

456
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:15,819
I have already made it clear.

457
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,538
We have to admit

458
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:22,939
marriage involves two families.

459
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,939
Our families are too different

460
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:28,218
both in backgrounds and values.

461
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,498
We should be apart to cool our heads.

462
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,538
Huan.

463
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:41,218
Don't be mad.

464
00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:43,978
Let's try harder again

465
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,859
and go back to the way it was before.

466
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,018
Jialiang.

467
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,778
We have come to this point today.

468
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,579
Can we go back then?

469
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,978
Why can't we?

470
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,498
I'll take you to a city
where no one knows us.

471
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,258
Let's escape from our families

472
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,538
and start over, okay?

473
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:05,738
Xin Jialiang.

474
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,058
Why don't you understand?

475
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,538
Let's talk about our own issues,
leaving aside our families.

476
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,859
Have you thought about our own problems?

477
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:17,819
I was framed at the bidding conference.

478
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,698
And you just hid.

479
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,738
I called you, and you didn't answer.

480
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,139
When you encounter problems,
you only hide and apologize.

481
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:27,419
You always think that after apologizing,

482
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,538
you can just muddle it through.

483
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,339
But have you ever thought

484
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,584
that the two of us
have never communicated?

485
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,579
Nor have we ever faced the problems,

486
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,339
or resolved them.

487
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:40,698
Jialiang.

488
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,179
I'm tired of this.

489
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:48,258
I really don't want to continue anymore.

490
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:57,592
In this relationship,

491
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:01,419
I've been constantly saying sorry,

492
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:04,899
because I care about you, but you...

493
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,738
You said I was evasive.

494
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:14,339
But you don't know how many times
I've fought with them because of you.

495
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,099
Think about it.

496
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:19,512
It's been three years,

497
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,379
I do

498
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,179
whatever you say.

499
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,179
Have I ever refused you?

500
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,339
Huan.

501
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,058
After so much has happened,

502
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,859
has any one of you ever cared about me?

503
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,018
Has anyone cared about me?

504
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,419
Have you ever cared about me?

505
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:52,339
Huan and Jialiang?

506
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:53,659
What's going on?

507
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:59,498
If I didn't care about you,

508
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,218
I wouldn't have been
with you for three years.

509
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,458
If I didn't care about you,

510
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,018
I wouldn't have forgiven you
after you deceived me

511
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:11,258
again and again.

512
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:12,538
If I didn't care about you,

513
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:13,939
I wouldn't have wished

514
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:15,458
to get through difficulties with you,

515
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:16,778
though your family

516
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,424
looks down on me

517
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:20,538
and my family.

518
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:21,698
Jialiang.

519
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,379
I'm too tired.

520
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,778
I have to give up.

521
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,298
Do we have to break up?

522
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:18,498
Jialiang.

523
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,698
You and I are not from the same world.

524
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,819
Let's let go of each other.

525
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:32,179

551

Dad, what are you doing here?

00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:30,379
I just happened to pass by.

554
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:33,379

Take the medicine.

575
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:13,139
She's so quiet. I'm worried.

576
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:16,698
Right now,

577
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,379
she must be very sad.

578
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,738
She wants to be alone for a while.

579
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,498
Just leave her alone.

580
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,258
You go to her

581
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:29,619
and check what's going on.

582
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,018
You take this medicine first.

583
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,738
When I give her some medicine,

584
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,339
I'll check on her.

585
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:39,538
No.

586
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:42,139
She's been like this since she returned.

587
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,018
She won't eat, drink, or speak.

588
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:45,899
I'm worried about her.

589
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,939
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

590
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:57,619
What's wrong?

591
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:01,579
Your mom

592
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,659
got angry with the Xin family,

593
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:07,738
so, Huan broke up

594
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,018
with Jialiang.

595
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,859
Great. It should have happened sooner.

596
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,538
What makes you say that?

597
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:18,579
Xin Jialiang is not worthy of my sister.

598
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,619
Keep it down.

599
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,379
He likes to put on airs.

600
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,619
And his sister is tough to deal with.

601
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:27,419
His mom doesn't seem easygoing.

602
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,258
Shouldn't Huan break up

603
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:30,498
with him?

604
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:32,498
Enough.

605
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:35,218
What if they're back together?

606
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,099
No way, I'll go take a look.

607
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,379
Be careful.

608
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,579
It's quiet. I'll knock on the door.

609
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,018
Huan.

610
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:10,579
Huan.

611
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,339
It's so quiet. What should we do?

612
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:18,018
Could something happen?

613
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,139
She's fine.

614
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,939
She knows what to do.

615
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,139
No way, I need to knock on her door.

616
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,218
No, don't.

617
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:27,379
It's all right.

618
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,538
- It's okay.
- Move aside.

619
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:30,859
Don't.

620
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:34,738
What are you doing?

621
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,538
Nothing.

622
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,258
Are you okay?

623
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,579
I'm fine.

624
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:43,819
The laundry detergent is almost out.

625
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:45,379
I'll go out to buy it.

626
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm leaving.

627
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:52,498
I'm going to check on my sister.

628
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:04,419
I can't imagine

629
00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:06,899
how many difficulties

630
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,738
she has to face

631
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,698
and overcome alone.

632
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:33,379
Okay.

633
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,139
Don't be upset.

634
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,179
Chengzao is with her.

635
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,058
He will comfort his sister.

636
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:44,899
Come on.

637
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:47,139
Take your medicine.

638
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:20,859
Huan.

639
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,178
Why are you following me?

640
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,339
I'm fine.

641
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:30,299
I just got out for some air.

642
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:32,538
Huan.

643
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,058
Don't try to fool me.

644
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:54,498
Zao.

645
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,259
Do you think I'm a loser?

646
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,578
I'm always acting self-righteous.

647
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:03,819
Don't think that way.

648
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,578
You should break up.

649
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,978
Marriage isn't a business deal.

650
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,779
Since you've broken up
with Xin Jialiang,

651
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,379
I won't work at the law firm.

652
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:21,219
You have your pride.

653
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:23,339
So, what's your plan?

654
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:25,939
I'll find a new job.

655
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:27,859
Doesn't it mean

656
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,939
you used a connection to get the job?

657
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:30,978
I...

658
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:32,219
Zao.

659
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,779
Right now, all you need
to do is to work hard.

660
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:36,819
Even if you want to find a new job,

661
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,699
it shouldn't be due to my relations
with the Xin family.

662
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:40,578
You will change your job

663
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,339
because this firm isn't right for you,

664
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,458
or you have a better option.

665
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:45,739
Do you understand?

666
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,739
But seeing what they did to you,

667
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:54,658
I really...

668
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:58,498
Life is like opening a blind box.

669
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,752
When you make a choice,

670
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:04,379
you never know if it's right or wrong.

671
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,978
What does it matter
if the result isn't good?

672
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:10,538
The key is
that you take every step as you want,

673
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,498
as long as you don't let yourself down.

674
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,299
I'll serve it.

675
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,299
Huan, time for breakfast.

676
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:52,578
Have breakfast.

677
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,138
Look, steamed buns
and barbecued pork buns.

678
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,618
No need, Mom.

679
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:58,299
I won't eat. I have a weekly meeting.
I gotta go.

680
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,458
I'll pack some for you

681
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:00,899
and bring it to your office.

682
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:01,859
No need.

683
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,299
What about your favorite, Huangjin cake?

684
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,259
I'm leaving.

685
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:09,739
Your bag.

686
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:12,658
I forgot.

687
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,978
I'm leaving, Mom.

688
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:23,699
Be careful on the road.

689
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,339
Okay.

690
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:40,178
Zao.

691
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:42,498
Did you talk to your sister yesterday?

692
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:44,939
I did. Don't worry, Mom.

693
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,259
Huan is very wise.

694
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,339
She will surely figure it out.

695
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:49,699
Really?

696
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,339
If so, she won't be like that.

697
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,138
After all, it's been three years.

698
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,538
They can't be over easily.

699
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:57,259
As for love...

700
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,578
You can't understand, anyway.

701
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:03,819
Last night,

702
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,379
I thought about it all night.

703
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,859
I think

704
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:09,299
no matter what,

705
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,658
Huan can't give up

706
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,739
on this relationship.

707
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:14,259
Zao.

708
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,259
You persuade your sister

709
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:17,899
and tell her

710
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,259
that as long as she
and Jialiang are good,

711
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:22,538
don't care about anything else,

712
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:23,859
or the two families.

713
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:26,779
This is between Jialiang and her.

714
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:29,859
Mom.

715
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,578
My sister might not think the same way

716
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,658
as you.

717
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,504
We should put ourselves in her shoes.

718
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,178
Okay, I see.

719
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:41,259
I will talk to her myself.

720
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:42,739
Yu.

721
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,978
The cake has been steamed for a while.

722
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:45,978
I'll turn off the heat.

723
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,138
Okay, turn it off.

724
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:48,739
She can eat when she's back.

725
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:06,939
Chenghuan.

726
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:09,538
A-Are you okay?

727
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,578
I'm fine. I didn't see that.

728
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:18,498
Didn't you see such a big sign there?

729
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:20,899
Let's hurry. We're late for the meeting.

730
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:22,578
Be careful.

731
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:34,058
Morning.

732
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:38,339
Slow down.

733
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,939
It's time for the most boring routine.

734
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,419
Let's have a regular meeting.

735
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:53,978
I will make it brief,

736
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,699
giving you time
to slack off at work, okay?

737
00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:57,578
First, I'll speak about negative things.

738
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,899
The negative point is...

739
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:02,899
Chenghuan, my phone
has run out of battery.

740
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:04,658
- Do you have a power bank?
- Can you be more patient

741
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:06,379
when communicating
with the property owner?

742
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,339
Try to keep your temper.

743
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:09,819
You have a complaint every week.

744
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:11,058
I warn you.

745
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:14,819
I hope this power bank

746
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,538
can charge up our relationship.

747
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,379
Next, I'll talk about positive things.

748
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,859
The star housekeeper last week

749
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:26,538
was the new staff Mai Chenghuan.

750
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,178
Chenghuan, come on.

751
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:32,978
You tell us

752
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,578
how you became a star housekeeper
so soon.

753
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,098
Do you have any secrets?

754
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:37,498
Good, let's give a round of applause.

755
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,018
About the secret,

756
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:44,939
it's just one word.

757
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,538
Problem solving.

758
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:48,819
Chenghuan.

759
00:40:49,899 --> 00:40:51,018
That's two words.

760
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,538
Two words.

761
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:55,299
Okay.

762
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,219
Whether one or two words, it's okay.

763
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:10,859
What happened to your feet?

764
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,978
How come you didn't tell me
about your breakup?

765
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,178
I had to find out for myself.

766
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,498
If you need a place to vent,

767
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,978
I'll take you there.

768
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:31,178
I'm tired.

769
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:44,018
Well, let's go home.

770
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,618
Alright?

771
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:48,739
Okay.

772
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:51,739
Don't cry.

773
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:08,498
You've been lying here for an hour.

774
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,419
Say something.

775
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:17,419
I'm telling you.

776
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,939
The breakup is a relief for you.

777
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,618
Look at Xin Jialiang.

778
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,458
He's deceived you many times.

779
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:27,379
And his family.

780
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:29,819
If you married him,

781
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,259
you would suffer a lot in the future.

782
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:35,939
So, what's there to be sad about?

783
00:42:38,899 --> 00:42:40,259
I don't know.

784
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,419
I'm just sad.

785
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,618
But I don't know why.

786
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:51,618
I don't know what to say.

787
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,538
I'll get you something
to make you forget.
