2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,868
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,653
Don't tell me my mom is also here.

4
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:33,852
Why would your mom go fishing?

5
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,252
She hates the sun.

6
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:38,813
You're heading to...?

7
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,893
Mr. Yao has helped us a lot.

8
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,052
I thought I might go fishing

9
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,653
with him

10
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,013
to show gratitude.

11
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:50,052
You're also going fishing?

12
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:51,293
That's great!

13
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,893
Mr. Yao took us in.

14
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,893
I've wanted to thank him
for a long time.

15
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:59,252
How about all three of us go fishing

16
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,293
with you today?

17
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:01,772
- No, no.
- Dad.

18
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,573
You don't have to do that.

19
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,813
Yes, I do. We must show gratitude.

20
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:06,573
Put it in the trunk.

21
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:07,093
Okay.

22
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:07,653
Here.

23
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:08,372
Let's go.

24
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,453
I'll drive.

25
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,733
Give me the key.

26
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,652
Mr. Yao, you've got a nice car.

27
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,932
A new car is always perfect, after all.

28
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,573
I can drive without concerns.

29
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,932
It's not like that old company car.

30
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,932
After two major repairments,

31
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:42,092
I'm driving it
with my heart in my mouth,

32
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,733
worried that it may go off.

33
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,573
Dad. Dad.

34
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,492
Focus on driving.

35
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,052
Mr. Yao, you like fishing too?

36
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:58,693
Tell me when you
want to go fishing again.

37
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,612
I'll join you on the weekend.

38
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:01,733
I like fishing too.

39
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:03,973
Okay.

40
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:08,492
Zhiming,

41
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,733
are you good at fishing?

42
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:13,052
Let's see who gets more fish later.

43
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:26,733
What's wrong?

44
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,492
Huan, why are you so quiet today?

45
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:32,453
What's it to you?

46
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:00,453
Mr. Mai,

47
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,893
could you ask around

48
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,893
and see if anyone

49
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,293
sells scissors nearby?
I forgot to bring mine.

50
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,212
Scissors?

51
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,013
I brought mine.

52
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,133
Here you are.

53
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,133
Thank you.

54
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,013
There are so many mosquitoes.

55
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,053
That's right.

56
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:38,933
Right?

57
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,852
Mr. Mai, could you fetch
the mosquito repellent

58
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,893
from the back seat of my car?

59
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,453
The back seat or the trunk?

60
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,412
- The trunk.
- Alright.

61
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,092
Dad, stay.

62
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:51,172
I have it here.

63
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:51,832
I brought it.

64
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:53,732
Here.

65
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:54,412
Look.

66
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,412
Chengzao is really thoughtful.

67
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,212
It's a good brand.

68
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,292
Dad, I think it's about time.

69
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,893
Why don't you get the charcoal ready

70
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:20,893
for the stove?

71
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,053
Already?

72
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:23,212
Are you hungry?

73
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,013
Yeah.

74
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:26,212
Alright, I'll go make a fire.

75
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:28,613
Zao, come and help.

76
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,493
Dad, I haven't caught a single fish yet.

77
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:31,573
Silly kid.

78
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:34,613
Zao.

79
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,532
I don't think you can catch a fish

80
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:37,412
anytime soon.

81
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,133
Help Dad with the charcoal.

82
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:41,013
I haven't caught any fish yet.

83
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,412
I must catch one today.

84
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,652
Zhiming will help you.

85
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,813
The fish he catches are his.

86
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,133
The ones I catch are mine.

87
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,053
Get going.

88
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,053
I won't go.

89
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:50,813
Get going.

90
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:51,613
I'm not going.

91
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,613
You really should go.

92
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,613
Right, I-I should go.

93
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:07,693
Anyway, I can't catch any.

94
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,373
Dad, let me help you.

95
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,172
Okay.

96
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,053
You are the one
who asked me out for fishing.

97
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,852
Your fishing strategy isn't working.

98
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,852
You can only
catch big fish if you concentrate.

99
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,772
How do you know I'm not concentrated?

100
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,613
I'm really curious.

101
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,732
Why do you guys like fishing so much?

102
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,373
Isn't it boring
to sit there all afternoon?

103
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,373
Not at all.

104
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,813
How can it be boring?

105
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,373
Fishing has many benefits.

106
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,933
Firstly, it cultivates your character

107
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,373
and makes you patient.

108
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,133
Secondly, you see...

109
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,292
- Dad.
- You get fresh air.

110
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,693
- Wait.
- The fire's gone out.

111
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,493
Okay.

112
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,133
You get fresh air,

113
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,133
which is good for your health.

114
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,652
And what's the best part?

115
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,212
It offers more protein.

116
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:14,332
You can grill

117
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:15,772
the fish you catch.

118
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,013
Dad, look at this.

119
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,412
You won't catch any big fish like this.

120
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,092
Let me show you.

121
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,212
A mistake. That doesn't count.

122
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:50,893
Something took the bait.

123
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,053
The wind is a bit strong today.

124
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:04,933
Unexpected, huh? This is the real deal.

125
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,373
I-I think I've got something.

126
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:26,693
Did I catch something? Did I?

127
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,133
- Did I?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:32,613
It's quite heavy.

129
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,733
- Lift it.
- Lift it. To the left.

130
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:36,772
To the right.

131
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:38,333
Up.

132
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,532
One, two...

133
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:44,213
Where's the fish?

134
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:03,572
The fish is ready.

135
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,373
Here we go.

136
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,292
Careful, it's burning, Dad.

137
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,213
Dig in, Mr. Mai.

138
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:22,093
Come on, dig in.

139
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,772
Mr. Yao, have a drink with me.

140
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,213
Dad, he can't drink.
He can't hold his liquor.

141
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,172
He'll pass out.

142
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:33,133
It's fine. Shanghainese
don't pressure others to drink.

143
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,253
Drink if you can. It's up to you.

144
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,772
Mr. Mai, I'll drink with you.

145
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,052
Cheers.

146
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,213
Mr. Yao, I'm so envious

147
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,172
of you single young folks.

148
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,772
It's like paradise to not have

149
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,412
your wife nagging you.

150
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:56,652
Such a nice barbecue.

151
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,013
Such a nice weekend.

152
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,772
It's a pity your mom didn't come.

153
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:05,893
Dad.

154
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:09,093
You just said that
it was paradise to be left alone.

155
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,052
I was trying to say

156
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:13,452
that I only need

157
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,973
very little free time.

158
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,613
What I really want to say is

159
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,093
that your mom

160
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,772
works the hardest in our family.

161
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,412
She is indispensable for

162
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,213
any of the household chores.

163
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,853
We can't make it without her.

164
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:29,932
Right?

165
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,052
We've been

166
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,052
going through some issues at home.

167
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:34,613
She's pressured

168
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,532
and not in a good mood.

169
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,452
I'm not forcing you to come home.

170
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,452
I'm only saying that

171
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,772
when you're done with your work,

172
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,292
you should come home

173
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:50,412
to have a meal with her

174
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,932
and talk to her.

175
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,692
You get it?

176
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,013
I know.

177
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:57,452
Don't worry, Dad.

178
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,093
Good, that's my girl.

179
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:01,213
Come on.

180
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,973
It's the weekend,

181
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,052
but nobody's home.

182
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,213
Only you keep me company.

183
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,412
Are you hungry?

184
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,213
Eat then.

185
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,867
Eat.

186
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:56,613
Mr. Yao.

187
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,013
Huan has

188
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,572
her mom's temper.

189
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,292
I'm just hoping that

190
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,733
she comes home soon.

191
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,093
Mr. Mai.

192
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,893
Give them some time.

193
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,893
They need a chance to take a step back.

194
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,333
- You're back.
- Yeah, they just need a chance.

195
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,133
You're back.

196
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,652
You went fishing together?

197
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,692
Did you catch any? Where's the fish?

198
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:24,973
We grilled them.

199
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:28,613
Mai Laitian.

200
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,893
You've been drinking?

201
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:34,213
H-He drove after drinking.
Are you out of your mind?

202
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,133
Mrs. Mai, we got a designated driver.
It was very safe.

203
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:38,853
It was safe.

204
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,052
What's your problem?

205
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,412
You're a driver. How can you drink?

206
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,172
This is against the law.

207
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,652
And what if you have an accident?

208
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:50,013
He will oppose Huan if he's upset.

209
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,853
And if Huan is upset,

210
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,093
she won't come home.

211
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,333
Will you be happy?

212
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,613
Huan will be back soon.

213
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:58,133
I'll sit with Mr. Yao for a while.

214
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:02,292
Go upstairs.

215
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,013
What are you doing?

216
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,652
Go to sleep.

217
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:36,729
(Lane 1100, Jianhua West Road)

218
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:42,333
Ming.

219
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,692
Wake up.

220
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:47,812
Ming, wake up.

221
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:48,893
Yu.

222
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:49,613
Ming.

223
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:50,292
Yu.

224
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:50,932
Are you there?

225
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:51,613
Ming...

226
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,652
Stop it. Let him sleep.

227
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,452
This isn't right.

228
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:56,412
Ming.

229
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,412
Are you there?

230
00:13:58,652 --> 00:13:59,812
Stop it.

231
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,613
No, we have to wake him up.

232
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,853
Huan says he often has headaches
and works overtime.

233
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,493
There are cases
of young people dropping dead.

234
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,532
We have to wake him up.

235
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,613
Don't talk nonsense.

236
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,373
Should we just break in?

237
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,853
You're strong. You do it.

238
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,733
I'm not breaking in.

239
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,772
You won't do it, huh?

240
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:16,812
Then I will.

241
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:17,812
No.

242
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,213
One, two, three.

243
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,733
Y-You're awake?

244
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,572
Why didn't you respond?

245
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:28,893
We were worried about you.

246
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,572
We thought you were out cold...

247
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,493
Enough.

248
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:33,893
Yu.

249
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,172
Say no more.

250
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:37,333
Mrs. Mai,
I didn't sleep well last night.

251
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,812
Let me sleep more.

252
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,412
Eat something first.

253
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,333
I made you some porridge. Have some.

254
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,973
No, thanks. Let me sleep.

255
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,412
You must eat breakfast.

256
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,613
Or you'll ruin your stomach.

257
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,613
Come downstairs.

258
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,253
Or I can bring it up.

259
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,133
I'll be right down.

260
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,452
Hurry up. Come down.

261
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:55,253
Hurry up.

262
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:01,253
Mr. Mai, the fish.

263
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,932
Let me.

264
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:04,692
Okay.

265
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,052
Good morning, Mr. Yao.

266
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:08,652
I'll get you some porridge.

267
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:09,292
Alright.

268
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:12,253
Mrs. Mai, I won't be back
for dinner tonight.

269
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,572
You don't need to bother.

270
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,532
Don't flatter yourself.

271
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,932
I made these for Huan.

272
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,052
Mr. Yao.

273
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,213
She prepares a feast every day,

274
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,973
waiting for our daughter.

275
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:26,373
I've told her so many times

276
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,692
that she can cook when Huan comes back.

277
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:29,692
Am I right?

278
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,333
She's bound to come home one day.

279
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,692
How do you know?

280
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,692
Maybe she will come home today.

281
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,013
Maybe she won't.

282
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,893
Maybe she won't come home
tomorrow, either.

283
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:46,052
Maybe she won't come back at all soon.

284
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,493
I'm her mother.

285
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,013
She will come back if I tell her to.

286
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:53,412
I don't believe that.

287
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:55,733
Let's make a bet.

288
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:00,493
Alright. What are we betting?

289
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,452
I'll take you to pick her up.

290
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:06,932
No problem. What's the big deal?

291
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,133
You think I'm scared?

292
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,052
Mr. Yao, have some breakfast.

293
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,613
Okay.

294
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:11,692
Thank you.

295
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:23,613
Mr. Mai, can't you go faster?

296
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:26,412
The food will be cold
by the time we arrive at Xing'anli.

297
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,213
Mrs. Mai, take it easy.

298
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,973
We're less than half an hour away.

299
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,292
As the old saying goes,

300
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,253
"All parents care about their children."

301
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,292
"But the children may not
care about their parents."

302
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,532
How well said.

303
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:47,973
Right, Yao?

304
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:54,253
Yao.

305
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,333
I'm talking to you.

306
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,812
Why are you ignoring me?

307
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,613
Listen.

308
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,213
It's impolite

309
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:03,972
to not text back,

310
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:05,533
not answer the phone,

311
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,813
or not open the door.

312
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:10,053
You must change those bad habits.

313
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,732
Yeah. I'll do better.

314
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,172
I'm not commanding respect.

315
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,972
I just want to

316
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:21,893
tell you what I've learned in life

317
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,252
to help you.

318
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,853
Actually, Mr. Mai

319
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,613
knows me well.

320
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:30,012
I have quite a few problems.

321
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,893
I care a lot about vanity.

322
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:34,613
I often lose my head
when it comes to serious issues

323
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,412
and do harm with good intentions.

324
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,573
So,

325
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,293
Huan must be avoiding me because

326
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,573
she's annoyed with me.

327
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:44,853
No way.

328
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,412
She doesn't want to talk to me at all.

329
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,172
Mrs. Mai, it's not like that.

330
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:52,893
It's not?

331
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:55,333
You don't know Chenghuan.

332
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,773
She's my daughter.

333
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,692
I know her the best.

334
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:09,053
Why do I suddenly have a headache?

335
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:10,773
Mr. Mai.

336
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:13,613
Park somewhere.
I'll get some medicine at a pharmacy.

337
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,452
I have a headache.

338
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,133
I'll get off

339
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,053
and get some painkillers
at a nearby pharmacy.

340
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,492
What a coincidence.

341
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:24,492
I happen to have painkillers.

342
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:29,932
I can't take other brands.

343
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,813
I'm used to certain brands.

344
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,932
You're just scared, aren't you?

345
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:39,172
Mr. Yao, you don't know my wife.

346
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:43,012
Her word is her bond.

347
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,692
She promised to see
our daughter today. So she will go.

348
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:46,613
Is that so?

349
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,732
What are you talking about?

350
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:50,172
I'm scared to go?

351
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,613
Am I that kind of person?

352
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:53,813
Fine, I can

353
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,452
put up with the headache.

354
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:57,212
Let's go.

355
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:58,853
Okay, let's wait and see.

356
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,172
Mr. Mai, once you

357
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,012
drop me off,

358
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,212
make sure to get Mrs. Mai there.

359
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:04,053
Rest assured.

360
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,492
Let's go.

361
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,912
(Modern Chinese-style wedding room)

362
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,533
I think

363
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,932
we should revise this version.

364
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,252
The old Shanghai style

365
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:29,133
can also be fashionable.

366
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,813
(Modern Chinese-style wedding room)
This version is...

367
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:33,333
And we're promoting
the receiving ceremony

368
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,613
of the bride.

369
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,652
The entire building is meant for that.

370
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,732
We must be more meticulous

371
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,732
to establish a good reputation.

372
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:42,172
So I can't approve of

373
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:43,533
this version.

374
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:45,133
Please take a look at it.

375
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,133
Okay, Miss Mai.

376
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,293
I'll work on it.

377
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:47,853
Thank you.

378
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:51,893
Mr. Cui.

379
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:52,932
Chenghuan.

380
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:53,373
Mr. Cui.

381
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:55,652
The wedding on the weekend
went very well.

382
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,613
Some wedding companies in Shanghai

383
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,333
are approaching us.

384
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,773
And I've received quite a few

385
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:02,573
inquiry calls from the youngsters.

386
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:03,932
Okay then, Mr. Cui.

387
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:05,452
Make some arrangements.

388
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,613
I will personally handle all receptions.

389
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:08,813
Okay.

390
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,932
Here are the butterfly pastries
you asked for.

391
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,053
Thank you so much.

392
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:14,573
It's so popular that

393
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:15,573
I can't get it

394
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:16,573
on my own.

395
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,012
I had to use a privilege.

396
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,172
Don't mention it.

397
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,452
It's for gifting, right?

398
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,373
Yeah.

399
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:22,773
I'll get back to work.

400
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:23,652
Go ahead.

401
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,816
(Butterfly Pastries)

402
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:33,373
Let's forget it.

403
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,533
What if Huan finds it annoying...

404
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:37,732
But we're already here.

405
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:39,533
Let's go.

406
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,293
We'll arrive soon.

407
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,133
Mao, I'm not up for it today.

408
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:48,613
I'm planning

409
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:49,972
to see my mom today.

410
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,293
Let's do it another day.

411
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,932
Hello, beauty.

412
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,492
Hello, sir, what can I do for you?

413
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,452
May I add you on WeChat
and get to know you?

414
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,012
Sir, you're drunk.

415
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:12,212
I'll have the staff call a cab for you.

416
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:13,533
- Call a cab for him.
- Okay.

417
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,652
You also work here?

418
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:17,613
You know what?

419
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,773
The alcohol here is top-notch.

420
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,813
So you waitresses

421
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:23,333
must keep up with the service.

422
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,692
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

423
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:26,692
- Sir...
- Serve me.

424
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:27,333
I'll call a cab.

425
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,813
I'll call a cab for you. This way.

426
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,293
- What for?
- Let me help.

427
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:32,053
Why would I need that?

428
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:34,893
I ordered a lot of drinks
to treat guests.

429
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,613
Why can't I ask a beauty
to drink with me?

430
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:38,613
You're drunk.

431
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,533
Drink with me, okay?

432
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,333
- Sir.
- Let's go, beauty.

433
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,452
Sir, you're drunk.

434
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:43,172
No way.

435
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,853
Sir, there are cameras here.

436
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,652
Please show respect, okay?

437
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:47,172
Sir.

438
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,452
Yeah, hold him. Okay?

439
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:49,373
I'll protect you.

440
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:50,773
I'm telling you. I can protect you.

441
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,053
Sir, please let go.

442
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,172
I'll file a complaint
against you for this.

443
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,533
You've drunk too much, sir.

444
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,732
Come on, please let go.

445
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,412
I'm going to file a complaint.

446
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,452
You disrespect your customers.

447
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:02,692
No, sir.

448
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:03,893
Listen.

449
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,172
Sir, please let go.

450
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,813
- Let's drink.
- Let go.

451
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,053
You thug!

452
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,573
- Who is this?
- You...

453
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:11,333
You dare to bully my daughter?

454
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,692
You have a death wish?

455
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,133
Yu...

456
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,212
Mom!

457
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:39,732
Mom.

458
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:40,773
Here.

459
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,093
Thank you.

460
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,053
I thought we could leave

461
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,573
after giving the statement.

462
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:48,732
Mom.

463
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:51,133
Tell the police everything you know.

464
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,452
I'll handle the rest.

465
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,373
Don't be afraid. I'm with you.

466
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,613
Madam, please tell us everything.

467
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,133
Sir, here's the thing.

468
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,652
I went to the hotel
to see my daughter today.

469
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,293
And I saw a drunk man

470
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:10,773
harassing her.

471
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:12,133
I saw him...

472
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:13,732
So you hit him?

473
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,853
I saw him doing that, you know?

474
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,972
I-I had to step in.

475
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:20,893
Mom.

476
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:22,053
The surveillance shows

477
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,893
that you hit him with something.

478
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:25,732
Please tell us what you used.

479
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:28,492
This. I lost it and just...

480
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,732
Mom, put it back on.

481
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:32,972
Sorry.

482
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:34,412
Sorry.

483
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:36,813
Remember?

484
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:39,773
You bought these for me last year.

485
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:44,853
Why didn't you call us for help?

486
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,492
Why didn't you call the police?

487
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:48,492
I didn't have time.

488
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:50,972
It might sound like
I had time, but I didn't.

489
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,692
Someone was bullying my daughter.

490
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:54,412
She's the boss of Xing'anli.

491
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:55,813
She must remain composed.

492
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,452
So I had to take action.

493
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,053
If we waited for you,

494
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:00,492
what if she got hurt?

495
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:01,573
I wouldn't wait.

496
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,053
Madam, please calm down.

497
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,932
Once we get the injury report,

498
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,412
we will know
if it's a civil or criminal case.

499
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:10,692
Criminal case?

500
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:14,613
Isn't it like a serious crime?

501
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:16,573
I'm going to prison?

502
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,293
But...

503
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:22,492
But it was him

504
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,252
who bullied you first.

505
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:31,333
I...

506
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:34,133
But...

507
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:39,133
It's okay, Mom.

508
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:40,813
It's fine.

509
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,012
Mom.

510
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,373
Thank you.

511
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:55,613
Thank you.

512
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:15,452
Mr. Mai.

513
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,492
Mr. Yao.

514
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,012
Do you think

515
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,613
they will be in trouble?

516
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:24,932
Don't worry.
It's the guy's fault. I'll handle it.

517
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,732
Sit over there. I'll take a statement.

518
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:30,293
- Alright.
- That's him.

519
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,412
Where is the old woman?
Look what she did to me.

520
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,533
I'm bleeding and bruised.
I'm going to sue her.

521
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,412
Hello, may I have a word with you?

522
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:40,573
What do you mean?

523
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:41,893
Come here.

524
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:42,853
Wait, who are you?

525
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:45,293
What is it?

526
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,692
Officer.

527
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:06,293
Look, here's the thing.

528
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:08,893
You see, I'm not seriously injured.

529
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,333
It's not a big deal.

530
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:13,053
It was just a misunderstanding.

531
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,093
We might as well let it go.

532
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:16,452
That won't do.

533
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,813
We'll cover the medical bill.

534
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,053
It's okay. It's nothing.

535
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:24,293
Then let's confirm the statements.

536
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,853
Come on, you too.

537
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:26,492
Okay.

538
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:33,893
Mom, wait for me.

539
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,212
Have a seat.

540
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,412
I'm here.

541
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,293
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

542
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:47,373
I heard you threw a slipper at someone.

543
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,293
It was a leather shoe.

544
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,732
Anyway, it was a shoe.

545
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,492
I didn't expect you
to be a martial artist.

546
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:55,492
I'm impressed.

547
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,813
Martial artist?

548
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:57,732
I don't get it.

549
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,452
Mr. Yao is quite thoughtful.

550
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,893
He told me to buy a pair of shoes

551
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:03,333
as a backup just in case.

552
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:04,853
I...

553
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:06,373
Shoes...

554
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:07,773
She has her shoes.

555
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,893
Maybe Mr. Yao thought that

556
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:14,692
you threw your shoes at someone
and lost them somewhere.

557
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:16,692
So he asked me to buy a pair of shoes.

558
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:17,932
I didn't.

559
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,293
Thank you.

560
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,172
You're welcome.

561
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:24,333
He's quite nice.

562
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:31,053
Dad, Mom, it's alright. Let's go.

563
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:34,252
Let's go.

564
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:37,533
Thank you so much.

565
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:38,692
It's nothing.

566
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:43,133
Take them home first.

567
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:46,492
See you around.

568
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:47,172
Alright.

569
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,452
I'll get the car.

570
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,492
Be more careful from now on.

571
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:00,492
Why?

572
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:03,732
Chinese Kung Fu.

573
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,533
It runs in the blood.

574
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:08,412
Annoying.

575
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:11,252
You've been so busy helping them.

576
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,533
But Chenghuan may not even accept it.

577
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:17,373
Doesn't matter.

578
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,732
Only work is all about

579
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:21,093
seeking a return.

580
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:26,452
Huan, I'm sorry.

581
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:29,172
I caused trouble for you again.

582
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:31,492
Mom.

583
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,492
Let's go home.

584
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:42,813
I said,

585
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:45,492
"Let's go home."

586
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:47,652
I'm coming home

587
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,053
with Zao.

588
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,732
Let's go home.

589
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,492
Buy Ms. Liu

590
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,732
a pair of shoes with rivets.

591
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,732
That's why you're the boss.

592
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,533
Your wrist is swollen.

593
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,053
It's not swelling. I've gained weight.

594
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,252
Why do you have to apply this?

595
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:34,692
Let me tell you.

596
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:36,373
That guy got away fast enough.

597
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,053
Otherwise, I would have...

598
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:39,613
What's wrong?

599
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,012
knocked him over.

600
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:41,893
Where does it hurt?

601
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,053
Slow down.

602
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:49,732
It's fine.

603
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,853
You must be hungry. Let me cook for you.

604
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:53,853
I'm not hungry.

605
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:55,093
You must be hungry.

606
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,293
See?

607
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:58,692
I told you to stay put.

608
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,412
Your back hurts, huh? Sit down.

609
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:03,412
My back is fine.
A bit of stretching will do.

610
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:05,133
Don't forget that

611
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,813
I'm the central dancer
in the square dancing.

612
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:09,293
Yeah.

613
00:30:09,972 --> 00:30:11,212
You're the best.

614
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,012
Let me change the bed sheet for you.

615
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:16,452
It's covered in dust now.

616
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,212
Mom.

617
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:21,133
Can you just sit down and rest?

618
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:22,573
Stay put.

619
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:27,813
Huan.

620
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:31,093
I was quite upset

621
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:34,212
to see you like that today.

622
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,373
Doing business is not easy.

623
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:40,293
That guy was bullying you.

624
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,893
But you had to deal with him
patiently and politely.

625
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:46,972
How would I know

626
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,053
your suffering if I hadn't been there?

627
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:52,972
You must find

628
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,893
someone strong to be your husband.

629
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,492
Get a martial artist?

630
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,692
But it won't work

631
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,373
if you don't share common interests.

632
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,293
But again, it won't work

633
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:08,172
- if he's all frail and feeble.
- Mom.

634
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:10,732
You've had a long day.

635
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:12,692
Get some rest.

636
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,492
You can hardly keep your eyes open.

637
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:15,893
We'll talk tomorrow.

638
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:20,692
Alright, go wash up and sleep.

639
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,133
Got it. You too.

640
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:27,893
Huan.

641
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:32,813
You're not leaving, are you?

642
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:37,133
I promised I would come back.

643
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:38,773
Now that I'm back,

644
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:40,533
I won't leave again.

645
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:45,412
Rest early.

646
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,333
There's food in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

647
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,333
Okay.

648
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,016
I didn't even figure out
what was going on

649
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,352
and your auntie already
hit the guy with her shoe.

650
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,412
It swelled up immediately.

651
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:08,412
That guy started running
and crawling in the garden.

652
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:10,252
We were chasing him.

653
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:13,172
If I were there,
I would have hit him too.

654
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:14,813
Stay out of it.

655
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,373
Why? Do you want to be
the second Liu Wanyu?

656
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,333
Did she go to sleep?

657
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,452
She could hardly stay awake

658
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:24,732
and she wanted to talk.

659
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:25,692
Huan.

660
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:28,773
Your room is just across from ours.

661
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:30,972
Your mom was cleaning it

662
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,492
every other day

663
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,133
when you were away.

664
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:35,333
Go have a look.

665
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,613
Let me know if you need anything.

666
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:38,692
Got it, Dad.

667
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,688
I guess my mom was frightened.

668
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:42,972
Go up and keep her company.

669
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:46,333
Actually, your mom is a paper tiger.

670
00:32:46,972 --> 00:32:49,133
She got nervous at the police station.

671
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:51,212
That's because you spoil her.

672
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:54,931
Dad, I haven't been home for a while.

673
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:56,332
You've worked hard.

674
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:59,732
What's going on? Being polite with me?

675
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,891
Alright, I'll check on her.

676
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:04,211
You can talk.

677
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,732
Okay, goodnight.

678
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:06,611
Goodnight.

679
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,672
Goodnight.

680
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,012
It's been a long day. Drink something.

681
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:16,492
Where's mine?

682
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,092
There's only one left.

683
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,532
Come on, have it.

684
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,532
- Here.
- I don't want it.

685
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:25,572
My brother got it for you. You have it.

686
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:32,332
Oh, right.

687
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,972
Go back to the dorm
and pack up your things.

688
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:36,732
Come and stay at home with me.

689
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,451
I...

690
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:47,572
It's getting late. I should head back.

691
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,572
I'll leave you to talk.

692
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,492
It's family time.

693
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,411
- I'm off.
- Let me walk you out.

694
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,131
No, I'll go back by myself.

695
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,492
- Bye.
- I'll walk her out.

696
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:58,572
Okay, then...

697
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,812
Take your time.

698
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,412
Why are you scared?

699
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:13,691
We should be careful.

700
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:16,691
I think my mom

701
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,331
had a bit of a scare.

702
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:21,892
My sister and I will
move back home for a while.

703
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:23,331
So

704
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:25,691
I may not be able to

705
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:28,092
accompany you after work.

706
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,412
You want to keep me company?

707
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:31,811
What? Are you clinging to me?

708
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:33,731
Your sister is busy.

709
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:35,932
Shouldn't you keep your mom company?

710
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,331
We'll have plenty of time to meet.

711
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:42,731
Alright then.

712
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,532
I got it wrong.

713
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,771
I thought you might be upset.

714
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,731
But...

715
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,771
What are you

716
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:57,972
going to say if your sister asks

717
00:34:58,412 --> 00:34:59,492
about us?

718
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:00,771
I'll tell the truth.

719
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:02,171
Tell the truth?

720
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:09,012
I'm so much older than you,

721
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:10,811
and I'm your sister's bestie.

722
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,131
Now I'm divorced with a child.

723
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,892
We'd better take it slow.

724
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:20,331
I really don't want to

725
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,572
upset your mom at this point.

726
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:24,771
Mao.

727
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:27,492
I don't think any of those is a problem.

728
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,131
I'm young and I don't have a stable job.

729
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,211
Would you be embarrassed

730
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,331
to present me to your friends?

731
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:36,171
You are way too outstanding.

732
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:37,651
You'd dazzle everyone

733
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:39,932
if I introduced you to them.

734
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:41,532
What if they snatch you away?

735
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:42,331
Really?

736
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:43,691
Just kidding.

737
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:51,731
Let's go.

738
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,144
I was teasing you.

739
00:35:58,811 --> 00:35:59,611
Let's go.

740
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:17,691
Yu.

741
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:21,092
Go to sleep.

742
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,291
I need to check on her.

743
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:29,492
Where are you going?

744
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:34,211
I'm worried that the pillow
might not be comfortable for her.

745
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:37,131
Didn't we get that from the old house?

746
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:40,171
She's been sleeping on it.
Why would it be uncomfortable?

747
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:50,171
No, I have to check on her.

748
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,771
What if she's not used to something

749
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:55,131
and decides to leave again?

750
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,012
Yu, listen to me.

751
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:01,171
Our daughter has come back for real.

752
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,932
She won't leave again.

753
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:04,211
Rest assured.

754
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:07,731
If you're worried,

755
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:09,251
get up early tomorrow

756
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,532
and check on her.

757
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,131
Stop being paranoid.

758
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:14,731
I'm going to sleep.

759
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:40,171
Come in.

760
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:45,171
Shouldn't we celebrate
your first day back home?

761
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:53,211
Thanks.

762
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,331
Tell me.

763
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,892
How did you
convince that guy to back off?

764
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,532
I found his workplace
and got his wife's phone number.

765
00:39:08,852 --> 00:39:09,972
So I told him

766
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,611
that if he didn't settle,

767
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:14,211
I'd sue him for harassing an old lady.

768
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,532
Only you can come up with this.

769
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:20,771
When it comes to such matters,

770
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:23,372
the wife is always
the key to the solution.

771
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:27,412
You're really something.

772
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:32,731
Chenghuan,

773
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,412
I want to apologize.

774
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,211
Apologize? Why?

775
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,131
Actually, I pushed Mrs. Mai

776
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:44,932
to go to Xing'anli.

777
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,171
If that's the case,

778
00:39:58,651 --> 00:39:59,771
I should thank you.

779
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,532
Through this incident,

780
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:06,331
I realized that my mom
needed me more than I thought.

781
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:09,211
So,

782
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,331
I want to thank you.

783
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:12,892
I owe you one again.

784
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:21,731
It's even livelier with you back.

785
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:23,291
It's quite nice.

786
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:26,331
Don't you find it noisy?

787
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:27,331
I do.

788
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:32,092
But compared to my dull life,

789
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:35,572
it's quite interesting.

790
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,651
And

791
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,892
I owed you quite a lot before.

792
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,012
You owe me one.

793
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:46,731
I owe you one.

794
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:48,972
It makes us inseparable.

795
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:17,251
Sorry.

796
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:18,852
Hello?

797
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,892
Hello, this is
the airport police station.

798
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,972
Are you Ms. Zhang Ziyu's guardian,

799
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:24,092
Mr. Yao Zhiming?

800
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,852
Yes, it's me. What's the matter?

801
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,691
Ms. Zhang Ziyu was scammed

802
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:30,012
by a fraud who claimed

803
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:31,651
to have lost his wallet.

804
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:33,492
She has gotten her money back.

805
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,532
Why would you

806
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:36,291
do something so dishonorable?

807
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,052
Keep it down.

808
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,611
Okay, I'll be right there.

809
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:43,052
Is it fine? I heard something about

810
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,052
"police station" and "guardian".

811
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,731
Huan, I'll explain everything later.

812
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:52,412
Be careful.

813
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:53,131
