3
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,133
Even if you become a mom,

4
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,613
you're still my sweetie.

5
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,133
I can help you take care of your baby.

6
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:41,092
Mom.

7
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,493
You're getting ahead of yourself.

8
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,693
Besides, I don't wanna bother you.

9
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,773
Did Jialiang tell you

10
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,172
when we're meeting his parents?

11
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,493
He will let me know.

12
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:55,172
Okay.

13
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,372
Once we meet,

14
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,333
I'll have a good talk

15
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,413
with them

16
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:02,092
about your wedding.

17
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:03,292
We'll discuss

18
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:04,933
how to plan it.

19
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,693
Okay, as you wish.

20
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:12,852
Take your time.

21
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,773
Looks like you have a terrible day.

22
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,173
You don't even have enough to eat.

23
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:22,773
Yeah.

24
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:24,652
I have proposed.

25
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:25,972
- What?
- You proposed.

26
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:26,972
You proposed?

27
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:30,453
Have you made up your mind?

28
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,733
Yeah, I have.

29
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:33,132
Mom.

30
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:34,692
You discuss

31
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,613
with my dad

32
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,652
and have a meal with Huan's family.

33
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,572
Right, there's one more important thing.

34
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:44,652
From now on,

35
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,773
no matter who

36
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,372
my dad's business partners are,

37
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,733
I won't have meals
with their daughters anymore.

38
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,493
It will never happen again.

39
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,132
I was trying

40
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,053
to give you more options.

41
00:02:58,213 --> 00:02:59,213
Don't bother.

42
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,053
I've already made my choice.

43
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:03,733
I know who's good to me.

44
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,132
So,

45
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,412
I'll trouble you to arrange it.

46
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,453
Thank you, Mom.

47
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:12,013
Where are you off to?

48
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:14,412
Off to date.

49
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:17,652
Unbelievable.

50
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,213
Mom.

51
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:22,532
What's the story with that girl?

52
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,733
Jialiang is so crazy about her.

53
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:25,572
Who knows?

54
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,132
If Jialiang really wants to marry her,

55
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,532
I think both families

56
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,412
should meet up sooner rather than later.

57
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:34,572
So you agree?

58
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,412
Look at me.

59
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,013
I got married without even a proposal

60
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,053
or enough dowry.

61
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,733
I don't have sufficient respect
in the Luo family,

62
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,132
but I have to marry into his family.
You know why?

63
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,852
I try to help our family
climb up the social ladder.

64
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:51,013
Dad and you established Deshan together

65
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:53,213
and worked so hard to develop it

66
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,412
from a small workshop

67
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,213
to a big business.

68
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,173
Can we just share the fruit
with the Mai family

69
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,733
that is waiting for a windfall?

70
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,132
There's nothing I can do.

71
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,852
Look at your brother.

72
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,213
He can't see anyone

73
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,333
but his girlfriend.

74
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,852
What can I do?

75
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,412
I've thought it through.

76
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,212
As long as my son is happy

77
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,332
and she tries to be a good wife,

78
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,572
they can get married.

79
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:27,212
We book an expensive restaurant.
The more expensive, the better.

80
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:30,293
We must have his girlfriend know

81
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,613
that it's her great honor

82
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,653
to marry

83
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,733
into our family.

84
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,293
And she better behave well.

85
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,132
Come in.

86
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:07,613
Mr. Yao, this is the report
about the event on the day of 520.

87
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,772
I don't need it.
You did a good job, anyway.

88
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,812
Mr. Yao, I'm sorry

89
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,572
about yesterday's event.

90
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,012
I caused trouble.

91
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:20,853
Mai Chenghuan.

92
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:23,973
Why are you always apologizing?

93
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,572
That is a good proposal.

94
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:27,733
It got a lot of buzz online.

95
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,053
For the brand,

96
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:30,372
it created a positive value.

97
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:31,812
It's wise

98
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,332
to use your connections.

99
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,413
But,

100
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:39,892
that wasn't my plan.

101
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,053
I only value the results.

102
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,012
As for the process,

103
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:43,973
I don't care.

104
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,812
Anyway, the outcome is good.

105
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,132
Beautiful ring. Congratulations.

106
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,173
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

107
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:55,012
By the way,

108
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,012
I baked some pastries for you

109
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:58,452
and they are not costly.

110
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,332
I want to thank you

111
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,772
for your encouragement and tolerance.

112
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,973
I hope it brings you happiness.

113
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:07,413
Thank you.

114
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,413
I won't disturb you. I have to go.

115
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,853
Since when do you like desserts?

116
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,212
You don't understand.

117
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,413
Mr. Mai's granddaughter

118
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,372
is a clever girl.

119
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,413
I like her very much.

120
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,812
I'll invite her over for tea.

121
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:39,372
Her name is Mai Chenghuan.

122
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,933
When I mentioned Xing'anli,

123
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,613
Grandma would talk about Mai Chenghuan.

124
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,332
It seems

125
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,772
Mai Chenghuan is the key
to securing Xing'anli.

126
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:53,293
So,

127
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,772
whatever Grandma likes now,

128
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,252
I like it too.

129
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:02,933
You just like what your grandma likes.

130
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,744
(He Jing Nursing Home)

131
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,212
Grandma.

132
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,772
I had the most famous tailor in Shanghai

133
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,053
alter this dress.

134
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,012
Take a look.

135
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,413
And these health supplements.

136
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,413
Remember to take them regularly.

137
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,012
The usage and dosage have been written
on the label.

138
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,733
I have my own tailor

139
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,733
in Shanghai.

140
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,533
I don't lack anything here.

141
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,933
You've just returned from abroad.
Work should come first.

142
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,452
Don't worry about me.

143
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,053
You do your things.

144
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:48,293
Alright.

145
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:54,252
Grandma, I bet

146
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:55,973
you like these pastries.

147
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,413
Chenghuan made them, right?

148
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,772
Grandma, you have sharp eyes.

149
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,053
You are really cunning.

150
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,252
My granddaughter

151
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,493
is a sincere person.

152
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,452
Don't boss her around.

153
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,413
No, I don't.

154
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:15,533
Grandma.

155
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,572
I've kept in mind

156
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,212
what you told me last time.

157
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:20,772
I've been paying attention to her
at work.

158
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,613
She's hardworking

159
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,613
and we work well together.

160
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,173
You rarely compliment people like that.

161
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,012
I am being objective.

162
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,013
But she has a strong personality.

163
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:34,773
She relies on herself for everything.

164
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:36,212
So,

165
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,533
I don't even dare to talk to her

166
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,013
about my relations with you.

167
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,332
I'm afraid

168
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,373
she will feel awkward and uncomfortable.

169
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:46,212
You're a sensible child.

170
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,133
Grandma.

171
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,612
I'll open it for you.

172
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:55,413
You have a try.

173
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,413
Okay.

174
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,332
Tasty.

175
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,192
(Baby Liang)

176
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,612
Honey, my mom has booked a restaurant.

177
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,212
Our families will have a meal together.

178
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,612
I'll send you the time
and the restaurant's address.

179
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,732
(Okay, I'll let my parents know.)

180
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:40,653
(The Mai family)

181
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:41,732
(Dad, Mom, and Zao.)

182
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,773
(We'll have a meal
with Jialiang's parents)

183
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:44,852
(at this time and place.)

184
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:52,933
(You all check it out.)

185
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:54,653
(It costs over a thousand per person.)

186
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,472
(One meal for both families)

187
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,893
(will cost over ten thousand yuan.)

188
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,492
(It's a big day.)

189
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:01,253
(We must behave properly.)

190
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:04,092
(Mom, it's just a meal.)

191
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,373
(Chengzao.)

192
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:17,852
(Sanheli)
(A student of mine will meet me this weekend.)

193
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,082
(Professor Cheng)
(After graduation,)

194
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:20,568
(Professor Cheng)
(he studied abroad for two years.)

195
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:22,520
(Upon returning,
he joined a renowned law firm.)

196
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,492
(I've heard the law firm is recruiting.)

197
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,173
(I'll introduce you to him.)

198
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,452
Dad, what is Mom doing?

199
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:41,452
Where are they?

200
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:44,212
We'll meet Jialiang's parents,

201
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,452
so she's looking for clothes for that.

202
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,452
It's just a meal.

203
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,053
Don't you know your mom?

204
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,572
Keeping up appearances at all costs.

205
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,133
I'll go and talk to her.

206
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,612
Mom, stop it.

207
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,612
It's just a meal.

208
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,373
No need to dress up.

209
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,572
No way. We must take it seriously.

210
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,092
They have arranged it all for us.

211
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,452
We have to dress up

212
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,533
and behave properly.

213
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:14,933
I'm looking for the fabric

214
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,612
I bought

215
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,852
for your dad a few years ago.

216
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,972
It can be made into a nice suit.

217
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,013
Chengzao has grown taller.

218
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:25,653
I need to get him a new suit.

219
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,013
Mom.

220
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,612
Haven't you always wanted
to buy a cheongsam?

221
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,732
You wanted to show off
in your dance group.

222
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,933
Why don't you buy it?

223
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,332
You can wear it for meeting them

224
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,533
and for dancing later on.

225
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,732
It's really worth it.

226
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,212
I don't have to. I've already found one.

227
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:44,492
I have a nice dress
bought a few years ago.

228
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:45,773
I've barely worn it.

229
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,373
It's out of fashion.

230
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,013
I'll buy you a fashionable one.

231
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,612
I don't need something fashionable
at my age.

232
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,173
Save your money.

233
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,173
Come on.

234
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,173
I planned an event for the hotel

235
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,452
and received a bonus.

236
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:58,852
Just accept my gift.

237
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,812
Let me buy it for you.

238
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:05,253
Did you hear that?

239
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:07,013
I have a good daughter.

240
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,013
So,

241
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,332
since we have such a good daughter,

242
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,413
why are you in a rush to marry her off?

243
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,933
I don't know what you're thinking.

244
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:14,572
Stop nagging.

245
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,332
Remember to wash and do your hair.

246
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:18,572
Got it.

247
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,773
Come and help carry the box.

248
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,013
I'm watching the game.

249
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,612
Come on.

250
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:24,373
Alright.

251
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,212
Listen.

252
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,612
Tomorrow, you borrow a car

253
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:32,852
from Mr. Yao.

254
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:33,933
Borrow a car?

255
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:38,413
I'm his new driver and not familiar

256
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,572
with him.

257
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,373
I'm too embarrassed to do that.

258
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,812
Just give it a try.

259
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,933
We use a car to keep up appearance.

260
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,773
I have an idea.

261
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,773
You ask Zhang Peisheng for help.

262
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,773
You've been her driver for many years

263
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:53,692
and worked so hard.

264
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:54,972
She will agree.

265
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,893
Okay, I'll try.

266
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,212
You must do your best.

267
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,612
You have to make it. It's important.

268
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,773
You can't let me down.

269
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:02,893
Okay. I...

270
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,852
You put them away for me.

271
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,293
I need to check that box above.

272
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,013
I...

273
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:07,812
Zao.

274
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,572
Listen.

275
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,572
This weekend, we're going to have dinner
with Jialiang's family.

276
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,373
Make sure to free up some time.

277
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,413
Mom.

278
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:19,933
You should ask him
if he is free that day.

279
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:21,013
How could he not have time?

280
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,133
You must have time.

281
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,053
Anyway, you must free up some time.

282
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,133
Your sister's marriage is a big deal.

283
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,972
Don't forget.

284
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,053
Be quick. Let me do it.

285
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,013
You take down the box for me.

286
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:36,732
Zao.

287
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,133
If you're busy that day,
you go ahead with your stuff.

288
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,173
It's okay. I'll be there.

289
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,212
(I'm sorry, Professor Cheng.)

290
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,173
(I have family matters this weekend.)

291
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,332
(I may not be able to make it.)

292
00:13:58,933 --> 00:13:59,732
(Thank you.)

293
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:20,212
How come you're so easily moved?

294
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,812
The thing from before
hasn't been settled yet.

295
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,773
You agreed
just because of a diamond ring?

296
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:26,253
The point is

297
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,413
that Jialiang looked quite sincere.

298
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,972
And we've been together for many years.

299
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:33,413
It hasn't been easy to come this far.

300
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,373
I think you've been suffering.

301
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:38,612
Give me your bag.

302
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:39,933
Why?

303
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:40,812
Let me have a look.

304
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:51,612
You have a portable charger

305
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,413
because he always forgets
to charge his phone.

306
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:56,413
You have a stain remover pen

307
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,373
because he always gets food
on his clothes when he eats.

308
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,653
You have a bluetooth headset
because he loves playing games.

309
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,092
And this notebook.

310
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,293
You write down everything

311
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:10,653
he can't remember.

312
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,572
Does he treat you like an assistant?

313
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,413
Mai Chenghuan.

314
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,332
It's like you're raising a son.

315
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,013
Does he know what you do for him?

316
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:19,933
I'm not asking for anything
in return from him.

317
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:23,253
If you're always calculating gains
and losses in love,

318
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,852
what's the point of being in love?

319
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:29,173
Besides, I've thought it through.

320
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:30,373
What I've considered is

321
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:33,533
that we will have children and raise

322
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,612
and educate them.

323
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,773
I feel secure to marry

324
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,572
into a wealthy family,

325
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:42,013
but I'm not coveting Jialiang's money.

326
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,173
I just think

327
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:47,173
that material foundation is important.

328
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,332
Right.

329
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:51,173
I know you're asking for nothing
from him.

330
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:54,053
I've been there,
so let me tell you something.

331
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:57,653
If you're not marrying

332
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,212
with 100 percent love,

333
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:00,653
you'd better not get married.

334
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:04,173
You two are not
from the same background.

335
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,812
If you live together

336
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,053
and you have to keep tolerating him,

337
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,373
you'll lose yourself in the end.

338
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:12,933
I got it.

339
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,972
I'm naturally positive,

340
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,612
but not pompous.

341
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:18,373
Even if a family

342
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,933
with blood ties can't avoid arguing.

343
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,533
So when it comes to marriage,

344
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,253
I have my expectations.

345
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,572
Besides,

346
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,373
It's my life.

347
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,533
We just need to work hard
to make it work.

348
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,972
Oh, my.

349
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,212
You're doomed.

350
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:36,212
Please help me.

351
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,413
You can't stand by.

352
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,173
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:40,293
Tomorrow, you accompany me

354
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,332
to select clothes for my mom.

355
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,653
You have good taste.

356
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,212
Please accompany me.

357
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,852
My mom is driving me crazy.

358
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,212
Alright.

359
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:57,173
After all, you got me a gift.

360
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:58,572
Alright, I'll go with you.

361
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,053
Mr. Mai.

362
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,333
Have you caused any trouble for Mr. Yao?

363
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,933
I heard you had him take the subway.

364
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,452
- I...
- Mr. Mai is reliable in his work.

365
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,333
I took the subway
because of traffic congestion.

366
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,052
I was in a hurry to meet Mr. Li
of Tianhe Home Furnishing.

367
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:18,052
Tianhe Home Furnishing?

368
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:21,573
You're using it
as a target substitute, aren't you?

369
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:25,133
(Yu)
You are focusing on the major suppliers

370
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,573
and having a change of minor suppliers.

371
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,853
You act really fast.

372
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,012
I have to take the initiative.

373
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:31,933
The faster, the better.

374
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,972
Mai Laitian, have you borrowed the car?

375
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,373
Don't forget our meeting
with the in-laws.

376
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,212
I'm driving. I'll call you back later.

377
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,012
Zhang Peisheng refused to lend it?

378
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:47,012
You helped her when she got robbed.

379
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:50,813
Ms. Zhang.

380
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,413
I'm really sorry.

381
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,893
Time flies too fast.

382
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,413
Chenghuan is getting married.

383
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:58,813
Congratulations, Mr. Mai!

384
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:00,252
Thank you.

385
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:02,488
The day after tomorrow,

386
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,173
I'll have a meal with in-laws.

387
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:08,413
Chenghuan's boyfriend is
from a wealthy family.

388
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,573
He's kind of out of Chenghuan's league.

389
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,333
So, Yu wants

390
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,333
to keep up appearance

391
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,252
and ask me to borrow your car.

392
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,653
Actually, I think it's not necessary.

393
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,012
Besides,

394
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,413
you have helped me a lot.

395
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:29,252
Without you,
Huan wouldn't have this job.

396
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:33,613
Mr. Mai.

397
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,532
The day after tomorrow,
you don't need to work.

398
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,452
Take a day off

399
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:37,853
and spend some time with your family.

400
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,373
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

401
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:41,413
You are welcome.

402
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:50,772
Mr. Mai

403
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,052
is henpecked.

404
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:53,012
I hope you don't mind.

405
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:57,173
So, he saved you ten years ago.

406
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,212
It's pretty interesting.

407
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:00,972
I just thought

408
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:02,573
you would relent and lend the car.

409
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:04,972
It's not the same thing.

410
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,813
It's not private.

411
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:10,252
Mr. Mai is quite honest and reliable.

412
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,133
And his wife always thinks

413
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,972
that I should repay him.

414
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,613
I paid Mr. Mai's medical expenses

415
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,012
back then.

416
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,252
Later on, I gave him a job.

417
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,772
After that, I gave his daughter a job.

418
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,373
I've been helping him all these years.

419
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,413
I think I have repaid his kindness.

420
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,012
His daughter Mai Chenghuan

421
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,413
is doing quite well.

422
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,212
Now, they're both our acquaintances.

423
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,893
I should give him a red envelope.

424
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,772
You focus on your work.

425
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,613
I will handle this.

426
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,532
Then I'll leave it to you.

427
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,012
(Chengzao, I've talked
to my student Tian Feng)

428
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,732
(about you.)

429
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,052
(He said that you two have met before.)

430
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,853
(You can just go and see him directly.)

431
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,333
Tian Feng.

432
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:23,613
Mai Chengzao?

433
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:25,333
Hello.

434
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,613
You still remember me?

435
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:29,133
Professor Cheng mentioned you to me.

436
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,813
I heard you want an internship
at Fangyuan.

437
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,413
I applied for it online,

438
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:34,492
I've submitted it face to face,

439
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:35,532
and I've applied by mail.

440
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,333
You're quite persistent.

441
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,813
Are you trying to use my connections?

442
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,373
I don't approve of pulling strings.

443
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,333
No.

444
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,173
I just want to give it a try

445
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,972
and see if I can make it possible.

446
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:53,613
Here is my resume.

447
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,212
(Mai Chengzao's Resume)
Your academic performance is good,

448
00:20:58,292 --> 00:20:59,813
but you almost have no chance

449
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:01,133
to work at Fangyuan Law Firm.

450
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:04,012
You're competing with graduates
from Tsinghua, Peking University,

451
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,613
and prestigious overseas universities.

452
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:06,813
I know.

453
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:08,772
I'm mentally prepared for that.

454
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:12,212
But I still want
to try for an interview,

455
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:13,972
even if there is little hope.

456
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:15,613
Well,

457
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,052
I'll give your resume to HR department.

458
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:19,772
You wait for the news.

459
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,212
Thank you, Tian Feng.

460
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,212
It looks good on you.

461
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,413
So beautiful.

462
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,813
I like it,

463
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,573
but it's too expensive.

464
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,252
It's fine, Mom.

465
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,333
Too expensive.

466
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,813
The fabric feels bad

467
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:48,972
against my skin.

468
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:49,613
Madam.

469
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:50,732
The fabrics

470
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:52,413
are all silk.

471
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:54,373
Really?

472
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,012
Look.

473
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:57,532
The size is too big.

474
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,212
- It isn't suitable for me.
- Madam.

475
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,853
We have smaller sizes.

476
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,532
Really?

477
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,413
It looks too flashy.

478
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:06,613
It doesn't fit me.

479
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,613
Too flashy.

480
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:09,532
Madam, if you think it's over budget,

481
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:11,573
we also sell relatively cheaper dresses.

482
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:13,133
- Cheaper?
- Mrs. Mai.

483
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:14,613
Let me tell you.

484
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:17,813
This color goes with your skin tone.

485
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:20,413
And it looks pretty good on you.

486
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:22,168
You know what?

487
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:23,813
I have coupons here.

488
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:25,933
They are going to expire.

489
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,772
You have coupons?

490
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:27,532
Yes.

491
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,012
How much is it after the discount?

492
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,813
I guess a few hundred yuan.

493
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:34,173
Right.

494
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,093
A few hundred yuan?

495
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:35,573
Yes.

496
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:36,413
Well, that's good.

497
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,613
So, let's buy it.

498
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:38,933
Okay.

499
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,413
- Thank you, Mao.
- I'll pay the bill.

500
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,133
Mom, you go and get changed.

501
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:42,813
Okay.

502
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,413
Hurry up.

503
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:46,292
I'll pay. Hurry up.

504
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,252
Mao.

505
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,933
Luckily, you're here.

506
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:50,972
Otherwise,

507
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:52,173
my mom definitely wouldn't buy it.

508
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,093
Come on.

509
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,452
That's how elders are.

510
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,853
Mao, I'm going to use the restroom.

511
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,200
Zao is already waiting for us
at the restaurant.

512
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,813
You can take my mom directly there.

513
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:04,492
Okay.

514
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:05,613
- Go ahead.
- I gotta go.

515
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:14,613
Mr. Yao, what a coincidence.

516
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:15,813
Yeah.

517
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,212
I heard you're getting married.

518
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,252
Congratulations.
You won't have to work anymore.

519
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,632
Mr. Yao, no worries.

520
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:25,976
Even though I am getting married,

521
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:27,813
it won't affect my work.

522
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:29,452
I will still work very hard.

523
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:32,573
But I've heard that the women
of the Xin family

524
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,012
don't have to work.

525
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,093
Mr. Yao.

526
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,608
Work is a very important part

527
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,133
of my life.

528
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,408
My marriage is about both parties

529
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:46,373
coming together.

530
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:48,012
When it comes to supporting a family,

531
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,012
a couple needs to work for it together.

532
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:54,613
Well said, I wish you good luck.

533
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,212
I'm off.

534
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:12,212
Sir, for personal use or a gift?

535
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,252
Let me offer you some advice.

536
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,613
It's a gift for a girl.

537
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:17,653
Could you please describe the person
you are giving it to?

538
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:18,653
I can make a recommendation.

539
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:22,413
She's modest,

540
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,933
steady, down-to-earth,

541
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:28,133
and imaginative.

542
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,093
Sir.

543
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,532
Please take a look at this model.

544
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:39,093
I'll take this one.

545
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,133
Alright, sir, I'll wrap this up for you.

546
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:45,413
What's the matter, sir?

547
00:24:45,772 --> 00:24:46,613
Get me

548
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:48,292
a more expensive gold watch.

549
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:49,972
Certainly, sir.

550
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,133
After all,
she has to maintain her dignity.

551
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,692
Mom, Mao, I'm here.

552
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,532
Thank you.

553
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:03,012
You have ordered them?

554
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,813
How much does this meal cost?

555
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:09,212
Mom, Chenghuan ordered these dishes.

556
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,532
It costs many of our living expenses.

557
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:12,653
Where is my sister?

558
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,012
She went to the bathroom
and will be here soon.

559
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,252
How was your shopping?
You bought a lot of stuff.

560
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:20,413
I bought a very beautiful cheongsam.

561
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,492
Mao is really amazing.

562
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,413
After the discount,

563
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,212
it only cost a few hundred yuan.

564
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:29,532
Mao, you are pretty

565
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:32,893
and clever.

566
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,252
You're perfect.

567
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:35,532
Look what your dad has done.

568
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:36,952
He can't even

569
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,413
borrow a car.

570
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:39,813
I can't believe him.

571
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:41,333
You need a car?

572
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,413
Just drive my car

573
00:25:43,532 --> 00:25:45,173
if you don't mind.

574
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:46,653
That's good.

575
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,012
How much did your car cost?

576
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:51,772
Just a few hundred thousand.

577
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,492
Okay.

578
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:54,613
That's quite good.

579
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,173
Well, you drive my car tomorrow, okay?

580
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:57,573
- Okay, thanks.
- Mao.

581
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:58,772
Why don't you come with us?

582
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,813
The more people, the merrier.

583
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,613
- I...
- You have to ask Mao

584
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:04,452
if she's free.

585
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:08,813
Yeah.

586
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:11,012
It's a meeting between two families.

587
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,972
And it's kind of an engagement banquet.

588
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,173
I just got divorced.

589
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,772
So, it's not appropriate
for me to be there.

590
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:17,373
Yes.

591
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,613
No, not really.

592
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:21,173
The point is,

593
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,972
you've accompanied me for a long time

594
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,333
and your shop has just opened.

595
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,692
You have many things to do.

596
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:27,692
Don't waste time.

597
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:29,212
Yeah, for me now,

598
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,212
making money is important.

599
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:31,573
- Exactly.
- Right?

600
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:32,613
Work hard to make money.

601
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,933
- Huan, you're here.
- Come here.

602
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:36,972
Go ahead and eat.

603
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,292
What took you so long?

604
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,413
I just ran into one of my superiors

605
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:41,413
and we chatted for a while.

606
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,292
Who? Your direct leader?

607
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:46,772
Mr. Yao. I mentioned him to you before.

608
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:49,292
My Dad is his driver.

609
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:50,573
Mr. Yao?

610
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:53,173
You should have told me just now.

611
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,252
I should say hello to him.

612
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,653
We need to get along well with him.

613
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,653
The Xin family

614
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:00,653
is his big client.

615
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,772
Mom, it's his supplier.

616
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:04,732
Yes, his supplier.

617
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,252
Finally,

618
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,133
Chenghuan can hold her head up high

619
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,613
at the company.

620
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,133
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

621
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,333
- Eat more.
- Okay.

622
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,613
If we can't finish, we'll pack it up.

623
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,152
What a gentleman.

624
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,424
You've grown up.

625
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,492
If you do this

626
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:25,613
for other girls,

627
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:26,893
you will gain favor with them.

628
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:30,413
Mao.

629
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,732
Actually, you don't have to compromise.

630
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,292
You called me Mao,

631
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,212
right?

632
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:39,492
Call me sister.

633
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:41,413
Watch your manner.

634
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:42,972
When did I compromise?

635
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,093
My Mom borrowed your car,

636
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,532
but she didn't want you to go with us.

637
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,413
So what?

638
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:51,613
When the two families meet,

639
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,413
it's not appropriate for me to be there.

640
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,373
My Mom shouldn't...

641
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,093
What?

642
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:00,972
Mai Chengzao.

643
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:04,292
My parents have been busy doing business
since I was little.

644
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:05,813
Although my family is rich,

645
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:07,732
the days of seeing them

646
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:09,333
are numbered.

647
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:13,012
Do you remember when the water pipe
at my house broke?

648
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:14,012
Yeah.

649
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,133
My dad fixed it.

650
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:17,373
And my mom brought you to my home.

651
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:18,093
Right.

652
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:20,696
After I stayed at your home,

653
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,212
I realized that a lovely family existed.

654
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,813
Such a comfortable family relationship

655
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:29,012
is truly priceless.

656
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:33,333
I used to freeload off your family.

657
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,133
If I feel unhappy
with such a trivial matter,

658
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,613
I will be an ungrateful person.

659
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:40,573
Zao.

660
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:42,813
I have something to warn you.

661
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:45,813
You know your sister.

662
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,853
She handles a relationship
differently from me.

663
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:52,012
She desires a mutual commitment
and enduring love.

664
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,292
Sometimes, she even compromises.

665
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:55,972
So,

666
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:57,692
when you dine with the Xin family,

667
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,052
take care of your sister.

668
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:02,613
I promise to accomplish the task.

669
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:06,012
So how do you view a relationship?

670
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:07,492
Me?

671
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:13,052
It must be passionate, pure,

672
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:14,853
and persistent.

673
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:18,653
And then?

674
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:21,933
Will you believe in love
unconditionally?

675
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,613
Well,

676
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,133
I will believe in love.

677
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:32,280
But, as for marriage...

678
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:34,813
What?

679
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,813
You can't understand.

680
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:41,012
It's like when the doors
to marriage open,

681
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,012
the gates of happiness will close.

682
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,093
I'm not a child.

683
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,532
I'm about to start working.

684
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:50,093
That's why you're still a child.

685
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,692
Come on, get in the car.

686
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,333
Here is the key.

687
00:29:58,252 --> 00:29:59,413
The ignition is over there.

688
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,492
Let me adjust the seat for you.

689
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:11,933
Hand me the bag.

690
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,012
I'll just walk back. You drive safely.

691
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:15,692
Goodbye.

692
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:36,173
Have you arrived home?

693
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,333
Yes, I just parked.

694
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:51,933
I found you have beautiful eyes,

695
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,133
and I was inspired.

696
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,653
So, I designed a necklace.

697
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:56,772
Please have a look.

698
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:42,692
Have a look.

699
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,492
Is it form-fitting?

700
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:46,173
Take a look.

701
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:48,573
- Does it fit me?
- I just realized

702
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:52,492
you often ate less

703
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:54,813
because of the cooking fumes.

704
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:58,292
I thought you saved food for us to eat.

705
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:00,052
It turns out

706
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:01,452
you have tried

707
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,452
to maintain your figure.

708
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,012
Guess what?

709
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,532
You're not only maintaining your figure.

710
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,012
Your figure

711
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:12,012
has become even better.

712
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:12,813
Really?

713
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,653
You don't even look at me.

714
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,653
You're fooling me.

715
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,333
I just looked at you.

716
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,133
When you wear it,

717
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,853
you look like an elegant lady.

718
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:31,893
- Really?
- It looks good.

719
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:32,813
- Looks nice.
- Beautiful.

720
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,133
I also think it looks good on me.

721
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,133
- It looks good.
- Look at me.

722
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:40,173
Why don't you put on your suit?

723
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,692
Let's see if we look good together.

724
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:45,252
It's just a meeting

725
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:46,413
between both families.

726
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:48,452
I can just wear a jacket.

727
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:50,212
If I wear a suit and a tie,

728
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,613
I will be like a countryman.

729
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:54,292
Are you talking about me?

730
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,413
I'm a countryman?

731
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,613
- No.
- I'm killing you.

732
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:03,173
Yu, you know I'm not the articulate one.

733
00:33:03,573 --> 00:33:06,413
Besides, I am a countryman.

734
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,613
I moved from the suburbs

735
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,893
to the city.

736
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:14,732
Looks good.

737
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:16,933
I'm telling you.

738
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,212
They're from a wealthy family.

739
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,653
We must behave properly.

740
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:22,692
Mind our manners.

741
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,333
We can't embarrass ourselves.

742
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:25,692
When we meet with them,

743
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:28,012
we need to know
how to greet and shake hands.

744
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:28,853
At the dinner table,

745
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,133
we need

746
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,024
to be concerned

747
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:33,212
about table manners.

748
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,133
We should be quiet while eating.

749
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:36,813
When drinking,

750
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,413
you can't even make noise.

751
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:41,173
Don't humiliate ourselves.

752
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,012
Otherwise,

753
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:45,692
they will look down on Huan.

754
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,613
That's terrible.

755
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,333
I got it. No worries.

756
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:51,012
I've been driving for the bosses
for so many years.

757
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:53,772
I've seen all sorts of situations.

758
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:55,052
Alright.

759
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:56,413
Big occasions.

760
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,653
How come you were not so tough before?

761
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,252
Yu.

762
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:08,933
Recently,

763
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,972
I've been thinking of Huan
when she was little.

764
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:16,693
Back then, when she could walk,

765
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,933
she stumbled around

766
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:20,773
and babbled away.

767
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,253
She couldn't even call me Dad.

768
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:27,172
In the blink of an eye,

769
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,413
my daughter is about to get married.

770
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:36,813
You can't bear to let her go.

771
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:40,612
Kind of.

772
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,773
I know how you feel.

773
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,333
But she has grown up,

774
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,572
and she's almost 30.

775
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:52,172
She's going to be married.

776
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:58,333
When I was at her age,

777
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,213
I had Huan.

778
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:04,092
Right.

779
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,813
(Dear Mai Chengzao,)

780
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:15,384
(given HR's preliminary review,)

781
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:17,912
(I'm sorry that you're not qualified
for this position.)

782
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:19,972
Zao.

783
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,612
Why aren't you asleep?

784
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:22,652
I'll go to sleep right away.

785
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:24,333
What's up, sister?

786
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,693
Are you feeling nervous?

787
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:28,853
No.

788
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:35,693
I just want

789
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,572
to chat with you for a while.

790
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,612
Zao, all these years,

791
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:44,652
as your older sister,

792
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,132
I've been

793
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,492
occupying a room at home

794
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,492
and enjoying the favor of our parents.

795
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:51,893
And I owe you a lot.

796
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:53,612
I remember it all.

797
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,813
Once I get married,
you'll have your room.

798
00:35:57,652 --> 00:36:00,012
What are you talking about?

799
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,572
We are siblings,

800
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:02,893
not strangers.

801
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:04,612
Besides,

802
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:07,213
good law firms are in Lujiazui
in Pudong.

803
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:09,253
I might move out

804
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:10,733
when working.

805
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,413
I can't have my room, anyway.

806
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:14,413
Sister.

807
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,572
After you get married,

808
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,333
you must often come back.

809
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,293
Don't forget your room.

810
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:22,132
Come back to see Dad, Mom,

811
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:23,652
and me.

812
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:26,253
You look so confident.

813
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,172
It seems you will get a job soon.

814
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:30,333
Don't worry.

815
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:32,172
I didn't do well
in the college entrance exam,

816
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:33,532
but I didn't fall behind in college.

817
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,652
I got a scholarship many times.

818
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:37,452
Of course, I know.

819
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,933
In my heart, you are the best.

820
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:42,733
Who doesn't have setbacks in life?

821
00:36:42,813 --> 00:36:45,213
But don't doubt yourself
and look forward.

822
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:46,933
I know

823
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,012
it's hard to find a job.

824
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:51,213
If you want to join a good law firm,

825
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,972
you must overcome many difficulties.

826
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,612
Just remember

827
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,933
to tell me
whenever you encounter any difficulties.

828
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:57,944
Understand?

829
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:00,933
Got it. Don't worry.

830
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:01,933
I know what to do.

831
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,733
Sounds like a powerful guy.

832
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,092
Watch me.

833
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,933
Let me perform for you.

834
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,012
Michael.

835
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,052
What sound is that?

836
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,132
Let me see.

837
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:19,612
Pants are broken.

838
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:20,893
Oh, my.

839
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,213
Don't blabber on.

840
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,693
Dad, be careful.

841
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,293
You shouldn't be wearing high heels.

842
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,012
Mom, you don't understand.

843
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:47,293
I came prepared today.

844
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,333
I've placed the orders
at the raw material factory.

845
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:55,333
Why suddenly re-tender?

846
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,213
Are they tricking me?

847
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,253
Mr. Xin, don't be mad,

848
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:03,893
or you'll get a headache again.

849
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,176
Come on.

850
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,424
(Wife)

851
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:19,373
Zhishan, where are you?

852
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:20,572
We're almost there.

853
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:23,813
I'm in a meeting right now.

854
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:25,452
You guys go.

855
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,333
You can do your thing.

856
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:42,933
I'll stay for the meeting.

857
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,612
Jialiang's wedding is the big thing.

858
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:45,572
Business is less important.

859
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,373
Don't be silly.

860
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,813
Business comes first.

861
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,572
- What's wrong?
- My ears.

862
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:58,773
The elevator moved up too fast.

863
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:01,253
Country folks.

864
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:02,773
Everything is new to me here.

865
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,773
Wait a moment.

866
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:07,572
Hi, may I know where is the private room
reserved by Mr. Xin?

867
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:08,532
Please wait a moment.

868
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,373
It's big.

869
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:10,972
This way, please.

870
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:11,612
Okay.

871
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,172
Let's go.

872
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,773
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

873
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:24,733
Hurry up.

874
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:26,333
What's the rush?

875
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,572
I can't believe your dad.

876
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,532
Work always comes first.

877
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:31,532
Come on.

878
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,052
If we're late, Huan will get angry.

879
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:34,213
Wait a moment.

880
00:39:34,648 --> 00:39:35,293
What's wrong?

881
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:36,333
Let me tell you.

882
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,413
We must be calm later.

883
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,172
Let me go up and meet them first.

884
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,413
Enough, stop making a fuss.

885
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,853
Hurry up and be careful.

886
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:43,813
Be careful.

887
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,464
Xin Jialiang, we made a deal.

888
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:49,492
Dad.

889
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:53,652
The Oriental Pearl Tower, Huangpu River.

890
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:56,652
- Come and look. How impressive.
- It's a fancy restaurant.

891
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,092
It's so impressive.

892
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,452
How come they haven't arrived yet?

893
00:40:06,092 --> 00:40:08,172
They arrive later than us.

894
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,813
Sit down and have some tea.

895
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,368
Jialiang and his family are caught

896
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:15,253
in traffic, but they'll be here soon.

897
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,572
Why didn't we get stuck?

898
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:19,172
We came at the same time as well.

899
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,813
I need to use the restroom.

900
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:24,333
Wait a moment.

901
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:26,492
What if they arrive and you're not here?

902
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:28,092
It will be impolite. Sit down.

903
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:30,532
You're the boss at our home.

904
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:31,452
Don't be silly.

905
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:33,172
We must be together today.

906
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:34,213
- Alright.
- Sit.

907
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:36,253
Great view.

908
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:37,532
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

909
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:39,012
- Here you are.
- Huan, Zao.

910
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:40,773
Let me introduce them to you.

911
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,168
This is my mother.

912
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,572
This is my elder sister.

913
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:44,773
Hello, Mrs. Mai.

914
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:45,773
Hello, Mrs. Xin, Jiali.

915
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:46,532
Hello.

916
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:47,893
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

917
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,813
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

918
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:50,773
That's all right.

919
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,532
He must be the younger brother.
What year are you in university?

920
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:56,972
Senior year. I'm about to graduate.

921
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:58,492
Chengzao.

922
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,853
He studies very hard in college,

923
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,532
getting scholarships every year.

924
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,572
A talented young man.

925
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:07,572
Jiali, right?

926
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,492
You're so beautiful.

927
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:11,532
Huan told me that you're pregnant.

928
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:13,972
How many months along?
Is it a boy or a girl?

929
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:15,733
How could I know?

930
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:18,492
I have stood for so long
and my back is killing me.

931
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,293
I'll sit down first.

932
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:21,773
Let's sit down.

933
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,012
- Take a seat.
- Please.

934
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:23,813
Yes, have a seat.

935
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:24,492
Okay.

936
00:41:24,572 --> 00:41:25,652
Let's sit together.

937
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:26,452
Alright.

938
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:28,972
Sit.

939
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:29,492
Please.

940
00:41:29,492 --> 00:41:30,333
Please sit.

941
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,972
- Go ahead.
- Alright.

942
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:34,333
Take a seat.

943
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,172
It looks really nice.

944
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:36,052
- Yes.
- Thank you.

945
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:37,333
We ordered it specially.

946
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,733
- Thank you.
- Take a seat.

947
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,612
Okay.

948
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:40,893
Sit down.

949
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:47,693
Jialiang's father didn't come?

950
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,572
He suddenly has an important meeting.

951
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,172
He might not make it today.

952
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:02,572
I can't believe he is absent

953
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,572
from such an important occasion.

954
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:11,052
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

955
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:13,592
My dad let me apologize on his behalf.

956
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:15,693
He has to attend a meeting.

957
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,092
So, he might not make it.

958
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:19,452
But he has told me

959
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:21,893
to treat you well

960
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:24,132
and behave well.

961
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:25,532
Mr. Mai, Mrs. Mai.

962
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,733
This restaurant has a special dish.

963
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,612
- I'll go take a look.
- Yes.

964
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,652
This restaurant has a minimum charge.

965
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,693
Most people order a set meal.

966
00:42:33,893 --> 00:42:36,413
But the set meals
don't include my brother

967
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:38,773
and mother's favorite food,
East China Sea yellow croaker.

968
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,572
So let's just order
from an à la carte menu.

969
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,933
Chenghuan.

970
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,652
Would you mind ordering the dishes?

971
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:47,773
Remember to order the yellow croaker,
shrimp, and crab.

972
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,893
And then order whatever you like.
