00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:29,560
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:33,693
Who is it? Coming!

4
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:38,933
Who are you?

5
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,172
Hello, I'm with the Botticelli Hotel,

6
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,892
lead of the decor team
in long-term cooperation.

7
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,773
Today, we have an appointment
with Chenghuan for the decoration.

8
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,413
- Mai Chenghuan asked you to come?
- Yes.

9
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:50,053
Okay, come on in, please.

10
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:51,128
- All right.
- Don't come in.

11
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,532
We don't have Mai Chenghuan here,
and we're not renovating. You may leave.

12
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:01,573
Sorry. Wait a moment, please.

13
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:02,616
Okay.

14
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:11,093
Honey, although Huan's not at home,

15
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:13,052
her heart is still attached
to this home.

16
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:15,704
What attachment? No sign
of her being concerned about us.

17
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,212
She just sent a decor team
to get rid of us.

18
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:23,293
Yu, look, the water pipe is broken.

19
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,052
The flush toilet has been out of order
for several days.

20
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:27,612
How can we live like this?

21
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,052
Why can't we live?

22
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,652
Can't we live without water?

23
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,533
Mai Laitian, go downstairs
to fetch water then.

24
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,293
If the toilet doesn't work,
can't we use a chamber pot?

25
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:38,373
I have been taken care of you
all my life.

26
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,172
I can empty the chamber pot myself.

27
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:45,732
Are you still renovating here?

28
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,133
No renovations. Didn't you hear me?
You can go back.

29
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,253
Sorry to have bothered you.

30
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,253
- Liu Hui.
- Here.

31
00:02:58,253 --> 00:02:59,533
(Partner Service Center)

32
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,652
- Zhang Bin.
- Here.

33
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,293
- Chen Chen.
- Here.

34
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,533
- Hu Bing.
- Here.

35
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,452
- Mai Chengzao.
- Here.

36
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,013
Wang Cheng.

37
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:16,413
Mai Chengzao, why are you hiding
back there with bunny ears on?

38
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,293
You didn't answer calls or
reply to WeChat. Why is it?

39
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:19,533
- It's not like that. I...
- You...

40
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,373
Sir, sorry, I'm taking a leave for him.

41
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,392
He won't take orders today.

42
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,373
Wait. I'm just going to change clothes.

43
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,400
No need to get changed.

44
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,732
What are you looking at? Stand still.

45
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,492
Those without girlfriends,
keep on working.

46
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,573
Why did you bring me to the mall?

47
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,693
Your sister told me everything.

48
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:40,052
I just want to ask
how's the job search going.

49
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,533
It's not bad.

50
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:46,133
Not bad? Then why are you
delivering takeout?

51
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:48,973
I just need some time.

52
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,772
Mai Chengzao, your name itself
is telling you to act sooner.

53
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,813
There's not much time
for you to waste. Let's go.

54
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,008
Come, take a look.

55
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:06,552
It sells men's clothing here.

56
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,272
Yes, I brought you here to buy clothes.

57
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,652
No need. I have clothes.

58
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,093
Wait a minute.
Aren't you looking for a job?

59
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,092
Do you know
that it's very realistic in workplaces?

60
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:20,133
You've got to spruce yourself up
from head to toe.

61
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,133
Come on, choose an outfit.

62
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,532
How is it? Does it fit well?

63
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:44,173
Pretty good. You do look handsome
after a bit of dressing up.

64
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:48,933
If the hair is slicked back,
you'll look even more like an adult.

65
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,373
I've said it many times.
I am already an adult.

66
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,292
Yes, you are. Come on, button it up.

67
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,336
Is it tight?

68
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:07,384
Thank you.

69
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:18,253
Remember, when you enter the workplace,

70
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,864
you will meet all sorts of people.

71
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:24,373
By then, your sister and I can't come
to help you anytime, anywhere.

72
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,972
You are on your own.

73
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:37,693
It's been a while since I tied a tie.
I'm a bit rusty. There it is.

74
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:44,053
You're sweating so much. Feeling hot?

75
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,573
Yes, a little bit.

76
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:52,173
Alright, very dashing, Attorney Mai.

77
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,892
This one then. Let's pay.

78
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,173
I can pay for it myself.

79
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,493
Just give me a chance.

80
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,813
Pay me back
after you earn some money, okay?

81
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,624
Then I'll buy you a cup of coffee later.

82
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,712
No problem.

83
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:22,373
It's about what I told you last time.

84
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:25,652
There's a half-hour break
between the morning and evening shift.

85
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,892
Mr. Wang's takeout

86
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:29,013
got messed up
because of this half-hour before.

87
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,000
Do you think
if we need to reschedule this time?

88
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:34,613
Okay, I get it. I'll think about it.

89
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:35,813
- I'll leave you to yourself.
- Okay.

90
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,024
(Zhu Baoqiao)

91
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,373
Do you think I'm like a joke?

92
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,212
All the scheming comes to naught.

93
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,772
I shouldn't comment on others' affairs.

94
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:09,133
But I've already told you
what I could say.

95
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:12,813
As your former classmate, I just feel

96
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:17,652
it's a pity when your ability
actually matches your ambition.

97
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,373
After this, what's your plan?

98
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,013
I'm going back home.

99
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:32,292
During the engagement banquet,
Xin Zhishan had another stroke.

100
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:36,053
This time he's completely hemiplegic.

101
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,493
I'm afraid he can't get out of bed
for the rest of his life.

102
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:47,373
Then what about your baby?

103
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:52,972
You really believe that? I forged it.

104
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,532
Chenghuan, maybe you're right.

105
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,053
I shouldn't have done it.

106
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,412
As long as you figure out
what you should do, that's good.

107
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,772
I hope you can have a new beginning.

108
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,332
I'll call a cab for you,
but I won't see you off.

109
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:29,976
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

110
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,000
You are welcome.

111
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,728
What are you drawing?

112
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:47,373
Such a handsome boy,
such a good-looking suit.

113
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,253
Shouldn't I pair those
with something else nice-looking?

114
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,373
What's this?

115
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,532
Cufflinks. I'll give you a pair
once I have the samples ready.

116
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,973
What do you mean by giving me a pair?
Isn't it drawn especially for me?

117
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,253
Wishful thinking.
I'm still in business, okay?

118
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:07,572
But since it was inspired by you,

119
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:10,333
if it sells well,
I'll give you a commission.

120
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:18,172
By the way,
how has my sister been doing lately?

121
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,973
Haven't you talked to her before?

122
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,652
Don't you know your sister?

123
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,812
She's the type to wake up
and have all her troubles vanish.

124
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:29,172
She's carefree. Don't worry.

125
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,692
- Have some coffee
- Right.

126
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:39,480
Divorce dispute.
I'll contact you later, okay? Okay.

127
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:42,936
Wait for me a moment.

128
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,416
Tian Feng.

129
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,213
Chengzao, what are you doing here?

130
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,412
- Please enjoy your coffee.
- Thank you.

131
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:57,532
I'll take some of it first.

132
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:03,013
Xin Jiali and Luo Mingli
are getting a divorce?

133
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:06,013
Yes, they are currently separated
and preparing divorce papers.

134
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,333
For what?

135
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:11,800
Xin Zhishan was so distressed by them
that he became hemiplegic.

136
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,013
Really?

137
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,253
Then Xin Jialiang just gave up.

138
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:16,932
He does nothing at home.
He doesn't even work.

139
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,932
What about the company of his family's?

140
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,733
The company is managed by his mother.

141
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,692
As long as his mother is determined
not to divorce,

142
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,373
even if Xin Zhishan's mistress
has a child, it's of no use.

143
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,013
That woman is quite something.

144
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,292
Chengzao, how's your job search going?

145
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,184
It's not settled yet.

146
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,253
I don't think it's bad for you
to leave Fangyuan Law Firm.

147
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:46,133
I'm also looking for
other job opportunities.

148
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,812
Maybe we'll become colleagues again
in the future.

149
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:55,453
That would be great.
I hope you two can work together.

150
00:10:55,453 --> 00:11:00,052
Let's make a toast with coffee
to your bright futures. Cheers.

151
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:01,624
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

152
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:05,772
Later, you send the flowers by yourself.
Try to create more opportunities...

153
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:07,692
Speak of the devil. Hey, Mary.

154
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,333
Hi, Dong.

155
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,052
Hi, Mary. Mr. Yao was looking for you.

156
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,453
Do you need me for something?

157
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:22,680
Well...

158
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:30,572
Didn't you say that the water I drink
often clogs up the water dispenser?

159
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,613
Send me some more water.

160
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,772
You've got it? No problem.
I'll arrange it right away.

161
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:43,093
By the way, Mr. Yao,
I wanted to tell you long ago.

162
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,572
In this world, there are other clothes
besides black suits.

163
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,373
Even He Dong has changed his socks.

164
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,133
You should also try something new.

165
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,772
Mai Chenghuan, you really know
how to take your opportunity.

166
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:59,333
Not at all. Customers are always right.
Excuse me.

167
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:07,412
Mao, dinner tonight? No problem.
Great, see you tonight.

168
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,733
If no other questions, then I'm leaving.

169
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,133
Flowers for a girl, huh? Good luck.

170
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:24,373
What are you standing around for?
Waiting for her to invite you together?

171
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:29,292
You're giving away sunflowers
day after day for nothing.

172
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,093
The trips to the nursing home,
all for nothing.

173
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,772
Your grandma doesn't take the hint
about Xing'anli.

174
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,812
Chenghuan ignores you.
It's all for naught.

175
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,253
Isn't the headquarters planning
to expand phase two of the apartments?

176
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:45,733
Mai Chenghuan is on the list
of those in charge.

177
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:48,213
So what?

178
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,333
So, of course,
I have to look for an opportunity

179
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,213
to tell her the good news.

180
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,172
If you want to go to dinner with her,
just say so.

181
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:57,373
Why make so many excuses?

182
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,432
Don't I look good in a suit?

183
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:14,733
You do, but it's a bit monotonous.

184
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:26,333
So Zhu Baoqiao's pregnancy was fake?

185
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,888
The gossip you've brought today
is really something.

186
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,253
Isn't it?

187
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,892
The Xin family
has already ended up like this.

188
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:33,853
I was planning to vent for my sister.

189
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,093
It seems there's no need for that now.

190
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:37,692
It's all over now.

191
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,453
The way to cut losses is to stay away
and not get involved anymore.

192
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,453
You're right.
Come on, let's have a drink.

193
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,853
Live well in the present
and don't worry about anything else.

194
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,333
- Cheers, come on
- Cheers.

195
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,373
What a coincidence that you're here too.

196
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:01,493
I haven't even had a drink yet,
and my eyes aren't blurry.

197
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,093
Why are you dressed like this,
Yao Zhiming?

198
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,652
Didn't you say
that I was always wearing suits?

199
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:14,013
Chenghuan, now that we've run into
each other, how about sharing the table?

200
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,772
Otherwise, we couldn't get one.

201
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:21,093
Then let's share the table, come on.

202
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,213
May I use this chair? Thank you.

203
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:27,013
Huan, could this be...

204
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,973
Our half-brother.
You should call him Zhiming.

205
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:35,692
Come on, Zhiming.

206
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,453
He can't hold his liquor.
He'll be down after one drink.

207
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,292
I can drink this.

208
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:45,932
Get me one too.

209
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,333
You've been talking.
I haven't introduced myself yet.

210
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,733
Hello, I'm He Dong.
You can also call me...

211
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,824
Dong.

212
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:54,652
Right, you can call me Dong.

213
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,532
Look, what a coincidence.

214
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,812
I'm his friend. You're her friend.

215
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:00,973
He, her brother. She, his sister.

216
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,172
That makes you my sister.

217
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,052
Come on, may I have your WeChat contact?

218
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,292
Her phone is dead. Have mine instead.

219
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,652
- You're the younger brother, right?
- Correct.

220
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:12,172
I'm not short of younger brothers.
It's getting a little awkward.

221
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,013
Let's talk about it later. Come on,

222
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,373
let's raise our glasses.

223
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,973
Say goodbye to the past life,
and step towards a brilliant life.

224
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,172
Come on, here's to all of us
turning the page on the past.

225
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:25,652
Turning the page on the past.

226
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,133
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

227
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,172
By this time, Grandma hasn't eaten yet.

228
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,493
She can have something warm here.

229
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,692
How is it?
Is the small cot still comfortable?

230
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:44,052
It's quite good. The nursing home
is quiet and there's free breakfast.

231
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,832
Most importantly, I can still
talk to Grandma. It's comfortable.

232
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,093
If you were thrown into the desert,

233
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:52,856
you could also cheerfully
grow cacti there, right?

234
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:58,133
How do you know? Well, one must have
a bit of the happy-go-lucky attitude.

235
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,772
I firmly believe
that even if one is unlucky,

236
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,692
fate wouldn't keep frowning upon
someone who has a smiling face, right?

237
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:10,172
Now that you can't get married and
have run away, what's your future plan?

238
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,213
Just work hard to make money.

239
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:19,213
That's it. Recently I met
a senior executive from Yueda.

240
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,892
I have some good news for you.

241
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,292
What's it?

242
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,333
The headquarters is looking to
expand Phase Two apartments.

243
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,453
They need to expand the management team,
and you are one of the candidates.

244
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,133
You didn't recommend me, did you?

245
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:36,984
Wait a minute, Yao Zhiming,
I feel something's odd.

246
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,052
Grandma asked you to take care of me,

247
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,333
but you've been spending money
and putting in effort for me.

248
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,213
You're not after something
from my family, are you?

249
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,772
Have you watched too many dramas?

250
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:57,493
Right, my family barely has anything.
It seems you couldn't get much.

251
00:16:58,412 --> 00:16:59,532
Then why is that?

252
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:06,013
Is the lease renewal rate or
your performance false? Be confident.

253
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:17,933
Wait for me.

254
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,008
(Warm service, due diligence)

255
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:10,893
How great it would be
if Huan could come back for the meal.

256
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:29,733
Huan, no matter how busy you are
with work, remember to have your meals.

257
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:34,973
Dad, thank you.

258
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:37,213
You've made another trip
just to bring these things to me.

259
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:40,733
I mainly came to pick up Mr. Yao,

260
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:45,532
and thought I'd bring you clothes
and some other things while I'm here.

261
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,532
I'll turn in this month's salary.

262
00:20:57,213 --> 00:21:01,052
Your mom and I are getting old,
so we don't need to spend much money.

263
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,893
But you're young, having a lot
of pressure. You need it more.

264
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,372
Keep it for yourself.

265
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,493
No, I've already said it last time.

266
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:11,893
I need to contribute my share
to the family. Don't you remember?

267
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,253
Besides, I'm quite content
in this apartment.

268
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,772
Eating at the company doesn't cost much.
You must take it.

269
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,933
Then I'll give it to your mom.

270
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,292
My daughter has grown up indeed.

271
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:34,572
Growing up is a good thing.
Why the sigh?

272
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:40,852
Yes, it is a good thing.
Huan, I'm telling you something.

273
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:45,733
Before you even entered
the house back then,

274
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,653
far away, we could hear

275
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,392
the clattering of your leather shoes
on the stairs.

276
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:54,772
Your mom used to polish your shoes
every day.

277
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,132
While polishing your shoes,
she was always complaining

278
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:02,132
that it was either cooking
or polishing shoes for you all day long.

279
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:06,653
But now, you don't come back,
and she doesn't have shoes to polish.

280
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:11,733
I can see
that she feels empty in her heart.

281
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:17,413
How is my mom doing now?

282
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,653
You and your mom are so alike. Stubborn.

283
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:25,453
I'm different from her.

284
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,572
How are you different?
To me, you are exactly the same.

285
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:33,772
Look, both of you have each other
on your minds,

286
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,453
but neither wants to compromise.

287
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:38,213
Well, now you've reached a stalemate.

288
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:44,893
Dad, I know
that my moving out hurt you and mom.

289
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:48,013
But if I hadn't done so,

290
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,173
mom would never have realized
her issues.

291
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,893
This time I want to keep my boundaries.

292
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,453
Of course I wanted you to come home.

293
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:03,653
However, I can understand your thoughts.

294
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:08,372
The things that happened at home before
were unfair to you.

295
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:14,040
That's your mom, always doing things
with good intentions but bad outcomes.

296
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,852
But I think
we should give her some time.

297
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:20,852
I think she will change eventually.

298
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,280
By the way,

299
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:34,092
your mom made
the shepherd's purse wontons for you.

300
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:08,532
What's it? Don't they taste good?

301
00:24:11,812 --> 00:24:15,973
It's not that.
My mom could make anything delicious.

302
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,173
You are getting softhearted.

303
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:26,840
As I say, if you go home now,
it means you're giving in.

304
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:30,693
All your efforts would be wasted,
all your previous achievements gone.

305
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:34,733
This time I won't be softhearted,
and I won't go back.

306
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:37,332
I want to use this time

307
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,532
to let my mom take a good think.

308
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:48,132
It's just
that I've left my home all of a sudden.

309
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:52,733
Eating out
makes me feel the dishes fresh.

310
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,213
I sleep on Grandma's small cot,

311
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,253
without my mom coming in
from time to time.

312
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,253
That makes me feel very free.

313
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,933
But when I think of home,

314
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,092
I feel my heart's heavy.

315
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:19,224
It's hard for people to step out
from an environment they're used to.

316
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,493
Your mom was used to
being the head of the family.

317
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:27,173
She's not used to it
when you're not around.

318
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:31,933
And you, being used to being
a well-behaved daughter,

319
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:36,493
also aren't used to
being away from your mom.

320
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:42,453
You're right. In fact,

321
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:46,493
I should take this time
to clear my mind.

322
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,213
Just don't take too long.

323
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,893
If your mom suddenly
comes to her senses one day,

324
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,013
just like the lady in that news story,

325
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,453
driving off to rove all over the world

326
00:25:57,453 --> 00:26:00,852
and leaving all the household matters
behind, what will you do?

327
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:04,013
Then I would be so happy.

328
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:10,173
If one day my mom
could find herself and be free and easy,

329
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,453
then as her child,
I would be happy for her too.

330
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:18,372
What do you think?

331
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:19,448
Really good-looking.

332
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:21,693
I think their designs
have always been very good.

333
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,612
- Let's come again next time.
- Of course we will.

334
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,772
(This is a new product
we've just launched.)

335
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:30,173
It's very suitable for your girlfriend.

336
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:34,292
Hello, sir. What can I help you with?

337
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,480
Is your boss here?

338
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,176
Who are you?

339
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:38,933
I'm her ex-husband.

340
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,852
Boss, you have a visitor.

341
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:52,453
Who? Come on, let's go downstairs
and find it out.

342
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:54,812
I have some new accessories
for you to try on. Come on.

343
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,704
Qiu, who came for me?

344
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,973
It's me.

345
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,173
What are you doing here?

346
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,852
I heard you've opened a shop,
so I came to have a look.

347
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:10,572
Didn't expect your designs are
more and more in line with my teachings.

348
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:12,332
Song Huaimin, you're really shameless!

349
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:14,572
Mao's designs have always been
better than yours, okay?

350
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,653
Song Huaimin, I've told you before,

351
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:19,693
if it weren't for Dingding,

352
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:22,173
we wouldn't see each other
unless absolutely necessary.

353
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,092
Copycats are not welcome here.
Please leave.

354
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:26,136
Get out.

355
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,332
Before I go, take a look at this.

356
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:34,493
Make a decision after you've read this.
I'll wait for your reply.

357
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,292
Why are you taking my things?

358
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,852
- Is it very valuable?
- Where're your manners?

359
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:40,888
Alright.

360
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,776
Such a...

361
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,092
Mao, take a look at this. What is it?

362
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,400
(Legal Notice)

363
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,852
He's accusing me of plagiarism?

364
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,213
Didn't he know who was plagiarizing?
Really shameless of him!

365
00:27:56,213 --> 00:27:57,653
Is something wrong with him?

366
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:01,656
I'm so pissed off.

367
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,272
(Legal Notice)

368
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,893
What do you think, Zao?
Is it easy to handle?

369
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:13,852
For creative design work,

370
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:16,973
there're many ways to prove originality.

371
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,812
Gathering evidence won't be difficult.

372
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,532
Although Song Huaimin
took the initiative,

373
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,132
we definitely have a chance of winning.

374
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,693
So, do we need to find a lawyer?

375
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:31,413
If you trust me,

376
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,092
I can be your representative lawyer.

377
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:34,493
Of course I trust you.

378
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,612
This is just a piece of cake for you.

379
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:39,493
Besides, haven't I already
paid the deposit?

380
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,453
What deposit?

381
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,812
The suit.

382
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:48,973
Okay, then I'll leave
the legal matters to Zao.

383
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:50,653
Mao,

384
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:54,092
the necklace designed by Song Huaimin
looks very similar to yours.

385
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:55,852
The quality of your necklace
is better than his,

386
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:57,560
and the price
isn't even one-fifth of his.

387
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:01,733
But the sales volume of yours
doesn't even reach a fraction of his.

388
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:02,733
Have you thought about why?

389
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:05,772
People buy it
because of Song Huaimin's fame.

390
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:08,933
Exactly. So, Zao,
you focus on the legal aspect.

391
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:11,292
And I'll focus on marketing.

392
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,493
I'll plan an independent brand for you.

393
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:14,812
We'll tackle it from both directions.

394
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:20,132
That's great!
Then with both of your help,

395
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:22,572
I'll definitely be able to
bring Song Huaimin down.

396
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:24,532
Of course. Definitely!

397
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:26,413
Come on, thank you both.

398
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:28,733
Take down Song Huaimin!

399
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:42,973
Working overtime, huh?

400
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:47,332
Grandma, am I disturbing you?

401
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:53,092
I'm old. I don't need that much sleep.

402
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:57,253
I just sleep and wake up now and then.
I can still talk to you.

403
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:02,973
Grandma, I want to help Mao
establish an independent brand.

404
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:05,013
I also want to join in.

405
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:09,013
You are seeking development
for yourself?

406
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:12,792
Not really. Mao is very talented.

407
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:17,173
I want to build a brand
out of her jewelry designs.

408
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:20,312
This would also
expand my professional skill.

409
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:25,292
Are you unhappy
working in the apartment?

410
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:31,768
Not really.
But I prefer the hotel industry.

411
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:35,224
After all, a hotel is a place
where dreams can be realized.

412
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:39,772
Your hard work and efforts

413
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,332
can quickly become a visible space,

414
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:45,693
delicious food and drinks,
and the laughter of customers.

415
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,933
Besides, I've been in the hotel business
for seven years.

416
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,612
I really enjoy it myself.

417
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:57,812
Chenghuan, you have dreams and plans.

418
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,933
I'm very reassured.

419
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:05,048
Grandma, since you can't sleep,
would you give me some advice?

420
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,653
Sure. Come here.

421
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:17,213
Grandma, take a look.
All these are designed by Mao.

422
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,013
You've seen a lot of good things.

423
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:22,132
Help us choose one that you think
could be the main model.

424
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:04,888
Good morning, Grandma.

425
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,656
Gently.

426
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:39,653
What are you doing, Yao Zhiming?

427
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,893
Why are you taking candid photos
of me? Delete it.

428
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,933
It's quite cute.

429
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:45,733
I don't believe your nonsense.

430
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,453
My brain would be busted
to believe it. Delete it.

431
00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:49,572
It really is cute.

432
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:50,693
- Do it.
- Absolutely not ugly.

433
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:52,253
Believe me. It's very cute.

434
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:57,973
You're not deleting it, huh?

435
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:01,532
I've got a cute photo of you here too.

436
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,213
Isn't it very cute?

437
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:08,760
Mai Chenghuan.

438
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:14,893
I took such a cute picture of you,

439
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,493
but you show me
such an unflattering photo.

440
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:20,292
You actually know
how to use a beauty filter?

441
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,772
Indeed, it is quite cute.

442
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,013
Remember to send it to me.

443
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:27,772
- Then delete it.
- Why should I delete it?

444
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,612
- If not, I won't send it.
- Suit yourself.

445
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:30,852
Then I'll zoom in on your face.

446
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,173
It's really childish of you.

447
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:37,213
You have no business in the morning?
What brings you here so early?

448
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:41,092
Having finished a meeting
with the headquarters.

449
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,413
I thought of taking a walk
and ended up here.

450
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:46,092
Not like you. Grandma is up,
yet you were still sleeping.

451
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,453
Come on, please check what time it is.

452
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:51,928
It's the weekend.
Of course, I can sleep in on weekends.

453
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:55,772
Besides, I'm not a leader.
I don't have to work so hard.

454
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,292
Madam, you need to work hard
even if you're not the boss.

455
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,653
If not, how can you
become a boss in the future?

456
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:03,413
Firstly, I'm not a madam.

457
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:07,852
Secondly, men should be modest.

458
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:09,172
Do you understand what modesty is?

459
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,264
Nope.

460
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:13,293
And men...

461
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:18,252
When you two get together,
you're always fighting.

462
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:22,092
I got up early today.
I want to sleep in a bit longer.

463
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,652
Huan wants to create a jewelry brand.

464
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:28,440
Go buy some breakfast for me and
also talk about the ideas.

465
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:31,768
Jewelry?

466
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,493
Any questions?

467
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,404
(Jewelry E-commerce)

468
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:43,092
Soybean milk.

469
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:44,184
Thank you.

470
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:52,973
You really want to help Mao Yongxin
create an independent brand?

471
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,773
Yes. Her ex-husband was like a vampire,

472
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:01,773
stealing her designs for so many years.

473
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:05,692
Now seeing Mao
getting better and better,

474
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:09,172
he's accusing Mao of plagiarism
to cover himself up.

475
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:13,333
I just want to help Mao
build her brand and reputation.

476
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,413
That way she can get rid of
her ex-husband for good.

477
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:22,013
Then how do you plan to promote it?
Who are the target customers?

478
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:23,732
I've researched all of this.

479
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:27,493
It's actually very difficult
for such independent, innovative brands.

480
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:30,572
They get bought out by big corporations
who then invest heavily,

481
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:33,373
or they are celebrities
bringing traffic themselves.

482
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:35,973
A new designer like Mao

483
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,813
would have difficulties
in creating a new brand.

484
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:41,933
My idea is to start
with an online store first.

485
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:45,208
After all, nowadays, young people
are quite receptive to new brands.

486
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,413
What do you think?

487
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,853
I think you've overlooked
an accessible customer group.

488
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:55,373
Who do you think have money and time
but don't like things too common...

489
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:56,453
You mean Botticelli?

490
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:04,760
Uniquely designed branded jewelry
can be given as gift packs to clients.

491
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:11,373
That's good. But would Botticelli accept

492
00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:14,293
a brand from a new designer like Mao?

493
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:15,732
You can make use of me?

494
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:21,252
You mean we can take the shortcut?

495
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:25,013
Wishful thinking. I am impartial
when it comes to product selection.

496
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,532
Then is there a possibility

497
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:32,293
that if Mao brings her own popularity,

498
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:34,013
our chances of success would be greater?

499
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:40,088
It tastes good.

500
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:46,168
I got it. Thank you, Mr. Yao.
I'll go find Mao now.

501
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:47,973
The bill is already settled.

502
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,052
I'll drive you there.

503
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:52,572
No need. After you buy
the steamed rice balls for Grandma,

504
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:54,732
just go back to sleep.
You can use my little cot.

505
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,212
For Xing'anli?

506
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:16,373
(Over triple total revenue of Xing'anli)
The payoff is really good.

507
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:20,453
I've come with full sincerity.

508
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:28,333
But I'm old. I can't take it with me
in life or death.

509
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,773
Money doesn't mean much to me.

510
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:36,252
I know it doesn't mean much to you,

511
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:39,893
but it's significant
to your grandson, Yao Zhiming.

512
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:44,373
I believe, in his career,
Xing'anli is the most important part.

513
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:50,453
Why not take another look?
You'll find it much more to your liking.

514
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,212
So Zhiming has been working
with you on this.

515
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,172
He's never been upfront with me
about this.

516
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:04,760
Grandma.

517
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,572
Ms. Zhang, what brings you here?

518
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:14,172
As your partner, I came to check on
the project's progress.

519
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:17,853
My grandma is old
and can't handle disturbances.

520
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,813
Let's step outside
if there's anything to discuss.

521
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,973
Alright, then I'll take my leave.

522
00:38:30,493 --> 00:38:32,773
Grandma, remember to have breakfast.

523
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:51,532
You've overstepped.

524
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:56,692
With this, my months of companionship
seems having an ulterior motive.

525
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,652
You've disrupted my plans.

526
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,773
Didn't you have an ulterior motive?

527
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:07,612
An advice from me.
She is just an old lady after all.

528
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:12,092
You, her own grandson, haven't succeeded
despite months of trying.

529
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:14,572
It seems
that playing family cards doesn't work.

530
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:18,933
If I hadn't come today,

531
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:22,973
I wouldn't have known
that she hasn't looked at the proposal.

532
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,212
If you don't trust me,

533
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:32,973
then find someone more capable.

534
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,373
Of course, I trust you.

535
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:45,373
I just came to give you a reminder.

536
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:50,853
You're a businessman, decisive
and ruthless in business dealings.

537
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,172
You can't afford too much hesitation.

538
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:26,293
Grandma. Grandma!

539
00:40:27,013 --> 00:40:30,572
Grandma!

540
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,933
Boss, there are a lot of returns again.

541
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,092
Come on, let me take a look.

542
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,224
Look,

543
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,824
another unopened package.

544
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,672
(This jewelry store is disappointing.)
The number of returns reached nearly a half.

545
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,692
One-star reviews
and negative feedback on web store.

546
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,293
The copywriting is almost the same.

547
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,893
They must be paid by Song Huaimin

548
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:58,264
to harass you.

549
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:00,293
So what should we do?

550
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,413
It's fine. Since he's chosen this way,

551
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,172
then we'll play it straight with him.

552
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,232
How?

553
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:08,248
Sue him.

554
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:10,652
Sue him. Zao, I'm telling you...

555
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:13,013
Wait a second. Calm down, both of you.

556
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,013
Winning or losing the lawsuit
is one thing,

557
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,692
but the most important thing
is the reputation of the creator.

558
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:21,132
Unless the plagiarized party
has a certain social reputation,

559
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:23,652
otherwise, the plagiarist
won't take it seriously.

560
00:41:23,652 --> 00:41:26,092
At worst, they lose the lawsuit
and pay some money.

561
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,853
It has not much effect on them.

562
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:31,212
I got it. You can utilize
the focus on Song Huaimin.

563
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:32,373
How do I do that?

564
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,692
You can expose his scandals online.
Face him head-on.

565
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,572
Then you can livestream
the process of creating your work.

566
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:40,092
In this way,
you can prove your innocence,

567
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:41,413
and also gain a wave of attention.

568
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:44,612
Then how should I prove the authenticity
of my previous designs?

569
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:48,493
Right. Do you have any evidence
that you ghostwrote for Song Huaimin?

570
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:49,973
For example, email correspondence,

571
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:51,652
WeChat logs, or surveillance videos.
All can work.

572
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:53,652
Yes, there's so much of it.

573
00:41:53,652 --> 00:41:55,893
I'll post all his dirt online later

574
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,853
and make him utterly discredited.

575
00:41:57,853 --> 00:41:59,813
- I might save the legal fees, right?
- Right.

576
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:03,172
This is the first step.
Next, we need to establish the brand

577
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,893
and push the popularity and reputation
to a larger market.

578
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,052
I've figured it all out for you.

579
00:42:07,052 --> 00:42:10,773
Yes, I'll leave it to you.
I don't understand marketing anyway.

580
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,216
- You can count on me.
- Okay.

581
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,013
Let me see.

582
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:15,052
Maybe you shouldn't.

583
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,052
Let me take a look.

584
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:24,853
Yao Zhiming.
Grandma? What's wrong with Grandma?

585
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,568
Thank you.

586
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:40,013
Hey, Mom. Yes, Huan and I have arrived.

587
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:42,252
Yes, once you get off the subway,
you'll see the hospital entrance.

588
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:44,732
Are you okay?

589
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,092
I'm fine.

590
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,612
- Is it sprained?
- A little.

591
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:51,092
Zao, don't worry about me
and wait here for Mom and Dad.

592
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:53,853
Remind them to watch the steps
so they don't sprain their ankles.

593
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:55,612
Okay, take care.
