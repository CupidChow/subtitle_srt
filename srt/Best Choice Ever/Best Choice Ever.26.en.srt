00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:30,008
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,551
I'm telling you.

4
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:37,751
Today, Zhang Peisheng's daughter
came for Yao Zhiming.

5
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,991
She said she was his girlfriend.

6
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,430
So it turns out
Yao Zhiming has a girlfriend now.

7
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,031
And she's Zhang Peisheng's daughter.
What a coincidence.

8
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:55,631
Girlfriend? Is that
what Yao Zhiming told you?

9
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,590
Yao Zhiming didn't say that.
He denied it.

10
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,551
He said she was just a sister.

11
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,568
But this girl was just too forward.

12
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,384
Girls are really bold nowadays.

13
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,391
You should learn from them.
Make your move when you're sure.

14
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:13,831
No, get a good look
and then seize the opportunity.

15
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,351
With accuracy and speed,
strike when the time is right.

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,391
I got it. I'll go upstairs then.

17
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,640
Hello, Huan.

18
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,671
Mao, you already went to bed?
I'd like to talk with you for a bit.

19
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,630
Not yet.
Why are you calling at this hour?

20
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,590
Nothing much, just felt like chatting.

21
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,951
You know what?

22
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,231
You see, I have a friend,
and this fri...

23
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,071
Alright, stop pretending with me.

24
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,791
It's you, isn't it? Just say it.

25
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,056
Okay, yes, it's me.

26
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,831
Now the situation is that Yao Zhiming

27
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,312
used to be a guardian of a girl abroad.

28
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,584
Now, this girl has returned to China.

29
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:21,656
And today, this girl came to my house.

30
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,391
She met my mom and told her
that she was Yao Zhiming's girlfriend.

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,710
But Yao Zhiming explained to me

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,590
that the girl was not his girlfriend.

33
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,430
They had no romantic relationship.
She's just kind of his sister.

34
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,111
The situation is quite complicated.

35
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,671
Remember, when a man says
it's some kind of sister,

36
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,071
there's definitely something fishy.

37
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:47,271
And don't just take his word for it.
You've got to judge by his actions.

38
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,231
It is quite complex, isn't it?

39
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,111
Come on, Mai Chenghuan.

40
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:56,430
Don't jump into
the pit of love so easily. Stay calm.

41
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,831
I know. I will.

42
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,710
What? I certainly haven't.

43
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,280
I, Mai Chenghuan, am a career woman.

44
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,928
I just... I was just asking casually.

45
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:12,376
Alright, nothing else.
You should go to sleep. I'll hang up.

46
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,240
Kind of sister.

47
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,430
Is that so?

48
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,151
I'll take you there sometime
by the end of the year.

49
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,390
He Dong.

50
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,656
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

51
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:57,950
Beauty, who are you?
I'm He Dong's girlfriend.

52
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,830
Sister! My goodness.

53
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,630
How come you're here for me?

54
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,671
Goodness. My sister. Isn't she pretty?

55
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,591
Could you get her something to drink?

56
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,950
Milk, she's growing lately.

57
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,950
Why are you here?

58
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,310
Why can't I avoid you anywhere?

59
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
I can't reach you by phone.

60
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,510
I had to wait for you here.

61
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,911
I'm busy here.

62
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,630
Stop talking nonsense. Yao Zhiming
has been acting strange lately.

63
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,551
He used to always be alone.

64
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,190
Why has he recently been living
with a bunch of strangers?

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,031
You two are keeping secrets from me.

66
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:34,510
You know me well. I keep my personal
and professional life separate.

67
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,510
I don't care about
his private matters, okay?

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,736
You know him inside out.

69
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:42,616
You don't know it? Come on, spill it.

70
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,510
What do you want me to spill?
I really don't know.

71
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,270
Then I'll go and talk to that beauty.

72
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,911
Forget it. Talk to me.

73
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,728
- Ask.
- Who is Mai Chenghuan?

74
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,671
We'll go to Guangming Village
for breakfast in a bit.

75
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,750
After breakfast,
we'll go to Wukang Road.

76
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,591
Those houses are so pretty.
Many people go there.

77
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,190
There are many famous people's
former residences.

78
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,310
- Really?
- People take photos there.

79
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,310
Don't run around, Qiu. Be careful.

80
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,551
- When we eat, we...
- These buildings are rich in character.

81
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,992
Very retro, quite flavorful.

82
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,736
The lawn outside is also spacious.
Why don't we just choose this place?

83
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:16,870
Okay.

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,270
Let's add it to
our wedding hotel options.

85
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,551
What's going on? Whose child is this?
Anyone looking after him?

86
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,750
It's our child. What's the problem?

87
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,991
Don't you have any sense?
Can't you see the dress is dirty?

88
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,151
Is that necessary?

89
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,231
What's the matter?

90
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,830
Why are two adults scolding a child?

91
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,750
What are you talking about? Didn't you see
the dress is dirty? So unreasonable.

92
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,830
- Come here.
- Is it necessary

93
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,991
to argue with a child?

94
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,231
- All right.
- Let it go.

95
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:38,151
Every bratty child has an unreasonable
parent. There's no talking to them.

96
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,031
You call us a bratty child and
an unreasonable parent?

97
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,464
I did. So what?

98
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:42,551
Apologize.

99
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,510
Apologize?
I'll call the police right now.

100
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,671
- Don't.
- You want to call the police?

101
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,351
We can talk this out.

102
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,111
Fang, hold back on a few words.
Don't harm Huan or the hotel's business.

103
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,190
Yu, Qiu is the treasure of our family.

104
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,950
You just watch them bully him?

105
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,711
- Exactly.
- Who is bullying whom?

106
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,111
Do you have any sense of reason left?

107
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,151
Who is being unreasonable?

108
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,231
Are you even an adult?

109
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,151
Is it necessary for you guys?

110
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,231
What would a child know?

111
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:10,351
Stop quarreling.

112
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,911
Sorry, sir, ma'am.

113
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:14,351
I'm the manager of Xing'anli.
Is there anything I can help you with?

114
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,950
Chenghuan, you've arrived just in time.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,671
- Stop talking.
- Come here.

116
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,190
Just now, this child got my skirt
into this mess.

117
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,351
- Look.
- They want us to apologize.

118
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:25,111
You're being quite unreasonable.
What kind of hotel is this?

119
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,111
I'm sorry, ma'am.

120
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,310
We are very sorry for the inconvenience.

121
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,510
How about this? Our hotel will cover
the dry cleaning cost for your clothes.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,031
We can also waive your room charges
for today.

123
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,216
Is this solution acceptable to you?

124
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,551
Alright, you're quite reasonable.

125
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,911
We won't quibble over it then.

126
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,711
Thank you, ma'am.
Thanks for your understanding.

127
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,351
Please leave your skirt at the entrance.
It will be attended to.

128
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,031
If you want to take a cab,

129
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,711
the concierge colleagues at the door
can help you hail a taxi.

130
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:54,008
Fine. For your sake,
we won't make an issue of it.

131
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:55,711
Learn from this.

132
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,390
Sorry about that.
I wish you a pleasant journey.

133
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,551
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,791
Chenghuan, what do you mean?

135
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,430
How can you show such disrespect
to your relatives in front of strangers?

136
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:08,390
Uncle, a child cannot
tell right from wrong.

137
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,991
Adults must set an example for him.

138
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,911
If Qiu dirties someone's clothes,
an apology is a must.

139
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:14,630
- You...
- Fang.

140
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,351
Please say less.

141
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,270
It's embarrassing
with so many people around.

142
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,224
Huan, compensating
for a night's room fee is a bit much.

143
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,750
If her clothes are dirty, take them off
and I will wash them.

144
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,248
Mom, that's not how it works.

145
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,344
In the hotel business,
we rely on our reputation and services.

146
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,550
We want everyone
to stay comfortably and happily here.

147
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,431
Yu, you told me Chenghuan is filial
and obedient.

148
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,870
Not only did she scold me
like her grandson,

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,311
but she also disciplined you,
her own mother.

150
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,591
She talks back to adults,
looking down her nose at us.

151
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,270
She's so aggressive.
It makes me feel sorry for you.

152
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,550
Can you please speak less?

153
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,192
Uncle, it's not easy for you
to come all this way.

154
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,431
I know it's not easy.

155
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:04,711
I've given one hundred percent sincerity
in hosting you.

156
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,630
But if you can't
tell right from wrong like this,

157
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,951
and also try to stir up trouble
between my mom and me,

158
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,390
then don't blame me
for setting boundaries with you.

159
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,431
- What do you...
- Mai Chenghuan, what do you mean?

160
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,150
It means if you still want to stay here,

161
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,951
please abide by the hotel's rules.

162
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,048
If not, then today's room charge,

163
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:23,030
I won't help you. Do as you please.

164
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,311
What? Are you sending us away?

165
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,150
We've come such a long way.

166
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,390
She won't let us stay here anymore.

167
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,431
- She's kicking us out?
- It's not easy to come all this way.

168
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,991
- Huan.
- Uncle. Auntie.

169
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,790
- Fang Da.
- What's happening?

170
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,150
Da, how come you're here?

171
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,184
Chenghuan asked me to come over
and talk about work.

172
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:37,951
What's happening?

173
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,550
Mr. Fang,
I'll wait for you in the garden.

174
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,670
Fang Da, Mai Chenghuan
nearly kicked us out just now.

175
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,032
Almost kicked us out. Be careful
when collaborating with such a person.

176
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,150
- You...
- Don't collaborate with her anymore.

177
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,471
Uncle, calm down, please.

178
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,071
We've come from far away
to have fun, to enjoy ourselves,

179
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:59,630
not to argue, right?

180
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,390
Don't let such a small matter
ruin our good mood.

181
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,670
How about this? I'll call a car
and find a guide

182
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,870
to accompany you for a stroll.

183
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,192
Have a great time. Be happy.

184
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,311
Sure, sure.

185
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,550
Auntie, you can go too.

186
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,150
Alright, Fang Da, thank you.

187
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,910
- Look at Fang Da.
- This is good.

188
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,711
Don't be angry. Let it go.

189
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,991
Quickly, go have breakfast.
We're still hungry.

190
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,351
- Alright, alright.
- Be quick, let's go.

191
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,510
Let's go, Qiu. Let's go.

192
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,550
They've left for breakfast.

193
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,670
I'm really sorry
you had to witness that embarrassment.

194
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,328
It's okay. It's normal for the elderly
to be set in their ways.

195
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,191
Did you read that collaboration proposal?
What do you think?

196
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,311
I've read it.

197
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,231
And I've also come to get to know
the situation of Huixue.

198
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,471
Although it's a startup,
it has a bit of fame.

199
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,336
I think the designs and aesthetics
of your proposals are quite great.

200
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,071
So, I'm pretty confident
about this collaboration.

201
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,390
The hotel evaluation
is particularly important to me.

202
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,111
If we can pass the evaluation,

203
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,630
it would be regarded as dual recognition
from the media and customers.

204
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,071
And once passed,
the homepage will be Xing'anli.

205
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:13,510
That way, more people
can learn about Xing'anli.

206
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:19,231
I've made some changes to the plan.
Take a look.

207
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,591
Great, that's wonderful.

208
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,951
I've enlarged this area.

209
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,311
This? Yes, this is great.

210
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,471
Now, young people and elderly...

211
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,150
Yes, and then...

212
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,030
- Pleasant cooperation!
- You too!

213
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,352
Take care.

214
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,840
Take care.

215
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,750
Boss.

216
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,870
(She is Mai Chenghuan?)

217
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,670
I didn't mean to tell her.

218
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,231
She's been blocking me all day.

219
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,630
I really had no choice.

220
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,711
Where are you going?

221
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,390
To find Zhang Ziyu.
You're going to play golf with Mr. Li.

222
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,976
What are you here for?

223
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:40,231
I'm a travel blogger.
Can't I come to explore this place?

224
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,510
It's not the first day
I've known of you, Zhang Ziyu.

225
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,390
Right, it's not the first day
you've known me.

226
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,831
Then you should know that the more
you keep it, the more curious I get.

227
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:50,968
Who exactly is this Mai Chenghuan?

228
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:51,992
Keep your voice down.

229
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,311
I want to find a job in Xing'anli.

230
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:59,951
Are you crazy?
Don't come here to cause trouble.

231
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,270
I'm not causing trouble.

232
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,951
If she has exceptional qualities,
that means you have good judgment.

233
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,951
I not only want to learn from her,
but I'm also completely convinced.

234
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,630
But if not,
I want to have a match with her.

235
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,712
Come on. You...

236
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:16,951
You really are efficient.

237
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,280
I don't see any issues.
I'll just sign it.

238
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,951
That's great.
Here, you can use this pen.

239
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:29,471
Hello, Miss Mai.
Hello, I'm here to apply for a job.

240
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,544
Is it convenient?

241
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,471
Yes, it is.

242
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:35,111
Excuse me, who are you?

243
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,111
Zhang Ziyu, come with me.

244
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,351
What for? Can't you see
I'm busy applying for a job?

245
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:45,510
Let me introduce her, Zhang Ziyu.
She's the daughter of Zhang Peisheng.

246
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,910
I'm her overseas guardian.

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,231
She is the one who called you
at the police station that day.

248
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:51,790
Hello, my name is Zhang Ziyu.

249
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,870
I'm currently studying
at the Swiss Hotel Management School.

250
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,471
I'm proficient in copywriting,
public relations, and fan operations.

251
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,351
I'm a travel blogger
with 230,000 followers.

252
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:03,670
It can be said that I have
a good professional expertise,

253
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,030
and I'm a rare post-millennial fresher.

254
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,150
Looks pretty good.

255
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,150
What is your friend's name?

256
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,191
This is Fang Da, the person in charge of
Huixue Wedding Company.

257
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:17,231
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,928
Here is my business card.

259
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:20,991
Okay.

260
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:25,510
We've known each other since childhood.
Chenghuan and I are kind of hometowners.

261
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,071
Childhood sweethearts.

262
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,431
About that.

263
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,630
Ziyu, you are Zhang Ziyu, right?
Hi, I am very pleased to meet you.

264
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,550
However, if to apply for a job,
you need to submit a resume first.

265
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,448
There are guidelines on the website
of Xing'anli. You can take a look.

266
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,351
Is it that troublesome?

267
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,488
Yes, it is.

268
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,311
It wouldn't be because of my mom
that you won't take me, right?

269
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,910
Is it because she badmouths me
everywhere?

270
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,790
I'm not like what she said.
I'm ambitious and hardworking.

271
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,071
Zhang Ziyu,
your account is just a hobby.

272
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,840
Work is about professionalism.

273
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,912
Stop teaching me what to do, okay?
I'm not a child anymore.

274
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,870
That's how it is, Ziyu.

275
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,670
Everyone who wants to work here must
submit a resume and follow the process.

276
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,991
Everyone is treated the same.

277
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,071
So, I'm not worried about your identity.

278
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,991
I don't care
whose daughter you are, either.

279
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,471
I just heard your self-introduction.

280
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,591
You have more than 200,000
followers. That's quite impressive.

281
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,150
You must have some
extraordinary qualities.

282
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,750
If you really want to work at Xing'anli,

283
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,390
bring your proposal
when coming to the interview,

284
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,790
so I can get to know you well.

285
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,231
Also, I hope you can be clear

286
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,550
about why you want to work
in Xing'anli and what you want.

287
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,431
Okay, no problem.

288
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,150
We're leaving, Yao Zhiming.

289
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,951
Zhang Ziyu, don't come here
and cause trouble again.

290
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,951
Go home now.

291
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,870
I was just holding you like this.

292
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,750
She didn't even bother
to lift her eyelids.

293
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
She simply doesn't care about you.

294
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,912
Yao Zhiming, are you in unrequited love?

295
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,910
It's unrequited love, isn't it?

296
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:12,390
I'm back.

297
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,624
Gentler, please. It's killing me.

298
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:14,630
Okay, I got it.

299
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,351
Huan, Mom made dessert.
Do you want some?

300
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,344
Sure.

301
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,750
Huan is back.

302
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,150
Mom, what happened to your leg?

303
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,831
She spent the day out
with your aunt and her family

304
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,416
and helped with the kid. She's tired.

305
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:37,111
Age spares no one.
I really can't make it tomorrow.

306
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,150
If you can't make it, then don't go.

307
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:51,951
Huan, I'm wondering
if you should join them tomorrow

308
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:57,030
to the aquarium. This could also help
smooth things over, alright?

309
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,311
I don't have time tomorrow.

310
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,471
It's okay.
If Huan can't go, I'll go with them.

311
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,151
Don't. Stop nagging.
This isn't your concern.

312
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:13,151
Huan, I want to talk to you.

313
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,110
Your aunt dotes on you a lot.

314
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,991
Look, she's getting on in years now.

315
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:18,431
She doesn't come around often.

316
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,472
And now you're too busy.

317
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,231
The meeting ended up a bit unhappy.

318
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,310
That's not good.

319
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,550
So, I was thinking that you...

320
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,030
Mom, let me be honest with you.

321
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,790
I know my aunt is nice to me.

322
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,070
If it weren't for aunt's sake today,

323
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,231
I guess I would've gotten upset
with them.

324
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,631
You can't.

325
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:45,030
Alright, I understand
what you said today.

326
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,991
If I have time in a couple of days,
I'll take them out to have fun, okay?

327
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,590
But I really can't tomorrow.

328
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,070
The hotel has its rules and regulations.

329
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,310
I can't take leave.

330
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,550
Look, there's another work call.

331
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:01,030
Mr. Lin, yes, yes.

332
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,471
Mrs. Mai, it so happens I have a friend
at the aquarium.

333
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,231
I can get you some VIP tickets.

334
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,350
Mr. Yao, this is a family matter.

335
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,070
How could we trouble you with this?

336
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,631
We all live together.
No need for formalities.

337
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,550
Exactly, no need for formalities.

338
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,671
Thank you, Ming.

339
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:22,744
- That's nice.
- You're welcome.

340
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,560
- That's nice.
- Mom.

341
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,711
Huan's job nature is different now.

342
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,310
The weekends are her busiest time.

343
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,711
You'll go. That's perfect.
How did I not think of that?

344
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,431
Zao, your aunt and uncle raised you
when you were young.

345
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,830
And your cousin Fang Jie
has also been very good to you.

346
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,904
Such good relationships.

347
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:54,310
It's time to repay the kindness.
Show it well, kid.

348
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,350
But in what you do and say,

349
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,871
don't be as blunt as your sister.

350
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,871
Otherwise they might be unhappy.
You need to be delicate and attentive.

351
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,030
Alright, Zao will go.

352
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,310
- And smile.
- Keep a smile.

353
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,911
- Eyes filled with tenderness. You hear me?
- I have something to talk to you.

354
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:12,631
Also, whenever they go to the bathroom,
you have to follow, understand?

355
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,550
When they're hungry, you need to find
something to eat.

356
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,510
You should buy something tastier
and a bit more expensive.

357
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,110
Don't go too cheap, got it?
And bring water.

358
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,951
What's wrong? Not happy?

359
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,671
Yes, relatives are annoying,
and so is work.

360
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,231
How come as an adult,
there are so many troubles?

361
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,790
Wait for me a moment.

362
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,151
Take a sip. Drown your sorrows.

363
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,911
How are you doing?
Are you getting used to living with us?

364
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,816
Pretty good.

365
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,830
Really?

366
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,911
Really, I actually think

367
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:24,824
in one's lifetime, many things often
go against their wishes.

368
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:28,216
If it can't be changed, perhaps
try looking at it from another angle.

369
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:32,510
What if, just what if,
there might be a surprise?

370
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,048
Take it slow.

371
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,191
Impressive.

372
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:03,191
Bingo.

373
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:09,912
You just aren't caught up in it.

374
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,550
That's why you can speak
so lightheartedly.

375
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:18,232
Actually, I feel
it's like a besieged city.

376
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,976
People inside want to get out,
and those outside want to get in.

377
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,510
Then why can't I be the one outside
who wants to come in?

378
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,750
The house is yours, and so are the keys.

379
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,991
If you want to come in,
who dares to stop you?

380
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,848
Alright, if Miss Mai says so, alright?

381
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,270
Let's go. I'll take you for a ride.

382
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,312
You shouldn't drive, either.

383
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,151
Today, let me take you
to experience the real deal. Let's go.

384
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,070
Zao.

385
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:11,911
What's wrong? Are you sick?

386
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,951
I've been staying up late to catch up
on orders. Got a cold. Noting serious.

387
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:19,070
Then I'll come over to check on you.

388
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,471
No need. Tomorrow
is Dingding's visitation day.

389
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,391
I want to take him out to play.
Do you have time?

390
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:29,991
Sorry, Mao. Mom gave me a task.

391
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,391
She asked me to accompany
a relative's child to the aquarium.

392
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:39,510
What a coincidence. Dingding just said
he wanted to go to the aquarium.

393
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,151
Then why don't we go together?

394
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,350
It'll be nice for the two kids
to have each other's company.

395
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,736
That sounds great.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

396
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:48,951
Okay.

397
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,631
Take your medicine,
and get some rest early.

398
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:53,110
Okay.

399
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,350
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

400
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,808
Kid, could you switch seats
with a brother like me?

401
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:20,231
Is it okay to sit here?

402
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,431
You are an uncle.

403
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,350
Then, can you switch seats
with the uncle?

404
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,510
Uncle and this sister are together.

405
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,391
I want to sit with the beautiful sister.

406
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,151
It's okay. Let's just sit separately.

407
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,584
Then, can I sit here?

408
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,711
Yes, you can.

409
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,824
Thank you.

410
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,070
You are such a pretty sister!

411
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,391
You are very handsome too.

412
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,711
Are you from Shanghai?

413
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,911
- Clever beyond his age.
- Yes.

414
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,631
- What about you?
- I'm also from Shanghai.

415
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,471
Which district are you from then?

416
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:57,550
I'm from Huangpu District. And you?

417
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,648
Make a guess.

418
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:01,350
You are...

419
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,790
Kid, look, the little girl up there
has a gun just like yours.

420
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,231
She has more bubbles than you.
Do you want to go and have a look?

421
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,110
- Just up front.
- It seems like it.

422
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,128
Slow down.

423
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,830
- I'll come back later.
- Okay.

424
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,671
There's no "later". Come on!

425
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,110
No way about "later".

426
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,431
You're sitting on my dress.

427
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:21,432
Sorry about that.

428
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,871
You're quite good at deceiving kids.

429
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:29,671
I wasn't deceiving him.
I was helping him.

430
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:30,911
There's a little girl up ahead.

431
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:33,871
Then he can go over to play with her.
They can make a pair.

432
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,231
So, Mr. Yao was also like this
as a child, right?

433
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,790
My childhood was quite miserable,
as you well know.

434
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,750
You weren't like this in your childhood?

435
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,030
Yes, I've been popular
since I was little. What's the matter?

436
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:56,310
I knew it.
It's that Fang or something, right?

437
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,070
He said you were childhood sweethearts.

438
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,480
Fang Da? Please,
your way of thinking really is...

439
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,310
I barely saw him a few times
in my childhood.

440
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,671
Growing up, I don't even remember
what he looks like.

441
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,631
Besides, I don't fancy him.

442
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,030
But what does it have to do with you?

443
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,631
Of course, it has to do with me.
Because I like you.

444
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,951
Like me? Are you joking like last time?

445
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,471
This time I'm serious. Be my girlfriend.

446
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:51,711
Serious? How can you prove that?

447
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:02,191

She's now the owner of a big hotel.
Of course she's busy.

468
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:04,471
Yao Zhiming said something today.
Did you hear it?

469
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,560
What did he say?

470
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:09,830
He said something about us
all being one family.

471
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,030
He considers us as one family.

472
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,151
There was already
a familial relationship.

473
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:20,431
Now we're living together.
Of course, we are a family.

474
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:22,951
That's true indeed.

475
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:28,790
You call her again later.
I'm going to sleep.

476
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,070
Okay, you should go now.

477
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:41,830
Keep it down. My mom and dad are asleep.

478
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:48,391
Yao Zhiming, I've given it some thought.

479
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:51,790
Let's not tell my parents about us
for now.

480
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,991
Why? Weren't you the one
taking the initiative just now?

481
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,030
No, it's because some relatives
have come recently.

482
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,030
My mom has been busy with everything.
She's quite tired.

483
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,750
I'm thinking of waiting
until after this period.

484
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,391
I'll find the right opportunity
to tell her then.

485
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,110
Okay, I'll listen to you.

486
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,272

Probably it's Huan coming back.

♪Don't cry. Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry♪

513
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:58,044
(Mai Chenghuan, come out for a moment.)

514
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,231
What are you doing?

515
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:16,911
You haven't answered me yet
if you want to go together tomorrow.

516
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,550
Depends on my mood.

517
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,270
What now?

518
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,631
I missed you.

519
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,871
Don't say bye-bye.

520
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,951
Yao Zhiming, you big fool.

521
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,070
I mean, let's meet at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

522
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,480
Okay, okay.

523
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,631
Why is there a noise on the balcony?

524
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,550
How did a rat get onto the balcony?
What is it doing?

525
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:12,431
Tomorrow, buy some rat poison.
I want to kill it.

526
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,550
Remember to buy it tomorrow.
Did you hear me?

527
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,110
I'm catching this.

528
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:13,351
It's gone, over there.

529
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,751
Taking care of children is so tiring.

530
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:20,510
But fortunately,
I have you with me today.

531
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,070
Otherwise, I really can't do it.

532
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,791
Dingding has a nice personality.
He's already considered easy to manage.

533
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,871
Children nowadays have so much more
to play with than we did.

534
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:31,911
Tiga, Tiga, these are the fish.

535
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,070
They are greeting you.

536
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:36,440
I want to play too.

537
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:39,070
Tiga is my good friend.

538
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,391
You should ask Tiga
if he wants to play with you.

539
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,670
Let me play for a while.

540
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:55,791
Dingding, come on. Get up.

541
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:58,110
- Are you hurt? What happened?
- Are you okay?

542
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,230
Mom, he's bullying me.

543
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,871
Did he snatch your toy?

544
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,311
Qiu, give Tiga back to him.

545
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,070
Don't fight, you guys.

546
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,391
Just let Qiu play for a while.
Why make a fuss with a child?

547
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,070
Can't you just buy another one?

548
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:27,510
Because he's a kid,
he can snatch others' toys?

549
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,471
Why should we have to give it to you?

550
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,070
Why don't you buy one for him yourself?

551
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,150
Isn't it just a toy?
Is it necessary to fuss over it?

552
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,871
We've come a long way to play here.

553
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:37,991
Can't you guys make some concessions?

554
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:40,391
You are relatives with Mai Chengzao.
Do I even know you?

555
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:41,510
Why should we make concessions?

556
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,472
Alright, stop crying. Have some dignity.

557
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:50,510
Why are you scaring the kid?

558
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:54,670
Mai Chengzao, you've been living
in my house since you were little.

559
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,510
You've grown up and become a lawyer,
and you think you're so great.

560
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,911
I'm telling you. This is my child.

561
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:02,911
I will do as I please.

562
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:05,311
There's no need for you to tell me
how to raise my child.

563
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:06,471
Show some respect.

564
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,951
Fine, watch out for yourself.

565
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:14,751
I'll tell your entire family about all
your dark secrets since you were little.

566
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:19,831
Fine. If you don't tell them,
I'll think less of you. Come on.

567
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:23,896
(Mom)

568
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,230
What are you being so arrogant for?

569
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,710
Alright, no more crying. Come here.
Let me have a look.

570
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:36,152
Let's go, Dingding.

571
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:37,784
Let's go. Go.

572
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,488
Don't cry. Go play by yourself.

573
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,744
Boss, have you checked
our group's financial report?

574
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:50,630
In the entire East China region,
only Botticelli is on the report.

575
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,271
Why do you look so listless?
Did you stay up late last night?

576
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,751
I woke up too early. I'm sleepy.

577
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,431
Woke up early? Why?

578
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:09,871
(Miss Mai, are you done with your work?
Maybe Mr. Yao can invite you to lunch.)

579
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:15,070
(I still have tons of work to finish.
How about dinner instead?)

580
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:18,030
(Then make sure to have a good lunch.)

581
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:24,271
Uncle Zao, do I have to

582
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:28,110
share with the other kids
to be a good kid?

583
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,951
Of course not.
You can share if you want to.

584
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:34,590
But, you don't have to share
if there aren't more.

585
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:41,391
Dingding, Uncle Zao promises you

586
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:44,110
that your Ultraman will definitely
regain his energy by tomorrow.

587
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,032
Thank you, Uncle Zao.

588
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,911
Alright, so can we now

589
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,590
happily eat something? Come on.

590
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,150
Uncle Zao, you can drink it first.

591
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,391
Okay, since Dingding is willing to
share with Uncle Zao,

592
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:04,791
let's open another one. Cheers.

593
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,096
Cheers.

594
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:12,351
You two are taking turns speaking.

595
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:15,030
I feel so superfluous as a mother.

596
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:20,471
Dingding, it seems
Mao is getting jealous.

597
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,190
So delicious.

598
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,831
By the way, later on,
take Dingding to play for a while, okay?

599
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:34,936
I'll go home first.

600
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,824
Okay.

601
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,871
Chenghuan, the training plan
for the room service department

602
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:47,030
and the PR department's plan
have already been sent to you by email.

603
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,311
I've seen it. Mr. Cui. I think
there's no problem with it.

604
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:52,351
Let's go ahead with it then.
Alright, thanks.

605
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:57,070
Miss Mai, we'll go back
to the dormitory for a rest.

606
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,230
Go back and have a rest.
You've worked hard.

607
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,150
You promised me that you'd have
a good lunch.

608
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:21,951
Didn't we agree to have dinner
together tonight?

609
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:25,510
If I hadn't come, would you really
have settled with a sandwich?

610
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:29,710
No, but I'm still working.

611
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,590
Relatives have come over recently.
I was just a bit distracted.

612
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,744
No excuses allowed.

613
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,991
It's all brought by Mr. Yao, so lavish.

614
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,271
But I never imagined
that a first date would be like this.

615
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,070
You better not really mean that.

616
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:56,871
You just didn't give me a chance
for a romantic date.

617
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,871
Every day, it's all work on your mind.

618
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,951
But it's also my fault
for giving my heart too soon.

619
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:08,590
Now my world is filled with you.

620
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:22,230
Where did you learn this nonsense from?

621
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:29,150
What for? I saw it online,
some love encyclopedia.

622
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:36,431
What's so funny?

623
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,600
Mr. Yao, you should surf the Internet
less in the future.

624
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:45,431
I think you're already very good
just as you are.

625
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,232
My mom.

626
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,751
Hello? Mom. What's wrong?

627
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:05,070
Yu, come to judge the situation.

628
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:08,951
Zao did something for a child
that we don't even know,

629
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:11,110
and made Qiu cry terribly.

630
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,431
What is this all about?

631
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:19,351
Zao, I asked you to take your cousin
and Qiu out.

632
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:22,871
Instead, Qiu came back crying.
What happened?

633
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:27,791
You need to explain to everyone
clearly, Zao.

634
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,230
Mom, Qiu was in the wrong first.

635
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,791
I told him to bravely admit his mistake.

636
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,630
That's my son.
Why do you have to interfere?

637
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,630
Fang Jie, can you save it a little?

638
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,710
Zao, you are his uncle.
You should know who is closer

639
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,311
and who is the family. Just apologize.

640
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,431
No need. We're all family here.
It's not that serious.

641
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,351
Zao, just apologize.
