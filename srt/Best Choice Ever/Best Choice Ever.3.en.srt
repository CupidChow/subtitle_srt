2
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,976
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,792
Mom, let me help you.

4
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,792
Don't. Hurry and get out.

5
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,471
It's all fumes. Hurry and get out.

6
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,752
You'll get it all over you.

7
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:03,112
Go put on some makeup. Get out.

8
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:05,471
Why do I need to put on makeup at home?

9
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:17,392
Jialiang. Jialiang.

10
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:22,431
Mom? What brings you here?

11
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:24,952
You've forgotten again.

12
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,352
Didn't we agree on

13
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:29,271
meeting Mrs. Zhang
and Miss Zhang this afternoon

14
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:30,271
and having afternoon tea?

15
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,591
I've made arrangements.
I won't see them.

16
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,632
But I've made the appointment
and you won't see them?

17
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,151
No. Don't make any more arrangements.

18
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,912
It was your dad who arranged it.

19
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,751
What did my dad arrange this for?

20
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,912
It's all for your own good.

21
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:50,512
What does he want to do? Oh, my.

22
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,472
Jialiang. Jialiang.

23
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:54,551
I've made all the appointments.

24
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,711
Meet them first, alright?

25
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:59,912
Just for this time.

26
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,352
I'm just making an appearance.

27
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,711
I'll speak a few words and then leave.

28
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,632
- Mom, we're back.
- Dad. Zao.

29
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,512
The old wine has been bought.

30
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,072
Mrs. Liu sure knows
how to budget carefully.

31
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,991
She usually buys only half of
a green onion and a garlic bulb.

32
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,192
What a waste today.

33
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:21,431
It's for five of us.

34
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,031
Today is also the joyful day,
so it's not a waste.

35
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,512
- Mom, I'm back.
- You're back.

36
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,751
It's been thoroughly cleaned.

37
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,632
I can hardly recognize my home.

38
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,591
I told you that Zao would be fine.

39
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,431
Our son has grown up
and become sensible.

40
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:51,392
Right? We are elated
at Huan's celebration.

41
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,591
Just a few seconds of tidying.

42
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,991
Zao, I am amazing, right?

43
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:58,031
See? The house is
much more spacious, right?

44
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,232
Zao, don't mind it.

45
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:03,792
Thank you
for making room for me.

46
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,912
Tonight, I'll help you
put everything back in its place.

47
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:09,392
See? My sister loves me the most.

48
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,232
I'll go wash some wine glasses.

49
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,431
Tonight, our family
will have a good drink.

50
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,991
That's right.

51
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,751
- You've been checking your phone. Busy?
- Yes.

52
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:50,152
- Miss Zhang, what do you like to do?
- Reading.

53
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,272
What books are you reading?

54
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:56,071
- Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea.
- An ancient book.

55
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,592
Do you play video games?

56
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:01,991
What do you play then?

57
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,472
Taekwondo.

58
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,551
Real combat?

59
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:18,352
Miss Zhang, I'll be completely honest.

60
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:19,951
This meeting

61
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,032
has actually been arranged by
your father and mine.

62
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:23,431
I didn't intend to come.

63
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,712
Because I have a girlfriend.

64
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,152
And my girlfriend and I
are deeply in love.

65
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,311
The two of us are just
going through the process.

66
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,112
Please don't take it seriously.

67
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,551
So, you mean

68
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,751
that we just put on a show, right?

69
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,912
You are so clever.

70
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:44,152
This kid.

71
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,592
Well then. Let's add
each other on WeChat.

72
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,991
If you ever get tired of reading

73
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,152
or practicing Taekwondo,

74
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,032
and you want to play games or soccer,

75
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,551
I'll have my friend take you.

76
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:55,991
Come on. Scan my QR code.

77
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,912
- It seems they're getting along well.
- Right.

78
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,431
Let's not just watch them.

79
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,751
Try this butterfly pastry.

80
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,431
It's not very fancy but delicious.

81
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,232
- Have a try.
- Okay.

82
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,712
- It really tastes good.
- Not bad.

83
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,751
(Baby, I'm stuck in traffic.)

84
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,391
(Tell Auntie I'm sorry.
I'll be there soon.)

85
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:30,712
(Be safe. We'll wait for you.)

86
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,272
Shall we go out for a walk?

87
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,071
Let's check out the new arrivals.

88
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,912
I want to give
these two kids some space.

89
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,551
That's a good idea.

90
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,391
- Okay. Let's go then.
- Let's go.

91
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,032
Jialiang.

92
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:52,152
Shall we go to Hang Lung or Reel?

93
00:06:57,152 --> 00:07:01,272
Grandma, Xing'anli Garden
is still so beautiful.

94
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:03,511
Of course.

95
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:08,352
Cui and the others have
carefully maintained it for years.

96
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,391
Look, what do you think about this tree?

97
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,951
It looks a bit strange.

98
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:22,951
This tree was planted by you and me

99
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:27,391
in the spring of the year you left.

100
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:30,672
Look how tall it has grown now.

101
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,511
No wonder there is
a strange sense of familiarity.

102
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,951
Grandma, you have such a good memory.
I almost forgot.

103
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:45,152
Then, you went abroad with your parents.

104
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,391
So many years have passed.

105
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:53,871
Grandma, I have been thinking of you
all these years.

106
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:59,832
- I have missed you too.
- Let's go.

107
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:07,272
Zhiming, how is your father?
Is he still in jail?

108
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:09,751
I'm not sure.
He should be let out of prison soon.

109
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,592
How long can you stay this time?

110
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,391
About a year.

111
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,352
I haven't come to see you
for so many years.

112
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,152
This time,
I'll properly keep you company.

113
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,152
Okay, then I'll have you eat more.

114
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:26,751
Okay, Grandma.

115
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,792
Actually, I want to ask why you
decided to live in a nursing home.

116
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:32,712
That family didn't treat you well?

117
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,472
Nothing bad about them.

118
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,312
I married Mr. Mai midway through life.

119
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:41,791
It's normal that his son and I
don't get along.

120
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,791
I don't need him
to take care of me in my old age.

121
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:47,151
We live our separate lives
and it's quite fine.

122
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:52,511
Mr. Mai's granddaughter is a smart one.

123
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,952
Over the years,
she has often kept me company.

124
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,952
I've grown very fond of her.

125
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:02,031
By the way,
I heard she works at your hotel.

126
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,391
Is that so? I just got back
and haven't recognized everyone yet.

127
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,072
I'll invite her for tea.

128
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,552
Her name is Mai Chenghuan.

129
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:13,952
Let's go to the restaurant.

130
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:16,911
Is there anything you need to explain?

131
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,391
No. It's my fault.

132
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:22,791
Okay, then head to
the HR department and leave.

133
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,911
Madam, you're here.

134
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,271
You look well today.

135
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,712
We have fresh fish.

136
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:38,552
I'll have the chef steam one for you.

137
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,991
No need for fish.

138
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:44,352
Someone brought me a fish
caught from Songjiang yesterday.

139
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:45,952
My craving is satisfied.

140
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,391
- This is Zhiming, right?
- Mr. Cui.

141
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,671
It's been over a decade.

142
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:53,952
You've grown even more handsome.

143
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,312
Madam, as usual,

144
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,271
I'll serve you some butterfly pastries.

145
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,352
And almond croissants,
with a cup of Ceylon milk tea.

146
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,712
- Alright.
- The skimmed milk. For keeping fit.

147
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,552
Zhiming, what would you like to eat?

148
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,751
I'll have the same as you.

149
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,832
- Alright, then I'll go prepare.
- Okay.

150
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,911
Isn't that Chenghuan's...

151
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,712
All done, Miss Zhang.
Mission is completed.

152
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:28,352
Zhiming, wait for me inside for a bit.

153
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:32,112
Thanks for cooperation.
I'll be leaving now.

154
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,952
Jialiang, you're here too?

155
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:39,751
- Grandma, you're eating here too?
- Yes.

156
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,312
I just talked with Huan a few days ago.

157
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,712
I would find some time to visit you.

158
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,991
- This is?
- This is...

159
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,352
Grandma, I am his date.

160
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:56,472
Grandma, it's fake. All is fake.

161
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,751
Her father and my father arranged this.

162
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,368
Alright, you shall

163
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:04,631
solve it yourselves. Goodbye.

164
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:32,592
Like a starving man.

165
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,871
Jialiang isn't here yet.

166
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,112
Mom, I'm growing.

167
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,751
Fine. If I don't have the dishes,
I can have some rice, right?

168
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:52,312
This is from yesterday. I'll eat it.
You shall have some fresh ones.

169
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,911
Mom, don't keep having leftovers.

170
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,112
What's the problem?

171
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:58,592
I have had it for decades
and I am still fine.

172
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,432
Eat. Here's some fermented bean curd.

173
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:13,511
Dad, Mom. Jialiang said
he's still in a meeting.

174
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,271
He'll come over right after the meeting.

175
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:16,911
Still having a meeting this late?

176
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,991
No worries. Wait for him.
We'll eat when he arrives.

177
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,911
(Huan, I ran into Jialiang
on a blind date at Xing'anli.)

178
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:33,911
(He said it was arranged by his family.)

179
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:35,472
(You should know about it.)

180
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,151
It's Jialiang? He's here?

181
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,472
Jialiang said we don't
have to wait for him.

182
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,151
Let's eat while it's hot.

183
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,911
How can we not wait for him?

184
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,712
I made the dishes just for him.

185
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:01,511
We don't have to wait for him.
He can't make it today.

186
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,631
He said there's a big client
who won't leave.

187
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,871
So, he can't leave either.

188
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:08,352
Let's eat first. Dad, come on.

189
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:12,511
Didn't we schedule this dinner
a long time ago?

190
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,991
Why is he seeing a client again?

191
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,592
Huan, he should show us respect.

192
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:25,151
Alright. If I say we don't
have to wait, then we don't.

193
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,552
He's not coming today.

194
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:30,511
I'm going to pick up a package.
I'll be back soon.

195
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,391
Mom, I'm also going down
to pick up a package.

196
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:44,072
Alright, you're forced into it.

197
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,112
Xin Jialiang, I'm telling you,
my mind is a mess right now.

198
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,991
I don't want to see you. Don't come.

199
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,112
Let's calm down.

200
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:53,232
Don't calm down.
If we do it, it'll be over.

201
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,391
- Huan.
- What are you doing?

202
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,472
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

203
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:00,112
You misunderstood.
It really is a misunderstanding.

204
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:01,712
It's not what you think.

205
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,911
It's not a blind date.

206
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,991
That was work.

207
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,072
Xin Jialiang, I'm asking you
which part is actually the truth.

208
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,791
Is it true that your parents
wanted to see me?

209
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,952
Or is it true that your parents
asked you to go on a blind date?

210
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:17,112
- No, it's not
- You said they wanted to see me.

211
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,631
So is this how we're supposed to meet?

212
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:21,432
No. It's a misunderstanding.

213
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,832
I was just going through the process.

214
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:23,952
Because that person

215
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:26,671
is the daughter of one of my father's
business partners.

216
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:27,751
I had no choice but to go.

217
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,271
They were discussing business.

218
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:32,552
I just went over to tell her to give up.

219
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:33,952
Can you please understand me?

220
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,552
Understand you? Who understands me?

221
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,552
My mom started getting busy
early in the morning,

222
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,352
just for the dinner with you tonight.

223
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:44,791
If you really couldn't make it,

224
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,511
you should have explained
over the phone.

225
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,712
But then you just disappeared.

226
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,271
I had no idea what you were up to.

227
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,232
Xin Jialiang, you lied to me again.

228
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:54,552
I-I didn't lie to you
and it's not that I couldn't come.

229
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,871
Let me go upstairs and explain, okay?

230
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,952
For what? To tell my parents
you went on a blind date?

231
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,352
- It's not like that.
- Xin Jialiang.

232
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,911
You've made
my whole family be laughed at.

233
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,511
- I-I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

234
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,751
Huan, I'm sorry.

235
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,151
Can you let me go upstairs?

236
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,991
Xin Jialiang. Womanizer.

237
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,271
Treating Chenghuan
like a fish in your pond, right?

238
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,871
Mao, why are you hitting me?

239
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:20,952
I'm hitting you exactly.

240
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:22,271
Wait. Who is the womanizer?

241
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,112
It's you.
Why did you go on a blind date?

242
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,952
Who went on a blind date?

243
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,671
Why can't you forget it?
I didn't do that.

244
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:29,271
- Why you're here?
- Help you beat him up.

245
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:32,312
- Beat me? Huan.
- W-What are you doing?

246
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:34,952
Young man, is the car outside yours?

247
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,352
- Yes, it's mine.
- Move it. You're blocking the way.

248
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,511
- Sorry.
- Go move it. Don't block others.

249
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,112
- Stop talking.
- Hurry up.

250
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,952
Stop talking.
Your car is blocking the entrance.

251
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,671
You're inconveniencing everyone.
Just leave.

252
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,151
Yes, young man. Just leave.
You've completely blocked the way.

253
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,151
Hurry up and go before the police come.

254
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,991
- Just leave.
- Huan.

255
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:57,192
He went on a blind date. Oh, my.

256
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,871
- Mao.
- Zao, you have grown so tall.

257
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,151
Come on. Help me carry these.

258
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,592
Mao, why you're here?

259
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,112
Don't cry.

260
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,472
Came to see you and Godmother.

261
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,151
You have just arrived
and already witnessed the farce.

262
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,592
When you go upstairs,
don't tell my mom...

263
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,952
I won't say a word. Rest assured.

264
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:21,791
Let's go. Go home. Let's go.

265
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:27,151
Zao, you are about to graduate, right?

266
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:29,391
Are you going to pursue further studies
or look for a job?

267
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,352
I am looking for a job.

268
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,911
Mom, we're back.

269
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:42,031
- What about the package?
- I returned it.

270
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:46,271
- Returned it?
- However, I brought someone back.

271
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,511
There he came?

272
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:49,871
Godmother.

273
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,871
- Mao.
- Mao, you scared me.

274
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,151
Why are you here?

275
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:58,072
Because I miss you.

276
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:00,952
You told Huan I was heartless
for not coming to see you.

277
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,712
So, I came to apologize.

278
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,552
You should have done it early.
You haven't come for so long.

279
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:06,951
- Come on, sit down.
- Sit.

280
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,272
I'll sit with Godfather.

281
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:13,592
Why didn't you bring Dingding for me?

282
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,552
Let's eat and talk.

283
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,951
Jialiang really won't come?

284
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:22,871
He's not coming. Let's eat first.

285
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,871
Old wine can be useful for beautifying.

286
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,272
Okay, come on. Let's eat.

287
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,871
How long has it been since you came？

288
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,951
Thank you, Godmother.

289
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Zao, don't just stand there.

290
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,711
Bring a chair over here and sit with me.

291
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:38,792
Have a drink with your dad.

292
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:45,312
I haven't had
such a delicious meal for a long time.

293
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:48,671
The Goddess of the Kitchen in Suzhou
truly belongs to no one but you.

294
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:52,911
- Sweet talker.
- Look, six dishes and one soup.

295
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,471
Five pairs of chopsticks were used.

296
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,032
Come on. Dig in.

297
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,552
Jialiang was supposed to come.

298
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:12,352
Godmother, Huan is getting married.

299
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,431
But she is not going to
marry into the Xin Family.

300
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,711
It's already 2023.

301
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,951
For a girl, getting married

302
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:22,352
is just a bonus,
but not a necessity, right?

303
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,992
- Come on.
- Come on.

304
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,312
Mao, you have really got
a good marriage.

305
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:31,552
Look, you even have a child
and he's about to attend kindergarten.

306
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,671
But Huan hasn't even settled

307
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,671
and hasn't even gotten married yet.

308
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,552
I have something to tell you.

309
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:45,072
I got divorced.
Dingding is with his dad.

310
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,112
Why is it so sudden?

311
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:53,911
Weren't the two of you
madly in love before?

312
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,552
Did he do something wrong to you?

313
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:59,112
No, he didn't do something wrong.

314
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,871
We were young back then, right?

315
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:03,552
After getting pregnant,
I thought I might as well get married.

316
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,352
Who knew this great artist

317
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:08,951
just wanted a free nanny
after getting married?

318
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,032
But why should I

319
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,471
be a nanny for someone else, right?

320
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,552
I won't speak ill of my ex-husband.

321
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:16,552
I wish him a bright future.

322
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,231
- Already divorced?
- Yes.

323
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:28,911
You young people are really too hasty.

324
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:32,151
Once you're married,
can you just divorce as you like?

325
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:35,352
No marriage is devoid of trials
and tribulations?

326
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:39,151
Any issues should be
resolved through communication.

327
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,272
Divorce is not good for the child.

328
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:46,871
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

329
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,832
Huan, I brought you gifts.

330
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,352
Just fetch it.

331
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,992
You being here is enough.
Why brought gifts?

332
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:56,671
Exactly. You're surprising us.

333
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:57,752
She's often like this.

334
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:59,992
- I can't just eat and drink for free.
- So many. Look.

335
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,471
This heaviest one is for you.

336
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,151
My favorite. Really clever.

337
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:06,871
Godfather, here's your wool sweater.

338
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,391
I like the wool sweater.

339
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,352
The wool sweater. Let me see.

340
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:13,752
- The one of this brand is expensive.
- Thank you.

341
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,711
Zao, this is for you.

342
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,752
- Thank you, Mao.
- Hope you like it. Sit down.

343
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:19,272
It must have cost a lot of money.

344
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:22,711
- Not at all.
- Let's eat. Come on. Dig in.

345
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,912
A pen. Mao. He's just a kid.

346
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:27,711
You don't need to
give him such a good pen.

347
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,552
Our future lawyer
will have to sign big contracts.

348
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:32,832
It will be useful in the future.

349
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,992
Good. May you sign big contracts soon.

350
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:38,552
- Keep it up.
- Come on. Let's continue eating.

351
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:39,711
- Here, Godfather.
- Cheers.

352
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,032
- Come on.
- Come on, Godfather.

353
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,191
- Eat more.
- Alright.

354
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,871
How come no one had this fish?

355
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,552
The braised fish cooked
by your mom tonight

356
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,671
was quite tasty.

357
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:56,871
Thank you

358
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,592
for defending me in front of Ms. Liu.

359
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,951
No need. Isn't it what I should do?

360
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:07,871
I felt it was very hasty
when you married Song Huaimin.

361
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,151
You didn't listen when I advised you.

362
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:11,911
Because I was carrying Dingding.

363
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,151
Things happened too suddenly.

364
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,832
- Do you have plans later?
- No.

365
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:18,711
I'll take you to a good place. Let's go.

366
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,152
We're here.

367
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,592
This is the good place you mentioned?

368
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:32,711
Yes. I just rented it.

369
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:35,871
Ground floor for the jewelry store
and I live upstairs. How's that?

370
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,391
That's really great.

371
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,391
Such a good location
must have expensive rent, right?

372
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,151
It's okay. I got
a sum of money from the divorce.

373
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,512
I have some savings of my own as well.

374
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,552
Anyway, I've invested all into it.

375
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,871
Owning a boutique jewelry store
in the city center

376
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,871
has been my dream since I was young.

377
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:56,431
From now on, I'll cover

378
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,992
all your jewelry. How about that?

379
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,752
Boss Mao is really generous.

380
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:05,312
This lemon is sour
and this coffee is bitter.

381
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,552
Sour and bitter.

382
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,671
And the chips are spicy.

383
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,112
How is this eaten?

384
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,151
Here's also something sweet.

385
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,911
Sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy.
This is my worry-free combo meal.

386
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:25,151
It's as stimulating as a marriage.

387
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:27,711
What's the marriage like?

388
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,312
Is the marriage scary?

389
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,951
Only those who
have been through marriage

390
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,072
can really know what it's like.

391
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,512
Why don't you give it a try?

392
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,072
I think I'll pass.

393
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,151
I was just a bit inclined.

394
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,352
Then, I was made to be anxious
by my mom and Xin Jialiang.

395
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,471
And with your direct example,

396
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:53,911
I need to be
extra cautious with marriage.

397
00:22:56,671 --> 00:23:00,471
What exactly is going on
between you and Xin Jialiang?

398
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:02,471
Xin Jialiang is born
with a silver spoon.

399
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,992
Can you believe Deshan Home Furnishings
belongs to his family?

400
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:09,552
So, was he just acting
as a poor man all along?

401
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:10,792
And he even borrowed money from you.

402
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,832
He's been acting for so long.

403
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:16,592
See? He has fooled me for three years.

404
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:19,032
I had no idea at all.

405
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,752
Actually, many people
think I should be happy.

406
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,391
But I just can't manage to be happy.

407
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,911
The attitude towards life is strange.

408
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,711
When I first found out
he was from a wealthy family,

409
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:36,832
I was very angry.

410
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,471
Internally, I felt pleased.

411
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:42,792
I felt like I was opening a mystery box.

412
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,312
Suddenly, I hit a big prize.

413
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,471
All problems before me vanished.

414
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:51,112
An house and a car is
no longer an issue.

415
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,752
I was just thinking,

416
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,792
during the three years,

417
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:58,871
I had no other thoughts.

418
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,992
I just felt that marrying him

419
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,752
was a matter of course.

420
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:07,711
And my mother often says
I'm already twenty-nine.

421
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,151
I don't have many years left to waste.

422
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:14,871
As if getting married
is something I must do in my life.

423
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:18,191
Now, it seems I'm at a crossroads.

424
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,391
I am a bit unsure of what to do.

425
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:27,711
Mao, as we've reached this stage,

426
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:31,431
do we have to get married at this age?

427
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,512
Let me tell you,

428
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:40,752
there's nothing that is a must.

429
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:45,871
Being 29 is fantastic for girls.

430
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:48,832
Look at me. I'm divorced now.

431
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,592
I feel like my life is starting over.

432
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,191
And your name, Mai Chenghuan.

433
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,391
It meas reveling in the joy
of family time.

434
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:58,951
But it also means

435
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:03,151
that you should
enjoy life to the fullest.

436
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:05,032
So, what does this mean?

437
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,231
You should live happily in the present

438
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:09,631
and live well every day. Don't you agree?

439
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:12,711
I think you're right.

440
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,992
Marriage and relationships
are like clouds in the sky,

441
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:21,391
visible but ungraspable.

442
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,592
Only hard work can give me
a real sense of security.

443
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,911
- Right.
- Besides, even if I can't get married,

444
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,592
I just won't get married then.

445
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,391
I'll accompany you
and we'll travel together.

446
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:35,671
Sunbathing and admiring hot guys
is also quite nice.

447
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:40,352
Great. You must include me
when it comes to hot guys.

448
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,792
Come on. Cheers.

449
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,552
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

450
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:12,992
You're still up so late?

451
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:14,191
What are you up to?

452
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:18,992
I've been calculating.
It's still not enough.

453
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:22,391
- Calculating what?
- Huan's dowry.

454
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:25,992
You really are too careless.

455
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,832
You seem to be not in a hurry at all.

456
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,911
She is about to get married.

457
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,231
Then, we must prepare her dowry well.

458
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:38,631
Otherwise, it wouldn't be respectable.

459
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:43,752
We have just learned about
Jialiang's family background.

460
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:47,711
In fact, they have known about
our family background for a long time.

461
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,352
If he really looked down on
my daughter for this,

462
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:52,992
they would have broken up long ago.

463
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:59,792
- Is my bracelet worthy?
- Yes, it is.

464
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,992
And the two pairs of gold earrings
you gave me.

465
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:04,911
Also, there are two rings.

466
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:07,992
Look at the pendant.
There are two of them.

467
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:11,072
Along with several bankbooks.

468
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,871
It's getting to be more.

469
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,992
You wanted to sell all these things

470
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,671
to gather a dowry for Huan.

471
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,112
Here, take this watch as well.

472
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:23,032
Impossible. Are you joking?

473
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:27,072
This watch is
a memento of our marriage. No way.

474
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:33,592
Had we saved more money,
it would have been better.

475
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:37,072
We shouldn't buy things we don't need.

476
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:41,272
That way, we would
have saved a bit more by now.

477
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:46,191
You go to sleep first.
I'll do the calculations more carefully.

478
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,214
(Who is paying attention to "520"?)

479
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:39,764
(Continue the romance
and spend "520" with parents)

480
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,752
Mr. Yao,

481
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:45,792
(520 Love is all round)
this is my proposed plan for this event.

482
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:49,671
The relevant brands involved
have been contacted.

483
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:54,592
This is the event plan from last year
and it is for this year.

484
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:56,951
I would like to ask

485
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:00,592
if you are playing
Spot the Difference with me?

486
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:05,832
Mr. Yao, actually, right now,

487
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,832
the menu consists of the best-sellers
from previous years.

488
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:11,911
And the brand partners
we are collaborating with now

489
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,431
are also the best in the market, but...

490
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:17,512
If it's just about copying and pasting,

491
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,992
what do I need department managers for?

492
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,951
Where is your creativity?

493
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,352
- Next one.
- The next is me.

494
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:40,231
Hello everyone, my proposal
is to continue the romance

495
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:42,032
and spend "520" together with parents.

496
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:45,951
Miss Mai, innovation
isn't quite done in this way, right?

497
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:50,391
Mai Chenghuan, are you dating
along with your parents?

498
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:52,752
Aren't you financially independent

499
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,671
or emotionally detached yet?

500
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,191
Mr. Yao, perhaps you
have been abroad for too long

501
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,592
and are not very familiar with
our domestic marriage.

502
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:05,471
In China, the union of two people
is also the union of two families.

503
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,711
Moreover, let's not forget,

504
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:09,871
"520" is not like
Valentine's Day abroad.

505
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:11,752
It's not a holiday we must spend.

506
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:14,112
So customer stickiness isn't that high.

507
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,671
I think on the day of 520,
we can encourage

508
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,391
young people to celebrate
this day with their parents.

509
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,112
When parents are at the scene,

510
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,792
they can share with the young couples

511
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,431
their secrets to a loving relationship.

512
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,951
Also, parents can also share
their children's romantic mood,

513
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:36,552
making this day a celebration
for both parents and children together.

514
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,312
It can be said to serve
both love and family affection.

515
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:42,552
(Theme, Content, Arrangement)
If I had a boyfriend, I would

516
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:45,512
definitely have us
meet the parents on the day of 520.

517
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:49,512
If it were just a promotion,

518
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:50,512
it would be not intense enough.

519
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:52,871
I think it would be difficult
to attract more customers.

520
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:56,151
But if it's celebrated with the parents,

521
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,711
then we could attract
many family customers.

522
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:01,792
It would also benefit
the hotel's sustained development.

523
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:05,631
Good. We will use your plan then.

524
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:09,391
You will lead
the planning and execution.

525
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,352
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Mr. Yao.

526
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:20,671
Also, I have one more thing to say.

527
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:23,871
The core
of the hotel business is service.

528
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:26,552
We need to wholeheartedly
focus on the customer's experience.

529
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:30,552
This is the original intention
behind all of our planning.

530
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:32,832
I hope you can know it.

531
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:37,631
At the same time, I also hope
that all departments can unite as one.

532
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,512
I support healthy and fair competition.

533
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:45,112
But if someone intends
to use some underhanded tricks,

534
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:49,151
I will make them disappear from here.

535
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:54,512
Dismiss. Mai Chenghuan.

536
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:59,711
Sherry, please take it back for me.
Mr. Zhu, I will head over.

537
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,112
Okay, go on then.

538
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,512
Sit.

539
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,512
- Thank you, Mr. Yao.
- Let me introduce.

540
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,992
This is He Dong, my assistant.

541
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,231
You will coordinate with him
regarding the events.

542
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,352
He will assist you.

543
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:24,151
Understood. Assistant He.

544
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,752
You can call me He or Dong.

545
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:27,832
Or my English name,

546
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:30,711
- Dong. Got it?
- Yeah.

547
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,352
- Shut up.
- Yes.

548
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:36,191
I have another task for you.

549
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:38,592
Regarding the gifts for this event,

550
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,752
I require the products
from Deshan Home Furnishings

551
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:43,512
and I want the lowest price.

552
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,592
Mr. Yao, it was Sherry
who used to negotiate the prices.

553
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:50,671
I know, but you are
in charge of this event.

554
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:54,112
Isn't it good that I'm giving you
an extra opportunity to negotiate?

555
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:02,112
Mr. Yao, I have told you before
about my relationship with Deshan Home.

556
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:05,671
Is it not quite proper for me
to negotiate the price?

557
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,911
This is merely a simple
business engagement, Mai Chenghuan.

558
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,911
I think you might be overthinking it.

559
00:33:16,312 --> 00:33:19,352
If you're hoping
I use my boyfriend's connections

560
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,112
to get Deshan's lowest price,

561
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:24,711
then I'll have to
withdraw from this project.

562
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:30,112
You possess ample intelligence,
but you lack calmness.

563
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,832
You didn't even let me finish
before you started overthinking.

564
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:38,112
First of all, on what grounds do you
assume I asked you to negotiate prices

565
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:40,312
because of your boyfriend, Xin Jialiang?

566
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:45,752
Secondly, Deshan Home Furnishings
is already a supplier for Botticelli.

567
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:47,951
So if it were anyone else,

568
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,592
I would've said the same thing.

569
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,951
The reason I asked you to negotiate

570
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:54,032
is that I see potential in you.

571
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,671
I believe you can surpass yourself.

572
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,471
As for the price, I never specified.

573
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,512
This will depend on
your personal ability.

574
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:04,072
As long as it's within the budget.

575
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:08,191
Then I get it.

576
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,751
If there's nothing else,

577
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,311
I won't disturb you two any longer.
I'll take my leave now.

578
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,711
I find Mai Chenghuan to be quite honest.

579
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:28,791
Are you sure you want her
to continue being involved?

580
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:29,992
It doesn't matter.

581
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,392
She was originally an unexpected piece.

582
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,351
No harm in trying if it costs nothing.

583
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:44,711
How's it going?
Congratulations on the good start.

584
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:47,512
I'm not sure
if the boss took a liking to my proposal

585
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:49,872
or he was more interested
in my boyfriend.

586
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,751
You can't just make jokes about that.

587
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:56,231
What are you thinking?

588
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,512
Mr. Yao asked me to drive down
Deshan Home's price for the Gift Pack.

589
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:02,751
That's not difficult.

590
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,992
Just a matter
of talking with Xin Jialiang.

591
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,151
I'd like to take it if I could.

592
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,408
Chenghuan.

593
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:12,351
- This is yours.
- What's this?

594
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:13,711
It just got delivered by the courier.

595
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,151
- I brought it up for you on the way.
- Thanks.

596
00:35:18,631 --> 00:35:20,512
(Chenghuan, I'm sorry. Baby Liang)
What a good man.

597
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:21,831
Such a sincere apology.

598
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:24,432
Spill it. What big mistake did he make?

599
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:25,751
Nothing.

600
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:27,151
Come on. Tell us.

601
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:28,992
Just a little quarrel.

602
00:35:29,512 --> 00:35:31,671
Alright. Hurry back to work.

603
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,151
So gossipy, each one of you.

604
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:38,671
That's why you're embarrassed
to ask him for the price, right?

605
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,992
Not really. I was just thinking

606
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:44,831
work is work. Love is love.

607
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,952
I don't want to mix the two together.

608
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:50,311
Just treat him as a stranger
when it comes to work matters.

609
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,512
Just chat normally and relax.

610
00:35:52,512 --> 00:35:56,351
- Don't take it so seriously.
- Wait a moment.

611
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,215
(Jialiang)

612
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,512
(Busy)

613
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:13,592
Chenghuan really has a heart of stone.

614
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:16,072
He's like this already
and you don't even smile.

615
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:21,311
Our situation is quite complicated now.

616
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,112
And we're still arguing.

617
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:27,231
If you ask me,
you shouldn't take it too seriously.

618
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,952
Isn't this just the right opportunity?

619
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,952
Just go ask him for a lower price.

620
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,231
This way, your work problem
will be solved too

621
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,392
and you two will reconcile.
To kill two birds with one stone.

622
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:38,112
Don't pass up
the nearby for the distant.

623
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,191
Do you really want to break up with him?

624
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,072
Hurry up and get to work.

625
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,872
(Isn't this just the right opportunity?)

626
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:06,872
(Just go ask him for a lower price.)

627
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,112
(This way, your work problem
will be solved too)

628
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:11,351
(and you two will reconcile.
To kill two birds with one stone.)

629
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:13,231
(Don't pass up the nearby
for the distant.)

630
00:37:37,912 --> 00:37:39,671
It's five to zero now. Can you make it?

631
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:46,552
Bread. Take your stinky feet away.

632
00:37:49,592 --> 00:37:50,671
How are you two doing?

633
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,392
Not in good shape.

634
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,912
Could it be Huan?

635
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:05,032
- Who is it?
- Delivery.

636
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:08,831
Which one of you ordered the takeout?

637
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,392
- Not me.
- Not me.

638
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:11,711
Could it be a wrong delivery?

639
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:14,751
Is this Mr. Xin Jialiang's home?

640
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:21,952
- Guess it was my mom. Help me take it.
- Coming.

641
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:24,271
- Xueli.
- Chenghuan.

642
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:25,831
How's it going? Still smooth?

643
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:28,552
I've thought about it. I can't discuss
the price reduction with Jialiang.

644
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:31,751
Because once you start,
it becomes a bottomless pit.

645
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:35,311
- Chenghuan.
- Xueli, do you have the phone number

646
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,912
of the sales department manager
at Deshan Home?

647
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,592
Give me his number, will you?

648
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,592
I want to discuss it myself.

649
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,791
Alright, then I'll refer you.

650
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,912
You stubborn girl.

651
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:51,472
(This is the business card
of Deshan's sales department manager.)

652
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:53,032
(Best of luck.)

653
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:01,472
Got my hopes up for nothing.
I thought Huan had come.

654
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:02,751
What's that?

655
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:03,912
Stir-fried beef ho fun.

656
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:06,392
There you play. I'm going to eat.

657
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,872
Jialiang, but you are so silly.

658
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,631
Do you know

659
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:16,271
how difficult it is to coax a girl?

660
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,872
You have to buy a bag,
a necklace, and the like.

661
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:20,831
But you just bought some flowers.

662
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:24,231
Huan is not that kind of a vulgar girl.

663
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:29,952
But she is really angry this time.
What should I do?

664
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,392
Never mind.

665
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,151
Let me check my friend list.

666
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:34,392
I'll introduce you to some singles.

667
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,711
Shut up. I don't want that.

668
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,271
I just think Huan is good.

669
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:41,751
Didn't realize you're a masochist.

670
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,912
I have dignity when Huan is around.

671
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,231
Now that Huanhuan is not here,

672
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:55,432
my life is a mess.

673
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,992
So, you're just looking for a nanny.

674
00:39:58,512 --> 00:39:59,631
What are you talking about?

675
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:01,912
Huan is called passionate about life.

676
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:03,231
Life. Do you understand?

677
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:05,512
Daily life. Do you understand?

678
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:07,512
Xin Jialiang, what do you know?

679
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:10,711
Women want surprises
and they should be big ones.

680
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:14,191
Hurry. Three to one now.

681
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:15,512
Who's three? Who's one?

682
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,552
I'm three. Take a look.

683
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:31,872
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm from Botticelli.

684
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:33,872
I made an appointment
with Mr. Wang from the sales depart.

685
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,671
Okay, please hold on.
I'll check it for you.

686
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,952
Hello, is Mr. Wang in?

687
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,351
Okay, understood.

688
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,432
Mr. Wang has just stepped out
due to an emergency.

689
00:40:44,432 --> 00:40:46,912
If there's anything, you can tell me
and I'll pass on the message.

690
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,231
Then, when will he be back?

691
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:50,711
I'm not quite sure about that.

692
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,952
That's alright.
I'll wait for him here for a while.

693
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,191
- Okay.
- Thank you

694
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:37,872
A meeting tomorrow morning
and a dinner in the evening.

695
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:44,432
- Why is she still here?
- What should we do?

696
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:48,191
The supply line for Yueda
was fixed by Mr. Xin and Mr. Dennis.

697
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:49,528
We can't do anything about it.

698
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,112
Ms. Mai, sorry to keep you waiting.

699
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,992
Mr. Wang, I had arranged
to speak with you today to discuss

700
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:00,751
the supply price for the 520 event.

701
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:05,072
As the party B, we should be
the ones visiting you instead.

702
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:06,631
It's alright. Since I'm already here.

703
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:08,751
How about going to your office?

704
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,592
Look, it's already mealtime.

705
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:15,552
I can't have you chatting
on an empty stomach.

706
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:20,512
How about we have a meal
and talk while eating?

707
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,112
That works.

708
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,992
See, I told you
Mai Chenghuan is sincere.

709
00:42:32,072 --> 00:42:35,831
She just went to investigate
the cost price of the Deshan factory.

710
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:37,751
Now she's preparing to
make another appointment

711
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,512
with their sales department managers.

712
00:42:40,912 --> 00:42:42,592
It will be
another heavy drinking session.

713
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:45,112
I'm not clear about the others.

714
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:47,711
But as for the managers at Deshan,

715
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:50,231
when it comes to drinking,
one is better than the other.

716
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:53,512
Chenghuan

717
00:42:53,912 --> 00:42:56,592
really doesn't want to use
her boyfriend's resources at all.
