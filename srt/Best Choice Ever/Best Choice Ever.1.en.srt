=Episode 1=

3
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,307
It's almost half past ten.

4
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:52,507
Why hasn't Huan come back yet?

5
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,986
Did she say

6
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,787
why she would be late?

7
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:56,947
Huan said

8
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:58,507
she had to work overtime tonight.

9
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,626
Her office is just a street away
from home.

10
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,106
There's no need to worry.

11
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:06,746
Who says there is no need?

12
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,946
It could still be dangerous.

13
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,307
What if, just when she's coming back,

14
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,427
a bad guy suddenly pops out
at the entrance of the alley?

15
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:14,346
Wouldn't you worry?

16
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,547
Quick. Go pick her up.

17
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:16,707
Honey,

18
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,626
our daughter is already 29.

19
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,427
She's not a three-year-old child.

20
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,147
So what?

21
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,346
She's still a little girl to me.

22
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:25,547
Will you go?

23
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,547
Okay. I will.

24
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:27,906
Hurry up.

25
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:39,307
It's half past ten.

26
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,547
I need to get home.

27
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,307
Otherwise, my parents will be worried.

28
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,346
Stay a little longer.

29
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,547
Freedom is based on independence.

30
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,147
Alright, Xin Jialiang.

31
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,987
I'll bring you the cake
I made tomorrow, okay?

32
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:03,867
What now?

33
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,186
It's been three years.

34
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,707
You've never stayed for me.

35
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:13,587
Alright.

36
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,906
We can still video chat
at night, can't we?

37
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:21,906
What are you doing?

38
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:30,666
In the open air? It's embarrassing.

39
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:37,707
What are you doing?

40
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,107
Mom?

41
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:40,946
You!

42
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:41,867
Mrs. Mai.

43
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,226
Do you know what time it is now?

44
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:46,827
You don't want
to come home at all, do you?

45
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,867
You are too ill-mannered.

46
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:48,346
Mom.

47
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,387
You, don't talk.

48
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,307
Mrs. Mai, when I was driving Huan back,

49
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,107
it was jammed.

50
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,186
I was actually driving quite fast.

51
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:55,946
Jammed?

52
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,267
You sure?

53
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,147
What time is it now?

54
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:00,107
- It's ten o'clock now.
- Still jammed at half past ten?

55
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:02,066
You lie without realizing it, don't you?

56
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,027
It's not Jialiang's fault.
I'm the one who asked him out.

57
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,147
I was the one who came back late.

58
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,867
Step aside. We'll talk at home.

59
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,307
Are you out of your mind?

60
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:09,267
It's so late.

61
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,547
You were still doing that
on the road with her.

62
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,307
Are you insane?

63
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:14,307
You're not married.

64
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,626
Even if you're married, you can't

65
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:17,387
do that here so late at night.

66
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,507
Dad, what happened to your foot?

67
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,027
- You can't do that, even if you're...
- Dad!

68
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,906
- Do you understand?
- Mom, look at Dad's foot quickly.

69
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:23,187
What's wrong with your foot?

70
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,226
- What happened?
- I slipped.

71
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,187
I sprained my ankle.

72
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:29,267
You earn a living with your feet.

73
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,707
How could you sprain your ankle?

74
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,067
You're wearing slippers.

75
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,866
I've told you
not to go out wearing slippers.

76
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,147
- You had it coming.
- My tendon hurts!

77
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,666
Is it that serious?

78
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,707
Honey, do we have any plasters at home?

79
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:45,906
Mom, Dad sprained his ankle.

80
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,106
Help me up.

81
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:49,267
Do you think you've grown up?
You're taking his side.

82
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:50,507
What's wrong with you?

83
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,546
You're driving me crazy.

84
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:52,466
Watch out.

85
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,106
Huan, that guy just now

86
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,466
is too unreasonable.

87
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,187
Your dad sprained his ankle,
and he didn't even come over to help.

88
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:06,507
You scared me.

89
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:10,866
Look at you.

90
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,627
You're not wearing socks again.

91
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,147
Not wearing socks in this season
can make you catch a cold.

92
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:16,866
The cold starts at the feet.
Did you hear me?

93
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,027
You just won't listen.

94
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,827
Got it. I'll wear them now.

95
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:21,507
You are young.
You can't afford to catch a cold.

96
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,306
You still need to...

97
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:28,187
Tell me.

98
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,067
How far along

99
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,947
are you and Xin Jialiang?

100
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,466
What do you mean?

101
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:36,866
Have you done that?

102
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,106
What?

103
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,147
That!

104
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:45,226
Mom,

105
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,627
how could you ask me

106
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,187
such a question
that embarrasses both of us?

107
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,546
Besides, this is my privacy,
and it has nothing to do with you.

108
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:52,947
Privacy?

109
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,466
What's there to hide from me?

110
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,147
I can't believe you.

111
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,666
You're my own daughter.

112
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,906
Do you hear me?

113
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,546
Remember.

114
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,587
You can't do that
before getting married.

115
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,106
It's the girl who suffers.

116
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:06,267
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:09,666
Did he mention

118
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,387
getting married to you?

119
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:16,306
You really are carefree.

120
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,267
You're not worried at all.

121
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,106
You are turning 30.

122
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:22,747
Look at Mao.

123
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,666
She got married right after college

124
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,067
and had a kid
right after she got married.

125
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,226
Now her child is four years old

126
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:28,466
and in kindergarten.

127
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:29,387
Now look at you.

128
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,587
It gives me a headache
just thinking about it.

129
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,666
I get so anxious that I...

130
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:35,587
Listen.

131
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,187
If Xin Jialiang

132
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,187
doesn't start being proactive,

133
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,067
you should break up with him.

134
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:44,267
I'm not satisfied with him anyway.

135
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,666
You should find someone better than him.

136
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,707
I understand, Mom.

137
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,346
Well, the thing is,

138
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:50,986
I've just been enjoying myself

139
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:53,187
without considering
your or my dad's feelings.

140
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,947
I was really wrong.

141
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,947
So, I'll have a good talk with Jialiang

142
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,866
to plan our future. What do you think?

143
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:00,707
Really?

144
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:01,866
Yes.

145
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,507
Okay. I'll tell your dad in a bit.

146
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:07,707
How about you go
talk to Jialiang tomorrow

147
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,027
and have him talk to his parents

148
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:11,707
so that our two families can meet up

149
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,786
to discuss your marriage properly?

150
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:15,106
Okay.

151
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,267
Are you trying to fool me?

152
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,546
You won't let me speak, right?

153
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,707
Listen to me.

154
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,947
You should quickly put this
on the agenda.

155
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:23,306
I know.

156
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,747
My given name is Chenghuan.

157
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:26,067
It means being loved by you and my dad.

158
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:27,906
Your opinion is the most important.

159
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,707
Give me a hug.

160
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,666
Baby,

161
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:03,707
how was Mrs. Mai later?

162
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:04,947
Is she still mad at me?

163
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,306
Not anymore.
I've already coaxed her. Don't worry.

164
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:09,947
Baby, you are amazing.

165
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:11,666
Mrs. Mai seemed like

166
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,786
she wanted to scratch me.

167
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,106
Nonsense. My mom is not a tigress.

168
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,426
Jialiang,

169
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,466
previously, when you met my mom,

170
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,666
you didn't leave
a good impression on her.

171
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,507
And she doesn't know you well.

172
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,187
How about we

173
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:31,466
find a time for you to come over
to our place for a formal meal?

174
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,347
Then I have to
properly prepare myself mentally.

175
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:36,507
I should play a game later
to calm my nerves.

176
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,347
Stop playing games.

177
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,586
You have to work early tomorrow.

178
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,507
Go to sleep quickly.

179
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,306
I just requested to play a game.

180
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,066
Alright. If you say so, I won't play.

181
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,107
Why aren't you sleeping?

182
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:52,467
I plan to bake a bit more
for my parents in a while.

183
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,147
You're so filial.

184
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:55,706
Jialiang,

185
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,586
I think between a child

186
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:01,586
and a mom, as long as it's above
the bottom line, there's no conflict.

187
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,666
With some effort,
everything can be balanced.

188
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:04,747
What do you think?

189
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:07,586
Okay. I'll pick you up
after work tomorrow.

190
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,666
Got it. Good night.

191
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:10,666
Good night.

192
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,906
Why the rush?

193
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,666
A new director has come
to inspect the hotel.

194
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,706
I need to go help.

195
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,747
Don't wait for me for dinner.

196
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,987
Aren't you eating?

197
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,706
Give me a hug.

198
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,107
Be careful on the road.

199
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,467
Dad, I'm leaving.

200
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,586
Mr. Zhu, the new director
is coming today.

201
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:16,586
I'll go and help out first.

202
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,467
Chenghuan, off to work?

203
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,906
Mr. Liu, you've grown the flowers well.

204
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,784
(Sanheli)

205
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,387
Jialiang, are you awake?

206
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:33,347
Remember to have breakfast
once you're up.

207
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:39,387
Hello?

208
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,066
Watermelon?

209
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:44,387
Okay.

210
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:53,507
Hello?

211
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,267
I got it. I will be there soon.

212
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,066
Morning, Chenghuan.

213
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:11,906
Morning.

214
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:13,906
Morning.

215
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,546
Morning.

216
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:18,387
Hold the elevator.

217
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,186
Sorry. Good morning.

218
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,507
Wu You also asked you
to bring something?

219
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,347
Sherry, can you get my phone for me?

220
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:34,507
Thank you.

221
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,387
Mom, what's up? I'm in the elevator.

222
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,987
You didn't make it clear
to me last night.

223
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:40,946
Did you

224
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:42,786
and Jialiang sleep or not?

225
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,586
I... I don't have a signal
in the elevator.

226
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,706
Mom, I'm going to hang up.

227
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,706
Excuse me.

228
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,586
Sorry, sir.

229
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,467
Sir, please wait a moment.

230
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:07,867
Could you put my boyfriend's cake

231
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:09,306
in the fridge for me?

232
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,546
And this is for Wu You.

233
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:12,507
Sir.

234
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,987
Sir, sorry about earlier.

235
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,306
I got your clothes dirty.

236
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,747
I have a stain remover pen here.

237
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:21,347
The stain will be gone
after applying it.

238
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:22,387
Let me apply it for you.

239
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,147
Then press it with a tissue.

240
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,706
It should be fine in a moment.

241
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:42,747
Thank you.

242
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:43,507
You're welcome.

243
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:45,747
I am an employee
of Botticelli's sales department.

244
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:46,987
It's what I should do.

245
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:48,987
Here's your tip.

246
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:49,987
No need.

247
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,706
Sir, our hotel policy
prohibits accepting tips.

248
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,267
Besides, it was my fault just now.

249
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,467
I dirtied your clothes.

250
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:56,946
Now, please excuse me.

251
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,107
By the way, sir.

252
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:02,147
Welcome to the Botticelli Hotel.

253
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,467
Wish you a pleasant stay here.

254
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:13,906
Jialiang.

255
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:15,706
Mom, you're here.

256
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,186
Why didn't you go to the office today?

257
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,467
I came straight back
after finishing my business.

258
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,867
The chicken soup was just made at home.

259
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,387
I brought it specially for you.
Have a sip while it's hot.

260
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:27,507
I won't drink it.

261
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,267
Put it in the fridge. I just ate.

262
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,147
You should come back to stay at home.

263
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:32,666
Won't that be better?

264
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:34,706
I'm not going back.

265
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,987
I'm busy dating.

266
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,546
It looks like
you're living quite comfortably.

267
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,987
Your fridge is full.

268
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:03,786
As your mom,

269
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:05,867
I have no role to play anymore.

270
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,306
Don't worry, mom.

271
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,267
With Huan,

272
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,826
your son won't go hungry.

273
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,706
Mai Chenghuan, that alley princess?

274
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:14,826
Mom,

275
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,467
Huan is a really good girl.

276
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:18,867
Don't talk about her like that.

277
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:19,987
Does she know

278
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:21,546
what our family does?

279
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:26,306
Just thinking about it
gives me a headache.

280
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:27,987
At first, I wanted to tell her,

281
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,706
but everyone was stopping me.

282
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:31,786
Now it's too late.

283
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:33,186
I have no chance to speak.

284
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,267
With the hundreds of millions
of assets our family has,

285
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:38,546
there's really nothing much to hide.

286
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,107
Jialiang, you're still too naive.

287
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,706
Marriage is something
that must be carefully considered.

288
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,906
Your statuses are different,
and you're on different levels.

289
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,546
Isn't there a saying

290
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,107
that one must not be without the caution
of guarding against others?

291
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:53,107
Oh, my.

292
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,306
I was so engrossed in chatting with you.

293
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,066
I'm going to lose again.

294
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,656
(Ladies' Dressing Room)

295
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,706
Can you wipe this a bit faster?

296
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,306
Yan, clean that chair as well.

297
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:20,186
Why isn't this projector set up yet?

298
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:23,786
The new director
just returned from abroad.

299
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:25,706
His first impression of us
is very important.

300
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:26,987
Lily.

301
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,347
Are all the fruit plates here?

302
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:30,706
They've just sent over six plates here.

303
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,706
The amount isn't enough.

304
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:34,066
We are six plates short.

305
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:34,987
We are?

306
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:35,467
Right.

307
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,546
Lily.

308
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,906
Can't you even
arrange the fruit plates properly?

309
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,507
Do you not want to work here anymore?

310
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:41,867
Where's the cake?

311
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,147
I forgot!

312
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,107
What's the use of ordering it now?

313
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,387
Isn't there one here?

314
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:47,706
Use this one.

315
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:48,786
This cake...

316
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:51,507
Wait. This is the one
I made for my boyfriend.

317
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,027
Chenghuan, I know you make good cakes.

318
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,666
Let's use this one for now
to tide us over.

319
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,666
Just for now, Chenghuan.

320
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,066
It's not that I don't want to help you.

321
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,306
I wrote something on it,
and you can't use it.

322
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:00,586
You did?

323
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,467
Then forget it, You.

324
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,267
It's okay. We'll figure something out
for the cake.

325
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,147
Okay.

326
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,107
Mom.

327
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:16,946
Huan, have you asked Jialiang or not?

328
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,786
If you are too embarrassed to ask,

329
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,306
bring Jialiang back home.

330
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,347
And I'll talk to him.

331
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,627
Mom, I'm at work right now.

332
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:24,987
Can we wait till I get off work?

333
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:26,347
Hello, Mr. Yao.

334
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,147
I need to go. Our boss is here.

335
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:38,706
You...

336
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,147
Mr. Yao.

337
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:44,867
Hello, Mr. Yao.

338
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:50,306
Did you make this cake?

339
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,666
Yes, I made it.

340
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,426
How many years have you worked here?

341
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:58,387
Seven years.

342
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:00,426
With seven years of work experience,

343
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,507
you just placed a cake
you baked yourself

344
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,146
on the business meeting table like this?

345
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:07,346
Have you ever thought

346
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:08,987
about how the guests would feel?

347
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:13,667
(Make do)
Mr. Yao, it's a misunderstanding.

348
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,507
The cake probably
hasn't been removed in time...

349
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,707
Do you have anything to explain?

350
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:28,346
No, it's my fault.

351
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:33,386
Okay, go to the HR. You're fired.

352
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,987
Chenghuan, I'm sorry.

353
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:43,106
I did take the cake over just now.

354
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,866
Isn't this the cake
Chenghuan made for her boyfriend?

355
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,106
Why did you open it?

356
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:49,427
Let's use it for a moment.

357
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:50,146
That's all.

358
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:50,947
Don't.

359
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:53,146
Mr. Yao is here.

360
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,227
- Hello, Mr. Yao.
- Mr. Yao.

361
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,800
(Make do)

362
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:12,747
Who is responsible?

363
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:16,106
Mai Chenghuan is.

364
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,267
I'm sorry, Chenghuan.

365
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:20,707
It's all my fault.

366
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,106
I'll go and explain it to Mr. Yao.

367
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,786
I know it's definitely not your problem.

368
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,227
Chenghuan, I think Mr. Yao

369
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,146
is deliberately finding fault.

370
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,507
Your leaving might not
necessarily be a bad thing.

371
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:33,427
You might as well

372
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,866
find a better place.

373
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,106
Wu You, I find you really amusing.

374
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,386
I came to help you today.

375
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,386
Now that there's a problem,
you're making snide remarks.

376
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,586
Do you want to go with me to Mr. Yao now

377
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:47,747
to tell him everything?

378
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,586
For the Botticelli Hotel in Shanghai,

379
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,146
I am a newcomer.

380
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:56,947
And I hope that my joining

381
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,106
can assist Dennis

382
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,346
in taking Botticelli to the next level,

383
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,467
making our hotel

384
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,187
stand tall
by the bustling Huangpu River,

385
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:07,866
and become one

386
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,707
of the most brilliantly shining pearls.

387
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:11,427
Thank you.

388
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,027
But in reality,

389
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:19,707
from large items
like furniture and decor

390
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,586
to small items
like supplies and consumables,

391
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,267
it has been four consecutive years

392
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:25,866
since our hotel last had an open tender.

393
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,467
Our hotel's furnishings and concepts

394
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,227
have already started to fall behind.

395
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:32,346
Do you think this is normal?

396
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,106
Ms. Zhang,

397
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:39,987
the metabolism
of a large hotel's supply chain

398
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,546
needs to be gradual.

399
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:46,427
Mr. Yao
has rich hotel management experience.

400
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:47,586
On this point,

401
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,227
he should have more say.

402
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,626
Hotel linens and consumables

403
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,866
require long-term understanding
and experience.

404
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,227
Suddenly changing brands and suppliers

405
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,987
will cause the hotel to malfunction

406
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,507
once a problem arises.

407
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,546
So, on this point,

408
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,747
I agree with Dennis's opinion.

409
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,866
For Botticelli,

410
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:17,187
currently, stability
is the most important thing.

411
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:23,227
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

412
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:30,987
Mr. Yao.

413
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:34,106
Why haven't you
processed your resignation yet?

414
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:36,987
I think what you just said is correct.

415
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,707
I'm here to apologize to you.

416
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:39,987
I don't need an apology.

417
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,907
Mr. Yao, could you please

418
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:46,306
give me one more chance to make amends?

419
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,227
Then why didn't you explain at the time

420
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,386
that the cake was set on the table
by someone else?

421
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:53,146
Look.

422
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:55,427
I have already given you a chance.

423
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:56,747
Mr. Yao.

424
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,187
Mr. Yao.

425
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,507
Hello, Mr. Yao.

426
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,866
I'm Zhu Zheng, the manager
of the Marketing and Sales Department.

427
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:07,866
I heard
you want Mai Chenghuan to resign.

428
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,866
Mai Chenghuan is the best employee

429
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,306
in our department.

430
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:12,586
How about this?

431
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:13,866
Regarding this matter,

432
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:14,947
I will draw up

433
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,346
a detailed report for you

434
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,106
to clarify the situation. Is that okay?

435
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:22,626
Mr. Yao, the cake was mine.

436
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,626
It was my responsibility

437
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,947
not to stop them from putting the cake
in the meeting room in time.

438
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:28,467
I just felt that

439
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,386
everyone blaming each other
after something happened

440
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,747
was not what the management
wanted to see.

441
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:35,546
Listen to me.

442
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,707
In the workplace, people who don't know
how to protect themselves

443
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,546
are not worthy of sympathy.

444
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,546
You don't expect

445
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,707
someone else to stand up
for you, do you?

446
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:47,747
Mr. Yao,

447
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,586
Mai Chenghuan is an employee
of my department.

448
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,027
I take full responsibility
for any problems that arise.

449
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,187
How will you do that?

450
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,146
No one gets a second chance from me.

451
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,987
Since you want to play Miss Nice,

452
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:02,866
I'll let you be.

453
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:12,267
(Baby,)

454
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,947
please cheer up, okay?

455
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:18,747
If it comes to it, just quit the job.

456
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:20,546
And I'll support you.

457
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:24,027
You support me?

458
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,826
Xin Jialiang,

459
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,066
the phrase 'I'll support you'

460
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,386
sounds touching at first.

461
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:32,546
But in reality,
it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

462
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:35,386
Palm up for a day

463
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,386
is cute, coquettish, and charming.

464
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:40,546
With palms up daily for ten years,

465
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,467
it turns into a horror story.

466
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,267
When I say I'll support you, I will.

467
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:46,987
Whether it's 10 years, 20 years,

468
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:48,546
50 years, or 70 years,

469
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,066
I will support you.

470
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:59,106
With that little salary
you get every month,

471
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,907
it's good enough
if you can support yourself.

472
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:06,947
Then

473
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:08,907
what do you plan to do next?

474
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:14,586
I plan to go to Mr. Yao again tomorrow.

475
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,187
Go see him and argue with him.

476
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:18,106
Just do it.

477
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:19,907
Nonsense.

478
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,187
I've worked hard for seven years.

479
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,907
I've made up my mind.

480
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,146
A wise woman
does not suffer immediate losses.

481
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:28,386
Even if I have to swallow my pride,

482
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,826
I must secure my position.

483
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:32,586
Yes.

484
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:33,987
Besides,

485
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:35,987
the management of your company

486
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:37,786
must all be intelligent.

487
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:39,386
If he's intelligent,

488
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:43,747
he wouldn't fire
such a cute little bunny like you.

489
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:47,947
Cute little bunny? I bite, you know.

490
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,267
Jialiang,

491
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,386
it's just a shame about that cake.

492
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:54,826
I made it especially for you.

493
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,106
You didn't even get to see it.

494
00:23:58,027 --> 00:23:59,546
It's okay.

495
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,467
I feel sweet inside.

496
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,386
Then where's my gift?

497
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:07,386
What gift?

498
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,707
You haven't forgotten, have you?

499
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:20,786
What are you looking for?

500
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,027
What's this?

501
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,907
Chenghuan, Chenghuan, I love you.

502
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,626
I want to stick with you always.

503
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:31,586
Chenghuan, Chenghuan, I love you.

504
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,386
I want to stick with you always.

505
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:35,146
- Chenghuan, Chenghuan...
- Are you silly?

506
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,027
I want to stick with you always.

507
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,106
Thank you, Jialiang.

508
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,106
I like this gift very much.

509
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,747
It's so good to have you.

510
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:48,146
You think just thanking is enough?

511
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:02,747
Who's this? I really want to punch them.

512
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:05,987
I'm sorry.

513
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,467
It's your mom.

514
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:09,187
A phone call for me?

515
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:11,064
(Mom)

516
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:13,987
Your mom is pretty amazing.

517
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:15,786
At critical moments,

518
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:17,826
she always shows up.

519
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:22,546
Let's go. I've booked a restaurant.

520
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:25,826
I'm taking you
to celebrate our three-year anniversary.

521
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:27,346
Let's go.

522
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:27,987
Go.

523
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,546
My sunflower.

524
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:43,907
Are you still angry at me, Ms. Zhang?

525
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:47,187
Your acting was so good.

526
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:49,786
So?

527
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,106
Ziyu

528
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:52,947
has torn down your place, hasn't she?

529
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,586
She asked me to bring this to you.

530
00:25:58,187 --> 00:25:59,826
She doesn't have
that kind of filial piety.

531
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,027
I'll be happy
as long as she doesn't upset me.

532
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,507
I feel like
I've really found a treasure.

533
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:09,306
At your unluckiest moment,

534
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:10,467
I gave you a hand.

535
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,187
And now I dare to leave my daughter,

536
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,507
who gives me a headache, in your hands.

537
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:16,667
You're welcome.

538
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:20,066
This time, aren't you here

539
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,106
to take my side

540
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,467
and lend me a hand?

541
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:25,427
Of course, I am.

542
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,786
We have our friendship.

543
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,386
And interests don't lie.

544
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:32,106
It's just that I think
Dennis won't spit out

545
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:34,106
this fat piece
of merger and development.

546
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:36,146
We have to pull him down first.

547
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:38,386
Which fat piece are you eyeing?

548
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:39,386
Are you confident?

549
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:40,467
Don't worry.

550
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:43,027
Once I get Xing'anli,

551
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,146
I'll return to the headquarters

552
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:45,586
and leave this place to you.

553
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:46,626
It takes

554
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,427
a year at most.

555
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:50,267
Okay.

556
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:53,386
Help me kick out Dennis.

557
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,747
And one year later,

558
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:56,707
when I become president
of the East China region,

559
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:59,507
the merit of the acquisition is yours.

560
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:01,586
I will definitely help you

561
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,507
with your promotion at the headquarters.

562
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:05,346
Cheers.

563
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:12,106
Today at the meeting,

564
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,227
did you discern any signs?

565
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:16,027
Rigidity.

566
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:19,187
It lies with the hotel staff

567
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,586
and the management.

568
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,987
I see that Dennis
has a very big appetite.

569
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,586
From the room furnishings
to sanitary ware,

570
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:30,386
bedding, toiletries,

571
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,987
(and even the grammage of memo paper)

572
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,106
(and the refill of ballpoint pens,)

573
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:36,346
they are shrinking.

574
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:38,747
Then what do you plan to do?

575
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:42,346
I'll start from here.

576
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,187
Are you sure you want
to start with this company?

577
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:51,306
He and Dennis

578
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,427
have gone way back.

579
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:55,987
Yes, I'm sure.

580
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:59,096
(Shanghai Deshan Home Furnishings)

581
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,786
You're new here.

582
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,987
I'm assigning my most trusted driver

583
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:04,947
to you.

584
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,306
This is Mr. Mai,

585
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:09,907
who has saved my life.

586
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,106
Ms. Zhang, I'm flattered.

587
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:14,346
Mr. Mai, you must
take good care of Mr. Yao.

588
00:28:14,346 --> 00:28:15,187
Rest assured.

589
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:16,987
Hello, Mr. Yao.

590
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:18,987
If you need anything in the future,

591
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:20,027
just let me know.

592
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:22,187
Please.

593
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:24,386
Bye.

594
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:26,267
Please.

595
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:36,907
I want this one.

596
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:40,467
And one set each
for sleeve hooks No. 1, 2, and 3.

597
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:41,907
And the five-point-zero thread.

598
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:45,066
Sir, I can tell you're a pro.

599
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:46,907
But the five-point-zero thread

600
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:47,907
is already sold out.

601
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:49,306
You are one step too late.

602
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:51,267
And the two-point-five one?

603
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,866
It is also sold out.

604
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:53,586
Mr. Yao.

605
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:55,346
What a coincidence!

606
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:57,507
Are you following me?

607
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:58,786
No.

608
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,826
I heard that you like fishing.

609
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,187
So I thought of catering to you

610
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,507
by visiting the top fishing gear shop

611
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:04,866
to pick out something for you.

612
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:06,747
I didn't expect
to run into you by chance.

613
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:08,227
I sort of

614
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,667
bought the thing you needed most.

615
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,907
What is this? Are you bribing me?

616
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,306
Mr. Yao,

617
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:19,106
I would like to fight
for one more chance

618
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:20,747
to explain myself to you.

619
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,467
If you mind receiving gifts,

620
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:24,826
once you catch the fish

621
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:26,106
and treat my colleagues to fish soup,

622
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,626
you can let me share a bowl of it.

623
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,586
Consider that the repayment
for my kindness.

624
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,987
I don't mind. Thank you.

625
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:33,227
How much is it?

626
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:36,866
Hello?

627
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,306
Mr. Yao, I have already reported
to the headquarters.

628
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:41,187
This time, the bidding is open.

629
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,707
Dennis has no objections.

630
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,667
And Mr. Li wants you
to get there within an hour.

631
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:46,866
If you can't make it,

632
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,346
he'll invite you to fish next time.

633
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,106
Thanks.

634
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:50,106
What?

635
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,826
Do you want me
to fly to Songjiang in an hour?

636
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:55,146
Also, the girlfriend of Xin Jialiang,

637
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:57,306
Deshan Home Furnishings' heir,
works at our hotel.

638
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:58,264
Her name is Mai Chenghuan.

639
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:01,987
Are you sure?

640
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:02,907
Absolutely.

641
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,027
Okay, I got it.

642
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,907
Mr. Yao, may I
take ten minutes of your time?

643
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,027
My time is valuable.

644
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,306
I have no time for you.

645
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,507
Mr. Yao, then...

646
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:16,947
Mr. Mai.

647
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:18,386
Mr. Yao.

648
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:20,586
- Dad?
- Huan?

649
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,427
What are you doing here?

650
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:22,987
Well...

651
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:24,907
Mr. Yao just returned from abroad.

652
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:26,106
Ms. Zhang asked me

653
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:28,546
to drive for him starting today.

654
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:32,027
Dad, Mr. Yao is my boss.

655
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:36,027
Mr. Mai, I need
to get to Songjiang within an hour.

656
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:38,747
It's rush hour right now.

657
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:40,707
Rushing to Songjiang in one hour

658
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,146
is not very likely.

659
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,467
Then tell me what to do.

660
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:45,306
Well...

661
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:47,106
Mr. Yao,

662
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:50,386
I have a way to get you
to Songjiang in one hour.

663
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:02,346
You can hold on here.

664
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,106
Mr. Yao, it will be nine stops

665
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:10,066
and 40 minutes in total.

666
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:10,907
And after we arrive,

667
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,267
a ten-minute ride
on a shared bike will get us there.

668
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,626
Riding a shared bike?

669
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,187
What if the other party
sees me like that?

670
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:23,187
Then let's not park the bikes
at the entrance.

671
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:25,427
That's better than being late.

672
00:31:28,106 --> 00:31:30,227
Mr. Yao, it was my fault last time.

673
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:32,667
You can deduct my performance
this quarter.

674
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:35,106
I promise I will not
make such a mistake again.

675
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:39,507
I've been among the top performers
in the company for three years.

676
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:42,306
You can take a look
at the actual salary I received.

677
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:44,707
Now, a marketing sales manager

678
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:47,346
with five years of work experience
in the market

679
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:49,106
won't cost you
less than 15 thousand yuan per month.

680
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:50,546
For the company,

681
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,826
I am still the best candidate

682
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:53,546
for this position.

683
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,667
I hope you can give me
another opportunity to make amends.

684
00:31:58,507 --> 00:31:59,826
If I'm late,

685
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:01,707
you'll have to pack up and leave.

686
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:04,586
No problem.

687
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:06,786
(Mind the gap when getting on and off.)

688
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:09,187
(Please watch your step.)

689
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:11,267
Sorry, Mr. Yao.

690
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:11,866
Sorry.

691
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,227
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

692
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:19,987
Mr. Yao, this way.

693
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,987
Mr. Yao, please ride this bike.

694
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,546
I've scanned it for you.

695
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,146
Mr. Yao, we must go now,
or it will be too late.

696
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,386
Please bear with it.

697
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:45,546
Follow me.

698
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:07,187
Mr. Yao,

699
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:09,907
we arrived 15 minutes earlier
than expected.

700
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,106
It seems you're useful after all.

701
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:14,106
Mr. Yao, do I still

702
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:16,227
need to pack up and leave?

703
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,346
And about my initial promotion...

704
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:18,386
I will give you another chance.

705
00:33:19,987 --> 00:33:20,947
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

706
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:23,467
I will certainly correct my faults
and strive to do better.

707
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,786
Tomorrow, someone
will talk to me about cooperation.

708
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,427
But I can't see him.

709
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:31,027
You go and receive him
on behalf of me as my secretary.

710
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,546
And you must not offend him.

711
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:35,066
Let's talk about your work
after you've taken care of this.

712
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,106
I understand. I will do my best.

713
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:38,907
Okay.

714
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,507
I will have my assistant
send you his contact information.

715
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:43,106
Okay.

716
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,106
Mr. Yao, please take this.

717
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:48,747
Also.

718
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:52,146
Here.

719
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,027
And this book is a gift for you.

Best wishes on your big catch.

721
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,227
Goodbye, Mr. Yao.

722
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:10,827
Dad, don't worry.

723
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:11,987
The matter has been settled.

and Other Domestic Furniture Companies)

726
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,827
Isn't that the company
where Jialiang works?

727
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,027
No, I can't do this.
It's against the rules.

728
00:34:43,427 --> 00:34:44,867
Did you talk to Jialiang about it?

729
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,427
Mom,

730
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:49,987
remember to knock on the door
when you come in.

731
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:52,387
I'm asking if you've talked to Jialiang.

732
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,226
Did you discuss your marriage plans?

733
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,266
And what did he say?

734
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:56,746
We've both been very busy lately.

735
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:57,666
He has to work overtime.

736
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:58,507
I need to do research.

737
00:34:58,507 --> 00:34:59,507
There's simply no time.

738
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:03,666
If you don't have time to meet,
you can call him

739
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,947
and talk about it on the phone.

740
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,066
It's better to discuss such a thing
face-to-face.

741
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,266
Give me a little more time.

742
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,266
Then make it tomorrow.

743
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:10,907
Tomorrow is the deadline.

744
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:11,947
You must talk about it.

745
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:14,027
Wait.

746
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:15,907
Why tomorrow?

747
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,427
Tomorrow is too soon.

748
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:19,226
Then why don't you call him now?

749
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:23,787
Alright, I'll talk
to him tomorrow. Okay?

750
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,146
Zao will be home tomorrow.

751
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:26,586
Ask Jialiang to come to our place

752
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:28,626
and discuss the wedding plans properly.

753
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,186
This is a big deal.

754
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:31,827
It needs to be on the agenda.

755
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,307
I don't see him being proactive at all.

756
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,507
That's right.

757
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:36,867
If he's not proactive, forget about it.

758
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,186
I'm not satisfied with him anyway.

759
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,186
You can break up with him
and find someone better.

760
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,146
It's not like you can't.

761
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:44,867
Mom, where are you going with this?

762
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,226
Haven't I already agreed to it?

763
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,706
I'll tell him tomorrow.

764
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:50,027
Remember, it's tomorrow.

765
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:53,626
Don't stay up late.

766
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:54,387
Okay.

767
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,387
Remember, it's tomorrow.

768
00:35:58,546 --> 00:35:59,546
I got it.

769
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,467
Honey.

770
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:15,106
Honey.

771
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:18,106
Are you pushing her

772
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:20,307
too hard like this?

773
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:21,467
If I don't bring it up,

774
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:22,987
Xin Jialiang will be

775
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:24,546
leading her on, you know?

776
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:26,947
Our daughter is the girl.

777
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,546
She's going to have babies.

778
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:30,427
She can't delay it.

779
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:31,987
Listen,

780
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:33,467
if that guy

781
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:35,307
continues to be sly,

782
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:36,867
I'll make her

783
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:38,546
break up with him.

784
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:42,146
This is called
breaking up a pair of lovers.

785
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,827
She should marry someone she loves.

786
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:46,626
We're not after anything from them.

787
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:48,827
As long as he's good to Chenghuan,
that's all that matters.

788
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:50,266
Just being good is enough?

789
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:52,387
Can it give her a big place to live?

790
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,347
Can it give her a car to drive?

791
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,387
"Good"?

792
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:56,987
It's been three years already.

793
00:36:56,987 --> 00:36:58,626
I haven't seen him make any progress.

794
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:00,027
What does that mean?

795
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:01,867
It means he has no future.

796
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,347
Our own family's situation
is just so-so.

797
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:05,947
And you still don't get it.

798
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,226
Listen to me.

799
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,746
If Chenghuan marries him,

800
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,867
she might just end up like me,

801
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,467
tired from washing and cleaning
all her life.

802
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,666
Alright, I'll help you
with more chores in the future.

803
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,827
- Is that okay?
- You help me?

804
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,186
What can you help me with?

805
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,027
I want to live in a big house.

806
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,827
I want to ride in a car.

807
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,987
I want to come and go
without getting my feet muddy.

808
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,546
I want to have a babysitter

809
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:28,706
when I give birth.

810
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:29,987
Help me with all these.

811
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,467
If it hadn't been for my insistence
on staying in Shanghai back then,

812
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:37,907
you wouldn't have had the chance
to marry me.

813
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,586
- You didn't expect this, huh?
- I didn't marry well or live well.

814
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:42,907
I want my daughter
to have a good future.

815
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,666
There's nothing wrong with that.

816
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,066
You are not rational about this.

817
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:50,226
I think we shouldn't
pin our children's happiness

818
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,387
on someone else.

819
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,586
Others being good is their own business.

820
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,507
It only counts if we're good ourselves.

821
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:57,787
Right?

822
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:01,666
By the way, I heard that our place
is going to be demolished.

823
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:03,626
I've already thought it through.

824
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:05,827
At that time,
most of the demolition compensation

825
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:07,146
will be left for our children.

826
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:08,987
The two of us can move to the suburbs

827
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:10,467
and live in a settlement building.

828
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:13,507
There is a big oxygen bar
in the suburbs.

829
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:14,987
A big oxygen bar?

830
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:16,507
Oxygen bar, my foot!

831
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,827
They've been saying this place
will be demolished for ten years.

832
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,226
When will that happen exactly?

833
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:21,987
Just leave it at words.

834
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,106
What's wrong?

835
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:28,787
It's the old spot again?

836
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,907
As I've told you,

837
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,546
it's not good to open the windows.

838
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,907
Once you open the windows,
the wind whooshes in,

839
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:36,907
piercing through to the bones.

840
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:40,387
As we get even older,

841
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:41,947
we'll fall apart just by walking.

842
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:42,947
Just bear with it.

843
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,987
Is it here?

844
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:49,186
Done.

845
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:02,827
Jialiang,

846
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,987
do you want to come over
for dinner tomorrow?

847
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,626
I have to meet a client tomorrow.

848
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:23,746
But I think it's possible after that.

849
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,467
See you tomorrow, then.

850
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:45,706
Dennis,

851
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:49,827
did you receive the gift
I had someone buy for you?

852
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,027
Listen.

853
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:53,706
That gift was very hard to find.

854
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,546
Okay.

855
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:01,347
By the way, yesterday, I received

856
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:03,427
the meeting request
from your new Operations Director,

857
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,266
Yao Zhiming.

858
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:07,626
What is he doing?

859
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:11,106
Our bid for renewal this year
might need to be restarted.

860
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:12,827
All cooperation

861
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,427
needs to be reshuffled.

862
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,666
There will be no exceptions.

863
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:18,467
We've been cooperating
for so many years.

864
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:22,066
The annual bidding conference
is always an essential process.

865
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:23,827
Give me a definitive answer.

866
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,427
Mr. Xin, I'm sorry.

867
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:27,546
I have another meeting.

868
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,427
Let's go for tea another day.

869
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:36,347
You stingy, gluttonous beast!

870
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:38,586
I hope you choke on it!

871
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,226
I've already said it.

872
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:42,827
Personal favors are unreliable.

873
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:43,827
Then what can be relied on?

874
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,146
You?

875
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,827
Then design a plan for me

876
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,307
to win the bid.

877
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:50,427
I'm not reliable either.

878
00:40:52,307 --> 00:40:54,266
Then I won't be going up in a bit.

879
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:55,626
I'll be waiting for you in the car.

880
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:57,947
Why would I bring you
if you're not going up?

881
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:00,106
To train you as a driver?

882
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,507
Where are you going? This way.

883
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:18,546
Why are you wearing a mask?

884
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:22,987
I have a cold.
I don't want to spread it.

885
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:30,907
Dad,

886
00:41:31,787 --> 00:41:33,307
I need to use the restroom.

887
00:41:40,146 --> 00:41:42,827
Hello, Mr. Xin.
I'm Mr. Yao's secretary, Mai Chenghuan.

888
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:45,507
Hello, Miss Mai.

889
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:47,226
The thing is,

890
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,987
Mr. Yao suddenly received
a video conference from headquarters.

891
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:51,586
So he couldn't make it over.

892
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:53,507
He specifically sent me
to apologize to you.

893
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,746
Mr. Yao is always so busy.

894
00:41:58,427 --> 00:41:59,827
It really was a sudden situation.

895
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:01,987
Mr. Yao wanted to reschedule.

896
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:03,626
But because it involves bidding

897
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:05,827
and he has high expectations
for Deshan Home Furnishings,

898
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,387
he didn't want to put off negotiations.

899
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,027
That's why he entrusted me to come here.

900
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:21,226
Thank you.

901
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:22,827
And thanks to Mr. Yao

902
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,467
for his attention to Deshan.

903
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:27,507
Mr. Yao values you very much.

904
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:28,827
So today, I would like to know

905
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:30,746
about the recent production
and supply situation

906
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:32,307
- at Deshan.
- Where are you going? Come here.

907
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:35,907
Let me introduce you.

908
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,586
This is Mr. Yao's secretary,

909
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:39,347
Miss Mai.

910
00:42:39,746 --> 00:42:41,507
And this is my son, Xin Jialiang.

911
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,146
Jialiang?

912
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
♪My sweetie♪

913
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:23,194
♪I don't know if I'm a good mother♪

914
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:29,184
