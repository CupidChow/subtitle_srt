00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,040
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,941
What are you talking about?

4
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,021
When Ms. Chen was alive,

5
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,780
she never made these demands of us.

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,181
Mr. Cui, as the most senior colleague,
what do you think?

7
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:44,700
Time to eat.

8
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,780
Mrs. Mai.

9
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,661
Time to eat.

10
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,381
Huan, I brought you some food.

11
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:50,941
Don't forget to eat

12
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,340
no matter how busy you are. Time to eat.

13
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,941
Mom, I'm in a meeting right now.

14
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,140
Ms. Zhang, have you eaten?

15
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,541
Have you all eaten?

16
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,220
Not yet.

17
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,860
We're in a meeting

18
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,661
and none of us has eaten.

19
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:06,500
You just said
you were running a five-star hotel.

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
But I think
it's a five-star family business.

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,340
Watch your mouth.

22
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,100
As I just said,

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,461
the new performance review criteria
are effective immediately.

24
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,660
Mr. Cui, I'll leave the rest to you.

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,301
Okay.

26
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:19,940
Mom, come with me.

27
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,100
It's time to eat.

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,461
She can't even handle her relatives.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,461
Yet she made demands of us.

30
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:33,181
If you don't know the specifics,
keep your mouth shut.

31
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,701
Just tell me what you wanna say.
Why are you walking so fast?

32
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,060
I can't keep up. Just tell me.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,380
Chenghuan.

34
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,100
Mom.

35
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,141
I'm telling you for the last time.

36
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,060
Can you not come again when I'm working?

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,701
I just told my staff

38
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,461
about standardized management.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,780
Suddenly, my mom broke in

40
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,060
with a lunch box,

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,340
telling everyone to eat.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,261
How am I gonna convince
and manage my staff?

43
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,540
I didn't do anything.

44
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,216
I was worried you had no time to eat.

45
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:02,380
I saw that young man talking
to you like that

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,500
and treating you abominably,

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,780
- so I got mad and rushed over.
-Mom, I'm already 30.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,540
I have my own way of managing employees.

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,141
Forget it.

50
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,021
You don't get it.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,820
You go home, and we can talk
after I'm back home.

52
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,540
I haven't seen you at home for so long.

53
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,421
When you were happy, you bought me stuff

54
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:26,181
and asked me to learn many things.

55
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,620
When you were upset, you blamed me

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,660
and gave me a lecture.

57
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,620
What exactly do you want from me?

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,461
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,861
Why did I ask you to learn things?

60
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,581
I hope you can enjoy your life.

61
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,581
I don't hope
that your life is all about me.

62
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,581
I want you to have things
to do with your life.

63
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,352
Why don't you understand?

64
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,301
Do you enjoy your life right now?

65
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,620
I'm your mom.

66
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,261
Of course, I should focus on you.

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,181
I'm concerned about you.
What's wrong with that?

68
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,981
Mom, if you really care about someone,

69
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:55,421
the one should be Zao, not me.

70
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,500
I really hope

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,620
you can share your love

72
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,060
and attention with Zao.

73
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,380
Even slightly.

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,500
Please.

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,981
Don't keep focusing on me.

76
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,940
- You're driving me crazy.
- I got it.

77
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,141
You think I'm like extra.

78
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,581
Yes.

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,181
You think so?

80
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,821
Every time!

81
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,540
Yao Zhiming.

82
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,340
What's up?

83
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,261
Well,

84
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,740
I just argued with my mom.

85
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,581
Why?

86
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,501
Nothing, it's just...

87
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,141
What I just said to her was

88
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,701
out of line.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,100
My mom is sad.

90
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,860
Could you go and check on her for me?

91
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,381
Right now,

92
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,980
I don't want to go see her myself,

93
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,220
because if I go to see her,

94
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,821
I'm afraid of losing face.

95
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,501
Okay, leave it to me.

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,941
Alright.

97
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:00,701
Mrs. Mai.

98
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:04,740
Mrs. Mai.

99
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,581
Ziyu, how come you are here?

100
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
Isn't it time for a meal?

101
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,220
I invited myself to dinner.

102
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,300
Okay.

103
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,061
Huan didn't eat. It's all yours.

104
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,701
It's a big meal.

105
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,581
It's delicious. You eat more.

106
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,581
Mrs. Mai, do you want some?

107
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,821
I won't eat.

108
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,740
Go ahead and eat.

109
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,100
I can't wait to eat.

110
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:43,980
Ziyu.

111
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,300
What do young people like you have

112
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,701
in mind?

113
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,420
You don't need to worry too much.

114
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Chenghuan has been quite busy lately.

115
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,220
Put myself in her position.

116
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,660
When I'm busy with work,
I don't want my mom to bother me either,

117
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,461
even though she doesn't really care
about what I'm doing.

118
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,180
So what kind of mom do you wish to have?

119
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,061
She cares about me, but not too much.

120
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,980
She knows when to let go,

121
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,220
unconditionally believing in
and supporting my choices.

122
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,261
When I am confused,

123
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,780
she can be there with me.

124
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,621
When I am sad,

125
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,821
she can encourage me.

126
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,420
Am I being too greedy?

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,740
But I...

128
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,141
I never know how to do it.

129
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,901
I don't understand what she says now.

130
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,461
I can't help her

131
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,141
with the things she does.

132
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,141
What I can do for her is

133
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,220
just to cook for her.

134
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,100
Mrs. Mai, don't worry.

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,180
You don't have to keep up
with your daughter's pace.

136
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:13,261
Anyway, there is a generation gap
between old and young.

137
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,540
Yeah, there is a generation gap.

138
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,581
I can't keep up anymore.

139
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,100
Today, I saw Huan hold a meeting
with so many people.

140
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,660
I know what pressures

141
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:33,660
she's under.

142
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,700
I really envy Chenghuan.

143
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,660
You're so upset
but still worried about her.

144
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,221
You're really doing better than my mom.

145
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Come on, Mrs. Mai.

146
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,981
Don't be sad anymore.

147
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:52,861
Cheer up.

148
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,060
Zhang Ziyu, what are you doing here?

149
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm here to comfort Mrs. Mai.

150
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:03,341
Mrs. Mai, don't be upset.

151
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,460
Mai Chenghuan is now the boss.

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,060
At the workplace,

153
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,381
in front of so many people,

154
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,141
she had to be rational
rather than sentimental.

155
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,460
Sure.

156
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:16,221
I know it's not easy
for her to be the boss.

157
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,820
I know

158
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,780
she used me
to establish her authority today.

159
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,180
Anyway, I can't help her with her work.

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,940
I don't mind being a stepping stone.

161
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,981
No, that's not what she meant.

162
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,861
She specifically asked me
to come to check on you

163
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,501
and buy you new home appliances.

164
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,580
The stuff is outside.

165
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:40,021
You don't have to.
After all, I can afford them.

166
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,381
Sir, where should I
put these home appliances?

167
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,580
I'll return them?

168
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,300
My daughter bought them for me.

169
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,861
Why do you return them?

170
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Coming.

171
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,861
Yao Zhiming.

172
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,221
When did you
become Chenghuan's assistant?

173
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:07,780
It's not like you to do this.

174
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:09,981
What's going on with you two?

175
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,101
Come here.

176
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,101
Zhang Ziyu, I have something
to tell you.

177
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:23,141
What's it? You're so secretive.

178
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,621
Go ahead. I'm listening.

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,660
Mai Chenghuan and I are
in a relationship.

180
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,060
And I cherish her very much.

181
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,700
So if you come here again,

182
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,460
you must be careful with your words.

183
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,861
Behave yourself.

184
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,580
Otherwise, I'll have to blame you.

185
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,060
Yao Zhiming.

186
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
I'm trying to look out for you, alright?

187
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,060
What?

188
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,060
That's great.

189
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,540
Chenghuan and her family are kind.

190
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,981
You have a good eye.

191
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:06,420
My mom has never looked after me
ever since I was little.

192
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,501
The two of us
have been relying on each other.

193
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,501
I've long considered you as my family.

194
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,060
He Dong told me

195
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,021
that you have a girlfriend.

196
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,300
I have to watch out for you.

197
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,660
I think Chenghuan is a good girl.

198
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,741
She is very career-minded.

199
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,861
And her family is very kind.

200
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,300
If you marry into her family,
I'll be happy for you.

201
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,820
Marry into her family?

202
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,221
Alright, just be my good brother

203
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,101
and treat Chenghuan well.

204
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:36,901
I gotta go.

205
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:40,060
I've been very busy lately.

206
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,101
If there's nothing else, I'm going home.

207
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,700
Zhiming.

208
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,221
You must be happy.

209
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,621
Bye.

210
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Mrs. Mai, I'm leaving.

211
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,901
Little brat.

212
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,221
I've finished the task you gave me.

213
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,341
I'm coming over to pick you up.

214
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,460
How is my mom doing now?

215
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,300
Don't worry.
I bought her some new appliances.

216
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,861
She's just busy

217
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:34,981
studying the instruction manuals.

218
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,180
That's good.

219
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,460
What about you?

220
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,460
Do you choose to face

221
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,501
or continue to evade it?

222
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,700
I don't want to evade anymore.

223
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,861
I'm going home

224
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,460
to have a good talk with my mom.

225
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,300
Let's go home.

226
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:55,420
Go home.

227
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,300
Yu.

228
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,101
Yu, come here.

229
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:07,940
Look.

230
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,820
Huan has bought you so many appliances,

231
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,460
like an air fryer,

232
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,501
and a multi-function steamer.

233
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,901
Look, this is a juicer,

234
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:19,700
a all breaker juicer.

235
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,300
Huan is so thoughtful.

236
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,861
It's all bought for you.

237
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:26,820
Our daughter was angry,

238
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,660
but she bought you some things.

239
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,261
Our son was angry,

240
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,540
but he was gone without a word.

241
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,501
I told you.

242
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,501
The kids have grown up.

243
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,381
They have their own pride.

244
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,460
I told you to be careful with your words

245
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,180
and pay attention to the way you talk,

246
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,580
but you never listened to me.

247
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,940
So you tell me what to do now.

248
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:53,820
Just watch your mouth.

249
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:54,901
Mom, dad.

250
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,621
Huan is back.

251
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:57,621
I'm back.

252
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,341
How come you two are together?

253
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,940
We ran into each other after work.

254
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,901
Weird. Mr. Yao,

255
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,060
after I sent you back,

256
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,300
I didn't see you go out.

257
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,540
After all, he is Mr. Yao.

258
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,261
Can't he have other things to do?

259
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,261
Dad, that's his privacy, anyway.

260
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,060
Sorry about that.

261
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:26,300
Have you eaten yet?

262
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,300
Your mom can make you some food.

263
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,660
No need, I've already eaten outside.

264
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,780
You have eaten

265
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,060
outside.

266
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,861
In your eyes, the food outside is better
than the one at home.

267
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,141
It's okay.

268
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,381
I'll get you some fruit.

269
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,501
Mr. Mai.

270
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:51,820
Go ahead.

271
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:55,861
I'll go and help mom.

272
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,660
Zao said he would come back tomorrow
for his birthday.

273
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:28,780
Okay.

274
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,501
I know

275
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,660
you hate me.

276
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:46,820
I don't hate you.

277
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,780
I feel pressure

278
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,460
to be your daughter.

279
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,901
I don't know how to communicate with you

280
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,861
or get along with you.

281
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,021
Actually, I can feel

282
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,700
you're quite dissatisfied with me.

283
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,221
I'm not the daughter you want to have.

284
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,621
I don't do as you wish,

285
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,060
like getting married, having children,

286
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,261
and enjoying a better life.

287
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,021
Sometimes I think

288
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,780
if only the person sent back

289
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,741
to the hometown wasn't Zao

290
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,101
but me.

291
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,780
Then I could have been free

292
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,381
and would not been bound
by your high expectations

293
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,741
of me.

294
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,621
I never thought

295
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,901
that I was that kind of mom

296
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,981
in your heart.

297
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,260
I know

298
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,861
you've been complaining
about me being busy.

299
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,220
Indeed, I am busy with work.

300
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:15,940
But actually,

301
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,740
I don't know how to communicate
with you.

302
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,940
I don't want to face it.

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,740
I don't want to go home.

304
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,861
I try to escape.

305
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,980
I also know you have been mad at me

306
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:36,781
because of the house.

307
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,581
I have never communicated with you.

308
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,940
Do you know why?

309
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,781
I just took over Xing'anli

310
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,901
and couldn't convince my staff.

311
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,020
The employees are dissatisfied with me.

312
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,260
Xing'anli encountered

313
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,141
financial difficulties,

314
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,260
so I had to use the money for the house

315
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,260
to close the loopholes.

316
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,220
Besides,

317
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,061
because of Zao and me,

318
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,781
you had a conflict with my aunt.

319
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,700
We have never talked about this,

320
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,700
but we know

321
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,460
that you and my aunt are good
on the surface.

322
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,101
Neither of us dares to bring it up.

323
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,061
Mom.

324
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,660
Do you know why I don't want
to communicate with you?

325
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,180
That's because I'm so afraid
you'll slap me again.

326
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,861
That slap has cast a shadow on me.

327
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,581
It broke my heart.

328
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,220
It hurt me so much.

329
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,061
Really.

330
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,301
Huan.

331
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,541
I slapped you.

332
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,901
In this lifetime,

333
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,901
I will never forget it.

334
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
I slapped you on your face,

335
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,821
but it hurt my heart.

336
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,061
I know I was wrong.

337
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,660
How could I be such an awful mom?

338
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,061
I drove my daughter away by hitting her.

339
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,020
I was so wrong.

340
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,301
How could I hit you

341
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,061
in public?

342
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,740
After that, I was so worried.

343
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,700
I was afraid

344
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,980
you would never come home again,

345
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,740
you wouldn't get over this,

346
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,420
and that you would be very sad.

347
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,301
I couldn't sleep all night.

348
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,861
I stared at the ceiling

349
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,861
in a daze.

350
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,781
I wanted to admit my mistake to you,

351
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,381
but I didn't know how to start.

352
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,660
You slapped me.

354
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,220
Even though it hurt my feelings,

355
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,500
it also made me decide

356
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,581
to change the way I live.

357
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,660
I want to live
with conviction and confidence.

358
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,660
Do you know why I want
to manage Xing'anli well?

359
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:08,101
One reason is
that I don't want to let Grandma down.

360
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:11,381
And another reason is

361
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,381
that I know
too many people look down on me.

362
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,020
They think I got a windfall gain.

363
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,061
They don't think a woman like me

364
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:21,861
can manage Xing'anli well,

365
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:23,980
waiting to see me become a joke.

366
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:26,381
In that case,

367
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,381
I expect to achieve good results.

368
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,141
I want to show them with my efforts

369
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,260
that I can lead Xing'anli to be better.

370
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:36,781
I want to provide a good life

371
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,500
for my family on my own.

372
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,700
And my family

373
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,460
can be treated with dignity.

374
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:50,660
I want to make a better life
for my family.

375
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:53,901
Yes.

376
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,901
Live a good life on our own.

377
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,460
Huan.

378
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,740
I gave birth to you and your brother.

379
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,861
What I tried to do

380
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,420
to live well on our own.

381
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,861
But later I found
that I wasn't capable of doing it.

382
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,420
I couldn't.

383
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,301
So I...

384
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,500
I did whatever I could

385
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,420
and lost my principles.

386
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,740
I tried to seize every opportunity

387
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,541
without scruples.

388
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,660
As long as you can live a good life,

389
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,101
even if others belittle us,

390
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,341
look down on us, and insult us,

391
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,660
I can endure it all.

392
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,821
I-I started

393
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,381
to rely on others

394
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,541
to give you a good life.

395
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,301
But I didn't expect that the Xin family

396
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:48,061
would cause you so much pain.

397
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:51,581
In fact,

398
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,740
I did many things

399
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,660
as I wished.

400
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,940
Well,

401
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,901
I pushed you to buy a house

402
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,660
and moved into this house.

403
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,220
I thought if we had a bigger house,

404
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,141
you could move in.

405
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,781
We could live together and be happy.

406
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:10,341
But I never considered it
from your perspective.

407
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,101
I never thought about what you felt.

408
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
I'm not a good mom.

409
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,460
If I could be your mom

410
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,381
in my next life,

411
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,861
I would definitely be a better mom.

412
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,220
Sometimes I even hoped

413
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,061
if only you were a boy.

414
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,901
Then I wouldn't have to worry so much

415
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:33,061
about you.

416
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:35,861
Well,

417
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,061
when I was a little girl,

418
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:43,020
my feelings were always hurt at home.

419
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:47,180
Your grandpa asked me

420
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:49,301
to break an egg into a kettle every day.

421
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,901
I took it to the soy milk shop

422
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,260
to buy hot soy milk.

423
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,541
The egg inside would be cooked,

424
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,700
and I'd take it back home

425
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,980
for your uncle to eat.

426
00:23:58,621 --> 00:23:59,660
But one day,

427
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,821
as I walked out of the soy milk shop,

428
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,980
I fell.

429
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,260
The soy milk was spilled.

430
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,581
When I arrived home,

431
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,740
your grandpa accused me of eating it

432
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,980
and scolded me.

433
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,581
At that time, I thought to myself

434
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,460
that if I had a daughter in the future,

435
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,101
I would let her eat eggs every day

436
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:24,821
and be treated fairly.

437
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,821
What's wrong with being a girl?

438
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,940
Mom, I get it.

439
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,301
Well,

440
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,700
you think

441
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,061
I don't care about you anymore.

442
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,061
But I want to say

443
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,740
that I really love you.

444
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,980
I love you very much, mom.

445
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,141
I just want

446
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,940
to find a way for us to reach a balance.

447
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:08,980
So we can get along well.

448
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,381
All I want from you is trust and space.

449
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,541
I want you to believe in me.

450
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,581
Is that okay?

451
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,020
It's okay.

452
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
Certainly.

453
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,260
I get it now.

454
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:31,061
All my worries are unnecessary.

455
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,381
Unnecessary.

456
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:34,460
What's wrong with being girls?

457
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,781
Girls can be successful.

458
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,020
Girls can be excellent.

459
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,341
Girls

460
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,660
can do better than boys.

461
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,541
I will certainly work hard

462
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,381
to be a good mom.

463
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,660
I will support you.

464
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,861
If you're happy,

465
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,821
I'll be happy too.

466
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:01,700
Mom.

467
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,341
Come in.

468
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,101
Yao Zhiming.

469
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,621
Are you practicing acrobatics?

470
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,700
Why didn't you come in through the door?

471
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:09,420
I didn't dare to.
After all, I was almost caught today.

472
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,700
Come on.

473
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,980
That was so dangerous.

474
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,821
No worries. I'm skilled at that.

475
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,220
I wanted to ask you something.

476
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,700
What does Zao like?

477
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,220
I also want to prepare a gift for him.

478
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:21,861
Zao is not picky.

479
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,861
Anything is fine.
Don't spend too much on it.

480
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,020
Okay, I will choose something.

481
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,301
Wait a moment.

482
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,180
You climbed down

483
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,621
just to ask me this?

484
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,420
Or what?

485
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,460
Of course, I wanted to see you.

486
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,740
Zhiming.

487
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,541
Thank you

488
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,980
for doing so much for me.

489
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,660
Don't be silly. We are a family.

490
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,541
They all look good.

491
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:35,621
This is so pretty.

492
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:36,980
Is this made of silk?

493
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,901
Yes, all of these are made of silk.

494
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,621
Here's the thing.

495
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,861
I have a pair of cufflinks.

496
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,621
Could you help me pick a tie

497
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:50,061
to go with it?

498
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,220
It's suitable for business
and casual wear.

499
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,621
Could you help me pick one out?

500
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:54,341
May I have a look?

501
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:54,940
Sure.

502
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,101
These cufflinks are really beautiful.

503
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,660
I designed them myself.

504
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,061
Amazing.

505
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,101
I'll try out different pairings
one by one.

506
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:04,460
Okay.

507
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,220
Look at this one.

508
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,381
according to your preference,

509
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:07,541
it's suitable for business.

510
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,301
I think this one looks a bit casual.

511
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,220
This one.

512
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,541
No, this is too flashy.

513
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,180
This one, and this model.

514
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,341
You have a good eye.

515
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,220
This model was sold out.

516
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,420
But this one just arrived this morning.

517
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,420
Really?

518
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,621
It's the best of the best.

519
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:28,260
With it,

520
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,220
you're sure
to capture your boyfriend's heart.

521
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,821
Alright, I'll take this one.

522
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:34,940
- Please wrap it up.
- Okay.

523
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,660
I'll wrap it up.

524
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,541
Your cufflinks.

525
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,420
Thank you.

526
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:44,101
Goodbye.

527
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,141
Goodbye, teacher.

528
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:47,141
Goodbye.

529
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:48,061
Bye.

530
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,700
(Qisi Kindergarten)

531
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,581
Goodbye, teacher.

532
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,101
- Bye, teacher.
- We're leaving.

533
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,821
Miss Zhao.

534
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,301
- Miss Zhao.
- Ms. Mao.

535
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:56,101
Where's Dingding?

536
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:58,740
His dad has already picked her up.

537
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,740
Today is Friday.

538
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:02,180
I should be the one to pick Dingding up.

539
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,061
Dingding's dad specifically notified us

541
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,141
that you're no longer allowed
to pick up Dingding.

542
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,381
After all, he is the actual guardian.

543
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,488
I'm very sorry,

544
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:12,141
but we can't let you
take the child away.

545
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:13,980
Also,

546
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:15,940
Dingding has been in a bad mood lately.

547
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,700
If there's any problem
between you and her dad,

548
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:19,420
I hope it can be resolved soon.

549
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,660
Please don't affect the child.

550
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,740
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

551
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,821
Bye.

552
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,101
Song Huaimin!

553
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,341
Song Huaimin, open the door.

554
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,980
Dingding.

555
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,700
Dingding.

556
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,781
I take you to have dinner
with Zao, okay?

557
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,341
No, Grandma said
you don't love me at all.

558
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:19,381
How could I not love you?

559
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,020
Grandma told me when she came to see me.

560
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,980
You have a boyfriend

561
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,341
and don't love me at all.

562
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
You saw it.

563
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,980
He doesn't want to go with you.

564
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,821
Though you have visitation rights,

565
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,220
you can do nothing if he doesn't want

566
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,581
to go with you.

567
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,180
How could you tell the child about that?

568
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,260
Haven't you always told me to be honest?

569
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,781
Be honest, alright?

570
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,660
You have a young boyfriend,

571
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,020
right?

572
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,781
You were beaten up last time,

573
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:54,901
so you feel frustrated,

574
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:55,660
right?

575
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,460
Speaking of which,

576
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,180
I will settle the score
with him sooner or later.

577
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:03,020
Listen.

578
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,541
If Dingding has any mental issues,

579
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,260
I'll make you pay for that.

580
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:09,381
He will have mental issues
if he stays with you.

581
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,301
Dingding, let's go.

582
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,420
I will take you to eat something

583
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,581
and play, okay?

584
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:17,821
I will buy you an Ultraman, okay?

585
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,220
Let's go, Dingding.

586
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,061
I don't want to go with you.

587
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,101
Come here, Dingding.

588
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:23,180
It's alright, Dingding.

589
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,940
Ms. Deng, take him back to his room.

590
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,141
Come with me, Dingding.

591
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:28,700
Why do you touch him?

592
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,861
Let go.

593
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:30,740
You let go.

594
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,581
You have no children?
Why are you pulling my kid?

595
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:33,581
- Mao!
- Let go.

596
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:34,621
Don't be presumptuous.

597
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,781
You're at my house.

598
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,141
There are cameras in my house.

599
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,781
You're so out of control,

600
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,141
and your temper is so volatile.

601
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:42,980
How can I hand Dingding over to you?

602
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,781
If you can't change yourself,

603
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:46,980
I will never let Dingding go with you.

604
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,301
Dingding.

605
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,581
- Come to the room with me.
- Dingding.

606
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:52,260
- Dingding, go with me, okay?
- Let go.

607
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,420
Dingding, I will take you to play.

608
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,301
Let go!

609
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,980
Let's go, Dingding.

610
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,660
Grandma told me when she came to see me.

611
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,621
You have a boyfriend

612
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,980
and don't love me at all.

613
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,180
(Chengzao)
Where are you? Are you stuck in traffic?

614
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,180
No rush. Drive safely.

615
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:14,008
(Mao)

616
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:29,420
Zao.

617
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,741
The traffic is so heavy.
Sorry, I'm late.

618
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,020
That's all right.

619
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,381
Happy birthday.

620
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:36,140
Thank you.

621
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,221
What gift did you buy?

622
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:40,140
You open it later.

623
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,420
You make it quite mysterious.

624
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,701
I ordered all your favorites.

625
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,140
Do you want to order something else?

626
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,620
Excuse me, I'll serve the dishes.

627
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

628
00:34:51,181 --> 00:34:52,580
So many dishes for just two people.

629
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,020
It's enough.

630
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,540
Where's Dingding?
Wasn't he supposed to come too?

631
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,181
He...

632
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:00,580
He's not coming today.

633
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,181
You know a boy.

634
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,140
Alright, let's eat.

635
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,861
This beef is their specialty,
recommended by the owner.

636
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:13,020
And your favorite vegetable.

637
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,620
You love tripe.

638
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,741
I know you can't handle spicy food,

639
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,381
so I ordered a Yuanyang hotpot.

640
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:22,701
Here.

641
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,381
Zao, I want

642
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:29,940
to get back the custody of Dingding.

643
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:32,020
Sure, I support you.

644
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,381
Eat this.

645
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,661
But during my divorce,

646
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:40,580
I gave up the custody.

647
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,980
Now to get it back,

648
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,580
I have to go to court.

649
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,741
I'm not sure I can win.

650
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:47,341
I'll be your lawyer.

651
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,540
Eat.

652
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:00,181
Zao, I mean,

653
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,420
shouldn't we

654
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,261
reconsider our relationship?

655
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,181
I will take Dingding from his dad

656
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,661
and make him live with me in the future.

657
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,221
I know you don't mind,

658
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,181
but we can't always keep it a secret

659
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,620
from your parents.

660
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,221
What will we do next with our lives?

661
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,181
Have you thought about it?

662
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:30,181
You don't have to answer me right away.

663
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:31,580
You're still young.

664
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,940
I'll give you a chance to back out.

665
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,420
Let's think it over again.

666
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm going to the restroom.

667
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,901
(You're still young.)

668
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,701
(I'll give you a chance to back out.)

669
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,341
(Let's think it over again.)

670
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,940
Mom.

671
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:37,901
Don't worry.

672
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:39,980
Zao said that he would come back.

673
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:43,381
He promised he would come back.

674
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,781
Why did he break his promise?

675
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,980
Zao didn't say he wouldn't come back.

676
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,781
Maybe something came up

677
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,020
and delayed him.

678
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:53,140
You call him.

679
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,861
Okay, I'll give him a call.

680
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:00,500
I'm sorry.

681
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:03,940
The number you dialed can't be connected
for the moment.

682
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,580
He probably didn't check his phone.

683
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,381
It's okay. I'll send him a message.

684
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,861
Zao, where are you?

685
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:12,580
Mom, dad, and I are all waiting for you.

686
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,181
He's back.

687
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,580
Oh, it's you.

688
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,580
Mr. Yao is back. Come and sit.

689
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:25,661
Take a seat. Let's eat together.

690
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:29,821
He texted me back.

691
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,080
(Zao)

692
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:35,460
What did he say?

693
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:38,460
He sent me an address.

694
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,181
Well, mom, dad.

695
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:43,341
Don't wait for him anymore.

696
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,261
You go ahead and eat.

697
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,620
I'll go find Zao and ask what happened

698
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:47,580
I'll go with you.

699
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,661
I'll give you a ride.

700
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,060
I'll go.

701
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
All of you stay. Don't worry.

702
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,540
Wait for me at home, okay?

703
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:55,060
Zhiming.

704
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:57,060
You stay with my parents at home.

705
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,460
I will convey everyone's wishes

706
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,741
to him.

707
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,580
Don't worry.

708
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,980
I will inform you if anything happens.

709
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,540
Well...

710
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,861
You eat.

711
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,181
Why did you take the cake away?

712
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,420
He is really not coming?

713
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:20,781
Sit.

714
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:21,420
Yes.

715
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:25,420
Mrs. Mai, don't worry.

716
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,940
Zao is not angry with you anymore.

717
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,381
Actually, today

718
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,381
is also my birthday.

719
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,460
So let's just celebrate it together.

720
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,301
Really?

721
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,821
- Yes.
- What a coincidence.

722
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:38,341
How is that possible?

723
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,821
Today is not his birthday.

724
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
How do you know?

725
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,980
I did your laundry that day

726
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,980
and found your ID card
in your pants pocket.

727
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,460
I just happened to see it.

728
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,140
I have matched your birthday

729
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,821
with some girls'

730
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,381
for the Chinese zodiac compatibility.

731
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,420
But none of the girls were right
for you.

732
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,381
It's a case against you.

733
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:00,940
So I didn't say anything to you.

734
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,701
Don't worry. I'm working on it.

735
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:03,980
You will find the right girl.

736
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,540
Thank you, Mrs. Mai.

737
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,980
You treat me like a son.

738
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,580
You're welcome.

739
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:13,540
Yu.

740
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,940
I think we shouldn't wait anymore.

741
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,980
We have waited for so long.

742
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,901
Besides, Mr. Yao must be hungry.

743
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:20,980
Let's eat.

744
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,261
Alright, you eat.

745
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:23,821
Ming, sit down and eat.

746
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,381
Let's have a drink.

747
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,261
Okay.

748
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,420
Take your time.

749
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,420
Eat more.

750
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll go upstairs.

751
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,741
Happy birthday, Zao.

752
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,100
Thank you, Huan.

753
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,781
I should thank you.

754
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:11,781
I'm the only family
you're willing to see.

755
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,580
That's my great honor.

756
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:22,060
This is from dad.

757
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,580
He hopes you won't get too tired
when commuting.

758
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:27,341
I got you this.

759
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:29,620
I wish you good health.

760
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:32,620
This is from Zhiming.

761
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,381
He wishes you happiness.

762
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,701
Look how coincidental it is.

763
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,821
All gifts are cards.

764
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,381
And,

765
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,980
Mom did it all for you.

766
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,341
A big dinner.

767
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:56,980
How's mom doing?

768
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,741
Pretty good.

769
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,580
She's just especially missing you.

770
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,060
Actually, I found

771
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,460
that she had her reasons.

772
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,341
She wanted to tell you

773
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,781
but didn't know how to start.

774
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,181
Just like you didn't tell us
that you did the food delivery job.

775
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,861
I know

776
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,261
this is the way you love the family.

777
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,821
But everyone in our family

778
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:20,020
has always given

779
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,181
silently.

780
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:22,741
But the result?

781
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:24,341
None of us know each other's sacrifice.

782
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,741
In the end, we all feel aggrieved.

783
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,781
Huan, I understand.

784
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:35,261
I also ran away from home before,

785
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:36,940
so I really understand how you feel.

786
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,460
I won't force you to go back.

787
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:41,661
You make your own decisions
about everything.

788
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:43,940
But if you need anything,

789
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,381
just let me know.

790
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,620
Actually, I'm sad today

791
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,140
not because of mom.

792
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:57,901
