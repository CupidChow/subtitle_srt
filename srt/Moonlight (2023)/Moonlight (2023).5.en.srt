1
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,079
Being an actor for so many years

2
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,519
This is the first time someone asked me what my name is

3
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,599
You go to bed early

4
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,319
no

5
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,799
you can't go

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,879
What on earth do you want to do?

7
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,040
ring

8
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,799
this is me

9
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,000
The ring I’ve been preparing for a long time

10
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,480
Since you went abroad

11
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,079
I've been waiting for you until now

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Xiao Min

13
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,319
You are my white moonlight

14
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,360
Bai Yueguang

15
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
I didn't expect that

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Mr. Fei, you are quite affectionate.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,360
I don't care about you

18
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,039
I recognize you

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
Mr. Fei, what do you want to do?

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,319
marry me

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,039
All right

22
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,199
I really hope you tomorrow morning

23
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,639
I won't regret saying these words

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,280
No way

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,159
No way

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Go to sleep quickly

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,599
I have to go

28
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,520
I do not want

29
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,360
Mr. Fei

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Hello Tang and Song Dynasty

31
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,800
Xiaoxiao

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,599
I checked it for you

33
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,719
Signature document of formaldehyde contract

34
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,360
It's in Fei Mingxuan's safe

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,520
You won't be implicated if you reveal company secrets, right?

36
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,439
Thank you for my friend

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,520
will not

38
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,000
Your friends are my friends

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,599
You should help

40
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,400
I have something else to do here. I'll hang up now.

41
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,919
good

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
I didn't expect that this key could actually open it.

43
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,040
The password is indeed Fang Min’s birthday

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,920
Not at all

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,839
You are scared

46
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,079
Are you still using a honey trap on me?

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
I'm going to use a honey trap on you

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
You've fallen into the trap now, right?

49
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,759
I caught a thief

50
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,040
excited

51
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,199
with your eyes

52
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,879
Shouldn't be thought of

53
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,000
Will there be any fraud if I give you the key?

54
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,199
Of course I thought of it

55
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,040
But you tricked me here

56
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,680
Then break everything

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
It means you already know her location

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
you are very smart

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,639
You're so smart that I can't help but admire you

60
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,560
You and your assistant

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,399
Did you read the same book?

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,240
From the moment I open my mouth, it’s all about acting in a romantic drama

63
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,879
give me back the ring

64
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,959
What if I don’t give it?

65
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,160
Don't you also want to threaten me with the document?

66
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,560
Now you have no leverage

67
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,240
This is my last bargaining chip

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Mr. Fei, please take me with you.

69
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,920
If I don't have the ability to take back the gear on the road

70
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
I will return the ring

71
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm waiting for your words

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,879
Let's go

73
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,079
She is in Haishi

74
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,279
The journey took a total of eighteen hours

75
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
if you regret

76
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,800
Can tell in advance

77
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,199
Mr. Fei

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
How can you catch tiger cubs if you don’t enter the tiger’s den?

79
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,920
Aren't you afraid that I will lure the tiger away from the mountain?

80
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,519
Didn't you put the gear in the car at all?

81
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,439
for you

82
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,079
This is just a game

83
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,800
None of the important props are there

84
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,519
What’s the point of playing it?

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
You think you know me very well

86
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,279
i don't know you

87
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,279
But I know myself well enough

88
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
In fact, we are essentially

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,279
All the same kind of people

90
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,439
Which kind

91
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,279
To achieve the goal by any means

92
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,839
Me for money and you for people

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,240
It's just a game of cat and mouse

94
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,600
Then guess

95
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,319
Where is the file now?

96
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,199
Generally speaking

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,519
The most dangerous place is the safest place

98
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,439
I guess

99
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,000
it's in front of me now

100
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,800
You, what are you looking at me for?

101
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,160
I didn't do it

102
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,360
Let's go

103
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
Temperature too high

104
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,480
Come to me to get water

105
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
You don't believe me so much

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,720
if not

107
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,519
Fei Mingxuan

108
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,120
If you drag me again, I'll be angry.

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,399
you let go

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,799
This barren mountain

111
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,759
Even if I find the file, I can't run away.

112
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
Su Xiaoxiao, is it you?

113
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,600
I just missed my only chance to steal files

114
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,559
If not for saving you

115
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,559
Fang Min's matter has been settled long ago

116
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,559
Su Xiaoxiao

117
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
It's you

118
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
many years ago

119
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,879
on news reports

120
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,799
Said Fang Min saved me

121
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,399
I still believed it was true

122
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,559
You drank too much that day and told me this

123
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,039
You also said

124
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,840
Fang Min is your Bai Yueguang

125
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Wrong

126
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,720
since you appeared

127
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,879
I thought your voice was very familiar

128
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,799
So I've been thinking

129
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,120
It was really Fang Min who saved me

130
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,080
Or someone else

131
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,120
you won't doubt

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,759
I am the one who saves you, right?

133
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,799
I'm not doubting

134
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
I am confirming

135
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,159
I said it

136
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:49,960
not me

137
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,000
I asked you before

138
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,279
do we know each other

139
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,120
you denied

140
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,279
Now let me ask you again

141
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,200
The person who saved me back then

142
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,759
It's you

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
right
