00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,359
Cheers

2
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,000
Cheers

3
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:06,799
Respectfully

4
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
We all recognize the reality

5
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,439
Respectfully

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
i finally realized

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,359
I am a substitute

8
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,640
this joke

9
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,920
Xiaoxiao

10
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,359
You look so good with makeup

11
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,280
do you know

12
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,120
He likes the way I look with makeup

13
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,560
I thought it was because I wore makeup

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
relatively beautiful

15
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,200
Now I just found out

16
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,079
It turns out I was wearing makeup

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
More like Fang Min

18
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,000
no

19
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,240
It's because he doesn't know how to cherish it

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Su Xiaoxiao

21
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,120
you look at me

22
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,759
you are you

23
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,199
I don't care what others think

24
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,680
you are in my heart

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
It's the only one in the world

26
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,080
Su Xiaoxiao

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,759
The only Su Xiaoxiao in the world

28
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,919
drink one

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,639
stop crying

30
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,520
Don't cry anymore

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,199
no

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
Totally wrong

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,360
I feel like I only deserve to live in the shadows

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
I will never be able to escape Fang Min's shadow for the rest of my life.

35
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,439
Don't vomit

36
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,680
I'll go find a trash can for you

37
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,039
Come

38
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,639
So stinky

39
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
It stinks so much

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
OK OK

41
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,919
Xiao Min, listen to me

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,479
let go

43
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,360
I was forced too

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
Do you think I want this?

45
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,080
You were forced

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
You have no idea that after so many years

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,240
how did i live

48
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,800
In order to be worthy of you

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
How much effort have I made

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
You can't see it all

51
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,120
You only see chicken feathers here, right?

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,759
Chicken feathers everywhere

53
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,000
Tang and Song Dynasties

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,399
you made me hurt my best friend

55
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,000
But I never thought of hurting you

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,639
from beginning to end

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,319
I only love you

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,759
Xiao Min

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
I am the only one who loves you

60
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,759
That Xiaoxiao is at your place

61
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,040
Not even a person?

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,399
Who have you been with all these years?

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,959
You are so scary Tang and Song

64
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,079
yes

65
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,240
But what can I do?

66
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,560
I miss you so much

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
I have nightmares every night

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,879
I dreamed of the day you left

69
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,720
I dreamed that I would never see you again

70
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,240
She really is when we can't be together

71
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,360
a substitute

72
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,079
Because when she was your substitute

73
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,399
Exactly like you

74
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,160
You are such a scumbag, it’s obvious

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,519
You don't have to understand me now

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,680
But what's wrong with loving you?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
you tell me

78
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,040
Is it wrong to love someone?

79
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,639
Tang and Song Dynasties

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,160
My dad asked me to take a break

81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
Send me to study abroad

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
what

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
That Xiao Min

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,319
how long do you want to go

85
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,439
five years

86
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,439
at least five years

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,319
five years

88
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,959
How many five years can there be in this life?

89
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:55,920
Xiao Min

90
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I will always wait for you

91
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,240
I will try my best to become someone worthy of you

92
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,079
Tang and Song Dynasties

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,839
You don't have to be like this

94
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,720
you are a very good person

95
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,839
you can have your own life

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
You don't have to wait for me

97
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,439
No

98
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,360
I think you are worth it

99
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,839
I will always wait for you

100
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,160
Xiao Min, I know you won't forgive me

101
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
I don’t deserve to beg your forgiveness either.

102
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
But can you give me some more time?

103
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,519
Xiao Min

104
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,439
Don't go

105
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,560
I

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
It doesn't matter if we don't become boyfriend and girlfriend

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,360
Tang and Song Dynasties

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,319
we can be friends

109
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,000
We finally got back together

110
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,879
Tang and Song, don’t be like this

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,759
Xiao Min, I promise you

112
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,120
As long as you don't leave me

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,360
Fei Mingxuan

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,360
He can't bother us anymore

115
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,439
how do you know

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,240
Fei Mingxuan can't disturb us anymore

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To tell you the truth

118
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,199
to be with you

119
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,199
Su Xiaoxiao appeared at the press conference

120
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,079
from that moment

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,759
I'm just setting up this game of chess

122
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,319
What else did he plan?

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,360
Scumbag, I'll play with you

124
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,839
Come

125
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,560
That

126
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,519
I'll give you another chance

127
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm going to pack my luggage first

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,439
What a beauty

129
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,560
What's up

130
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,799
I have something to tell you

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,039
you say

132
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
In fact, back then

133
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,480
the person who saved you

134
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,799
it's really me

135
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,759
You finally admitted it

136
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,159
Do you still remember the agreement between us?

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
You said I'll wait until you return to China

138
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,240
You will definitely come to me

139
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,159
but you didn't come

140
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,639
So I looked for the name Fang Min

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,039
Sorry

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
Been a substitute for a long time

143
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,240
I just feel like I'm not that important

144
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
name identity

145
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
It doesn’t seem to matter that much anymore

146
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,519
There is something called

147
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
There is only one Su Xiaoxiao in the world

148
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,759
you are so smart

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
So gentle

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
So tough

151
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,519
so cute

152
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,480
You have many advantages that others don’t know about

153
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,799
I'm really lucky

154
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,799
The person I met is you

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,919
You took off my mask from the beginning

156
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,440
you tell me

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,440
Tell me not to be Fang Min

158
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,080
Let me be Su Xiaoxiao

159
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
It turns out I can be myself

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,679
You also let me use my own identity for the first time

161
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
Completed the scene

162
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,759
No one has ever told me this before

163
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Can you believe it?

164
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,039
Why am I telling you this today?

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,080
Just because I have thought it through too

166
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,559
from now on

167
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,720
I don't want to anymore

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,200
Living in Fang Min's shadow

169
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,320
Then let's do this

170
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,360
right now

171
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,279
you declare to the world

172
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,399
In the world

173
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,039
There is only one Su Xiaoxiao

174
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,360
Shout out now

175
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,799
Hurry up

176
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
I can't shout

177
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,320
You force yourself

178
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,279
Why don't you shout?

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,279
I

180
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,120
I feel a little middle-of-the-road

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,360
Then you still let me shout

182
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,200
I

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,919
Let me show you an example

184
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,039
Optimistic

185
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,440
She is Su Xiaoxiao

186
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,679
She is Su Xiaoxiao

187
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
I am Su Xiaoxiao

188
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,639
I am Su Xiaoxiao

189
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,399
Good second grade

190
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
Su Xiaoxiao

191
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,679
you

192
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
can you give me one

193
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,519
Pursue your own opportunities

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
Then when did it snow here?

195
