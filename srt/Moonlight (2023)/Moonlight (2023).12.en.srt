1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,239
Xiaoxiao

2
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,879
Your temper hasn't changed at all.

3
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,000
Your kung fu has improved a lot.

4
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,640
You are quite smart

5
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
Know that I will return to the company

6
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,120
so

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,879
Stay here and wait for me

8
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,439
with your IQ

9
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,079
It's just these tricks, right?

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,480
I figured it out when I got back

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,359
all this

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,439
It's all designed by you

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
It was you who made the plans

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,599
Let Fang Min beg me to play her

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,439
and then misled me further

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,359
Go to Fei Mingxuan and steal the contract evidence

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,599
Why didn't you find out before?

18
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,719
You look like a bed bug in the gutter

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,319
Good calculation

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
Good guess

21
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,240
But everything seems irreversible

22
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,479
Evidence of signed contract

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,039
It's in my hands now

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,759
Have you ever heard the saying

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
A woman who doesn’t fall in love

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,400
IQ will rise several levels

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,319
Do you think I will let you go so smoothly?

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Then we'll see

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Right

30
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,319
A friendly reminder to my good classmate

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
you are there for him

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080
It's just one

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,639
Just Fang Min's stand-in

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,199
It's me Fang Min

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,360
Xiaoxiao

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,159
I regard you as a good friend

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,159
But the Tang and Song Dynasties

38
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,240
He is a social scum

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
Are you sure you want to stick with him?

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,439
Xiaoxiao, don’t worry

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,159
Just because he hurt you

42
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,360
I won't forgive him

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,840
He now has evidence of the Tang and Song dynasties

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,039
He will definitely hurt Fei Mingxuan

45
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,319
this time

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I want to protect him

47
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,680
No matter what identity you use

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
Xiaoxiao

49
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,439
Just do whatever you want

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,319
I figured it out

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,919
Things like identity and skin

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,159
It's all external

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
the most important is

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
who am I

55
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,439
Everyone

56
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,240
we got a piece of information

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
It’s about the last contract for formaldehyde-containing materials.

58
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,639
And on this contract

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,039
The person who finally signed the approval

60
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,560
That's Mr. Fei

61
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,360
Mr. Fei’s signature

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Can he sign this?

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,719
he won't do this

64
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,600
It’s really Mr. Fei

65
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,519
everybody knows

66
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,000
Our Minghao Group has regulations

67
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,240
If a manager makes a major mistake

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,759
causing stock prices to fall

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,240
Then we have the right to vote veto

70
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
to decide

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,519
Should he hand over management rights?

72
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,600
agree

73
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,199
Anyway, Mr. Fei gave it to an actor

74
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,720
Nineteen percent of the shares

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
How childish is the decision-making from now on?

76
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,079
You can imagine it

77
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,560
Stop grinding

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,120
If you don't want me to be eliminated, please raise your hands.

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Xiaomin you

80
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,680
Actors also have the right to vote

81
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,399
It's like some irrelevant people

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Shamelessly stay here to force yourself

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,439
Wait a moment

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,199
Here is another piece of information

85
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,160
Mr. Fei and I are over there at Fengsheng.

86
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Retrieved the decoration materials shipment list

87
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
Found someone doing something inside

88
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,199
The contract clearly states that environmentally friendly materials are used

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,639
The shipping bill contains formaldehyde-containing products.

90
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,720
You can carefully compare the contracts

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,399
Just know

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,319
This contract is indeed different

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,759
Really

94
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,720
That's it

95
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,959
So that’s what happened

96
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,279
Since there is garbage mixed in,

97
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,199
Then I'll make it clearer

98
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,959
It is precisely because of this

99
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,319
The yin and yang contract where middlemen earn the price difference

100
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,319
That leads to shoddy products

101
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,759
Formaldehyde material appears

102
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,480
Cause damage to the company's reputation

103
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,879
I'm doing my best to make up for it

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,000
As for those who want to be in the middle

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
People who fish for oil and water

106
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
Wait until I find proof that you actually collected money.

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,199
This is economic crime

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,199
As for the consequences?

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
I think you should understand very well

110
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,519
By the way, Mr. Fang

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,680
I hope you won't listen to those rumors again

112
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,839
I'm too anxious

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
But it’s true that he failed to supervise

114
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,560
Now he's in front of half of the shareholders

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
lost credibility

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,279
I made the account of 300 million very detailed

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,879
Just find an accountant to support you then.

118
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,600
waste

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,959
waste

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,839
Three percent of the shares are given to you for free.

121
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,040
Cerebral thrombosis will make you angry

122
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,480
A waste like you

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,959
How could Xiao Min marry you?

124
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,639
Mr. Fang

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,160
I have another way

126
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,560
What can you do

127
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,839
You are a waste

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,639
I tell you

129
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,519
Xiao Min is much better than you

130
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,759
That Fei Mingxuan

131
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,480
I also gave her 19% of the shares.

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,000
No

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,360
Mr. Fang

134
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
The real Xiao Min will help me

135
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,039
boy

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,000
don't let me down again

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,879
Do you understand?

138
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,720
Get out of the way

139
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,440
Busy

140
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,759
Come here and help me

141
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,639
what are you doing

142
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
What do you think looks good?

143
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,039
That's good

144
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,799
Xiaoxiao

145
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,200
actually

146
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
You don’t have to act as Fang Min today

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Arrived at the scene

148
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
you are you

149
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,759
Although I turned into Fang Min today

150
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
But I won't do it again just because I'm a substitute

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,159
And feel humbled

152
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
I may still be because

153
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,639
I really want to deal with Tang and Song Dynasties, right?

154
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,799
I said you don't need to show off in front of me

155
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,120
knew

156
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,399
Xiaoxiao

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,519
Come

158
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,279
Will you trust me again

159
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,159
Then turn around

160
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,600
Su Xiaoxiao

161
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,759
It's snowing

162
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,559
Beautiful?

163
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,240
nice

164
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,919
sorry

165
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
I couldn't help it

166
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,840
Xiaoxiao

167
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
It can snow in the subtropics

168
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,720
Iron trees will also bloom

169
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,000
your wish

170
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,919
Realized

171
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
How about I teach you how to see snow?

172
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,679
What do you think?

173
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,240
Are you optimistic?

174
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,639
Crazy

175
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,720
Try lying down
