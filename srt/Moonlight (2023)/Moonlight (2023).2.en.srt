1
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,159
No more nonsense, Mr. Fei

2
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,040
I promise to marry you

3
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,560
Miss Fang suddenly wants to marry me again

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
You really like me

5
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,000
Still acting?

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,040
Of course I don’t really like it

7
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,480
The pros of marrying you outweigh the cons

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,599
Between people

9
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,719
The longest relationship is the relationship of interest

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,239
So before I marry you

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
Definitely still needed

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
Get to know you better

13
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,120
Before Mr. Fei got engaged to me,

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
Just send someone to inquire about me.

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,919
Did you have a martial arts stand-in before?

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
My name is Su Xiaoxiao

17
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,360
She is my martial arts stand-in

18
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,360
We haven’t contacted each other since we left the country.

19
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,319
They all say that the actor and the stuntman look alike

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
Do you think it looks like it?

21
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,319
I'm just me

22
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,439
If the fee is better than mine

23
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,680
If you are more interested in a substitute

24
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,599
Then there's no need for us to talk any more.

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,319
don't worry

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,360
Of course I am more interested in Miss Fang

27
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,240
Won't you invite me in and sit down?

28
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
My house is a bit messy, maybe next time

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,960
Now that we're both engaged

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,039
I still need to know you better

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,680
All right

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,599
Fortunately, I was prepared

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
I'll get some fruit

34
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,560
Mr. Fei, do you want to eat fruit?

35
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,839
you don't go home

36
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,199
Experience life here

37
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,600
Of course not

38
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Because I don’t want to get engaged to you

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,639
So I was kicked out by my dad.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,519
You're pretty good at finding reasons

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,360
Right

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Weren't you injured before filming?

43
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,319
Mr. Fei, you are very suspicious.

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,160
It is recommended that you seek medical treatment as soon as possible

45
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,759
I think we need

46
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,480
Learn more about

47
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,720
Mr. Fei

48
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,160
If you want to eat cherries, just say so

49
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,639
what do you want to do

50
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,839
Don't be in a hurry, right?

51
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,160
You still don't admit it

52
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
You are not Fang Min

53
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,279
I'm not Fang Min

54
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,399
who am i

55
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,040
You have a really good attitude

56
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,199
So good that I feel

57
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,839
You are really Fang Min

58
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,480
Su Xiaoxiao twenty-five years old

59
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,959
Learned martial arts and practiced Sanda

60
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,879
Also studied special effects makeup

61
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,639
All-around talent

62
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,319
Playing Fang Min is just to reject me

63
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,199
In the end, it was a mistake.

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,120
It seems that my professionalism is not enough

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
I would like to ask you where is my flaw?

66
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,879
After wearing the mask for a long time, it really becomes your face.

67
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
So

68
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,800
You announced your engagement in public

69
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,079
It was to force Fang Min to come out

70
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,040
Be polite first and then fight with soldiers

71
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,439
As long as I'm in the media tomorrow

72
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,879
Play a sad drama

73
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,040
The whole world will search for Fang Min with me

74
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,079
And what about your substitute?

75
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,199
You can take a break

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
You

77
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,920
It's just one

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,600
Hypocrite pretending to be affectionate

79
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,519
what do you know

80
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
Ridiculous

81
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,800
no

82
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,839
The game is not over yet

83
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,879
Take a look

84
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,959
What will happen if this video is broadcast?

85
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,600
The media won’t help you find Fang Min

86
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,560
I will only report you extensively

87
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,480
Cheating

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,360
support

89
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,600
Violence

90
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,319
What happened to your voice?

91
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,480
The voice also changed when I took off the mask.

92
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Doesn’t Mr. Fei know?

93
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,399
In movies and TV dramas

94
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,360
Is there a thing called a voice changer?

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
I don't like your voice

96
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,680
You can use my own voice if you like it.

97
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,839
And in this video

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
It seems that you are more proactive than me

99
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,720
Once this video is released

100
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,680
You can't explain it better than me

101
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
What if you were smart?

102
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,680
Just tell me where Fang Min is

103
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,519
I can still let you go

104
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
Mr. Fei, she’s coming after her.

105
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,039
parking

106
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,919
I can tell you where she is

107
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,919
But you need to give me time to confirm

108
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
I like doing deals with smart people

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,600
See you at my house tomorrow night at six o'clock

110
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,600
What will happen if this video is broadcast?

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,840
The media won't help you find Fang Min

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,639
This sound is so similar

113
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,960
The weather is very good today

114
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,080
There is sunshine and wind

115
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,200
Check Su Xiaoxiao again

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
Check everything in detail

117
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,840
Okay, Mr. Fei
