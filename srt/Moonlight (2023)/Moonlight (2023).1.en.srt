1
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,400
You said this world

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Do they really have the same face?

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,200
i'm looking for someone

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,480
one

5
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,040
in my memory

6
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,359
familiar

7
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,359
long time no see

8
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,159
A person who thinks about you day and night

9
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm not sure about her face

10
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,080
But I remember who she is

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm nervous and have nightmares again, right?

12
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,240
If Fang Min doesn't come

13
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,360
Today’s press conference is really difficult to deal with

14
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,639
Fang Zhengqing will definitely let her come

15
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,800
Come over here Come over here

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,479
Formaldehyde exceeding the standard touches the bottom line of the industry

17
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,319
For households with problems

18
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,800
We have sent professional organizations to conduct inspections

19
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,039
within the company

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,840
We have set up a self-correction team

21
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,919
Employees involved will be dealt with

22
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,520
on external supervision

23
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,080
My fiancee, Miss Fang Min

24
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,919
Will return soon to become the spokesperson of Minghao Group

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Fang Min

26
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
What's going on?

27
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,039
Isn’t she Xiying?

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Yes

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,199
How could she come back now?

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,919
Could you please go downstairs and buy me a cup of coffee?

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
OK

32
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,800
Fang Min

33
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,840
Otherwise, you should go out

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,039
Let’s face this press conference

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,199
After all, in the public eye

36
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,439
Me I'm afraid

37
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,360
Xiaoxiao, just help me this time

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Just help me finish this scene

39
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,159
I'm going to meet someone I've missed for many years

40
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,039
But if my dad can’t see me at the scene

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,960
His blood pressure went up immediately

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,719
please

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,639
OK

44
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,360
just this once

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Just one last step left

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Now I am the complete Fang Min

47
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,519
It's really Fang Min who's here

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
This is really big news

49
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,959
It is indeed a good means to divert public opinion

50
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,439
However

51
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,040
There are conditions for me to help you.

52
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,800
make a deal

53
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,560
As the spokesperson of Minghao Group

54
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,879
I will do a good job in supervising Minghao Group

55
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
I also hope that everyone today

56
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,279
Can you bless me and Mr. Fei?

57
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,879
Really, Fang Min

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Are you really going to get engaged to Mr. Fei?

59
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
Fang Min, are you ready to make a comeback?

60
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,319
Mr. Fei, don’t leave, Mr. Fei

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,240
Everyone stay

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Answer it

63
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,959
Mr. Fei

64
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,399
i don't like you

65
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
You have no reason to like me

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,839
The condition for me to help you is

67
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,399
Cancel this engagement

68
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
I don't accept your conditions

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,439
and i like you

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
No other reason is needed

71
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,439
I'm a rather irritable person

72
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,279
Like to solve problems directly with force

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
You saved me ten years ago

74
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,519
My life is yours

75
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,160
As you wish

76
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't want your life

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,639
Can I have my own?

78
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,120
Cancel this engagement

79
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,000
Meet Fei Mingxuan again

80
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,399
I didn't expect it to be based on Fang Min's face

81
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,759
I have to help Fang Min think of another way.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Mr. Fei

83
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
The real Fang Min has escaped

84
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,360
The current Fang Min is fake

85
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,600
Should I expose her now?

86
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,319
Need not

87
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,600
She is still useful

88
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
I would like to take a look

89
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
How can she carry on with this scene?

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
no matter where you go

91
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,160
I also want to find the real you
