1
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,680
It’s not like we don’t have any plans

2
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,000
It depends on whether Mr. Fei is willing or not.

3
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,560
You two seem like something written in a novel

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,799
shut up

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,280
more like

6
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,280
Second aunt

7
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,319
I dislike the poor and love the rich, so I can’t raise money with her.

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,000
aunt

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
often like luxury goods

10
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,879
But I often buy fakes

11
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,519
Next

12
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,439
second uncle

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,519
Second Uncle Phoenix Man

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,760
Can't mention his origins

15
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,159
Second aunt

16
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,120
Second aunt

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,239
Second aunt

18
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,560
Su Xiaoxiao

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,239
Are you avenging a private vendetta?

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,359
I'll hit you if you make a mistake

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm helping you do what you need to do

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,519
No way

23
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,959
Who made us a team now?

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,519
You can only make up for my shortcomings.

25
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,280
Come on

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,200
Don't talk nonsense

27
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,640
Quick, quick, quick

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,280
Second aunt

29
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,239
Nothing accomplished

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,400
I like to brag about my children the most

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,879
right next next

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,840
alright

33
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,000
Completed

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,799
nice

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,520
Actually you

36
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,960
is a good partner

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,680
Smart

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,240
Strong ability to control emotions

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,479
Have a spirit of cooperation

40
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,879
You don’t need to tell me, I know all this

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
It's just a pity

42
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,599
we won't be friends

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
I just want to praise you a few words

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,919
Don't go too far

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,479
Come again

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,439
cocoon

47
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,039
Will help

48
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,080
Look at my shameful hands

49
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,599
Just look at it

50
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,479
move place

51
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,280
Repair toilet

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
The hand holding the light bulb

53
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,599
Such hands

54
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
Why do you feel ashamed?

55
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,520
However

56
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,800
people like you

57
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,560
real

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,680
Do you think so?

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,240
I respect everyone who works hard

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,280
Not everyone can be born in Rome

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,000
you are right

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,040
let me help you

63
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,519
Thank you

64
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,839
It's OK

65
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,040
Help me get some water

66
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,040
Thank you

67
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,160
You're welcome

68
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,240
By the way, Mr. Fei

69
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,959
I just went to Fang Min’s house for a meal.

70
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,199
Why on earth are you going to all this trouble?

71
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,519
you won't be

72
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,079
right

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Fang Zhengqing introduced Fang Min to me

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,959
Just have another purpose

75
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,800
So you let me go to their house for dinner

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,839
It also has another purpose

77
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
Is it possible that I am now a spy?

78
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,199
rely on you

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,120
You wait a moment

80
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,199
This is a different price, let me tell you

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
Beautiful thought

82
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,920
You have to have a spirit of contract

83
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,600
It’s really no treachery and no business.

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
Thanks for the compliment

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,879
Miss Su

86
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,120
You have been him for more than twenty years

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,399
The woman we have been with the longest

88
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,399
None

89
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,759
You, watch less idol dramas

90
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,519
As soon as I opened my mouth, the boss always wrote.

91
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,480
Mr. Fei

92
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,079
We have completed material testing

93
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,360
Found there is indeed a problem

94
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,519
But the words are indeed signed by you

95
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,319
The group is currently in a credibility crisis

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm afraid the board of directors

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,319
Will find evidence to challenge you

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I can still handle it

99
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,720
I was negligent

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
I didn't expect that the other party would use a Yin-Yang contract

101
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
Such a low-level method

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
Right

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
I also found out about the man who was with Miss Fang

104
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,519
called Tang and Song Dynasties

105
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,839
They are also employees of our company

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
Formaldehyde materials currently in question

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,480
It's also related to him

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,639
There is also

109
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,959
It seems that he and Miss Su are also in a relationship

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
So bloody

111
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,279
Let me meet this amazing man

112
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Xiao Min is here

113
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,920
This is the second aunt who dislikes poverty and loves wealth.

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,199
Xiao Min

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Second aunt

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,519
I seem to have gained a little weight recently.

117
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,360
It's Mingxuan who feeds him well

118
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:36,839
Hello, second aunt

119
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,920
Second aunt is also beautiful

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,839
Thank you

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
aunt

122
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,240
Aunt and uncle

123
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,439
Second uncle Second uncle

124
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,160
third uncle

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
uncle uncle

126
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,040
Mingxuan is here

127
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,120
Xiao Min

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,639
dad

129
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:57,920
This

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why did you call me dad after not seeing each other for a few days?

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,040
Why should we change it?

132
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,720
What do you call me if you don't call me dad?

133
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,279
Xiao Min has been in a mood lately

134
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,399
They say the size of the square diamond is wrong.

135
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,000
I heard it was Dad who gave you a replacement.

136
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,600
Just for a diamond

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
I won’t call you daddy anymore.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,519
I no longer have a close relationship with daddy.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Give it back to daddy

140
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,439
do not worry

141
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,879
Daddy will give you whatever you want.

142
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,000
That's it

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,560
Follow me to the study now

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Choose one of your mother’s diamonds

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Go to study

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,360
Walk

147
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,039
Trouble now

148
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,879
Mingxuan, please sit down first

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,799
Sit, sit, sit

150
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,159
help me quickly

151
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,039
It depends on your acting skills

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,399
Sit down quickly, Mingxuan

153
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,000
come with me

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Xiao Min

155
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,559
I spent money to open a company to support your debut

156
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,840
It’s to improve you

157
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,440
Our company’s influence

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,320
and

159
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,799
I asked you to find Fei Mingxuan

160
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,480
Evidence in the formaldehyde case

161
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,440
Only by catching him

162
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,039
Only then can he hand over power to us.

163
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,840
Daddy, please don’t be angry first.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,759
I'm trying to find evidence of him.

165
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,919
Can I not be angry? I

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Cerebral hemorrhage almost makes you angry

167
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,799
me

168
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,080
How did I give birth to such a waste like you?

169
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,519
You also learned to avoid you

170
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,799
Don't you know how to catch it?

171
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
How expensive is this cup?

172
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,799
you

173
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,639
I didn't look carefully just now

174
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,000
Your face seems a little swollen

175
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,399
Me I'll take a look

176
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Nonsense

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
Can I wear so many skin-beautifying patches without getting swollen?

178
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,759
dad

179
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,120
Mingxuan

180
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,919
Xiao Min

181
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,519
Didn’t you always ask me for it?

182
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,080
The key to the safe?

183
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,159
I give it to you

184
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,919
Husband, you are drunk

185
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm not drunk

186
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,240
Having a domineering fiancé is unfortunate enough

187
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,399
And a father who is unscrupulous

188
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,159
Stop pretending. Wake up.

189
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,240
He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to deceive that old fox Fang Zhengqing.

190
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,240
To be more realistic

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,440
I drank a whole bottle of it

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,679
It turns out that he is still an experiential actor

193
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,840
Slow down. Slow down.

194
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,639
Come

195
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,080
I want to take a bath

196
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,200
Don't take it off

197
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,039
You guys play. I'll get off work at that time.

198
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,879
I go first

199
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,799
You, take a good rest yourself

200
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,039
Not allowed to leave

201
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,759
Are you Fang Min or Su Xiaoxiao?

202
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,200
I am Su Xiaoxiao

203
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
impossible

204
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
she told me

205
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,559
Her name is Fang Min

206
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,159
There's no way she could lie to me

207
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,159
I can't come tomorrow

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,480
Because I'm going abroad

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,279
days when I'm not around

210
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,440
You should continue to take good care of yourself

211
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,600
I brought you a box of building blocks

212
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,720
Wait until your eyes are healed

213
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,039
Just fight one piece every day

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
I guess I'll wait until you finish.

215
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,279
I'll be back soon

216
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
I put it here for you

217
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,799
I know

218
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,799
You may not want to talk yet

219
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,759
But I believe

220
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,759
you will get better

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,879
Fei Mingxuan

222
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,000
I am leaving

223
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,240
Wait a moment

224
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
Your name is Fang Min, right?

225
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,759
Your name was in the news

226
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,799
yes

227
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,639
My name is Fang Min

228
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,080
goodbye

229
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,120
Being an actor for so many years

230
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,639
This is the first time someone asked me what my name is
