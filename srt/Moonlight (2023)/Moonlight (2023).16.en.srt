Xiao Min is here. Have you seen it?

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,959
She should go to the toilet

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,439

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's go together later

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,079
It’s not easy for two people to date

19
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,799
Let's go

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,719

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,519

00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm very happy when someone picks me up after get off work.

24
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm so happy that winter is coming

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,959
Snowing

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Very happy too

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,639
But

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,199
The happiest thing for me is

29
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:15,840

42
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,759

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,680
Then what?

47
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,920
I didn't dare to think about it then

48
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,360
Tang and Song Dynasties

49
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,839
We can't be friends anymore

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Cold weather

51
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
You should go back quickly too

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,800
So what do you want to do in the future?

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
I

54
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,959
I want to study abroad

55
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,040
And you

56
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,120
Self-driving tour

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,000
That

59
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,360

Just send me a postcard

61
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:45,920

62
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,160
Mr. Fei

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Do you really want that one?

64
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Five million diamond engagement ring

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Put it in this balloon?

66
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,879
What if Sister Xiaoxiao lets it fly away?

67
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
Come, come, okay

68
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,680
Look at the camera

69
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,959
What I hate most in my life is balloons

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
Prick one if you see one

71
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,600
puncture one

72
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,399
Can't

73
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,800
She hates balloons the most in her life

74
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,800
she is that

75
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,439
People who pop balloons as soon as they see them

76
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,879
Then a big diamond ring will pop out when the time comes.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
That must be such a surprise

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,839
Then I will propose immediately

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Agree immediately

80
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,959
Fei Zongchong

81
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
It's almost over over there, right?

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,759
Get ready

83
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,600
Wait for my good news

84
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,399
Hard work, hard work, bye

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

86
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,240
why are you here

87
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,560
I want to take you for a walk

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,519
Where did the balloon come from?

89
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's take a walk first

90
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,480
Xiaoxiao

91
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,399
How do you feel about this balloon?

92
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Don't feel anything

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,879
I don't like balloons

94
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,800
you don't like

95
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,839
Then if you don't like it

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,279
You need to prick it

97
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,439
Why did you let go of my balloon?

98
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,360
I don't like balloons

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,839
Then shouldn't you prick it?

100
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
Why should you puncture it?

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,000
Since I don't like it

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
Then I'll let it leave my world

103
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
Wouldn't that be great?

104
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,680
This balloon is worth five million

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
It’s not ten yuan

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,680
what

107
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,279
I originally planned to propose to you

108
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,720
Big diamond ring in balloon

109
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,560
Five million, five million

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Chase

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,399
Hurry up

112
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,639
Hurry up

113
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,199
over there

114
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
My five million

115
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,720
Just disappeared

116
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,759
Tell me

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
Am I worth five million?

118
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:22,879
value

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,279
I agree to your proposal

120
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,920
Go to the Civil Affairs Bureau now to get your certificate.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
wait a minute wait a minute

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,080
What are you doing?

123
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,639
I seem to feel again

124
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
You're not worth five million

125
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,720
what do you mean

126
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,399
literal meaning

127
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,399
say it again

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
I mean

129
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,799
priceless

130
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,639
you are priceless
