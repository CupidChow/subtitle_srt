1
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,560
Mr. Fei knows it’s your birthday today

2
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,920
He specially arranged for me to come here early in the morning.

3
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,120
Prepare for this birthday surprise

4
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,200
Me I never celebrate my birthday

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,519
Has your boyfriend never given it to you?

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,799
He and I both feel

7
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,680
This expensive ritual

8
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,439
It doesn't seem necessary

9
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,079
This is not a ritual

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,159
Just someone happy that you were born

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
Make a wish

12
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,879
Me I'd better not allow it

13
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:41,920
me

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,439
It won't happen anyway

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,719
promise one

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
I never promised

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,199
I don’t know what to promise either.

18
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,520
So be it

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
Give me three seconds

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
I'll help you realize your wish

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Can it still be like this?

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,639
close your eyes

23
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,199
Stop

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,879
Stop

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,479
Don't come here

26
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,479
come and see here

27
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,599
Take a picture for you

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
Give it to you

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,560
This is material about the company’s formaldehyde problem

30
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't do this

31
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,240
I believe you will also have your own judgment

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,479
How are you doing on your business trip there?

33
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,159
my birthday today

34
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,719
I really want to talk to you

35
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,439
I brought you breakfast

36
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,840
So pretentious

37
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,639
This is the first time you went to the hospital to see me

38
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,479
Brought to me

39
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,199
We have tried our best to save your parents

40
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Please express your condolences

41
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,319
Because you hit a rock

42
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,959
causing temporary visual impairment

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
It will recover after a while

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
you don't have to worry

45
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,079
Have something to eat

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,959
yesterday

47
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,920
A drowning incident occurred in Wuyin Mountain

48
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,439
A young man fell into the water

49
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,519
Fortunately saved

50
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,319
It is reported

51
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,920
The rescuer is new to the entertainment industry

52
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,959
Up-and-coming star Fang Min

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,600
It seems there is no need for me to come see you.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
I saved you yesterday in vain

55
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,800
I tried my best to save you

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
It also delayed filming

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
But you are here looking for life and death

58
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,160
do you know

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Living is much harder than dying

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,639
But since you survived, you have to be brave

61
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,199
All acts of suicide are cowardly

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
you are a boy

63
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
This is also very unhandsome.

64
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,040
I brought you a gift

65
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,839
What about here?

66
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,399
Recorded weather forecast for the next fifteen days

67
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
Do you want to feel it?

68
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,360
September 9

69
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,240
The sun is warm

70
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,920
Breeze

71
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,800
It is advisable to bask in the sun

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
Big mouthful of food

73
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,040
Open mouth and hands

74
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Feel the shape of the wind

75
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
Su Xiaoxiao

76
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,480
I gave you all the documents

77
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,480
I can support you no matter what decision you make

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
I can give you whatever you want

79
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,439
I

80
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
I only hope

81
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
Don't love the wrong person

82
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,560
i don't want anything

83
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,199
Good luck with borrowing money

84
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,199
I won't love the wrong person

85
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,639
Even if love is wrong

86
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,079
I'm not afraid either

87
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,759
Hello

88
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,439
Xiaoxiao

89
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,879
How are you handling it over there?

90
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,199
I've got Fei Mingxuan's signature

91
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,120
Evidence of approval for use of formaldehyde-containing materials

92
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,319
Can expose him

93
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,800
bring him notoriety

94
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,919
but

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,360
How about I handle it?

96
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Let’s talk again

97
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,480
I don't want you to get involved now either.

98
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,039
Right

99
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,039
happy birthday

100
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,759
It turns out you still remember
