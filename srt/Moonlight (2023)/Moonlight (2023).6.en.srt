1
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,640
no

2
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,760
look

3
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you lying?

4
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,840
Instead of worrying about this

5
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,760
Might as well think about how we're going to spend tonight

6
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,079
We have to arrive at Haishi tomorrow, right?

7
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,680
yes

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,799
I think what we should be worried about most now is

9
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,799
Or your body

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
Sister, how was my performance just now?

11
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,719
The director is praising you

12
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,640
Very good

13
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,640
nice

14
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,799
Xiaoxiao

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
What's wrong with you

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,879
where have you gone

17
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,879
The next scene is coming soon

18
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,919
Your martial arts part is up

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
Someone fell into the water

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,919
I'm going to save people

21
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,800
What should you do if your costume is wet?

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,439
If you fall into the water, you should contact the rescue team immediately.

23
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,680
How dangerous would it be to go down there by yourself?

24
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,520
Sister, stop talking and go help Xiaoxiao

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,759
Bring me some clean clothes

26
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,680
Su Xiaoxiao

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,479
Don't tell anyone about saving people.

28
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,719
Let me explain to the reporter

29
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,000
what are you thinking

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,879
nothing

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
Please change your clothes

32
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,199
I got it in the car

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,879
You'll catch a cold like this

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Thank you

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Su Xiaoxiao

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
In fact, I have always

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,759
I really want to say sorry to you.

38
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,759
I used to tear off your disguise

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,159
I said a lot of outrageous things

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,960
But what’s actually my inner thoughts?

41
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,120
I think

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,199
you are familiar with

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
very smart

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,479
Very bold

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,719
also very cute

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
What do you think?

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,039
Su Xiaoxiao

48
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,919
can you hear

49
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,479
Su Xiaoxiao

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,599
are you okay

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Su Xiaoxiao

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,159
let me go

53
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,680
I'll take you back to rest

54
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,800
Why are you staring at me?

55
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,439
Are you feeling better?

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
Don't do this

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,439
I'm not used to it

58
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,639
good

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,519
Su Xiaoxiao

60
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,480
In fact, I don’t need to check you, I already know

61
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,399
you

62
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,079
It’s Bai Yueguang who saved me

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,879
You

64
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Better read less romance novels

65
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,759
Does it really matter who saved you?

66
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,120
important

67
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
After my parents left

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,560
You are the only person who is truly good to me

69
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,759
when i am alone

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,319
always over and over again

71
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,160
Listen to the Walkman you left for me

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,439
Even

73
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,600
In your few minutes and seconds

74
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,319
I know everything you said

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,079
the first time i see you

76
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,519
hear your voice

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,959
I just think

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,439
like

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,879
like

80
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,199
Su Xiaoxiao

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,759
so cold

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,199
so cold

83
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,360
when i am alone

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000
I will always listen to the Walkman you left behind over and over again

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,879
Even

86
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,360
In your few minutes and seconds

87
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,000
I know everything you said

88
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,079
Su Xiaoxiao

89
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,000
Su Xiaoxiao

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
Su Xiaoxiao, you won't leave me here, will you?

91
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,439
Who left you here?

92
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,879
Who do you think I am?

93
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,519
When I woke up I found you weren't there

94
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,759
I thought you were gone

95
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,439
Are you afraid that I will leave

96
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,120
Still afraid that I would take the file away?

97
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
Sorry

98
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,639
misunderstood you

99
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't accept the apology

100
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,639
Just give me the file

101
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,199
I'll give you the file

102
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,959
Aren't you going to leave right away?

103
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,079
You, please read less romance novels

104
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Pretty good

105
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,639
You go back, I'm ready to sleep

106
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,399
Su Xiaoxiao, I still have a fever

107
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,960
Aren't you going to take care of me?

108
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,080
How old are you? You still have to take care of me.

109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,399
I have a fever too

110
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay, that's just right.

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
We depend on each other for life

112
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,039
Besides, this hotel now

113
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,799
This is the only room left

114
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,240
What a tacky routine, Mr. Fei

115
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,639
You have a fiancée and I also have a boyfriend.

116
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,799
Do you think this is really appropriate?

117
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,559
Although inappropriate

118
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,399
But this is really the only room left

119
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,519
so what

120
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,320
Otherwise

121
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,600
I sleep in the living room

122
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,039
Let's keep a safe distance

123
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,399
Happy birthday Su Xiaoxiao

124
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,519
childish

125
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Why do you still have a birthday surprise?
