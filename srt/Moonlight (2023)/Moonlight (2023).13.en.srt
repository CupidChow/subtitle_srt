1
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,359
Are these all true?

2
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:20,719
Of course

3
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,719
I am also a fan of Minmin

4
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,599
I think this time

5
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,439
What she needs most is the protection of our fans

6
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,760
Right, right

7
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,239
I must restore the truth on behalf of the fans

8
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,120
Let these bad guys get the punishment they deserve

9
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,799
right

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,000
Su Xiaoxiao

11
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
You wait

12
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,760
Hurry up

13
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,079
Hurry up

14
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,959
Are you Fang Min’s stand-in Su Xiaoxiao?

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,079
Is it? Please answer

16
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,640
I heard you pretended to be Fang Min

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,599
Get engaged with President Minghao

18
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,680
Is this true?

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,200
Su Xiaoxiao, please answer

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,719
We are helping fans dig out the truth

21
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,840
Please answer Su Xiaoxiao

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Su Xiaoxiao

23
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,200
We are helping fans dig out the truth

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,079
please answer

25
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,400
Su Xiaoxiao, please answer

26
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,719
please answer

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,639
Does the truth also include invading other people's privacy?

28
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,680
Artists are not people

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
You don’t deserve privacy, do you?

30
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,159
get out of the way

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,159
please answer

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,759
Su Xiaoxiao, please answer

33
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,759
please answer

34
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,560
Su Xiaoxiao

35
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,840
Not allowed to leave

36
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,120
please answer

37
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,599
are you okay

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,319
I

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
It's OK

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,360
Su Xiaoxiao, don’t go, Su Xiaoxiao

41
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,800
Su Xiaoxiao Su Xiaoxiao don’t go

42
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,520
Mr. Fei is treating the wounds inside

43
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,439
It'll be fine in a moment

44
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,919
Fei Mingxuan

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,199
are you okay

46
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,800
thank you

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
When you were injured just now

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
I think a lot

49
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,879
I don't know when it started

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,879
heart

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,439
Start to care about you a little bit

52
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,319
Just yesterday

53
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,879
after yesterday

54
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,439
I'm not sure what's going on either

55
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,560
Just a mess in my head

56
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,960
My heart is also in a mess

57
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,680
I don't know either

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,879
What kind of emotion is this?

59
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,919
Anyway, that’s what I want to tell you

60
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,199
It snows in the subtropics

61
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
I think

62
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,879
I kind of like you too

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
Fei Mingxuan

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,759
do you hear me

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
Could you please give me some response?

66
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,680
It's very embarrassing for me to be here like this

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,399
Fine

68
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,680
Then you think I didn't say that

69
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,040
What did you say you wanted to get me?

70
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,839
this

71
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,199
do you remember

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
that time

73
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,439
i lost my parents

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Also lost the light

75
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,240
lost all hope

76
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,399
My world at that time

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
Only black and white remains

78
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,519
It's you

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,759
Gave me the courage to live

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,439
your encouragement

81
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,839
and this little answering machine

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,360
over a long period of time

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
accompany me

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Go on

85
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,279
my world

86
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
because of you

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,160
no more darkness

88
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,160
Su Xiaoxiao

89
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's date

90
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,639
is it ok

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,959
Fireworks in the sky that only belong to you

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,319
Do you like it?

93
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,639
so beautiful

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,240
where did you get it

95
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,120
Then leave it alone

96
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,600
Only mine

97
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,959
Only belongs to you Su Xiaoxiao

98
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,240
it's beautiful

99
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,360
Scumbag

100
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,279
I told you not to hurt Xiaoxiao

101
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,759
Just wait for me
