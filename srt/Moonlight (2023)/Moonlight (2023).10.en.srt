1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,799
snow

2
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,879
How can it snow here?

3
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,159
I

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,319
I went up first

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
Landlord brother

6
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,159
Why are you at my house?

7
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,200
What is your home?

8
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
Your boyfriend vacated the house

9
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,159
My deposit was refunded to him.

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,519
Pack your things and leave quickly

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
what did you say

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,200
you

13
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,319
Don’t want anything else

14
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,759
Pick it up another day

15
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,759
Broke up with boyfriend

16
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,520
Gone

17
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,840
Su Xiaoxiao

18
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,240
Where are you going?

19
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,879
Xiaoxiao

20
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,319
Why did you follow me?

21
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,960
you said then

22
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,560
Wait until the castle is ready

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,319
Maybe we'll meet

24
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,800
So I've been waiting for this day

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
I wanted to say

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,639
You take one piece a day

27
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,840
After you build this castle

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,719
I've almost forgotten about it.

29
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,319
But every time I take one

30
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,560
I will think of you once

31
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,599
I have never forgotten our agreement

32
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
I just want you to see this castle

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,840
OK?

34
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,840
I've finished reading

35
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,159
Let's go back

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,479
More than three thousand pieces

37
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,759
I've been riding for a long time

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,319
You just take a casual look like this

39
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,000
Isn't it a bit too perfunctory?

40
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,920
OK

41
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
Then I'll take a serious look at it

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,639
so beautiful

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,839
I have read it carefully now

44
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,519
You can go back, right?

45
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
In fact, your castle

46
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,399
It came at a particularly bad time.

47
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,920
I just got kicked out of my house by my landlord

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
This situation now

49
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,319
No matter how beautiful the castle you give me

50
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,600
I can't believe it's mine

51
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,600
do you understand

52
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,319
I see

53
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,480
So be it

54
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Do you want to stay at my house for a while first?

55
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,199
I mean

56
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,839
It's somewhat unsafe for you to live here.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,079
I can let you borrow it for a while

58
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,199
No

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,639
I quite enjoy this now

60
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,199
Star-gazing luxury life

61
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,439
Look at the stars, I'm too poor

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,639
It's getting late. Go home quickly.

63
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
don't worry about me

64
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,279
Why

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,040
Why

66
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,879
What did I do wrong?

67
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,000
Do not cry

68
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,319
good

69
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,240
Do not cry

70
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
Why are you back?

71
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,039
Because I also want to live a luxurious life

72
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,600
I want to see stars

73
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,039
Where are the stars?

74
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,919
It seems not

75
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,120
Su Xiaoxiao

76
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,759
Why are you trying to be brave?

77
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,600
Then I'll buy a lottery ticket tomorrow

78
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,159
Then get rich overnight

79
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Go to a star hotel

80
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,879
Thank you

81
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,279
Why should you thank me when it's yours?

82
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,679
I should be the one to thank you

83
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,320
Why am I so stupid?

84
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,039
I am now homeless

85
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Why should you blame yourself?

86
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,759
Because of love brain

87
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm really that stubborn

88
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,600
From beginning to end, I never doubted the Tang and Song dynasties

89
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,440
Wait a moment

90
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,759
Many people now

91
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,159
They all call sincere devotion a love brain

92
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,240
I think the love brain is quite good.

93
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,159
Say it again

94
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,159
He is blind

95
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,480
blind

96
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,399
I'm going to sleep

97
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
that

98
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
I prepared the equipment

99
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,039
How about I sleep outside?

100
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,799
ok good night

101
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,799
good

102
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,879
It's a bit cold outside

103
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,519
And now there is no internet on the mobile phone

104
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,559
I can't get a taxi either

105
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,600
I can't go home either

106
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Let me help you take a look

107
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,039
Mine doesn’t have internet either

108
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,200
good

109
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
I see

110
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,919
Go to sleep
