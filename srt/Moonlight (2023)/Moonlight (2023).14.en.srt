1
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,480
This lady, who are you looking for?

2
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Why don't you register at the front desk first?

3
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,040
Let me inform you

4
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm Fang Min

5
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,400
Are you sure you want to stop me?

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,599
Trouble now

7
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,640
Miss Fang, it’s not me who wants to stop you.

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,920
It's Miss Su inside

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,879
Miss Su, right?

10
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,439
It's her I'm looking for

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,200
get out of the way

12
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,480
It's over. It's really over now.

13
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,040
What do you want to eat today

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,359
Iron pot stew

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,159
good

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,359
I'll ask Luo Cheng to order it

17
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,599
Miss Fang

18
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,159
I heard

19
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,719
You two are together

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,079
You didn't like me before

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you like it to death?

22
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,519
yes

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
It was a misunderstanding before

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,480
What I always like is Su Xiaoxiao

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I got the wrong person before

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
I thought you were my Bai Yueguang

27
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,159
Bai Yueguang

28
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,400
You are so earthy

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,240
Okay, stop teasing him.

30
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,439
What's going on

31
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,240
Why don't you go out first?

32
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,680
I have something to tell Xiao Min

33
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,759
OK

34
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,319
why are you here

35
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,439
Xiaoxiao

36
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,199
That thing before

37
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,439
Sorry

38
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,800
why do you say that

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,120
It has nothing to do with you

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
It’s all because we believed too much in the Tang and Song Dynasties

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,599
Do you remember what I told you before?

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
have you ever thought about

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,759
What kind of person do you want to find in the future?

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,919
I have someone I like

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
at his place

46
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm not a star or an actor

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,479
Just the person he likes

48
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,879
He only cares about whether I eat well or not

49
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,240
Do you sleep well or not?

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,800
But I'm going abroad soon

51
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,400
you know too

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,800
My life is arranged by my father

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
so

54
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
you ask me

55
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
What kind of person do you want to be with?

56
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,439
Rather

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
What kind of person can I be with?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Fang Min

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
I think one day

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,400
You will definitely grow up on your own

61
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,719
that time

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
You can decide for yourself

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,039
What kind of person can I find?

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,199
how about you

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
What kind of boy do you like

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,240
me

67
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,159
me

68
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,840
I have been feeling insecure since I was a child.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,280
so i think

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,919
Where is my other half?

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,800
No need to be rich

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,560
No need to look good either

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,279
He just needs to choose me unconditionally

74
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,360
Believe me

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,399
At the lowest point in my life

76
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,000
You can also accompany me

77
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,399
I think such a person

78
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,120
i am enough

79
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,240
Xiaoxiao

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
Wait until I go abroad

81
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,879
You can definitely meet such a good person

82
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,120
Quick, quick, roast!

83
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,000
I have to film a movie later. It’s so cold.

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Anyway

85
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,079
Whether before or after

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,759
I will always protect you

87
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,759
Thank you Xiaoxiao

88
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,879
This is what you said is a good way

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,759
Just those tidbits

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,279
The public relations part was handled in minutes

91
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,560
Cerebral thrombosis will make you breathe out.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
What do you mean I want you?

93
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,680
A waste

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Mr. Fang

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
It doesn't matter

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Public opinion has fermented

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,279
Just let the public know

98
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,399
The person attending the event that day was not Xiao Min

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Then Minghao Group has lost credibility.

100
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,720
Fei Mingxuan still cannot explain to shareholders

101
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,839
It seems there is no other good way

102
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,040
As the saying goes, if you are reluctant to let go of your children, you cannot trap the wolf.

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,199
After Fei Mingxuan steps down,

104
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
Plus those shares owned by Fang Min

105
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,279
The right to speak of Minghao Group

106
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
It's in our own hands

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,959
Tang and Song Dynasty, do a good job

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
rest assured

109
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,240
I won't treat you badly

110
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,000
I saw Xiao Min today

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,920
I think she's a little nervous

112
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,160
You mentioned this

113
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,360
I provide information

114
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,079
Tonight at nine o'clock

115
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,040
Fang Zhengqing is going to hold a banquet at the company

116
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,959
tonight

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,560
no

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
I think it must be the Hongmen Banquet.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm too lazy to go

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,519
Definitely have to go tonight

122
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,560
I'd like to see

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,879
How did they finish singing this scene?

124
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,639
Go, go, go

125
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,519
Go change clothes quickly

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Go, go, go, go

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,759
did i ever tell you

128
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,160
Don't provoke Xiaoxiao again

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Xiao Min

130
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,519
I know you are angry with me

131
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
Can you give me another chance?

132
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,920
I have Su Xiaoxiao’s video there

133
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,720
Be good

134
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,040
Go out with me and finish the trick

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,759
Tang and Song Dynasties

136
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,720
Just be a human being

137
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:31,920
Everyone

138
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,040
My daughter Fang Min

139
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,360
This is the Tang and Song Dynasties

140
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
Shareholders of our company

141
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,680
What a talent

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,480
yes

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Come, come, come

144
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Come

145
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,120
Xiaoxiao, you are so beautiful today

146
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Tang

147
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,079
Can you lend me Xiao Min for a few minutes?

148
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,120
I have something to say to her

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,879
Xiao Min doesn’t want to leave me for a minute

150
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,160
She should say this herself

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,040
Relatively reliable

152
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,839
Mr. Tang doesn't have to answer for her.

153
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Why are you afraid that I will say bad things about you?

154
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
That's not true

155
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,160
What you said to me

156
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,639
I'll take it as a compliment.

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,759
OK

158
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,279
Then let's take a step to talk

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Xiao Min

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,320
Did he threaten you?

161
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,080
He said he has your video

162
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,080
I

163
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,279
Xiaoxiao

164
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,080
Don't be impulsive

165
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,440
I really can't stand it anymore

166
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,879
Don't worry, I know it

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Why didn't I notice it before?

168
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
He is such a scumbag

169
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,360
And he's such a complete scumbag

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,759
It’s not too late to find out now

171
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,759
After all, a red flower like me

172
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,159
He also needs green leaves like his to set it off.

173
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,559
I really want to piss him off

174
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,639
Splash it if you want

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,360
Hesitation will only lead to defeat

176
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,279
Only if you are decisive will it be in vain

177
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,879
real

178
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Then I'll set an example

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Just do whatever you want

180
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,399
I'll help you carry it

181
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,159
OK

182
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,799
go ahead

183
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,799
Why have you been egging me on today?

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,200
Because

185
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,840
I've always wanted to splash him too

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Otherwise

187
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,240
Let's have an acting show

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
Pretend to splash casually

189
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,679
That won't work

190
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
If we want to splash it, we should splash it openly and openly

191
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,279
I'll take a call

192
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,399
What's going on?
