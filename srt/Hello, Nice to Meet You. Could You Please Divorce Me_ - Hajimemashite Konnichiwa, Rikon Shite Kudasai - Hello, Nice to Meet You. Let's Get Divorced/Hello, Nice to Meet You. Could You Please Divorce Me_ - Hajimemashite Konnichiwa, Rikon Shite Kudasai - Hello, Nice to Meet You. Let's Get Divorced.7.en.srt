4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,810
I want to promote you and your paintings to a wider audience.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,520
Could we be partners?

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,020
I've fallen for you.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,200
"You've fallen for me"?

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,475
Do you mean...

9
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:35,270
I really like...

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,260
your art, Rio-san.

Thank you.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,970
It's really enchanting.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,160
Right. You were talking about my art.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Yes.

Please positively consider us as business partners.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,880
Also, I have a suggestion.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,680
A suggestion?

20
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:12,650
How would you like to take your art overseas?

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,990
You have the talent.

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,970
Overseas...

23
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:26,010
If you are willing, I will support you in any way possible.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,770
Thank you.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,450
But... I have to discuss this with my husband.

26
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:42,940
Does your decision entirely depend on what your husband says?

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,340
What?

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,680
I don't want to pry,

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,060
but not every husband likes a more successful wife.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,300
I have witnessed plenty of such cases.

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,780
But Masamoto-san...

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,210
isn't that kind of a man.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,770
I see.

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,030
I'm sorry if I crossed the line. I apologize.

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,940
It's okay.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,990
I look forward to a positive answer.

37
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,180
Oh, that rolled cabbage was delicious!

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,785
You're an amazing cook, Rio.

39
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:28,765
Really? Thank you.

40
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,520
Well...

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,040
What is it?

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,590
Kurose-san asked me to continue working together.

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,963
Did he?

44
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:51,963
He also mentioned taking my art overseas.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,730
What do you think?

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,190
What do you mean?

47
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,410
Do you not want me to go, Masatomo-san?

48
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,340
Would I not want it?

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,170
Of course, I would.

50
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,915
It means people approve of your art. Isn't it great?

51
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,300
Congratulations, Rio!

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,690
Thank you.

53
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,680
I knew you would say so, Masatomo-san.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
So what's the plan?

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,800
So Kurose-san says it's effective to do a media interview first

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,400
and post it on social media later...

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,450

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,675
Oh, by the way, a German art magazine reached out;

93
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:06,330
they want to feature you, Rio-san.

94
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,260
Really?

95
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,080

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,410
Very few.

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,490
and some classmates, I think.

119
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,480
Those people might have leaked the information.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,810

121
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,970

We don't need to care about people who hurt us.

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,110
You should value the words of those who cherish you.

139
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,280
Rio-san, you don't need to forcefully make yourself stronger.

140

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,710
Don't worry. Kurose-san comforted me, and I feel better now.

180
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,856
Kurose...

181
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:46,453
He said that we don't need to care about people who hurt us

182
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:50,653
and that I should chase after my dream the way I like.

183
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,420
I see.

184
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,250
Are you okay, Masatomo-san?

185
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,965
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

186
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:07,780
Don't say that. It's all my fault.

187
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,480
No.

188
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,850
I'm really sorry.

189
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:23,264
Well, I was shocked after reading about those rumors,

190
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:26,940
but now I know how hard it is to promote yourself.

191
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,270
After all this time,

192
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:34,260
I can imagine how you must've felt when a wrong rumor about you was published.

193
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,610
Okay. I need to be strong now.

194
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,935
Sorry, the dinner isn't ready yet.

195
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:50,840
Or maybe we can go out somewhere.

196
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,640
Not tonight.

197
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,970
What?

198
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,130
Let's stop going out together for a while.

199
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:05,670
I don't want anyone to know about me and let it interfere with your career.

200
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,165
It's fine. I don't care about that.

201
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,446
It doesn't work like that.

202
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,020
We don't want to create a scene, don't we?

203
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,790
Let's order take-out. I'll get changed.

204
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,850
<i>As long as we're together, the past will always haunt us.</i>

205
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,310
<i>I'll only end up holding her back.</i>

206
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:58,702
<i>I always keep all my artists under control.</i>

207
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:01,552
<i>That's my approach.</i>

208
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:09,910
<i>I thought that taking advantage of Rio's feelings will be a shortcut to success, but...</i>

209
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,600
<i>I'm glad you followed your dream.</i>

210
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,010
Masa, did you see this?

211
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,722
<i>[The man who bought Yuki Rio at 16, is CEO Takamine Masatomo]</i>

212
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:30,860
I knew it was only a matter of time before they found out.

213
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,660
We should release our official statement quickly.

214
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,900
Hello. Thank you for your continuous support.

215
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,800
I understand. Thank you.

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,930
What happened?

217
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,650
Our lawyer wants to see you before the board meeting.

218
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:02,060
All I can do is give an honest explanation.

219
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,410
Right, but...

220
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,150
If that's true,

221
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,500
some shareholders may demand your resignation, Masa.

222
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,730
Hello.

223
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,420
<i>You have a visitor, Sir.</i>

224
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:45,365
- Thank you for the other day.
- Sure.

225
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:47,570
Sorry, I'm bothering you at work.

226
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,687
This is for you.

227
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:51,487
Thank you.

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,780
Have a seat.

229
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,301
What brings you here today?

230
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,680
I need to discuss about Sensei Yuki's work.

231
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,150
About Rio.

232
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,580
I want to take her to study overseas.

233
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,300
Overseas...

234
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,585
They have a program to invite young artists to local studios

235
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:24,350
and give them a work environment.

236
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,740
The duration is at least one year.

237
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,110
I'm here to ask for your cooperation.

238
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,040
"Cooperation"?

239
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,270
Sensei Yuki is torn about what to do.

240
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:44,780
However, a small encouraging nudge from you may get her a good opportunity.

241
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
Sending her overseas...

242
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,760
This will be a precious opportunity for her to become a top artist in the future.

243
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,140
Besides, this latest scandal may severely impact her focus.

244
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,440
Are you saying no?

245
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,480
No. That's...

246
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,910
How do you feel about Rio, Kurose-san?

247
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,415
What do you mean by how?

248
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:25,000
Are you supporting Rio because you think she has potential as a painter?

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,630
Is that all about it?

250
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,300
Would you trust me if I say yes?

251
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,580
In that case, I can introduce her to a new female dealer you can trust.

252
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,620
She can shine more brilliantly as an artist.

253
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,380
She needs your support.

254
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,277
Please, I request you.

255
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:11,330
Are you done for the day?

256
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,230
Kurose-san.

257
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,385
I'm wondering about him.

258
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:17,980
Do you mean Takamine-san?

259
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,220
Lately, he seems worn out,

260
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,150
but he never says anything.

261
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,930
Maybe he thinks I won't understand.

262
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,360
Maybe he's worried about the scandal.

263
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,610
Are you okay?

264
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,850
I've been thinking...

265
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,650
As long as we are together, he will keep blaming himself for the rest of his life.

266
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:05,390
A married couple should be able to share

267
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,360
hardships and pain that come along the way.

268
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,023
However, we are in the opposite situation.

269
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,050
I've always wanted to ask you.

270
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,040
Why did you choose Takamine-san?

271
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:28,540
Wasn't this marriage forced by your parents?

272
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,720
Well,

273
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,290
I don't know that either.

274
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,740
I hated him at first.

275
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,340
But then...

276
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,300
I like you.

277
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,740
You mean my paintings, right?

278
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,610

What's going on?

287
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,092
I looked it up and made it.

288
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:50,632
No guarantee of taste, and it took three hours to make it.

289
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,770
It looks so scrumptious!

290
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,909

What?

293
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:28,040
You should go overseas with Kurose-san to study painting.

294
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,800
What's that all of a sudden?

295
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,940
This is my first time falling in love.

296
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,610
I wanted you to stay with me.

297
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,280
But that's just my arrogance.

298
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,350
