you agreed to pay 50 million on every birthday.

61

62

<i>had no other choice but to accept that proposal.</i>

74
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:33,720
<i>The decisions made by Father were absolute in the Yuki family.</i>

Really?

92
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,588
Maybe she looked beautiful because she was wearing a kimono.

93
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:49,892
No way. Everyone in the office was talking about her.

94
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,150
But why is she asking for a divorce now?

95
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,150
She must have found someone she likes.

96
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,170
"Someone she likes"?

97
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,490
What nonsense!

98
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,340
She's free to be with anyone she wants.

99
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,140
It's not that straightforward, is it?

100
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,120
It's ridiculous. Love is just an illusion of our mind.

101
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,530
<i>Masa has extraordinary skills when it comes to work.</i>

102
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,730
Divorce is out of the question.

103

- <i>But he's oblivious about people's emotions.</i>

105

<i>Plus, he hates losing.</i>

106
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:27,460
Let's think this through.

107
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,260
Now, I'm against divorce too.

108
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,695
It'll look really bad ahead of the board meeting in December.

109
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,930
Right?

110
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,890

111
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,310
It didn't seem like they're having an affair.

112
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,390
Do you want me to look into it?

113
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,551
Yes, thoroughly. I want every detail about that woman.

114
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:53,140
Quite strange. I can't believe you're interested in someone, Masa.

115
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,890
It's not that.

116
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,705
I want to have an advantage in the divorce. That's it.

117
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:08,930
My Lady, I'll return as soon as I finish my work.

118
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,025
I'm not a child.

119
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:14,160
Besides, you are no longer a retainer of the Yuki family, Hazumi.

120
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,325
- You were let go after the downfall of our house...
- That's not true.

121
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:21,018
I won't ever leave your side, my lady.

122
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,010

123
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,820

127
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600

What's wrong now? What do you want this time?

136
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,800
I am here to get divorce papers.

137
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,770
Essentially, it was your job to contact me.

138
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,980
- Rio.
- Don't call my name so casually!

139
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,245
But you're my wife!

140
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,995
We're going to be strangers soon.

141
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:34,390
Divorce papers have been given to the vice president, Amamiya.

142
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,540
What?

143
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,710
He's in charge of all the administrative stuff.

144
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,550
Administrative stuff?

145
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,300
You can't even do that yourself?

146
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,450
It's not easy to get a divorce for someone in my position.

147
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,851
How long will it take?

148
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,860
- Rio.
- I said don't call me that...

149
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,925
I'll call you so in front of my employees.

150
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:58,595
Then again, it's rude of you to show up without informing.

151
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,570
I apologize for that.

152
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,700
But you see, I don't have a choice.

153
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,850
I don't have your contact information.

154
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:13,760
Then give me yours. What's your phone number?

155
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,820
Phone number?

156
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,480

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,550
It's the first time I'm using a phone.

163
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,775
First time? What?

164
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:46,315
That's because I never felt the need.

165
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,640
No way.

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,440
Give it to me.

Okay, I'll leave you to it.

171
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,255
Call me when the divorce papers are ready.

172

Wait, wait, wait!

173

What are you doing?

174
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,525
Well, uh...

175
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:25,365
- Are you staying here for a while? Do you have a place to stay?
- What?

176
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:28,015
Of course, I do.

177
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm staying at... Grand State Hotel.

178
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,395
The Grand State Hotel?

179
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,470
You've chosen a rather fine place.

180
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,185
Oh, really?

181
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,205
What do you mean? Do you not know?

182
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,060
Hazumi picked it for me.

183
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,795
Hazumi?

184
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,077
Is that the one who was with you the other day?

185
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,245
Yes.

186
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,655
What's his deal?

187
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:57,840
Hazumi is a descendant of chamberlains who've served the Yuki family for generations.

188
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,355
You wouldn't guess it, but he is an expert in Japanese fencing.

189
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:02,055
I see.

190
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,570
Is this the place?

191
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,990
Ten, hundred, wait, what! No!

192
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,360
Oh, no! So many zeros!

193
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,425
Wait... Oh, no!

194
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,600
What do I do first?

195
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,410
First of all, I should...

196
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,920
She looks like an ordinary woman.

197
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,760
I don't understand what the fuss is.

198
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,290
So...

199
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:38,070
if you check out now, do you have another place to go to?

200
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,440
Do you want to stay at my place?

201
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,240
What?

202
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
Rio.

203
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,245
There is...

204
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,430
no way I can do it!

205
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,650
Whoa!

206
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,750
You ignored me for ten years; now don't pity me!

207
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,020
Even I have people I can rely on!

208
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,705
And who are those people?

209
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,820
That's none of your business.

210
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,740
W-Wait!

211
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,710
Such a reckless woman!

212
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,720
<i>There is a proposal to marry the Yuki family's daughter.</i>

213
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,650
Marrying a strange woman?

214
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,738
I will do it.

215
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,500
<i>It was the only way I knew how to do it back then.</i>

216
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,140
Ugh! Damn it!

217
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,880
God knows how she will survive in Tokyo.

218
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,150
<i>My head started spinning...
[Takamine]</i>

219
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,770
<i>But I have to visit Sensei today.</i>

220
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,670
<i>[Shitara Atelier]</i>

221
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,270
<i>Coming.</i>

222
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,090
Oh, Rio!

223
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,030
It's been a while, Sensei.

224
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.

225
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,535
It's okay. Come on in.

226
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,535
Thank you.

227
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,220
<i>Sensei Shitara is my Japanese art teacher.</i>

228
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,160
<i>He is the one who helped me when I was suffering the most.</i>

229
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,600
So you're getting a divorce.

230
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,250
Yes.

231
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,110
It must be difficult for you.

232
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,280
Will you stay in Tokyo for a while then?

233
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,780
Yes.

234
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,750
What will you do now?

235
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,890
I borrowed some money from my mother for living expenses.

236
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,830
That money...

237
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,230
Didn't it come from selling yourself?

238
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

239
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,675
That was rude. I never meant to hurt you.

240
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:30,095
No, I am sorry for worrying you.

241
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,860
But I want to work hard.

242
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,570
I'm thinking I'll start with finding a place to live alone, and be independent.

243
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,910
Independent?

244
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,400
Yes.

245
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,690
I've been trapped for the past ten years.

246
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,430
I want to find my own happiness.

247
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,700
Okay. I will introduce you to a good art vendor.

248
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,290
Rio, you can make a living for yourself by selling your paintings.

249
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,615
No. I cannot cause you any more trouble, Sensei.

250
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:12,240
I just came by to say hello.

251
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,710
Hope to see you again.

252
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,748
You look pale.

253
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,820
Are you really all right?

254
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,618
Yes, I am.

255
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:26,060
I never encourage anyone without talent to dream.

256
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,300
I've been thinking about this for a while.

257
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,700
But...

258
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,600
You can count on me.

259
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,010
I will always be your best ally, Rio.

260
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,990
Thank you, Sensei.

261
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,014
<i>I can't take this anymore. My head is spinning.</i>

262
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,530
<i>I must find a place to stay tonight.</i>

263
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,695
I think Hazumi was booking a hotel on his phone.

264
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,000
Which one was it?

265
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,650
Maybe this it is.

266
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,980
<i>I came to Tokyo in search of freedom,</i>

267
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,190
<i>but I can't do anything on my own.</i>

268
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,390
<i>[Saisho Hazumi]</i>

269
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,330
<i>I can't depend on Hazumi forever.</i>

270
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,430
Rio!

271
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,850
Rio!

272
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,180
Takamine? Are you following me?

273
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,580
My apartment is right here.

274
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,730
Your apartment?

275
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,525
Another ridiculously high building...

276
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:03,675
Ridiculous?

277
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,640
What's the matter?

278
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,430
You don't have a place to stay, do you?

279
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,220
That's not true!

280
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,870
I'm going to a friend's place now.

281
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,950
Wait a second.

282
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,080
Hey, Rio! Are you all right?

283
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,530
Hey!

284
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:31,257
Rio! Rio!

285
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:54,030
<i>Timing and Subtitles by the 🌸You, Me, Divorce?🌸 Team @ Viki</i>

286
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,260
Hello, Shohei?

287
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,075
I'm sorry, Masa. I still have no idea where Rio-san is.

288
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,770
It's fine.

289
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,990
She is in my bedroom right now.

290
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,210
What?

291
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,300
She fainted in front of my apartment so I called a doctor.

292
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,690
<i>Apparently, it's just over-exhaustion.</i>

293
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,250
What exactly is going on there?

294
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,230
<i>I have no clue either.</i>

295
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,240
They told me to feed her something nutrient-rich. Can you deliver it to me?

296
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,315
Yes, well, I can, but...

297
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,695
Do you even know how to take care of her, Masa?

298
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:27,540
"Take care of her"?

299
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,500
You have to look after her properly.

300
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,553
I have to?

301
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:35,233
Is there anyone else? She's still your wife.

302
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,520
Right...

303
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,150
Just think of her as a stray kitten.

304
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,250
Yes, she might scratch me once she wakes up.

305
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,170
What a pain in the ass!

306
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,980
- Why do you sound so happy then?
- What?

307
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,590
<i>If you were old Masa,</i>

308
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,280
<i>you would make me look for Rio-san and never ever leave work early, right?</i>

309
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,260
That's because I don't want her to cause trouble for us.

310
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,200
All right, I get it.

311
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,050
Just take her responsibility, okay?

312
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,010
I'll deliver her stuff later. Bye.

313
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,530
