Sorry to visit without notice.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,685
Don't worry about it. What did you want to talk about?

4
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:21,530
I have decided that I'll officially continue my marriage with Masatomo-san.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,980
So...

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,980
I'd like to politely decline your offer.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,410
Please accept my apologies.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,140
Please don't apologize.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,680
Then you'll continue your art, right?

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,380
Yes.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,300
In that case, I have a suggestion.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,160
Rio, let's arrange an exhibition.

15
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,270
An exhibition?

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,505
Yes.

17
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:05,670
We can exhibit some of your past as well as new works.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,131
But I'm a nobody. How can I arrange an exhibition?

19
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:15,271
Like I told you before, I never encourage anyone without the talent to dream.

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,040
An exhibition? That's amazing!

21
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:25,960
- Don't you want to go ahead with it?
- No.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,075
But I just wonder if people will accept my art.

23
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:37,420
You told me yourself that you wanted to make a living with your art pieces.

24
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,730
I'm 100 percent confident that you will succeed.

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,190
Let me support your dream.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,720
Thank you. I will try my best.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,210
Also, I want to go to your hometown someday.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,330

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,320

You're cute.

I can't.

Thank you.

61
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,740
It's very well illustrated.

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,195
But it's a bit different from your old works.

63
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:36,200
How so?

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,900
Your old paintings showed conviction.

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,650
They clearly conveyed your thoughts, and the art had an overwhelming power.

66
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,180
However, I can't sense that now.

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,620
Is that so?

68
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,540
I did not realize it by myself.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,127
Why don't we change your work environment?

70
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,520
I have a spare room. You can use that.

71

Nothing. We're doing great.

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,460
I wasn't asking about you and Rio-san.

80
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,400
Ouch!

81
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,640
- It's not enough.
- What?

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,065
Rio has hit the wall or something.

83
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:57,785
She draws all the time except when she's cooking.

84
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,975

<i>What?</i>

86
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,260

<i>Okay. You have my full support.</i>

88

90
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,540
But I know nothing about art to help her.

91
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,888

92
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,440
Ouch! You jerk!

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,750
Why do you look so serious? It doesn't suit you, Masa.

94
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,060
Pull yourself together.

95
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,760

96
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,580

100
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,490
Sensei.

101
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,520
Are you okay?

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't try to push yourself too hard.

103
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,540
I've run out of ideas for my paintings.

104
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,920
No matter what I draw, it doesn't feel like myself.

105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,180
A painting is a mirror of oneself.

106
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,370
No wonder a change in the environment changes the style of work.

107
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,710
A change?

108
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,490
Maybe it's because you're with your husband now.

109
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,540
Hi.

110
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,970
Hey.

111
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
Your art is just awesome.

112
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,030
You think so?

113
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,145
Of course, I do.

114
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:21,145
I don't know anything about art, but I like yours, Rio.

115
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,130
I'm looking forward to your exhibition.

116
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,670
I don't think so.

117
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,860
Rio?

118
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,645
This is not good enough.

119
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:42,635
I want to paint like before, but I don't know how to.

120
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,620
You don't have to force yourself to draw like before, I think your existing pieces are good enough.

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,990
Don't talk as if you understand anything about it.

122
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,860
You didn't even know me back then.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,930
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,495
No, it's okay. You don't need to apologize. I was insensitive.

125
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,834
I have to go to the store. I'll be right back.

126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm sorry to visit you at this hour.

127
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,250
I didn't expect you to come and talk to me, Takamine-san.

128
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,590
How can I help you?

129
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,558
Rio is struggling with her art.

130
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:36,420
I know absolutely nothing about it

131
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,440
so I am not able to help her.

132
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,810
You surely know her better than I do, Sensei.

133
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,101
Is it because you're giving up on her?

134
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,851
Just help me understand her better.

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,800
What's bothering her?

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,980
Why is she struggling with ideas?

137
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,080
I want to understand her well.

138
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,430
I want to be her strength.

139
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:12,740
I was wondering what you were going to say.

140
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,070
She's run out of ideas to paint because she met you.

141
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,470
<i>Earlier,</i>

142
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,750
<i>I was all alone.</i>

143
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,870
<i>But everything suddenly changed</i>

144
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,980
<i>when I married a complete stranger.</i>

145
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,060
<i>I was scared...</i>

146
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,530
<i>and lonely.</i>

147
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,820
<i>But I only felt free when I was painting.</i>

148
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,330
<i>That was the only thing I enjoyed.</i>

149
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,890
<i>But...</i>

150
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,530
<i>when I met Masatomo-san,</i>

151
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,410
<i>I came to know how genuine and wonderful he is.</i>

152
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,654
<i>And I fell in love with him.</i>

153
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:03,040
<i>And here I am, unable to paint like before.</i>

154
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
<i>I'm all miserable.</i>

155
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:10,660
<i>She's been suppressing her emotions
for so long now.</i>

156
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,536
<i>I want to live by selling my own paintings.</i>

157
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:19,450
<i>But I also want to accept myself in love with Masatomo-san.</i>

158
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>- I don't want to deny this reality.
- Calm down, Rio.</i>

159
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,840
<i>You're not alone; you know that, right?</i>

160
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,130
<i>Don't worry.</i>

161
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,840
<i>I'm sure that you will deal well with your old and existing self.</i>

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,430
And now you are coming to visit me.

163
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,767
Takamine-san.

164
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,420
Yes.

165
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,800
She has become stronger.

166
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,380
It was my arrogance to preserve her talent.

167
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,120
She's just confused about all the changes.

168
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,250
Just talk to each other.

169
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,895
- Masatomo-san.
- Rio.

170
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
- I'm sorry for earlier.
- I'm sorry.

171
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,462
- I couldn't understand what you were going through.
- No, I was just

172
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,442
worried about my own problems.

173
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,580
I want to face the truth properly.

174
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,150
It's for the good of both of us, Masatomo-san.

175
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,960
Me too.

176
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,170
<i>[Yuki]</i>

177
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,270
I'm here...

178
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,110
to reintroduce myself properly.

179
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,580
I need to tell you everything about what happened ten years ago.

180
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,340
<i>My father was a real estate tycoon,</i>

181
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,020
<i>who later became a minister.</i>

182
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,590
<i>All of his children were born to his mistresses,</i>

183
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,320
but he was quite strict with all of us.

184
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,435
I lived as per my father's wishes,

185
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:41,365
and I was made in charge of his subsidiary.

186
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,900
Then ten years ago,

187
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,450
<i>my father planned a political marriage.</i>

188
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,360
<i>He wanted one of his sons to marry into the Yuki family on the verge of collapse,</i>

189
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>to acquire their name and land.</i>

190
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,520
I couldn't stand that man who treated his own people as tools.

191
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,705
Out of rebellion against Father, I deliberately tried to provoke him.

192
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,217
I can do it.

193
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,178
After marrying Rio-san, I started a business with a friend,

194
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,320
and I cut all ties with my father.

195
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,497
I didn't want to be my father's puppet anymore.

196
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,480
I had run out of patience.

197
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,050
Once the company was stable, I intended to annul this marriage.

198
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,860
But I got tangled in the business.

199
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,350
And eventually forgot all about the Yuki family.

200
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,990
It may sound like an excuse, but I'm aware that I ruined Rio-san's life.

201
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,700
I would like to sincerely apologize.

202
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,630
I am not in a position to accept your apology.

203
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,710
I could neither stop my husband's rampant behavior,

204
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,460
nor protect my daughter.

205
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,360
Rio,

206
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,960
forgive me.

207
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,740
That's not true.

208
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,755
You always did your best for me, Mom.

209
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,927
You encouraged me to live my life with free will.

210
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,537
You gave me that right nudge.

211
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,558
For me,

212
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,568
you're the best mother I could ever ask for.

213
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,420
Masatomo-san, thank you for telling the truth.

214
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:30,540
It was definitely difficult, but that wasn't it.

215
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,528
It led me to the world of Japanese art that I love.

216
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,020
And...

217
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,140
I found you, who loves me unconditionally.

218
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,050
Rio...

219
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,680
I'm truly sorry.

220
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,160
<i>Hold still.</i>

221
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:20,060
I've never seen you so quiet.

222
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,185
- Really?
- Yes.

223
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:26,965
Because you never stop telling me how much you love me.

224
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:32,677
Masatomo-san, I want to thank you for what you did today.

225
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,980
I should be the one to thank you.

226
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,790
Did you paint this, Rio?

227
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,170
I can sense your calmness and strong will.

228
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,016
This painting gave me an encouraging push.

229
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,380
You've always supported me, Rio.

230
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:18,470
When you said all those things today, a thought crossed my mind.

231
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:25,240
Thanks to you and this marriage, the Yuki family could survive.

232
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,100
You were protecting me all these years.

233
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,949
Somewhere in my heart,

234
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:48,010
I might have identified myself with you, even though we never met.

235
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,920
Both of us were controlled by our parents

236
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,990
and forced into a marriage we never wanted.

237
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:02,230
I wished that one day, we'd look back
and laugh at those difficult days.

238
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,920
That day finally came, right?

239
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,820
Masatomo-san...

240
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,330
I'm happy that I fell in love with you.

241
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,470
Thank you.

242
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:47,787
Rio...

243
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,660
I love you.

244
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:16,520
- I love you a lot!
- Me too!

245
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,030
<i>I know it now.</i>

246
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,300
<i>I figured out...</i>

247
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,700
<i>what I want to paint.</i>

248
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:46,507
<i>I've changed since I met Masatomo-san.</i>

249
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,230
<i>He made me feel warm and fulfilled.</i>

250
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:59,110
<i>He gave me everything that was missing in my life.</i>

251
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,590
<i>That's why I can't draw like before.</i>

252
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,260
<i>I...</i>

253
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,735
<i>need to paint what reflects who I am now.</i>

254
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,580
<i>My paintings are...</i>

255
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,960
<i>no longer something to comfort my loneliness.</i>

256
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,960
It's done.

257
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,860
Hi.

258
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:52,938
Hey, Masamoto-san.

259
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,930
You know what?

260
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,690
I was completely ignoring my existing self all along

261
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,650
and trying to paint for myself like I used to.

262
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,340
But I couldn't do it well.

263
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,790
Now, I realize that I've changed.

264
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,440
Now, I want to paint for someone.

265
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:31,387
So I painted this as an expression
of gratitude to you.

266
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,080
This is a reflection of my heart.

267
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,690
♫ <i>Perhaps you're not looking at anyone else, right?</i> ♫

268

♫ <i>When I say that,</i> ♫

269
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,600
So you see me as a really handsome man like this, right?

270
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:55,810
Yes, I do.

271
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,120
Wow! You don't usually say much.

272
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,640
<i>Sensei, I'd like to continue my paintings.</i>

275
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,395
Hello.

276
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,435
Hello, Sensei.
