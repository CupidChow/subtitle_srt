Oh no!

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,250
This smells delicious. What is it?

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,990
Of course, I made it. Isn't it the part of exchange terms?

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,865
But first, put some clothes on.

13
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,515
Sure, after I eat.

00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,280

00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:12,545
What is it?

17
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:15,460
Did you say, "Bon Appétit"?

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,700
You have to say it before you start.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,880
Even Komatsu-san at Hazumi's house waits before eating.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,310
Who the heck is this Komatsu-san?

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,450
It's a Chihuahua. A very smart puppy.

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,680
Oh, a Chihuahua...

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,215
By the way, how did you make rice? I don't have a rice cooker.

24
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,845
- You can cook it in a pot.
- I see.

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,950
For a rich young lady, you know quite a lot about cooking.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,950
I don't want to hear that from a guy who only eats cereals.

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,550
So yummy!

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,840
- I'm heading off to work.
- Okay.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,385
And here's the spare key to the house. You'll need it.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,310

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,220

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,130
- Here.
- What?

35
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,185
Your lunch. You can leave it if you don't need it.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,470
Not at all. Thank you.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,810

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,920
I asked Hazumi-kun for these.

50

But when I was 16, I was married off to Takamine.

100
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,580
Long before that, your grandmother and I agreed on it.

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,620
Of course, that was not my intention.

No, of course I like flowers, but...

118
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,225
Then take it. I'll quickly wash my hands.

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,660

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,280
Sorry to bother you.

121
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,685
- Let me arrange some tea for you.
- Please don't bother.

122
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:12,685

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,940

126
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,960

00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,820

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,570

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,550
I had someone look into you.

132
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,260
Any woman who tries to get close to Takamine, no matter who,

133
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,150
could be a threat to the company.

134
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,270
A threat?

135
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,010
Shitara Toshiro.

136
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,985
Your art teacher since you were 16.

137
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,850
- Yes.
- Let me ask you this frankly.

138
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,560
You like him and want to marry him, so you want to divorce Takamine, right?

139
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,355
- What?
- I understand.

140
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:15,250
Anyone would look for a new partner when left alone for ten years.

141
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,025
- Hold that thought.
- No wonder you fell in love with your good-looking mentor.

142
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,705
I don't have that kind of relationship with Sensei Shitara.

143
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:22,970
Really?

144
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm married. I would never do that.

145
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,190
In that case, does Shitara-san feel the same about you?

146
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,230
Yes, of course.

147
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,250
I'm sorry for asking weird questions.

148
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,037
Then do you still want a divorce?

149
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,637
Yes.

150
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,450
Could it be that you've fallen in love with Takamine?

151
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
No.

152
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,950
Then I'm always willing to help.

153
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,855
Oh? But is that really okay?

154
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:07,465
I heard that we should hold the divorce until the board meeting in December.

155
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:09,230
Did Takamine say that?

156
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,625
Yes. So I want to know if you can really help me.

157
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,160
Okay, he...

158
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Is it any different?

159
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,900
No. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,690
I'll leave now.

161
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,050
Amamiya-san.

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,390
I'm really thankful for Takamine's help.

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,270
It is true that his money saved my family.

164
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,030
But for the last ten years before I showed up,

165
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,940
I was non-existent to him.

166
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,250
So I figured I could get a quick divorce.

167
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,420
But...

168
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,030
things don't work out as we think, do they?

172
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,900
<i>Indeed, Sensei Shitara is a wonderful person.</i>

173
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,400
<i>But he's my teacher, nothing more.</i>

174
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,780
<i>Could it be that you've fallen in love with Takamine?</i>

175
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,470
<i>I don't know anything about love.</i>

176
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,580
<i>I thought it was something that didn't matter in my life.</i>

177
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,100
<i>No amount of pondering will change anything.</i>

178
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,260

179

Here's your lunch.

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Thanks!

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,790
And water.

182
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,690
I'll head out.

183
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,770
Bon Appétit.

184
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,500
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,410
- Ah! Hold it, please.
- What?

186
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh no! It's burnt! What do we do?

187
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,360
<i>[Chief Executive Officer | Masatomo Takamine]</i>

188
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,710
Shohei.

189
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,010
Can you check this?

190
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,470
Hey, what's wrong?

191
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,420
This is Rio-san's profile.

192
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,090
There are a few unexpected details. Do you have the courage to read it?

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,010
Yuki Rio.

194
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,580
Graduated from the prestigious Karasuma Girls' High School in Kyoto.

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,080
What? She skipped further education because she was a caregiver.

196
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,700
I was surprised, too.

197
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,865
I thought she graduated from college.

198
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:58,060
You sent them the money, didn't you? She could've hired tutors and gone to college.

199
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,520
Her father started new businesses and failed repeatedly.

200
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,525
It looks like he used most of the money to compensate for his losses.

201
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,985
I had no idea.

202
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:10,750
I must go to Rio right away and apologize.

203
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,350
Wait a minute.

204
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:20,660
Who is this?

205
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,310
Shitara Toshiro. He's a world-famous Japanese artist.

206
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,595
Japanese artist?

207
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:31,133
<i>Rio-san's been studying art with him since she was 16.</i>

208
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:35,585
<i>She's still trying to make her debut with his help.</i>

209
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,760
No way. That means...

210
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,900
What are you going to do if she likes this man?

211
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,650
Even so, it doesn't matter to you, right?

212
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,360
You're going to divorce her in December anyway.

213
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,150
Wait! Masa!

214
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,875
What's happened to you, man? You haven't been yourself lately.

215
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,550
Rio is special to me.

216
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,890
<i>Ever since I was a kid, no matter what I did, I didn't feel satisfied.</i>

217
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:11,480
<i>No matter how much success I achieved at work, or how much praise I received,</i>

218
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,880
<i>I was clueless about my life's purpose.</i>

219
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,240
<i>No matter what I do, it's never enough.</i>

220
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,340
<i>What's the point of living like this?</i>

221
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:23,818
But...

222
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,250
I enjoy my days with Rio.

223
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,090
<i>Today, tomorrow, I want to be with Rio forever.</i>

224
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,665
You were right, I...

225
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:44,970
Sorry, I got to go.

226
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,770
Hey!

227
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:54,680
You'll find something soon. I know it.

228
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,510
<i>What does that mean?</i>

229
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,250
She completely stole my thunder...

230
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,760
Rio!

231
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,340
Asleep like a child.

232
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,430
I wonder if she learned this from Shitara.

233
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:55,430
Takamine-san, you're back. Sorry, I fell asleep.

234
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,625
Rio, tell me one thing. Do you like that Shitara?

235
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,810
Did you hear anything from your vice president?

236
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,510
Shohei?

237
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,320
He paid me a visit the other day.

238
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,790
He shouldn't have done that.

239
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,580
I'm sorry. I looked into you without your permission.

240
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,070
I just wanted to know more about you, Rio.

241
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:21,100
There's nothing between Sensei Shitara and me.

242
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,305
I told your vice president exactly the same thing,

243
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:27,265
that I'd do no such thing because I'm a married woman.

244
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,620
Oh, I see!

245
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:31,810
Thank God!

246
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,016
What are you doing? Let me go!

247
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:36,721
- No, I won't.
- What?

248
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,590
I want you, Rio.

249
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,150
Oh? But you said you'll divorce me in December.

250
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,220
Forget about that.

251
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,570
I lied about my lawyers saying that.

252
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,860
I did it instantly because I didn't want to lose you.

253
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,280
You're awful!

254
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,480
But...

256
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:15,510
I really do want to be with you. You made me so.

257
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,040
What are you saying?

258
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,720
I want us to be together like this forever.

259
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,830
I'm serious about this.

260
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,530
<i>A marriage?</i>

261
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,100
<i>But why?</i>

262
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,830
Do you have any idea how I felt about this all along?

263
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,604
You stole ten years of my life that I will never get back.

264
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,660
Don't think you'll be easily forgiven!

265
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,200
I came here to get a divorce.

266
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,270
Why do you want a divorce?

267
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,770
My father and grandmother passed away.

268
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,180
When it happened, my mother told me I was free to live my life however I wanted.

269
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,750
That's why I want to divorce you, become independent,

270
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,860
and find my own happiness.

271
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,930
What is happiness to you, Rio?

272
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,730
I don't know it yet.

273
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,530
But I want to use my art for my livelihood. That's my dream.

274
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,280
Okay, I understand that.

275
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,880
But I won't divorce you.

276
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,470
I thought you didn't care about me.

277
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,870
That's why you never looked back at me for the last ten years!

278
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,140
I hate you.

279
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,730
Rio, I heard that after high school, you had to care for your grandma,

281
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,760
and you couldn't continue your education due to financial issues.

282
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,100
I had no idea about any of that.

283
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,610
I'm truly sorry that it happened to you.

284
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,730
After all this time...

285
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,448
Yes, I'm aware.

286
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,544
My apology won't return to you the time you lost,

287
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,980
but at least let me say sorry now.

288
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,150
I'm really very sorry.

289
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,590
Raise your head.

290
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,426
Your dream...

291
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,010
Can we work together to make it come true?

292
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,720
What do you mean?

293
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,030
When we started living together, I eventually fell in love with you, Rio.

294
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,902
I can sense all sorts of emotions inside me when I'm with you.

295
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
You do?

296
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,820
I learned how hard you are working on your paintings

297
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,880
so I want to support you in any way I can.

298
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,230
I'm not expecting anything like that from you.

299
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,925
I don't care even if you have zero expectations from me.

300
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:12,015
It's something I want to do.

301

Even if you hate me,

302
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,807
I'll keep telling you how much I love you every single day.

303
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:23,067
Then you might change your mind one day.
