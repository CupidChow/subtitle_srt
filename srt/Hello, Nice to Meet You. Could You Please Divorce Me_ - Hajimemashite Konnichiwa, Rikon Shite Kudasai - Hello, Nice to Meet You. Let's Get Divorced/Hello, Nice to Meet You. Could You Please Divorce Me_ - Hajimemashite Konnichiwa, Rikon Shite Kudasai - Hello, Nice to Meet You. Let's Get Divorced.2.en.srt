What's wrong?

177
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,040
Just because a girl says she hates me.

178
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,340
A girl?

179
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,760
You mean Rio-san?

180
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
She said she hates you?

181
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,260
Hey.

182
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,150
How do you feel now, Masa?

183
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,040
Like my heart is in pain...

184
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,750
Whoa!

185
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,900
I can picture her face when I close my eyes.

186
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,670
And even with my eyes wide open.

187
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,520
Don't tell me you're falling for this girl.

188
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,840
What? Falling for her?

189
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,705
I would never fall in love.

190
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:30,090
I guess, then I'll just forward the divorce papers.

191
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,560
We're even ready with the statement for media.

192
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,130
<i>Let's get right down to business. Could you divorce me?</i>

193
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,257
<i>Your eye color is so pretty.</i>

194
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:42,590
<i>But then he showed me another good one.</i>

195
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,085
If the other party is in a rush, we can expedite the process...

196
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:47,685
No, wait!

197
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,840
We should hold off on the divorce until the board meeting.

198
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,010
What? Why?

199
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,510
Who knows how the press will react?

200
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,586
Really? I think it should be fine.

201
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,866
- I'm going home.
- What?

202
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,660
It's decided. Better to live as husband and wife for the sake of it.

203
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,915
- You handle the rest, okay?
- What? Wait, Masa!

204
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,070
<i>I'm back right where I was.</i>

205
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,990
<i>I'm pathetic.</i>

206
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,240
<i>I can't do anything on my own.</i>

207
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,450
I wonder if he has come back home yet.

208
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,890
<i>[Takamine Masatomo]</i>

209
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,220
Hey, wait.

210
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:11,361
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

211
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,215
- What were you up to?
- Some errands.

212
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,580
Rio!

213
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,700
Takamine?

214
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,292
Wait! Please!

215
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,510
- Why don't we just live together?
- What?

216
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,740
You can stay with me until you figure things out for yourself.

217
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,980
Why all of a sudden?

218
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,065
Legally, we're still married, right? You don't have to hesitate.

219
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:41,725
But...

220
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,160
Right. You hate me and never want to see me.

221
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,060
I'm sorry for saying that.

222
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,830
I lashed out at you because my apartment search failed.

223
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,300
My behavior is childish.

224
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,170
Don't worry. I'm rarely at home because of my work.

225
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,830
Is that so?

226
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,836
What do you want to do?

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,990
I don't know...

228
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,030
But living together is...

229
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,840
I want the divorce as soon as possible.

230
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:37,464
The fact is,

231
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:41,615
we have a big meeting coming up and lawyers said we should wait till December.

232
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,170
What?

233
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,480
If this matter becomes a scandal, our company stocks will hit a big decline.

234
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,330
I want you to cooperate with me because you're still my legal wife.

235
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,310
Well...

236
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,060
But it's difficult.

237
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm sorry, but can't you wait? In return, I'll provide you with everything.

238
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,970
I don't need your help to...

239
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,600
How about we go inside for now?

240
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,560
You are getting sick again.

241
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,410
<i>What's with this guy? So pushy!</i>

242
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:23,520
<i>But he does have this stray puppy eyes sometimes.</i>

243
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,490
Hurry.

244
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,845
I can't stay here and do nothing for you.

245
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:48,460
No, no, wait a second!

246
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,225
Sit for a while. Have some coffee. Let's sit.

247
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,510
Okay.

248
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,950
Let's decide on terms of exchange.

249
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,060
Terms of exchange?

250
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,220
Can you cook?

251
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,810
Some basic things.

252
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,100
Anything is okay. As long as it's better than cereal.

253
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,000
Cereal?

254
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,810
I usually eat cereal or protein.

255
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,470
Whoa! Hold on.

256
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,270
I don't think a protein supplement is a meal.

257
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,880
My vice president says the same thing.

258
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,970
I should worry about my health more since I'm the president.

259
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,070
He keeps annoying me like that.

260
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,980
But it's too much work.

261
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,345
But what if you faint or something?

262
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,755
Your employees will be out on the street.

263
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,070
That's an exaggeration, but yeah, something like that.

264
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,970
So in exchange for staying here, I want you to cook breakfast and dinner for me.

265
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,610
Is that an exchange term?

266
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,180
Yes.

267
00:20:57,115 --> 00:21:03,450
<i>Helping Takamine stay healthy is ultimately an act of kindness.</i>

268
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:09,590
<i>Right. An act of kindness. Just helping someone out.</i>

269
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:16,522
Okay. I accept.

270
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,400
You do?

271
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,310
I look forward to living with you, Rio.

272
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,910
Don't treat me like a child.

273
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,525
I'm not treating you like a child.

274
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:30,405
Then what were you just doing?

275
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,980
Doesn't matter. I'm going to my room now.

276
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,250
The guest bedroom over there is yours, Rio.

277
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,140
It has only one power outlet. Please bear with it.

278
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,175
I must get back to work. Make yourself comfortable.

279
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,940
One power outlet is more than enough, isn't it?

280
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,140
