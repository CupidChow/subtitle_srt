<i>What should I do now?</i>

179
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,160
Shall we we go back to Kyoto?

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
I'll arrange a car. Please wait here.

181
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,380
Okay.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,160

184
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,864

185

No way!

188
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,870
<i>Rio!</i>

189
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,650
I don't want to see you right now.

190
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,900
My lady, you must get away from here.

191
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,270
Let me take care of this.

192
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,970
Rio!

193
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,710
So you're Hazumi.

194
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm her servant and childhood friend.

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm glad that I was prepared for this to happen.

196
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,980
You cannot get past me!

197
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,580
Be ready!

198
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,520
- This has nothing to do with you!
- Sure, it does.

199
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,835
I've been protecting Rio since we were kids.

200
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:22,355
I will never forgive anyone who hurts her.

201
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,270
- Sir, please don't create a scene here.
- Let me go!

202
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,695
- Let's call the police!
- Let me go! Police?

203
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:33,980
- Please calm down!
- Hey, Takamine, wait!

204
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,580
Rio!

205
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,870
I'm sorry, I was being insensitive.

206
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,530
The person in the article wasn't me.

207
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,030
They mistook me for someone else.

208
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,820
It's fake news.

209
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,450
Fake news?

210
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,910
I should've come to you with this.

211
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,540
Rio, how can I make you believe me?

212
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,240
Stay away!

213
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,370
It was a mistake to turn to you in the first place.

214
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,470
I would rather be alone...

215
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:21,175
than be pushed around by you like this and lose myself.

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,790
Rio...

217
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,270
I've had enough.

218
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm sick of being with you and getting hurt every time.

219
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,510
Shohei scolded me as well.

220
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,230
He said that you're innocent and all of this will hurt you.

221
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,780
You're wrong.

222
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,665
Not because I'm innocent,

223
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:47,990
but I'm hurt because I...

224
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,690
My lady!

225
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,260
Get away from her!

226
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,040
She's my wife.

227
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,220
Then where were you for the last ten years?

228
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,290
My lady,

229
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,930
come over here.

230
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,255
For all my life,

231
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,410
I kept my feelings hidden from you.

232
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,328
But the truth is...

233
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,360
I love you, Rio!

234
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,620
Rio, I'm sorry I spooked you.

235
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
But rather than leaving you with this jerk,

236
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,900
I will make you happy!

237
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Rio!

238
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,470
I...

239
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,050
I love you, and I don't want to lose you.

240
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,750
But...

241
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,540
If you love him...

242
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,350
and if that's what makes you happy,

243
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,156
I won't get in your way.

244
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,490
Rio!

245
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,720
I would never do anything to hurt you, my lady.

246
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,420
I will continue to stand by your side and support you.

247
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,890
<i>Shall we?</i>

248
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,910
Hazumi...

249
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:35,290
Ever since we were kids, you cared for me more than anyone else.

250
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,210
With you, I'm sure my life will be quite comfortable.

251
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:50,450
And with Takamine-san, I was crying and furious all the time,

252
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,750
I was out of control with my emotions...

253
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,720
My lady.

254
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,640
But yet,

255
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,650
despite all of it, I want to be with Takamine-san.

256
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,995
No matter how hard it can be,

257
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,280
I want to be with him.

You finally got yourself to call me by my first name!

- Say it again.
- Nope.

- Come on, one more time.
- Never.

282
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,245
You said it once already.

I'm going back to Kyoto.

284
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,855
About what you said earlier...

285
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:20,620
Oh. That was a lie.

286
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,277
What? You lied?

287
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:26,710
I was just testing Takamine's true intentions.

288
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,210
I'm sorry for troubling you like that.

289
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,710
I hope you will be happy this time, my lady.

290
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,620
Thank you.

291
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,050
Can I have a moment, Takamine-san?

292
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,643
I'll accept you

293
00:21:55,643 --> 00:22:02,180
only after you explain what happened to her and her mother in Kyoto ten years ago.

294
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm going to that anyway.

295
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,430
Fine then.

296
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,390
As Rio's childhood friend, I want you to know one more thing.

297
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,640
We used to take baths together until kindergarten.

298
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,310
And we slept in the same bed until we were ten.

299
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,410
What?

300
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,725
Bye. Have a nice day.

<i>Damn it! I'll take a bath with Rio someday too!</i>

302
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,720
How did you know I was here?

303
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,430
You told me that before.

304
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,880
<i>Tell me where you would like to go.</i>

305
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,955
<i>I'd like to go to Kiyosumi garden and draw a sketch.</i>

306
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:50,450
You remembered?

307
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,800
Of course, I did.

308
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,237
But you came without me.

309
00:22:56,237 --> 00:23:00,040
That's because of your love affair in the media.

310
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,540
So you were jealous?

311
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,570
I'm not telling you.

312
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,740
<i>I wonder what will happen if she finds out about ten years ago.</i>

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,170
Nothing.

315
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,130
