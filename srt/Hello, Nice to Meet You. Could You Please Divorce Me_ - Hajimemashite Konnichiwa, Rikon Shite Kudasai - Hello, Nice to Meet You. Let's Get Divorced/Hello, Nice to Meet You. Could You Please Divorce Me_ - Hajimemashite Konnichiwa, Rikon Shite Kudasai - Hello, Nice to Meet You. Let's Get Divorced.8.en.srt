I stopped your tears by teaching you the art...

106

but that's all I could do for you.

107
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,390
It could not elicit any more of your emotions than that.

108
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,670
You were able to open up only after you met Takamine-san.

109
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,610
Do you really want to let go of such a special loved one?

110
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,550
All this time, I only thought of divorcing him.

111
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:38,333
But when I met him, I could finally cry, get angry, and laugh as well.

112
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,060
I felt all sorts of emotions I'd never felt before.

113
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,830
I wanted to cherish these new emotions,

115
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,850
But then he pushed me away,

116
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,810
and everything around me went pitch black.

117
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,160

139

140
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,800

141
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,130

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,760

<i>He always supported my dream, and continued to love me deeply.</i>

151
00:13:55,464 --> 00:14:02,030
<i>I felt blessed, and I opened my heart up to him.</i>

152
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,600
<i>Once shut close, my heart let him in before I knew it.</i>

153
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,822

However, with the recent news reports, I ended up hurting her again.

177
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,365
I accept all the blame.

178
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:22,910
Now that I have explained myself honestly and clearly,

179
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,920
<i>I want everyone to know that she's not a pushover.</i>

180
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,350
I just wanted to protect her.

181
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,498
I have only one wish at this point...

182
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:41,590
<i>I want Rio to be free and live her life as she pleases.</i>

Masatomo-san!

186
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,081
I distributed a video about my relationship with you earlier.

188
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,730
Why?

189
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,731
The more I cared about you,

190
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:29,211
the more I couldn't stand the judgments about you because of my fault.

191
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,640
I thought this was the least I could do.

192
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,960
For the last ten years, I only gave you pain and sorrows,

193
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,370
and I did it again today.

194
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,890
I apologize for everything.

195
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,200
If you can forgive me...

196
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,840
I want you to be happy, Rio.

197
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,450
That's the only thing I wish.

198
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,950
Is that how you are feeling right now?

199
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:23,510
Certainly, your actions in the past hurt me.

200
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:29,770
I always wondered why I love such a man who has hurt me so deeply.

201
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,500
But then I looked at myself and finally figured it out.

202
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:44,080
Masatomo-san, when I'm with you, I can be the best version of myself.

203
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,420
That day, I gathered all my courage and came here to see you.

204
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,300
And I'm so glad I did that!

205
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,000
I can't imagine a life without you!

206
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,120
If I want to live feeling like myself,

207
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,900
I need you in my life, Masatomo-san.
