- I see.

177
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:13,530
<i>So did you have many girlfriends who taught you different languages?</i>

178
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,150
Hey, wait.

179
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,370
Maybe Kurose-san can teach me English.

180
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,640
<i>What? Why Kurose?</i>

181
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,545
He has worked overseas, and he's fluent.

182
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:25,575
Maybe I can invite him for dinner.

183
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,710
Fine. Do whatever you like.

184
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,110
What?

185
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,200
I've been busy too. I may not make it to your exhibition.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,190
What? Wait! Masatomo-san!

187
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,575
You're fine because Kurose is there for you, right?

188
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,510
Bye!

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,540
What was that?

190
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,550
I can't believe this!

191
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,250
<i>Why does this always happen?</i>

192
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,530
Hello there.

193
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,850
Take this if you like.

194
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,200
Thank you.

195
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,140
As expected. They are just stunning!

196
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,785
But still...

197
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,880
- What is it?
- Nothing.

198
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,630
When I first witnessed your art, it had an intriguing charm to it, Sensei.

199
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,200
I could sense strong will in the silence.

200
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Like you were fighting alone.

201
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,700
I see.

202
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,424
But this one is splendid too.

203
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:39,590
This gives more of a free and comfortable vibe.

204
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,590
Like you're not afraid to express yourself.

205
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,555
Did you draw these with someone in mind?

206
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,000
Your husband, perhaps.

207
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:04,025
I see. That's a long history between you two.

208
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:07,460
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

209
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,010
No.

210
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:15,060
Now I understand why he's so worried about you.

211
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,460
He sounds like a perfect husband.

212
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,480
He is.

213
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:31,955
Well, I'll take my leave now. I look forward to other paintings.

214
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:34,705
Yes, I'll try my best.

- Thank you so much.
- Yes! It's...

219
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,090
I'd like many people to come to this exhibition.

220
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,120
Please take your time and look around.

221
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,050
It's a big success, isn't it?

222
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,615
Kurose-san, it's all because of you. Thank you.

223
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:28,120
It's your hard work.

224
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,040
A foreigner just told me that

225
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,385
he grew interested in Japanese art because of your paintings.

226
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:35,700
Really? That makes me happy.

227
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,975
Art transcends gender, age, and national borders,

228
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,435
I fully realized that again.

229
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,220
Rio.

230
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,690
Sensei.

231
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:54,940
Congratulations. Now you're a full-fledged artist.

232
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,320
It's all thanks to you, Sensei Shitara.

233
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,730
I'm grateful to you for teaching me Japanese art back then.

234
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,700
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

235
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,040
Thank you so much.

236
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,760
By the way, is Takamine-san coming?

237
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,910
Apparently, he's busy with his work.

238
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,530
It can't be helped.

239
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,890
And are you okay with that?

240
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,510
Thank you so much.

241
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,720
- <i>I work for Soyu Solution Company.
- I see.</i>

242
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,190
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

243
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,880
- Thank you.
- Thank  you.

244
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,960
You did great on your first day.

245
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,410
You too, Kurose-san.

246
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,525
So shall we wrap it up for the day?

247
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,645
Yes, please.

248
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>I wish Masamoto-san could be here.</i>

249
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,090
No way.

250
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,930
Masamoto-san!

251
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,192
What are you doing here?

252
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:34,552
It's my wife's big day. Of course, I need to be here.

253
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,130
Rio, congratulations on your exhibition.

254
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Thank you.

255
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:49,400
- Are you still angry?
- What?

256
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:55,375
Oh no. I didn't call because I didn't want to bother you.

257
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,070
Wasn't it you who were angry at me?

258
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,885
No, I wasn't.

259
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,385
Look at you.

260
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,917
You get angry easily.

261
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,810
That's because you keep saying mean things to me.

262
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,640
And I'm sorry for being jealous all the time.

263
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,840
Love doesn't involve my own feelings alone.

264
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,740
I wasn't thinking about your feelings.

265
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:27,280
You are free to do whatever you wish to.

266
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,130
Meet up with anyone you want.

267
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,305
Because you're a free woman, Rio.

268
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,760
It's fine.

269
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,420
The only person I love is you, Masatomo-san.

270
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:46,170
I never imagined you saying it wearing this kimono.

271
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,765
<i>We've finally met.</i>

272
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:51,567
<i>Let's get right down to business. Could you divorce me?</i>

273
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,050
Doesn't it bring back memories?

274
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,400
This kimono is for special occasions only.

275
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,505
I was kind of sweating it when I saw you the first time.

276
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,050
It really suits you well.

277
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,020
Sensei Yuki, can I take a look at your exhibition?

278
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,565
Let me show you around.

279
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,069
I wanted you to see it more than anyone else.

280
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,230
Let's start here.

281
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,680
It's been a long time since I've been home.

282
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,940
Masatomo-san, I have something for you.

283
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,490
Ta-da!

Luckily, it fits perfectly!

288
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Thank you! This is the best ring in the world.

289
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,134
May I put this on you?

290
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,690
The rings look good on us.
