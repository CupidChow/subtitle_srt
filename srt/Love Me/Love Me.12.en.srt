(Love me)

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
By the way,

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,350
how come your boyfriend didn't make it today?

12
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,890
Sorry?

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,360
I was hoping to finally meet him.

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,760
What did you say he does for a living?

15
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,130
She said he'll be a professor soon.

16
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,599
No, he's a lecturer, not a professor.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I see.

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,310
He'll get there eventually. Goodness.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,940
A star writer and a professor. What a power couple.

20
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,810
See? Now I'm even more curious.

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,680
You should've told him to come.

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,780
I guess he's a little busy.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,450
What? Come on. His girlfriend won a major award,

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,960
and he's "too busy"?

25
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,130
Come on, let's go.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,430
All right, thanks.

27
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,000
You guys go on ahead. I'll be right in.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,270
Why? Are you going to call your boyfriend?

29
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,470
Tell him to come, even if it's late. I really want to meet him.

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,010
Hey.

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,910
Hey!

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,890
Is this why you didn't show up?

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,120
- You can see for yourself.
- Why are you working as a driver?

34
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,660
I need the money. Am I doing this for fun?

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,830
That's what I'm asking! What could you need the money for?

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,299
- I'm busy. I got a ride request.
- Seo Jun Seo.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,530
For a nobody to become a lecturer,

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,970
they said I have to pay 5,000 dollars.

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,000
They said it's the only way. What else can I do?

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,640
You can't be serious.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,080
You'd really pay a bribe for that job?

42
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,850
You'll be a famous author. Can't I have ambitions too?

43
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,880
I have to at least become a lecturer to be a boyfriend you're proud of.

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,720
- Then you should have told me.
- And how was I supposed to do that?

45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,190
You would've been ashamed.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,190
You can only brag about a professor boyfriend.

47
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,230
Because you're embarrassed I'm a driver,

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,100
you lied to them too, didn't you?

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,600
While I'm losing sleep...

50
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,769
driving drunk jerks around,

51
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,710
while you're having interviews and going to award shows.

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,780
And what? Designer clothes?

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,180
You think I'll be grateful for thousand-dollar clothes?

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,350
Why did you even ask me to come today?

55
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,620
Did you need a pathetic accessory to wear that outfit and applaud you?

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,520
- You jerk.
- You want me to be more honest?

57
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,630
I have absolutely no desire to congratulate you on your award.

58
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,400
When you got congratulatory calls, I felt like trash.

59
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,400
I felt like a freeloading parasite, and it made me sick to my stomach!

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
So?

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,550
So, what?

62
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,320
You're trying to get me to break up, aren't you?

63
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,690
You say it. Say you want to break up.

64
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,660
Well?

65
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,530
You can't even say the words?

66
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Darn.

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,910
You pathetic fool.

68
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,360
Get up. Let's go.

69
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,210
You know something?

70
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,380
Jun Kyung lies all the time.

71
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,520
Deep down, she's really weak,

72
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,220
but she pretends to be strong, pretends she's okay.

73
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,620
She pretends to have it all together,

74
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,320
always acting like nothing bothers her.

75
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,330
And she's a terrible liar too.

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,100
Before,

77
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,940
whenever something was wrong with Jun Kyung,

78
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,680
she'd tell me every little detail.

79
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,620
But since she met you, having her do that...

80
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,520
gotten really rare.

81
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,920
I'll admit I'm a little bummed about it.

82
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,530
I kind of hold it against you, actually.

83
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
But...

84
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,500
I guess that's to be expected.

85
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,370
That's why...

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,240
when I got her call today,

87
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,610
I was like, "Yes!"

88
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,680
I was so excited.

89
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,110
But she won't tell me what's wrong.

90
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,990
So I didn't push it.

91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,890
But...

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,590
The Jun Kyung I used to know wasn't like this.

93
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,160
She'd get angry when she was angry,

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,330
and she'd cry when she needed to.

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,400
Do you...

96
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,640
know what I mean?

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
I do.

98
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,680
Don't make me laugh.

99
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,650
You have no idea.

100
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
She just kept saying it was all her fault.

101
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,390
Okay, fine.

102
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,830
I'm sure Jun Kyung did something wrong.

103
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,160
But even so,

104
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,870
I'm always on her side, no matter what.

105
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm completely biased.

106
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,570
Thank you.

107
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,250
From now on,

108
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,220
please always be on her side.

109
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,310
I'm holding you to that.

110
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,780
- Where's Jun Kyung?
- She passed out.

111
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,720
My gosh.

112
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,520
Thanks for bringing Soo Jin home, Do Hyun.

113
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,720
And for Jun Kyung too.

114
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,590
Get home safe.

115
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,530
Let's go.

116
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,310
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,910
Hey. What are you doing? Eat up.

118
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,780

My wife has Alzheimer's disease.

125
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,910
Her phone's off. The battery must be dead.

126
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,050
I've searched everywhere around our campsite.

127
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,820
We don't have any neighbours, so there's nowhere for her to go.

128
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,960
We're reviewing the security video. Just give us a moment.

129
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,060
- Okay.
- This is the only road out of camp.

130
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,200
She could've gone toward the mountain.

131
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,900
- Has this ever happened before?
- No, this is the first time.

132
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,910
- Is this you right here, sir?
- Yes, that's me.

133
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,610
Could this be her?

134
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,409
It looks like she's looking at you, sir.

135
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,950

141

You didn't mention that.

142
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,530
Yes, it was a last-minute thing.

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,530
It's one I can't get out of.

144
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,600
So I'm probably going to be pretty late.

145
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,300

Listen, Ja Yeong, they're calling for me.

156
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,270
I'll take a cab home, so don't wait up for me.

157

I'm sorry.

Are you okay?

171
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,310
I'm the one who was wrong. Why are you asking if I'm okay?

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,480
As you may already know,

184
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,120
a nursing home is different from a convalescent hospital.

185
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,420
We focus on providing daily care, not medical treatment.

186
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,560
We make sure our residents can eat their meals comfortably...

187
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,930
and live in a safe environment.

188
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,130
We provide care for all aspects of their daily lives.

189
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,900
It's the easiest way to understand what we do.

190
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,400
We have art classes, singing lessons,

191
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,810
as well as exercise and a variety of other programs.

192
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,910
Our staff members and professional caregivers...

193
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,750
treat them like their own family, so you don't need to worry.

194
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,990
So, will it be your father or your mother joining us?

195
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
It's me.

196
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,010
- Daniel.
- I'm not your son?

197
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,850
Am I really...

198
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,590
not your son?

199
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,490
Why did you lie to me?

200
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,330
Daniel, look at me.

201
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,430
I wasn't trying to lie to you...

202
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,710
I can't trust anyone anymore.

203
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,740
Mom...

204
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,510
is taking me...

205
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,180
back to Germany.

206
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,420
It's all over now.

207
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,330
Nothing matters anymore.

208
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,540
You knew too, didn't you?

209
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,610
That day...

210
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,850
when I came to see you...

211
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,820
You knew even then, didn't you?

212
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,500
You know how much I like you.

213
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,500
So why? Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
I didn't have the courage.

215
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,140
I was afraid you'd get hurt. I'm so sorry, Daniel.

216
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,380
Because you accepted me...

217
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,090
and let me live with you,

218
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,890
I was so...

219
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I was...

220
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,830
I was just so happy.

221
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,240
I know. I was happy too, son.

222
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,010
I really was so happy.

223
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,950
None of that matters to me.

224
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,550
I'm...

225
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,090
still your dad,

226
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,760
and you're my son.

227
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
Got it?

228
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,880
Yes, this is Officer Park Dong Su from the Palbon Substation.

229
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Yes.

230
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,960
Yes, you said you've located him?

231
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Yes.

232
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,770
Yes, I see.

233
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,180
This stop is the Ian City Promotion Hall.

234
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,650
Next stop, Power Square Mall.

235
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,720
("A Still Relationship")

236
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,170
(The hit new novel, "A Still Relationship" by Ji Hye On)

237
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:11,010
("A Still Relationship")

238
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,250
(Ji Hye On)

239
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,500
(Professor Song Won Cheol)

240
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,170
Tonight,

241
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,780
with the guy who's always been there for me,

242
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,210
instead of some fancy steak and whiskey,

243
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,790
I want to celebrate with a beer and a pork cutlet from our local joint.

244
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,390
And tomorrow night...

245
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
and the night after that...

246
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,760
(On the 29th night of summer, Ji Hye On)

247
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,800
I want to tell him I just want us to stay like this forever.

248
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:12,070
("A Still Relationship")

249
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,790
Aren't you going to answer that?

250
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,190
Your mom must be worried.

251
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,100
I don't want to.

252
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,240
Let's eat first.

253
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,350
You must be starving. You haven't eaten anything.

254
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,420
Eat up, and then I'll take you home.

255
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,900
(Police)

256
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,370
Are you Daniel?

257
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,810
- Yes.
- Your mother reported you missing.

258
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,880
She said you weren't taking calls and thought you were here.

259
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,320
Come out, Daniel.

260
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,790
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,060
What's it to you? What are you, Daniel's dad?

262
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,860
What do you think you're doing?

263
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,670
Please bring my son out here.

264
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,670
Is this woman your mother?

265
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,510
And is he your father?

266
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,960
For now, I think it's best if you go with your mom.

267
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
- Daniel.
- Sir.

268
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,350
This is the last time.

269
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,080
You will never see Daniel again.

270
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Daniel.

271
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,910
Don't cry. You're not a little kid anymore.

272
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,250
What are you doing?

273
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,390
No matter what anyone else says,

274
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,460
what you want is most important. You know that, right?

275
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,290
Do what your heart tells you. Whatever that is.

276
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Get in.

277
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,810
You said you'd do anything for him. Is this what's best for him?

278
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,010
I don't think that's any of your business.

279
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,260
Oh, her?

280
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,130
She had a consultation and left a little while ago.

281
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,530
There's something magical about sunset.

282
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
(For rent)

283
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,470
New buildings and old ones,

284
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,380
people laughing and people fighting...

285
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,710
At this hour, everything just looks equally beautiful, you know?

286
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,090
I used to...

287
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,490
feel so at peace watching the sunset.

288
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,360
I'd think, "Another day well-lived."

289
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,730
But these days,

290
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,940
it just makes me sad.

291
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,340
It's like, "There goes another day."

292
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,450
I used to feel that way too.

293
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,940
Are you really not going back to him?

294
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,050
Why?

295
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,410
Because you think without him,

296
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,320
I won't be okay?

297
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,290
No.

298
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,920
Without you,

299
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,060
I don't think he'll be okay.

300
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,800
You know what a mess he is.

301
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,270
Sometimes...

302
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,010
I even miss his awful jokes.

303
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,280
You're right.

304
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,880
They're really not funny.

305
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
He...

306
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,130
is probably still waiting for you.

307
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,280
Look at the state of you.

308
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,750
I thought you said I looked fine.

309
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,050
You really are a mess without me.

310
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,820
I know.

311
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,760
Without you,

312
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,330
I'm a mess.

313
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
So...

314
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,510
So, please...

315
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,410
don't leave me.

316
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,470
You win everything you touch. Good heavens.

317
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,470
What's with the surprise visit? You didn't even call.

318
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,740
I want my money back.

319
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,450
What?

320
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,680
I'm turning down the lecturer job.

321
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,350
Hey, what's gotten into you?

322
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,090
I'm not interested in buying a teaching position.

323
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,760
And besides, I never wanted to be a lecturer.

324
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,890
Give me my money back.

325
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,500
Hey, what do you think you're... No, I...

326
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,370
Nationality, gender, age, social status, language...

327
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,770
Two people who seemed to have nothing in common.

328
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,680
For Emma and Ryan, in the unfamiliar land of Korea,

329
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,280
the only way they could communicate...

330
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,480
was through their broken Korean.

331
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,990
But the two do share one other thing.

332
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Loneliness.

333
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,830
Which brings me to a question.

334
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,200
Do you have a favourite line from the book?

335
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,910
- Sorry?
- I'm sure you love all you wrote,

336
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,880
but our Night Walk family is curious to know your absolute favourite.

337
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,460
Noticing the shadow on Emma's face, Ryan asked,

338
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,930
"What's wrong?"

339
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,100
"The milk bottles in front of my neighbour's door..."

340
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,170
"kept piling up, so I rang his bell."

341
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,440
"But no one answered."

342
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,510
"It was a lonely death."

343
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,950
"A lonely death?"

344
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,450
"Yes."

345
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,990
"He died from loneliness."

346
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,190
"Then, after a long silence, Emma spoke."

347
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,430
"Isn't that terrifying?"

348
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,770
"The thought that loneliness..."

349
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,040
"can actually be a cause of death."

350
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,940
"Ryan held Emma in his arms."

351
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,650
"And he told her,"

352
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,250
- "It's why some people..." - "It's why some people..."

353
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,860
"need someone else."

354
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,970
"The way I need you."

355
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
So you finally read it?

356
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,380
It was really well written.

357
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,550
You deserved the award.

358
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,730
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

359
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Congratulations.

360
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,570
And I guess you're not going to apologise?

361
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,240
I'm sorry. I really am.

362
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,420
Not your hand.

363
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,520
Give me my book.

364
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,260
- What?
- I said, give it back.

365
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Right.

366
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,780
I didn't sign one for anyone else. I saved the first for you.

367
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,680
("A Still Relationship")

368
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,420
My very first autograph.

369
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,420
(To my Squirtle, Seo Jun Seo, From Ji Hye On)

370
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,190
I got a lot of criticisms for it.

371
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,420
They said a rookie was putting on airs.

372
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Why?

373
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,670
You know...

374
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,610
You really look like Emma Stone.

375
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,620
Says Ryan Gosling.

376
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,470
I'm hungry.

377
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,500
Let's go get some pork cutlets.

378
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Should we?

379
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,410
It's on me. I'm loaded.

380
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,610
Since when do you have money?

381
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,410
I got the 5,000 dollars back.

382
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm not taking the job.

383
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,450
Really?

384
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Then what are you going to do?

385
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,220
I'll have to figure it out. Starting now.

386
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,490
Good for you.

387
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,290
Being an instructor didn't suit you anyway.

388
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,560
But I can still afford to buy you beer and pork cutlets anytime.

392
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,810
Please take good care of Oscar.

393
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,750
I will.

394
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,280
Take care of yourself.

395
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,720
I'll call you sometimes.

396
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,700
Mom.

397
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,300
Can I go talk to him for a minute?

398
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,810
Don't be too long.

399
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,910
Okay.

400
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,710
Is your hand all right now?

401
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,850
A scar from my defeat, I suppose.

402
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,890
Congratulations. You won.

403
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,460
You must think this is some kind of game.

404
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,029
Strangely, it doesn't feel awkward being alone with you like this.

405
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,400
Why did it have to be Do Hyun?

406
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,940
You came all this way just to ask me that?

(Maternal Health Handbook)

408
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,720
And I had something to return to you.

409
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,460
It's a common story.

410
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,670
A one-night mistake.

411
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,770
After Do Hyun and I broke up, I was struggling and so lonely.

412
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,040
And I was only 20 back then.

413
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,880
I ended up pregnant and was terrified,

414
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,390
but sweet Do Hyun fell for my lie and was overjoyed.

415
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,220
That's why I decided to have Daniel.

416
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,630
I guess that must be why...

417
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,230
I tricked myself into thinking Do Hyun could fill this emptiness.

418
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,370
But you know, Yoon Ju...

419
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,740
loneliness doesn't give you a free pass.

420
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,580
All this time,

421
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,590
it's been great.

422
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,390
Thanks to you.

423
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,570
I didn't know you could talk like that.

424
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
So now,

425
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,680
are you not going to call me Dad anymore?

426
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,200
I should get going now.

427
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,810
Be happy with Jun Kyung.

428
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,790
Okay.

429
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,190
I think I'm going to miss you a lot.

430
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Dad.

431
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,510
I wish I could've treated you to somewhere nicer.

432
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,020
What could possibly be better than this?

433
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,920
I'm so glad you seem to be okay.

434
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,820
I was really worried about you.

435
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,230
When most people find out about a thing like that,

436
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,400
they're too embarrassed to reach out.

437
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,270
I'm sorry. Did I overstep?

438
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,210
No.

439
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,410
I'm trying to thank you.

440
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,510
For checking in on me and worrying.

441
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,690
But...

442
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,190
I have a concern of my own. May I ask you something?

443
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,229
- Sure.
- Aren't you seeing anyone?

444
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,230
Like a boyfriend?

445
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,430
Spending a perfect day off like this with me, of all people.

446
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,140
There was...

447
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,870
someone I liked.

448
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,780
"Was"? So you two broke up?

449
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,250
No.

450
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,780
He doesn't even know that I liked him.

451
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,820
It was just a one-sided crush,

452
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,420
and in the meantime, he got a girlfriend.

453
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,790
What? If you started to like him,

454
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,960
you should have told him.

455
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,900
It's easy to like someone from afar,

456
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,270
but I guess dating and getting to know someone scared me.

457
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,310
I'm not very courageous, you know.

458
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,420
That's true.

459
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:10,290
There's misunderstanding, jealousy, fighting, and making up.

460
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,130
All those emotions you can afford to be lazy with when you're alone...

461
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,730
suddenly have to work overtime.

462
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,170
Gosh...

463
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,340
You may not have found the courage to say anything yet,

464
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,770
but I bet someone out there has a crush on you.

465
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,810
Come on.

466
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,580
Should we try being brave together?

467
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,290
But is this really considered being brave?

468
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,730
Isn't trying something new an act of courage?

469
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,970
- Have you ever had a wavy perm?
- No, this is my first time.

470
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,640
I think it'll look great on you.

471
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,810
- Then let's get started.
- Okay.

472
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,610
Gosh.

473
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,710
What? Does it look weird?

474
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,210
It's because you're so beautiful.

475
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,180
You keep taking my breath away.

476
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,900
This looks about right, doesn't it?

477
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,570
Yes, Hye On, you're a natural.

478
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,110
- The best learn from the best.
- And you've got the banter down.

479
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,040
- I'm just going to grab a rag.
- Yes, go ahead.

480
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,710
Gosh, you can tell you've done this before.

481
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,980
How's the job hunt going?

482
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,610
Yes, it's going fine.

483
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,320
I'm sure it is.

484
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,650
Undergrad astronomy, your master's in "interdisciplinary studies,"

485
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,820
and now you're applying to the National Weather Service?

486
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,290
You want to forecast the weather when you can't fix your own life?

487
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm trying to get my life together, you know?

488
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,230
For the record, it's been a while since I asked you for money.

489
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,360
So stop nagging me.

490
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,470
You still haven't fully paid me back, you know.

491
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,370
Do we have to do this at home? We could just go out instead.

492
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,610
Why are you suddenly doing something so out of character?

493
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,240
If we go out, are you paying? If we stay home, are you cooking?

494
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,150
- Kids! The kimchi is here!
- You're here, Uncle!

495
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,350
Hey, take this. I have to use the restroom.

496
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,250
Gosh, this guy. He was like this the whole way here.

497
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,760
- Auntie, I'll put this away.
- Okay. Something smells delicious!

498
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,960
- You're here.
- Hello.

499
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,030
- Hi.
- Hello.

500
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,960
- We're here!
- Come on in.

501
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,030
Hello, everyone.

502
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,130
- Dad, you're here?
- Yes.

503
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,830
- You're here, Dad.
- You made it, Ja Yeong.

504
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,000
- Welcome.
- Oh, my, Jun Kyung, your hair...

505
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,040
Why? Does it look weird?

506
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,510
- You look beautiful! It's great!
- Really?

507
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,740
- You made it.
- Yes, I'm here.

508
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,050
- Hello, Ja Yeong.
- Hello, Uncle.

509
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,750
Jun Kyung, what's with your hair? I liked it much better before.

510
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,820
- This guy.
- But she just said it was pretty...

511
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,520
Sorry.

512
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,620
Since when have we had a dining table this big?

513
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,060
I just bought it. I figured it'd be useful someday.

514
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,400
- Good call.
- Dad, the picture frame too.

515
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,060
Goodness.

516
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:41,770
Gosh.

517
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,700
What do you think?

518
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,840
Gosh.

519
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,010
Goodness.

520
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,640
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

521
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,710
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

522
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,210
- Happy birthday, dear Ja Yeong - Happy birthday, dear Ja Yeong

523
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,649
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

524
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,780
Hold on.

525
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,650
I have something to say before I blow out the candles.

526
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,360
Judging by your smile, it must be something good.

527
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,160
Did you win the lottery?

528
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,130
- Sadly, no.
- Dad, are you two getting married?

529
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,630
- Oh, my.
- Married? Don't be ridiculous.

530
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,900
Well, I...

531
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,810
I have Alzheimer's.

532
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,030
It's progressing quickly,

533
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,460
and the prognosis isn't good.

534
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,170
So I've been getting treatment and learning how to manage it,

535
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,810
and Jin Ho, in case I get lost,

536
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,710
has put up signs all over the camp ground for me.

537
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,650
I have to learn to live with my disease now.

538
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,950
I don't know when, but eventually,

539
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,960
I'll stop recognising all of you too.

540
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,240
If I don't recognise you and hurt you,

541
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,010
please don't hate me for it.

542
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,080
I wanted to apologise in advance and ask you for this favour.

543
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,730
Thank you, Jun Kyung,

544
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,870
for throwing me such a lovely birthday party.

545
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,210
Don't worry, Auntie. I think you'll be the last I forget.

546
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,950
That charisma you had when we first met...

547
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,950
How could I ever forget that?

548
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,790
I'm going to make a wish and blow out my candles now.

549
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,760
("A Still Relationship")

550
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,120
You doing okay?

551
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,220
What now? Did you call to pick a fight?

552
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,790
No, I called to say congratulations.

553
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,230
You're a real meteorologist now.

554
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,000
But can I even trust your forecasts?

555
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,570
Suit yourself.

556
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,530
Now hurry up and pay me back.

557
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,340
The second I get my paycheck, I'll pay you back first thing.

558
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,740
Please do.

559
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,240
I'm busy. I have to go.

560
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,710
- Jun Kyung.
- What?

561
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,550
It's supposed to rain tomorrow.

562
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,420
Bring an umbrella.

563
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,990
All right.

564
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,810
Dad, are you doing okay?

565
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:27,110
I'm great. The hospital treatment you suggested is going very well.

566
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,280
These days, Ja Yeong is even better at finding her way around than I am.

567
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,350
How have you been? Are the wedding plans coming along?

568
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,420
Yes.

569
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,990
Do Hyun and I went to an adoption agency yesterday.

570
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,960
Really? That's great.

571
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,230
Yes. But I'm still not sure about it.

572
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,370
Take your time to think it over.

573
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,680
Whatever you decide, I know you two will do great.

574
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,280
Okay, Dad.

575
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,690
Someone once said...

576
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,760
that happiness is quiet...

577
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,730
and misery is loud.

578
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,530
In that sense, maybe happiness...

579
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,540
is a lot like loneliness.

580
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,840
Different in shape,

581
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,540
different in colour,

582
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,340
and different in size.

583
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,350
The loneliness each of us feels.

584
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,220
But if you trace it back to its source,

585
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,760
they say you'll find love at the very end.

586
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,860
When you crave something but can't have it,

587
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,000
when you're left wanting,

588
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,310
that feeling of emptiness is what becomes loneliness.

589
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,650
When you look at it that way, maybe being lonely isn't so bad after all.

590
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,820
It just hasn't been fulfilled yet,

591
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,990
but at least it proves...

592
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,560
that just as much love

593
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,190
exists within my heart.

594
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,640
(Love Me)

595
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:50,280
(Thank you for watching Love Me.)
