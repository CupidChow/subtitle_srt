00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,310
Dearly beloved brothers and sisters,

2
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,990
we are gathered here today to pray...

3
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,820
for the eternal rest of Kim Mi Ran Julia.

4
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,700
Though her life in this world is over,

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,400
remember that her new life in Paradise has just begun,

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,270
and may it fill our hearts with hope.

7
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,780
Julia was a wonderful mother and wife,

8
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,020
and a dear friend.

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,290
Which means that...

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,660
she was never alone.

11
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,690
Even now,

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,270
she is being sent off by her loving husband, daughter, and son,

13
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,200
and by the countless others who cherished her.

14
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,680
Letting go of a loved one...

15
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,750
is so painful and difficult.

16
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,250
But the Lord gives us hope.

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,020
We pray that the Lord will comfort us...

18
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,520
and bestow...

19
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,830
his peace and grace upon all of us...

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,160
who remain.

21
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,570
Amen.

22
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,410
I should get going.

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,910
Thanks for coming.

24
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,250
My poor, dear sister.

25
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,450
- Go on. - Okay.

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,220
She had such a hard life.

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,120
You poor things. What are you going to do?

28
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,630
Goodness.

29
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,730
Yes, hello?

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,270
- Yes, of course. Yes. - Jin Ho looks just as dead.

31
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,440
Return gifts? For those, we usually...

32
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,740
Jun Kyung, be sure to take good care of your dad.

33
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,940
- Yes, the 30-count... - I will.

34
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,210
- Take care of yourselves too. - is practical and durable.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,520
And the 40-count is softer and more luxurious.

36
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
- Go take that somewhere else. - Yes.

37
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,050
I see. It's for a first birthday party.

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
It's like no one's even sad.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's like...

40
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,340
they just showed up to check a box.

41
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,810
Everyone just has their own way of grieving.

42
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,450
Jun Kyung, I'm leaving.

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
- I'm going to go. - Okay. Take care.

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,770
A lot of people came.

45
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
You're right.

46
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
Too bad they didn't visit when she was still alive.

47
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,220
(Julia, Kim Mi Ran)

(Kim Mi Ran)

49
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Let's go.

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,310
Your mom should get some rest now.

51
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,230
I'll stay with Jun Seo.

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,620
It's okay.

53
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,460
- What do you mean? I saw you look! - Seriously, I really didn't!

54
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,600
I saw you look!

55
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,830
There's been a misunderstanding, so if you could just...

56
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,640
- Then let's just check the CCTV. - Jun Seo.

57
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,740
I said, let's see the CCTV!

58
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,110
It's not a big deal. We don't need the CCTV.

59
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,470
It's not a big deal?

60
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,240
He was checking out my girlfriend, and you say it's not a big deal?

61
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,380
Hey, Seo Jun Seo!

62
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,150
What? What did I do wrong?

63
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,390
Did you have to make a scene here? You're embarrassing me!

64
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,490
It's you who should be ashamed! Did you have to wear that here?

65
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,990
What?

66
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,300
You think that outfit is appropriate for a place like this?

67
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,840
I didn't dress this way for this. This is just how I always dress.

68
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
This is me.

69
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,570
I hate it!

70
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,080
I hate the way you're always dressing like that!

71
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,150
And I hate how you dress like that and post it all over social media.

72
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,820
And I hate seeing all the guys thirsting over your posts.

73
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,830
Do you have any idea how lonely you make me feel?

74
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Hey, Yoon Sol.

75
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,610
Hey, Yoon Sol!

76
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,720
What I ruined...

77
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
was Mom's last day.

78
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,370
I thought we'd have another chance.

79
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,620
Your mother and I...

80
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,320
Well, things weren't always easy.

81
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,460
But I thought if we just stayed as we were,

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,730
we'd grow old together.

83
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,470
Maybe take a nice trip once in a while,

84
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,809
watch the sunset side by side...

85
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,740
while eating some ice cream, and sing songs.

86
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,120
And go on that yacht your mother always wanted to.

87
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,660
It's sad when someone dies.

88
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,790
But it's the things they wanted to do.

89
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,600
The things your mother and I planned to do together.

90
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,170
It feels like all those things vanished right along with her.

91
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,250
Excuse me, could you pull over for a second?

92
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
What is it, Dad?

93
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Dad?

94
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Go on.

95
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,149
The person you have reached is unavailable.

96
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,120
Please leave a message...

(Seah Women's Hospital)

98
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
You okay?

99
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,080
The patient's cervix is dilated, and her contractions are irregular.

100
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,450
I'm asking about you.

101
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Are you okay?

102
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,860
I'm fine.

103
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,930
Please. You're just putting on a brave face.

104
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,400
How could you possibly be okay?

105
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,110
The neighbour's guitar music was actually comforting.

106
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
What are you talking about?

107
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,550
Someone's born, and someone dies.

108
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,290
Someone's paying me a salary, so I have to do my job.

109
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,860
You're not thinking straight.

110
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,430
I'm a pro. My private matters are separate.

111
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,790
Okay?

112
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,900
- Honey, should I wait outside? - No, don't go. Please.

113
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,500
You can't hold back now. Push.

114
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,170
- Breathe. Don't hold your breath. - Honey, breathe!

115
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,310
The mother needs to breathe, not the father.

116
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,340
I can't do this. I feel like I'm going to die.

117
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,710
- It feels like it, but you won't. - Honey!

118
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,580
No one else can do this for you.

119
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,190
Is this pathetic side of you what you want to show your daughter?

120
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,020
You're not going to be a mother who gets her leg cut off...

121
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,760
in a car accident on a rainy day, are you?

122
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,330
A mother who fights with her daughter...

123
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,270
and never gets the chance to make up.

124
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,770
One who dies...

125
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,240
from a brain haemorrhage, are you?

126
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240

If it isn't the professional who separates work and life.

130
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,130
You're the talk of the hospital.

131
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,830
They're saying Dr. Seo Jun Kyung pioneered a new delivery method.

132
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
I can only imagine how confused that poor patient was.

133
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,970
She was having a boy, but you kept screaming "daughter."

134
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,410
I bet the baby was shocked at birth. "Mom, am I a girl?"

135
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,820
I'm really not in the mood for this.

137
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,550
I was actually going to say you did well.

138
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,160
So our ice queen, Seo Jun Kyung, has a heart after all.

139
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,670
You may have looked a little unhinged,

140
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,570
but who cares?

141
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
You did good.

142
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,250
Do you think my mom ever loved me?

143
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,380
Thinking back on it,

144
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,150
her saying "I love you..."

145
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,290
I don't think I ever heard her say it once.

146
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,890
After we bust our bottoms raising our daughters,

147
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,300
they will probably say the same nonsense.

148
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,670
As if you have ever said that to your mom.

149
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,510
I thought I'd get to have at least 40 more meals with her.

150
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,180
Seriously.

151
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,680
So irresponsible, right to the very end.

152
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,050
You know what?

153
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,330
I will never ever die before my daughter.

154
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,630
How inspiring.

- Right? I'll be an amazing mom! - Give me a break.

157
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,040
No, Jun Kyung. That's enough.

Quit hounding me.

174
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,340
See? I told you to send a courier, especially since it's raining.

175
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,510
A courier? Are we made of money? It's a quick drive.

176
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,050
- So where are you now? - I just passed Hoam Station.

177

Okay, I'm heading out now.

(Yeonsu Hospital)

182
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,240
I told you not to come.

183
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,140
I told you not to come, didn't I?

184
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,080
I told you it was raining.

185
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,920
Because it was raining.

186
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,690
I told you not to come.

187
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,970
It's not your fault, Jun Kyung.

188
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,540
It's not your fault.

189
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,049
Don't cry.

190
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,350
Don't cry, Jun Kyung.

191
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,020
It's not your fault.

192
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
- Gosh. - It's starting to rain!

193
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,490
So, what should we get to eat?

194
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,050
Hey!

195
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,920
Hey, Seo Jun Seo!

196
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,190
Hey!

197
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,590
(Fast pitch: only 1 player allowed, 10 dollars for 17 pitches)

198
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Seriously!

199
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,970
Please let me get one hit.

200
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
One hit!

201
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,420
Hey, mister!

202
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,690
Mister!

203
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,860
- Mister... - What's wrong?

204
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,530
Mister, please help me.

205
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,100
- My neck is stuck. - What are you doing in the rain?

206
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,610
We meet again.

207
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Right.

208
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,790
Oh, dear. I seem to have forgotten the code to my place.

209
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,090
Can you believe it?

210
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,290
Why don't you ask your husband to let you in?

211
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,300
My husband?

212
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,200
Right. My husband.

213
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,870
He's on a business trip. Way out of town.

214
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,240
You could just call and ask him.

215
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,790
Darn it. Perfect timing.

216
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,020
Where is it? Come on, where is my phone?

217
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,030
Really.

218
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,730
- Gosh. - Your phone is ringing.

219
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,770
Hey, what's our passcode?

220
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,180
The ER?

221
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,690
Which hospital?

222
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,700
Okay, I'm on my way.

223
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,980
Look. I'll give you a ride.

224
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,980
No, that's okay.

225
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
- Isn't it urgent? - It is.

226
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,490
Get in.

227
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,760
- In that? - Yes.

228
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,630
- Whose car is it? - It's my car.

229
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,959
- It's mine. - But...

230
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,300
- The ambulance... - Shouldn't we head to the ER?

231
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,230
Whose car?

232
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,400
- It's my car. - Hold on.

233
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
It hurts.

234
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,410
Jun Kyung.

235
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,940
What? Have you been drinking?

236
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,910
I see you're thriving.

237
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,650
What are you writing your thesis on? Some kind of baseball-fusion theory?

238
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,890
Your brother's in this condition, and that's the first thing you say?

239
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,020
I heard everything from the nurse. You pulled a muscle swinging at air,

240
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,960
and you're fine. They said you can remove the neck brace soon.

241
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,330
"Fine?" I was practically dying. I'm only up because of the drugs.

242
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,530
- I never should've called you. - You wanted me to pay the bill.

243
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,970
Don't pay it! I mean it, don't you dare pay that bill.

244
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,670
Really? Then, mind if I take your wallet?

245
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,610
How can one person be so infuriating?

246
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,310
Seriously.

247
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm sorry.

248
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
No, don't be.

249
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,790
I'm the one who's sorry.

250
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,000
No, I'm really sorry.

251
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,330
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

252
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,900
Don't cry. It's my fault, okay?

253
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,010
Look at me. Look at me, Sol.

254
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,810
Why are you crying?

255
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,310
Your poor neck.

256
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,490
- I really love you. - Come here.

257
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,020
I love you more.

258
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,190
I love you!

259
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,900
Hey, Sol.

260
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,830
Hello, Jun Kyung.

261
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,670
Hello.

262
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,470
Hello.

263
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,410
And you are?

264
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,180
What? Right, so this is...

265
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,020
And your name was?

266
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,319
I'm Ju Do Hyun.

267
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,590
Right, Ju Do Hyun. He's my neighbour.

268
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,490
Wait, you live next door? Then why are you together this late?

269
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,330
What?

270
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Your sister and I...

271
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,870
were on a date...

272
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,970
when she got your urgent call.

273
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,420
Why would you say we were on a date? He's going to get the wrong idea.

274
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,250
My apologies.

275
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,920
Especially since you have a husband.

276
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,570
Actually, I'm not married.

277
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,410
I know.

278
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,270
Is it obvious?

279
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,810
You're 36.

280
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,680
- A doctor at Seah Hospital. - A doctor at Seah Hospital.

281
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,950
Family-wise, parents and a younger brother.

282
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,790
Height is 167cm. Weight...

283
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,590
It's a little more than I was told.

284
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,330
It was a gorgeous car, but I got sick of it in two years.

285
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,840
And you start seeing them everywhere.

286
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,770
- So I just switched to a Maserati. - I already booked a room.

287
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,910
Maserati actually has a team of engine sound design engineers.

288
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,280
- They're pianists and composers... - So you want sex, is that it?

289
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,790
We just met today,

290
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,620
and it hasn't even been an hour.

291
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,390
Hey. Please keep your voice down.

292
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,930
You're right. That way, we don't waste any time,

293
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,860
and we can quickly see if we're compatible or not.

294
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,630
My apologies.

295
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Keep it.

296
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,570
You wasted your time on a woman you won't get. Don't waste money.

297
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,110
Rude to the very end, aren't you?

298
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,680
My date was a total bore,

299
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,210
but that was entertaining.

300
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,450
It was impressive.

301
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,350
Downing your drink and storming out.

302
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm not usually like that.

303
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,930
Really?

304
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,260
I don't know. Maybe I am.

305
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,970
Want to listen to some music?

306
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Something that will boost my self-esteem, please.

307
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,140
One second.

308
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
That way.

309
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,850
Remember your password?

310
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,460
It's nice having a good neighbour.

311
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,630
About that...

312
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,140
I won't be your neighbour for much longer.

313
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,180
I'm moving out soon.

314
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,810
I see. Is that so?

315
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,090
It's a shame, isn't it?

316
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,060
Now that...

317
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,400
we won't run into each other anymore,

318
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
how about we meet on purpose for a change?

319
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,240
You said you wanted the lowest possible rate,

320
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,610
so you signed up for the non-refundable package.

321
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm sorry, but we can't offer you a refund.

322
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,950
As I said,

323
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,130
my wife, whom I was going with, has passed away.

324
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm very sorry to hear that.

325
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,170
But there's nothing we can do.

326
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,680
We hope you have a pleasant trip.

327
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,280
(Golden Tour)

328
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,569
Julia held the family together.

329
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,070
She handled everything, including the kids.

330
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,070
She worked so hard to raise those kids right.

331
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,250
I wonder how poor, helpless Raphael will manage on his own.

332
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm just so worried about him...

333
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,179
Raphael? I'll see you on Sunday.

334
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,190
Raphael!

335
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,650
Raphael.

336
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,120
Hello.

337
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,560
Something came up, so I couldn't make it to the funeral.

338
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,070
That's all right.

339
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,740
Our dear Julia. She seemed so well, but then she was gone so suddenly.

340
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,440
I heard it was a beautiful service.

341
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,850
Just the right number of mourners came,

342
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,250
and the priest's eulogy was magnificent.

343
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,420
My goodness, the death of a spouse...

344
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,230
They say it's the most stressful event in a person's life.

345
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,430
Are you holding up okay, Raphael?

346
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,430
Can you take this off? I don't need it.

347
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,770
This poor man...

348
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,610
Raphael. I thought you'd left. Is something wrong?

349
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,679
My goodness! Raphael!

350
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,050
Someone died, and you call it what?

351
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,880
"A beautiful funeral?"

352
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,020
Goodness, Raphael. Raphael, what's gotten into you?

353
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,960
- Oh, my! - No funeral is beautiful!

354
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,260
He's lost his mind.

355
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,270
Oh, my gosh, he's lost his mind. He's lost it!

356
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,310
Why are you still here, Raphael?

357
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,780
You're all right, aren't you?

358
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,350
Yes. I'm fine.

359
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,550
Julia will always be watching over you.

360
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,360
- Thank you. - Of course.

361
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,700
I mean...

362
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,870
It hasn't even been that long since my mom passed away.

363
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,040
And I keep wondering if I should even be doing this.

364
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,120
Do you think someone's just going to show up at the perfect time for you,

365
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,850
and ask, "So, is now a good time? Perfect for dating, right?"

366
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,220
You're no service tech,

367
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,459
but to give away your number like that...

368
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,730
- to a guy? - For real?

369
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,860
Hey, that was just because he said he was moving.

370
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,970
So I just got caught up in the moment.

371
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,470
I must've been out of my mind.

372
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,339
You won't know till you meet him.

373
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,310
It's not like you must marry him or have kids with him.

374
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,340
- You're just seeing what he's like. - Exactly.

375
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,680
Right?

376
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,250
No, I did get the address, but... No way.

377
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,550
Guys, that guy's wearing a hoodie again.

378
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,850
A hoodie?

379
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Did they meet?

380
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,020
Is he underdressed, or am I overdressed?

381
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,460
Hey, who knows? Maybe he's the CEO of some hot startup.

382
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,700
Hand it over to me.

383
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,400
Jun Kyung. Hey, first of all, don't just say what comes to mind.

384
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,470
That thought... No, you know what? Just don't think at all, okay?

385
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,740
No, wait. That's not right.

386
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,100
Whatever you want to do, don't do it. Okay?

387
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,170
He saw me. I've got to go.

388
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,240
Jun Kyung? What? Okay? Hello?

389
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,350
What?

390
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
Were you on the phone?

391
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,690
- I hope things go well. - Was she on the phone?

392
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,750
She was.

393
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,790
Excuse me!

394
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,490
Another bottle of soju?

395
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,730
Ma'am!

396
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,530
You're here early.

397
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,370
Yes, I got here super early.

398
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,870
This place is super popular. If you're late, the line is insane.

399
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,680
- I see. - This pork rind is amazing. Cheers!

400
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,000
- This is awkward, isn't it? - Sorry?

401
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes, a little...

402
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,370
Of course it is.

403
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,470
We've only ever run into each other.

404
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,080
This is the first time we've actually...

405
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,520
Don't you have any questions for me?

406
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,890
Well, I...

407
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,420
I know a little bit about you, Jun Kyung.

408
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,500
It's just...

409
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,270
I feel like I know a little bit about you too.

410
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,810
Let's see...

411
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,550
You seem a little younger than me.

412
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,920
Maybe 35?

413
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,060
You'd better not be married, of course.

414
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,030
And your job...

415
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Something in the arts?

416
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,440
A starving artist, I presume?

417
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,210
- It shows? - Really?

418
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,690
He's charming. He's even kind of cute, in a way.

419
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,330
But...

420
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,430
the fact that he's 35 and still just doing music...

421
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,800
For some reason, that doesn't feel like a real job to me.

422
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,700
So what kind of music does he make?

423
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,440
How should I describe it?

424
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,480
It's just, you know...

425
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,780
A bit of this and that.

426
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,280
Whatever feels right.

427
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,150
I pretty much do it all.

428
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,390
He doesn't even know what he's doing.

429
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,560
Does that remind you of anyone?

430
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,990
Who?

431
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,469
One guy still in a rebellious phase is more than enough,

432
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,330
and that's Seo Jun Seo.

433
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,800
- So he's broke? - Come on, do I even need to ask?

434
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,070
Gosh.

435
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,940
"If you don't mind me asking, what's your annual salary?"

436
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,650
"Are you self-sufficient? Are you a night owl who works late?"

437
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,620
"Because I'm a morning person with a 9-to-5."

438
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,880
You should've asked him those things since you were already out with him.

439
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,190
If a guy were to ask,

440
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,020
"How much do you weigh? What's your waist size?"

441
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,260
"What's your body fat percentage?" Would you tell him on a first date?

442
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,990
- Sure, I'd tell him. - I'd tell him.

443
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
I've got nothing to hide.

444
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,300
I wish someone would ask me.

445
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,470
For a guy his age...

446
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,610
What did he have to sacrifice for that kind of freedom?

447
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,520
Wealth and fame?

448
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,450
Exactly.

449
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,260
I'm not sure I could handle that kind of freedom.

450
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Here, try some.

451
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,910
- You must have burned yourself. - I did.

452
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,070
No, I don't want to handle it.

453
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,040
When it's already hard enough to find...

454
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,550
things you have in common with someone,

455
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:38,520
you're just hunting for things you dislike or don't have in common.

456
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,820
You're actively looking for them.

457
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,020
I'm not hunting for them. They're just obvious.

458
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,060
Obvious? What's so obvious? Is this a game of Tetris to you?

459
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,660
You have this void you've built up from all your insecurities,

460
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,860
and you expect some guy to just slot in there perfectly?

461
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,370
If you only wait for the long piece, it's game over.

462
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,370
Do you think she'll ever find a guy who'll sweep her off her feet?

463
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,140
No, that alone won't do it. We're out of booze.

464
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,340
- She'd have to be possessed. - And we're out of booze.

465
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,740
Hey, hold on a second.

466
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,910
I thought as long as a guy was hot enough...

467
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,050
for you to just live off his looks, that was good enough for you.

468
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,620
That's what I thought too.

469
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,720
But I guess I'm more materialistic than I realised.

470
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,230
What?

471
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,940
Is that really all he said?

472
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,410
The truth is...

473
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,120
I was certain about something.

474
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,220
Certain about what?

475
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,860
That you, Jun Kyung,

476
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,460
would need me.

477
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,770
They say attraction...

478
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
starts with observation.

479
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,710
I feel like I heard that somewhere.

480
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,090
And I...

481
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,690
unintentionally...

482
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,430
ended up observing you, Jun Kyung.

483
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,400
Almost every day.

484
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,750
(2:32am)

485
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,250
(Delicious Anytime! New Ramen Meal Kit Available Now!)

486
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,030
You looked lonely.

487
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,200
You did, Jun Kyung.

488
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,270
It was as if...

489
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,440
you were trying to be lonely.

490
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,550
If that makes any sense.

491
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,780
But...

492
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,690
who in the world actually tries to be lonely?

493
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,870
(The Guy Next Door)

494
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,130
Did you get home okay?

495
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,430
(The Guy Next Door)

496
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,410
(Charging will be complete in...)

497
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,780
For goodness' sake.

498
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,470
What's up?

499
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,970
Okay, I'm on my way.

500
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,850
We'll talk when I get there.

501
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,990
We keep running into each other like this.

502
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,210
I was worried. I couldn't get a hold of you.

503
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,550
Did I do something wrong last time?

504
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,390
No.

505
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,920
So it was the restaurant. I knew it.

506
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,040
I just thought...

507
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,970
that we were both...

508
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,310
really comfortable together,

509
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,880
and that we really hit it off.

510
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,050
In what way do we "hit it off?"

511
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,290
Fair point.

512
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,090
Which means...

513
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,930
all we need to do is get in sync.

514
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,800
Get to know each other better.

515
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Then again...

516
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,350
I guess no response was an answer in itself.

517
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,920
It's not just you.

518
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
I'm not interested in getting to know anyone right now.

519
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,650
(Golden Tour)

520
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,160
You can't be serious.

521
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,560
You said you booked this trip for Mom, right?

522
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,230
So you should obviously cancel. You're not going alone, are you?

523
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,470
Then you take Dad to Jeju Island.

524
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,310
- If you want to go so bad, you go. - You think I'm not busy?

525
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,380
What, and you think I am?

526
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,480
Jun Seo.

527
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,710
- Look, son... - Aren't you even sad?

528
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,750
Aren't you?

529
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,090
Why is no one else sad?

530
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,190
Why?

531
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,560
You know, I...

532
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,930
For seven years now, since your mom's accident...

533
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,230
So what, you're happy now?

534
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,940
Going to some fancy resort to celebrate Mom's death?

535
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,950
Seo Jun Seo. Watch your mouth.

536
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,430
That's rich, coming from you.

537
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,530
Don't you remember the last thing you said to Mom before she died?

538
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,500
That she looked fat.

539
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,740
I said her clothes looked too small. I never said she looked fat.

540
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,840
And you don't regret that?

541
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,280
Being sad and feeling guilty are two different things.

542
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,350
- Do you regret it or not? - And what good would that do?

543
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,950
You should still regret it.

544
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,130
Is this what you call "grieving in your own way?"

545
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,100
Is it? You...

546
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,740
You think we all had it rough because of Mom, don't you?

547
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,940
But how are you any different from Mom?

548
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,310
You both only think about yourselves and your pain. You're selfish too.

549
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,780
But...

550
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,320
at least Mom wasn't a coward like you.

551
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,170
You just ran away.

552
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,540
You didn't move out because you were making it on your own.

553
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,440
You were running away from this family.

554
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,590
(Operating Room)

555
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,740
(Operating Room)

556
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,860
(Absolute Rest Required)

557
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,920
(Absolute Rest Required)

558
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:35,930
Mom.

559
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,040
We need to go to the hospital.

560
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,610
- We should go to the hospital. - I'm not going.

561
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,380
Aren't you going to do your physical therapy?

562
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,220
How am I supposed to do therapy on a leg that isn't there?

563
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,620
Fine.

564
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,430
Even if you won't go to the hospital,

565
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,200
you should at least wash your face and your hair.

566
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
Okay?

567
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,670
I don't want to.

568
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,810
Are you just going to give up on life, Mom?

569
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,040
You blame me for this, don't you?

570
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,150
That you ended up like this because of me.

571
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,750
So you're trying to destroy yourself just to spite me, is that it?

572
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,779
- Get out. - That's why I told you not to come.

573
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,450
- Get out. - I told you it was raining.

574
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,690
- I said get out! - Why are you here driving me crazy?

575
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,360
Get out!

576
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:46,810
Hey, Jun Kyung.

577
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,210
How can you just leave like this?

578
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,480
Your mom's not in a good place. Fix things before you go.

579
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,720
Maybe next time.

580
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,020
Jun Kyung.

581
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,500
I wanted to tell myself not to leave.

582
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,300
To myself back then.

583
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,940
I wanted to stop myself.

584
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,610
To tell myself to stop.

585
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,280
That if I ran away then,

586
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,750
I would just keep running.

587
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,260
Always pretending to be okay.

588
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,200
Pretending that nothing was wrong.

589
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,470
But again...

590
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,940
and again.

591
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,680
I...

592
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,350
would end up lonely.

593
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,350
I saw that. I was pretty thrown.

594
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,849
- Hye Rin's manager... - Yes?

595
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,750
Really treats Daniel like...

596
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,460
- his beck and call. - Seriously?

597
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,630
No, that's not it at all.

598
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,100
- Hello? - Drinking by yourself again?

599
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,600
We're opening some wild grape wine. Why don't you hurry over?

600
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,470
That's right.

601
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,810
I always did run away to your place, didn't I?

602
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,550
What?

603
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,820
Just like Hyung Jun said,

604
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,890
I guess there's nothing I can do by myself.

605
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,190
I can't fight, I can't make up,

606
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:59,630
I can't comfort anyone, and I can't be comforted.

607
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,010
The only thing I can do by myself...

608
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,440
is being lonely.

609
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:14,950
Jun Kyung.

610
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,480
Do you want me to come over?

611
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,290
No.

612
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,900
I'm okay.

613
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,570
Tonight, I'm okay.

614
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:51,350
Jun Kyung.

615
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,420
I'm sorry.

616
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,860
No, it's...

617
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,470
You...

618
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,870
have nothing to be sorry about.

619
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:13,910
No, what I mean is...

620
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:23,980
It's just...

621
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,390
You mean?

622
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,360
I haven't been honest.

623
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:47,940
I always lie and pretend I'm fine.

624
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,710
So...

625
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,450
what I'm trying to say is...

626
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,390
I'd like to get to know you.

627
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,710
But I thought...

628
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,780
you didn't want to get to know anyone.

629
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,720
I'd like to try.

630
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,190
If it's not too late.

631
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,540
It is getting late.

632
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,810
But it looks like there's still a chance.

633
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,030
So, what should we do now?

634
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:22,970
Let's take it slow.

635
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,540
Okay.

636
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,310
Slowly.

637
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,380
Want to come in for one minute?

638
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:47,990
No.

639
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,830
Slowly.

640
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,430
Right.

641
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,370
Slowly.

642
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,740
I made single servings of bone broth and put them in the freezer.

643
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,910
Make sure you eat well, and always lock the door.

644
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,390
(Comments)

645
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:53,930
Yoon Sol, you killed it today.

646
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,290
Got a crush on me?

647
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,800
"Got a crush on me?"

648
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,870
- What? - It's Ju Hyeon Gyeong.

649
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,230
- Okay. - It's a pleasure to meet you.

650
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,510
Seo Jin Ho?

651
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,140
Yes.

652
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,880
Is Kim Mi Ran not coming with you?

653
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,550
Something came up.

654
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,290
Is it okay if I go by myself?

655
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,890
Life...

656
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,630
never lets a shining blessing...

657
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,930
or an unbearable sorrow...

658
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,570
linger by our side for long.

659
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,470
More than that unbearable sorrow,

660
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,140
- Where have I seen... - my deep rage that makes...

661
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,379
- Right. - my heart pound is more important.

662
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,950
- That's a first. - Pardon?

663
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,950
You're the first person I've seen wear dress shoes on a trip.

664
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,120
More than that unbearable sorrow,

665
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,490
- You look sharp. - my own small, unexpected thrill...

666
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,830
- is what's most important... - Grab your bags.

667
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,160
- to us. - Please come this way.

668
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:08,000
(Departures)

669
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,930
A shining blessing,

670
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,570
or an unbearable sorrow.

671
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,180
Nothing...

672
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,550
(Kim Mi Ran)

673
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,950
is meant to stay...

674
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,490
by our side for very long.

675
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:40,330
(Love Me)

676
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,869
- A birthday party? - Yes.

677
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:16,270
How about my birthday party at your house?

678
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,440
Is this what you call "grieving in our own way?"

679
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:23,710
I'm a truly hopeless scumbag.

680
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,410
I'm glad you came. I'm so glad you came.

681
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,110
I feel like I'm the only one living well,

682
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,320
and I feel so guilty and miserable about it.

683
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,090
Seo Jin Ho.

684
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,790
Seo Jin Ho?

685
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:40,220
We agreed to take things slow, right?

686
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,530
You like him that much?

687
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,060
Just as I thought, being a couple complicates things.

688
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,700
You're not getting disappointed as you learn more about me, are you?

689
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:52,770
Why did I ever like you? Why did I trust someone like you?

690
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,340
The regret is driving me crazy.
