1
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,232
So

2
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,369
it's not that you're too lazy
to have breakfast,

3
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,370
you just don't eat breakfast at all?

4
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:52,375
Intermittent fasting.

5
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,117
So it's not that you failed...

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,380
to get your license,
you just never bothered to get one?

7
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,344
Well...

8
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,027
It's my way of cutting down
on carbon emissions.

9
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,532
So it's not

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,903
like you couldn't date, you just didn't?

11
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,193
Then why did you change your mind?

12
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,311
You said we should take it slow.

13
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:31,582
Anyone hearing this would think
we slept together.

14
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:35,653
We didn't sleep together,
but we did fall asleep in the same space.

15
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,354
I mean,

16
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,524
getting to know someone

17
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:44,728
includes knowing their space.

18
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,601
So

19
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,267
how was it?

20
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:12,834
I expected to see
sheet music scattered everywhere,

21
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,392
the smell of old takeout,

22
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,795
and everything reeking of cigarettes...

23
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:21,197
I thought you'd be living like some zombie
with a flipped schedule.

24
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,501
So, you're disappointed?

25
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:29,506
Well, my fantasy of musicians fell apart.

26
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,784
After the tea ceremony today,

27
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,887
you'll have a Jeju silver hairtail set dinner.

28
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,689
Then back to the resort

29
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,870
for a spa massage.

30
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,273
That's the final schedule for today.

31
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:54,264
Please unpack and rest in your rooms.

32
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,733
We'll meet back here at noon.

33
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,533
See you later.

34
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,735
- Okay.
- Thanks for your hard work.

35
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,119
- Yes.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,104
Okay. Let's go.

37
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:06,843
Excuse me.

38
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,385
- Do I really have to join?
- Yes.

39
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,183
Sorry?

40
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,783
What do you mean?

41
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,387
The meals and sightseeing.

42
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:20,023
Those are all included in the fee.

43
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:23,593
It's a premier-level package,
so you'll be satisfied.

44
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:27,271
I'd rather rest.

45
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:31,201
Normally, individual activities aren't allowed,

46
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,504
but if you're staying behind,
please remain within the resort.

47
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:37,140
We can't risk you going out and getting hurt.

48
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:15,098
[Happy 35th Wedding Anniversary]

49
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,448
You slept with him?

50
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:24,467
You acted all aloof, playing hard to get.

51
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:27,390
We just slept.

52
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,600
I swear, we literally just slept.
Just sleeping, nothing else.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,264
No touching at all? Just sleep?

54
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,666
- Yeah.
- Is that even possible?

55
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,119
We decided to take things slow.

56
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,573
Take things slow?

57
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,845
Cold-blooded Seo Jun Kyung
and he, a broke musician,

58
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:51,714
did you two seriously agree to postpone sex?

59
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,767
Well,

60
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,687
that's how it ended up, anyway.

61
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,796
Is that something
a gynecology specialist should be saying?

62
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,862
Are we supposed to encourage sex?

63
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,728
Of all the things to postpone... seriously?

64
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:12,102
Wow, the laziest couple ever.

65
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,501
Then

66
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,439
what did you do all night long?

67
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:19,528
Well,

68
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,779
<i>we drank,</i>

69
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,227
<i>and talked.</i>

70
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,791
<i>He's my polar opposite.</i>

71
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,627
<i>That's all I figured out.</i>

72
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,568
<i>But somehow,</i>

73
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,898
<i>that difference didn't bother me
as much as I thought.</i>

74
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,012
You two did it, right?

75
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,316
Would you believe that if it were you?

76
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:02,552
You can't even sleep at home,
yet you slept like a baby at his place?

77
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,488
Nothing else?

78
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,169
I know.

79
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,629
How did I even sleep that deeply?

80
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,664
In someone else's house, of all places.

81
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:38,819
Anyway,

82
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,924
don't tell anyone.

83
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:44,574
Like there's even anything to tell.

84
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,697
Did you know?

85
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,498
What?

86
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,303
Dr. Hong skipped lunch today, not for dieting,

87
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,539
but because she fought with her boyfriend.

88
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,773
Seriously?

89
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,008
No way.

90
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,839
There's that smile.

91
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,915
Even if it's a bit awkward, it's been days.

92
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,167
Hey, let's go eat.

93
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,968
- Let's go together.
- Let's go together.

94
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,602
Hurry up.

95
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,640
<i>I don't have practice today. Where are you?</i>

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,945
Why are you ignoring my texts?

97
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,414
You ignored my calls too.

98
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,756
Why are you sulking?

99
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,921
Who is sulking?

100
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,501
Fine, then I'm leaving.

101
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,195
Hey.

102
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,664
Yes,

103
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:55,900
I am sulking.

104
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,895
So what is it? What are you upset about?

105
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:00,037
Who's that guy?

106
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,605
Who?

107
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,006
That guy.

108
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,641
He looks so sleazy,

109
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,743
posting photos of you all over his feed.

110
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:08,478
Oh, Beom Jun?

111
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,948
You're cute.

112
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,417
Come here.

113
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,656
What are you doing?

114
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,556
Look at this.

115
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,927
"He's my everything."

116
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:28,933
I posted it.

117
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,067
Are you happy now?

118
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,268
- You are, right?
- No.

119
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,703
You totally are!

120
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,840
Estonia?

121
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,207
You've been there?

122
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,807
Yeah.

123
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,344
When? With who?

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,932
There you go again, getting suspicious.

125
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,017
The year before last, with my team for a show.

126
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,685
Oh...

127
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,430
First, at the nicest restaurant
in the Old Town,

128
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,360
I invite everyone I know for round one.

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,495
Yeah.

130
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,997
Then we head downtown
to the hottest club for round two.

131
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:02,445
Yeah.

132
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,267
And then,

133
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,968
back to the hotel,

134
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,870
just you and me, a totally steamy round three.

135
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,210
What is that?

136
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,108
Well? Huh?

137
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,211
But seriously,

138
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:17,847
why throw a birthday party
all the way out there?

139
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,200
It's just

140
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,634
my dream.

141
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,355
Geez.

142
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:26,955
Hey.

143
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:32,329
Anything else besides that?

144
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,942
Huh?

145
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,067
If I say it,

146
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,834
will you do it for me?

147
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,425
Oh, no way.

148
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,872
Yes, Dad.

149
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,486
<i>Yeah.</i>

150
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,509
I feel like I shouldn't have come.

151
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,312
I should've just listened to Jun Seo.

152
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,285
You went on a trip?

153
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,222
<i>I bet you don't get me, do you?</i>

154
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:06,935
<i>Given everything going on right now.</i>

155
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,762
I just felt like doing it anyway.

156
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,899
I understand.

157
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:23,472
Did you get off work?

158
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,443
I'm about to.

159
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,545
I wonder if Jun Seo is at least eating.

160
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,039
- A home party?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,318
Not one of those boring
store-rented birthday parties.

162
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,021
A real birthday party.

163
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,322
But my place is too small.

164
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:41,091
What do you think?

165
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:44,093
Your dad is away traveling,
so no one is home, right?

166
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,039
Why?

167
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,774
You don't like it?

168
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,617
It's just...

169
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:02,112
I'm not sure if I'm in a place
where I should do that.

170
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,947
It hasn't been long since my mom passed away.

171
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:09,486
You know my situation right now,
it's just... My situation.

172
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,321
Huh?

173
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,724
He's sick too,
and he'll be alone at home anyway.

174
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:16,459
Eating alone is really lonely.

175
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,196
Make sure you eat dinner too.

176
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,063
Yes. You too, Dad.

177
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,400
Did you

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,348
get some rest?

179
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,486
Yeah, thanks to you.

180
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,745
I asked the restaurant,
and they said you didn't eat.

181
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,624
Eating alone didn't feel right.

182
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:48,759
Right?

183
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,495
That's why people stick together in groups.

184
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:54,830
This is abalone gimbap.
You should be able to eat it.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,585
Here.

186
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:03,739
Abalone in gimbap, huh.

187
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,510
Tomorrow, you'll be with us all day.

188
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,988
Oh, I already checked.

189
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:23,659
Yeah, it should be fine.

190
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,737
Oh, okay.

191
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:37,773
I'll put it together
and send it over by tomorrow morning.

192
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,335
They call themselves a writer,

193
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,679
yet misspellings
aren't something to brag about.

194
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,280
Seriously.

195
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,131
Geez.

196
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,248
Hey.

197
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:03,133
Sorry, but I have to work.

198
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,234
I can't eat with you.

199
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,973
Have you been to Estonia?

200
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:18,432
I want to go. The Baltic states.

201
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,968
Someone goes to Estonia,

202
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,167
someone goes to Jeju.

203
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,889
Ah...

204
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,123
Seeing it today,

205
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,200
you could totally

206
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,935
throw a party on your rooftop.

207
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:32,795
What are you talking about?

208
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:42,038
I feel like I'm the loneliest person
in the world.

209
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:07,567
When I'm alone, I'm lonely because I'm alone.

210
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,134
When I'm with someone, I'm lonely
because I'm afraid of ending up alone.

211
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,922
Poor or rich,

212
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:15,037
it's lonely either way.

213
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:20,609
What's more equal than loneliness?

214
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:24,901
No.

215
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,349
It's unfair.

216
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:30,386
I'm lonelier
than anyone else, even just a little.

217
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,692
No one understands me.

218
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm heading out early.

219
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,081
Where are you going?

220
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,872
- Sorry?
- It's only day one for her.

221
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:49,973
Of course, she's going on a date.

222
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:52,309
- Shh, it's a secret.
- Oh, right. A secret.

223
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,143
Good luck.

224
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,400
- Couldn't even keep it for a day?
- You got this.

225
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,824
Don't start quietly and let it fizzle out.

226
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:10,192
This time, even out of embarrassment,
do it right.

227
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,395
<i>- Auntie.
- That's right.</i>

228
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:14,797
<i>- Auntie.
- Auntie.</i>

229
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:16,267
<i>Auntie.</i>

230
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,414
<i>Make sure you bring your boyfriend.</i>

231
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:21,133
<i>Make sure you bring your boyfriend.</i>

232
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,907
<i>Make sure you bring your boyfriend.</i>

233
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:27,678
Your relationship isn't just yours anymore.

234
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:30,199
Take some responsibility. Okay?

235
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,111
Why are you looking at me like that?

236
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:43,197
What brings you here? No call or anything.

237
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:46,411
- It's broad daylight. Can't I just drop by?
- Dad's not home.

238
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:48,431
He's traveling.

239
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,411
I know.

240
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,933
Move.

241
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,943
Did you eat?

242
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:25,503
Is this what you call grieving in your own way?

243
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:28,103
- It's just...
- Don't say it.

244
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,073
I know what you're about to say

245
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,945
is probably right.

246
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,917
Thanks.

247
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,888
Let's just eat.

248
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,520
You got a text.

249
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,183
What is it?

250
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,656
From the guy next door.

251
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,631
"Jun Kyung, today's our day one."

252
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:32,835
"Especially during the day." That's all I see.

253
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,334
Here it is.

254
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:44,135
Congrats on day one.

255
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,266
Dad really knows how to make soup.
It's rich and hearty.

256
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,533
He's pretty old-school.

257
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,534
He must've cooked it with real care, no tricks.

258
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,202
Yeah.

259
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,801
You know,

260
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:17,579
that message from earlier...

261
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,066
it's not really a big...

262
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,051
- Don't say it.
- Huh?

263
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,720
I know what you're about to say

264
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,457
is probably right.

265
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,730
Let's just eat.

266
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,498
Uh, thanks.

267
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,834
Ugh, talk about bad timing.

268
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,746
That's embarrassing.

269
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,123
Yes, Do Hyun.

270
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,240
This is nice.

271
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:22,400
What kind of work are you doing here?

272
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,913
Oh, here?

273
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,467
You're

274
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,701
curious

275
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,451
what I'm working on?

276
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,167
What?

277
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,665
It's...

278
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:43,808
Yeah.

279
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,534
That coffee commercial.

280
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,204
It's the follow-up, coming out next week.

281
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:55,244
I'm putting my rough music

282
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:58,680
over a beautifully made video.

283
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:07,222
It's my first time
inviting someone to my studio.

284
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:10,033
As you get to know me more,

285
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,194
you won't be disappointed, right?

286
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:15,597
So far, not yet.

287
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:25,941
How do those two look to you?

288
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,501
They look lonely.

289
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,148
Well...

290
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:36,585
I can turn those two

291
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
into a sad couple

292
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,892
who sense a breakup coming,

293
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,960
or into a couple

294
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,834
just getting started,

295
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,966
full of butterflies.

296
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,392
How?

297
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:55,904
I have that kind of power.

298
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:57,974
Seriously?

299
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,955
It really changes the vibe.

300
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,731
So those two,

301
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,801
what happens to them now?

302
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,891
But,

303
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,527
we did agree

304
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:55,898
to take things slow, right?

305
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,370
Right.

306
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,492
Did you sleep well?

307
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,597
Yes.

308
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,265
Yes.

309
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:31,400
Are you going to be a hermit again today?

310
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,569
With the weather this nice?

311
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:44,532
- No way!
- I love it!

312
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:49,186
Not much longer now. Hang in there.

313
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:50,819
Are you okay?

314
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,489
You okay?

315
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,429
You go on ahead.

316
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:15,100
Why?

317
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,200
- Why, what's wrong?
- My pants tore.

318
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,801
Oh...

319
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,657
Give that to me. I'll take care of it.

320
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,895
Oh, no.

321
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,200
Thank you.

322
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,934
Guess that functional jacket

323
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,581
really did its job.

324
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,334
That was close.

325
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,218
Thanks to you, really.

326
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:04,693
- Don't sit there! That stings!
- It stings!

327
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,533
That's just cruel.

328
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,843
The more I think about it, that landlord,

329
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,964
how can they just change the move-out date
whenever they feel like it?

330
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:18,703
If that's the situation, what can I do?

331
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,576
I should be understanding.

332
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:23,704
They even covered
storage for the furniture and big items.

333
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:25,815
There isn't much left.

334
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:27,265
So that's it.

335
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:28,285
All done.

336
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,100
Don't bother

337
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,821
coming back up later.

338
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,422
It'll go faster if we do it together.

339
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:36,045
A junior's coming soon,
so I'll finish the rest with them.

340
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,601
So,

341
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:40,731
could you grab us something cold to drink?

342
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,634
What should I get?

343
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,366
Whatever.

344
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:48,003
- Watch the traffic.
- Got it.

345
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:54,243
He says the move date suddenly changed,
so he'll stay at a junior's place.

346
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:55,923
Wouldn't that be awkward?

347
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,083
For who?

348
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,349
Him?

349
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,248
Or your feelings?

350
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,644
Hearing he's leaving suddenly
just makes me uneasy.

351
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:04,844
<i>What, is he emigrating?</i>

352
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:07,123
Getting deployed somewhere?

353
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:08,344
Should I tell him to stay at my place?

354
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:09,975
Are you out of your mind?

355
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,728
You've only known him for a few days,
and you're talking about cohabiting?

356
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:14,630
It's not cohabiting.

357
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,066
It's just temporary until he moves.

358
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:19,668
That's too much.
You two haven't slept together yet.

359
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:27,325
What?

360
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,044
Did you sleep with him?

361
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,117
<i>Even so,</i>

362
00:27:35,117 --> 00:27:38,053
do you really need

363
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:41,246
to share everything at the very start?

364
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:42,006
Is that so?

365
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:44,727
Weren't you taking things slow?

366
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:48,197
His bathroom habits, his snoring decibels,

367
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:50,599
your bare face, your farting.

368
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,368
<i>There's nowhere to hide.</i>

369
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:55,905
You should be showing
only the lovely sides at this stage.

370
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:58,607
<i>You're playing a brinkmanship tactic.</i>

371

Right?

372

375

Why?

376
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,262
That junior turned out to be a woman.

377
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,300

Well...

the place is spacious,

403

405
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,082
Okay.

406
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,692
I will.

407
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,283

408
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,391
He's my junior.

409

Woo Jung Hoon.

410

Say hi.

411
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,637
This is Seo Jun Kyung.

412
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,037
My girlfriend.

413
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,907
Oh,

414
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,907
nice to meet you.

415
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,280
So,

416
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,100
you thought

417
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,951
my junior was a woman?

418
00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:31,595
What kind of image do I have?

419
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:35,730
I'm not that Hollywood.

420
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,133
It's just...

421
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:41,303
No, I mean... his hair looks so silky,

422
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:44,839
and his legs are so slim.

423
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:50,201
I should treat him to a meal sometime.

424
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:52,673
We should eat too.

425
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,701
Since it's moving day,

426
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:57,920
do we have a Chinese place number or something?

427
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,754
Oh my.

428
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,493
Thank you.

429
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:08,797

00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,503
Hold on a second.

431
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,341
Hello?

432
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,581
Oh, I see.

433
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,680
How close together are the contractions?

434
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,825
Then, we won't need oxytocin.

435
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:31,519
I'll head over now.

436

Hey, Sol.

437
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,245
You said four people, right?

438
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:39,805
Five?

439
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:42,499
That's fine. Totally fine.

440
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:44,400
I've already taken care of everything,

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,668
so just show up.

442
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,714
Okay.

443
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:44,726
Did you fix your pants?

444
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:48,132
You didn't know, did you?

445
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,065
I'm staying next door.

446
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,504
Just a second.

447
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,968
Here it is.

448
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,814
Thank you so much.

449
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:10,667
The wind in Jeju

450
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,987
is no joke.

451
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,156
Yeah, the pants are fixed.

452
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:20,061
Luckily, someone at the lobby had a sewing kit.

453
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,616
You must be very handy.

454
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,006
Not really.

455

I just made sure

456
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,103
it looks decent, so it doesn't show.

00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,043

00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,886

Sorry?

00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,094

00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:25,701
but curry's different.

561
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:27,771
It should be mostly comfortable.

562
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,370
Why's that?

563
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,374
Curry's my comfort food.

564
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:37,400
Back when I was broke,
freezing, and scraping by as a musician,

565
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,247
I'd grab a 1,000-won curry powder packet,

566
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,968
throw in just potatoes

567
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:47,322
and onions, make a big batch,

568
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:48,567
and day two,

569
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:49,901
day three,

570
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,667
it tasted deeper,

571
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,562
and somehow even better.

572
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:00,067
Like it levels up overnight.

573
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:04,873
I formed this tiny fantasy.

574
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:06,141
What kind?

575
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,775
One night,

576
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,811
I come home wiped out

577
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,248
for no good reason,

578
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:18,619
and there she is, apron on,

579
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,655
stirring curry,

580
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,000
that smell taking over

581
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,727
the entire apartment.

582
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,001
Well...

583
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,902
That's a pretty simple wish.

584
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:37,805
But there's a catch.

585
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:41,067
The wife

586
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:44,245
has to have the apron on and nothing else.

587
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,711
- Ugh, you perv.
- You'll actually do it, right?

588
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:49,653
- Me?
- Yeah.

589
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,019
You're out of your mind.

590
00:44:53,054 --> 00:44:55,534
Please make my wish come true.

591
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:56,991
That's ridiculous.

592
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:09,537
I've never seen you laugh this easily.

593
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:14,509
You tagged along so I wouldn't hole up

594
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:16,177
in my room acting all tough, right?

595
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:18,313
Man, guiding must be such a grind.

596
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:20,381
Not at all.

597
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,150
I get to travel for free, as much as I want,

598
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,686
and they pay me too. It's honestly the best.

599
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:27,555
And the yacht ride is the most expensive add-on
in the whole package.

600
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:29,423
Oh, really?

601
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:41,168
Being somewhere this nice
makes me think of my husband.

602
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:45,426
We never got around to a yacht trip together.

603
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,025
You still can.

604
00:45:47,025 --> 00:45:49,476
There will be another chance.

605
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:53,814
I lost mine too. Ten years ago.

606
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:10,134
This tastes nothing like

607
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,169
what I used to eat in Seoul.

608
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,999
Try the turban shell too.

609
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:17,200
The haenyeo ladies pulled it
from the water right here.

610
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,089
"Too salty."

611
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,791
"Too spicy."

612
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,695
My wife used to get on me
about that all the time.

613
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:46,734
And now the one who only ate clean
isn't here anymore.

614
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:50,137
Funny how that works.

615
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:08,659
Hey, look over there.

616
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,617
See that group?

617
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:12,897
Yeah.

618
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,895
Keep this quiet, okay?

619
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:19,050
Their deal is a little different.

620
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,901
Different how?

621
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,450
It's the "Erase-It" package.

622
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,373
- Erase it?
- Shh.

623
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:32,883
They look cheerful,

624
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:37,217
but they're going through it.

625
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:41,923
They picked this

626
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:44,726
just to block it out for a bit.

627
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:46,461
When they head home,

628
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:50,064
real life's still waiting, exactly the same.

629
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:53,501
But while they're here,
they want a break from all of it.

630
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,634
So that's why

631
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:57,138
they're all in the same hats.

632
00:47:57,138 --> 00:47:59,033
- Exactly.
- Got it.

633
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:00,601
Look.

634
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:01,901
See that pair

635
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,434
in the denim shirts?

636
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,212
Right there?

637
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:06,247
- Taking pictures.
- Yeah.

638
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:08,716
Five years married.

639
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,721
Both have day jobs.

640
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,033
He learned

641
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:16,124
she'd been seeing a coworker.

642
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:20,128
They blow up at each other pretty much daily.

643
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:23,030
And nothing's resolved.

644
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,939
See?

645
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,338
They're switched to
"shut-it-off" mode right now.

646
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:34,808
I see.

647
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,167
And beside them,

648
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:40,782
that husband backed someone,

649
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:44,152
got wiped out, and now he's in the hole.

650
00:48:44,152 --> 00:48:46,380
The house is gone too.

651
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,165
What can he even do?

652
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:51,629
- That's so upsetting.
- Seriously.

653
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,527
It really is.

654
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:58,767
So the people over there

655
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:01,201
have stories like that too?

656
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,504
Exactly.

657
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:08,409
Try it once.

658
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:10,381
Huh? Try what?

659
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,546
Try it.

660
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:17,200
Ah...

661
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,919
come on...

662
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,255
No...

663
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:25,211
I can't do this.

664
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,694
Just say something.

665
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,030
Anything works.

666
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:34,568
That guy's

667
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:37,934
a civil servant, desk job.

668
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,725
Yeah.

669
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,367
Recently, he started

670
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:43,965
thinking about retiring

671
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:46,814
a little early.

672
00:49:47,615 --> 00:49:50,117
And then he just pulled the plug and resigned.

673
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:54,855
He wanted more time with his wife.

674
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,159
But his wife

675
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:02,529
got in a bad accident

676
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:07,105
and lost an arm.

677
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:08,194
Oh no.

678
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:10,204
That's so cruel.

679
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,377
After the accident,

680
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:21,582
she stopped smiling.

681
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:28,155
I think she's convinced

682
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,459
there's no hope left.

683
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,198
He's been

684
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:41,300
giving up

685
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,537
his time, his heart...

686
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:46,707
everything for her.

687
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:51,111
But he's exhausted.

688
00:50:53,514 --> 00:50:56,383
Sometimes he thinks,

689
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:59,620
"When will this end?"

690
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,059
Then he hates himself for even thinking that.

691
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:11,367
And the reason he traveled alone is...

692
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:13,066
Well...

693
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,077
Her arm looks fine.

694
00:51:23,077 --> 00:51:24,674
Sorry?

695
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:32,319
No one knows she wears a prosthetic arm.

696
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,887
Her arm itches.

697
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,625
It's like she forgets it's even prosthetic.

698
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:43,300
Did you write this just so I'd read it?

699
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,599
Huh?

700
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:46,600
Can you even hear how this sounds?

701
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,671
I mean...

702
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,734
We're past the age of stupidity.

703
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,408
If you'd used your phone,

704
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:56,477
or put in even the tiniest bit of effort,

705
00:51:56,477 --> 00:51:59,947
you wouldn't have
turned in something like this.

706
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:02,683
You know...

707
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:05,019
When everyone else got jobs after undergrad,

708
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:08,456
you came to grad school acting
like you had some grand academic calling.

709
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:10,601
Honestly, I don't care.

710
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:12,005
Yeah?

711
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:15,896
Do you even care about your own life
and where you're headed?

712
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,201
If you did, you wouldn't be doing this.

713
00:52:21,745 --> 00:52:25,239
But your poor parents must care a lot.

714
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:29,114
Geez...

715
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:32,679
Clueless that you're ruining your own life.

716
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,782
You poor thing.

717
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:45,135
That bastard.

718
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:47,444
Dragging my parents into it now?

719
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:50,331
Like he's so great.

720
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:51,932
Why not say it to his face?

721
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:55,025
This is straight-up disrespect.
Professor power trip stuff.

722
00:52:55,025 --> 00:52:56,334
So what?

723
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:58,171
You're going to sue him?

724
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,983
No.

725
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,213
I'll rewrite it and resubmit.

726
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,649
Fine.

727
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,823
When do I get to meet your boyfriend?

728
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:17,324
Why now?

729
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,028
Shouldn't you two go public already?

730
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,384
Like, make it official with everyone.

731
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:23,744
You're basically living together now.

732
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:26,300
It's not living together, I told you.

733
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:34,578
Are you not going out?

734
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,276
Pick up.

735
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:41,943
Hi, Do Hyun.

736
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:43,743
<i>You're finished, right?</i>

737
00:53:43,743 --> 00:53:45,357
<i>What should we do for dinner?</i>

738
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:46,178
Dinner?

739
00:53:46,178 --> 00:53:48,289
Hyeong Jun says he's making dakbokkeumtang.

740
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:51,225
How does that sound?

741
00:53:51,225 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>- Sorry?</i>
- No, he's...

742
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,762
Let's eat together!

743
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:57,331
- Hey.
- That sounds great.

744
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:58,817
Is that okay?

745
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:00,738
Please don't feel pressured to eat with them.

746
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,502
He's not much of a cook.

747
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:05,106
Lee Yeon, Ian.

748
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:07,010
Come and eat.

749
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:39,607
It's been ages since Jun Kyung dated anyone.

750
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:42,467
Sometimes she feels like our eldest daughter,

751
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:44,745
so I'm extra happy.

752
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,682
I heard you make music.

753
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,484
Yes.

754
00:54:50,484 --> 00:54:52,289
What kind of music do you do?

755
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:57,824
I don't really stick to one specific genre.

756
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,186
Then do you busk, like on the street?

757
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,599
Well...

758
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,641
if I had to label it,
it's more for film and video.

759
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,803
Oh, for video.

760
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:14,475
Anything we might recognize?

761
00:55:14,475 --> 00:55:17,210
Tell us what you've done.

762
00:55:19,434 --> 00:55:21,181
Something you'd know?

763
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,217
Well...

764
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:24,652
It doesn't have to be famous.

765
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:27,554
Just give us anything. We'll look it up.

766
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:30,457
Then...

767
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,794
how about this?

768
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:36,062
Do you know it?

769
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,308
I know this one!

770
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:58,085
This one has animals, right?

771
00:55:58,085 --> 00:56:00,954
They just met. How are they this close already?

772
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,091
Look at you.

773
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,327
What?

774
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,701
You barely know each other.

775
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,799
Do you like him that much?

776
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,869
Yeah, I like him.

777
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,501
Maybe I got my hopes up too much.

778
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:23,110
He's not drop-dead gorgeous or anything.

779
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,051
And it's not like his physique is insane.

780
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,125
So what is it? What's the reason?

781
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:32,806
Why did our worldly, ice-cold Jun Kyung

782
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,921
fall this hard?

783
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,664
Just because.

784
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:44,901
Just because?

785
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,033
Yeah.

786
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:47,623
I just like him.

787
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:55,709
Get home safe.

788
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:57,011
- I'll get the door.
- I'm off now.

789
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,309
Hyeong Jun.

790
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:59,680
You remember what I said, right?

791
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,781
Yeah, I remember.

792
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:03,350
Bye, Jun Kyung.

793
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,150
Bye.

794
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,919
Bye, Do Hyun.

795
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,470
So?

796
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,235
I'm against this relationship.

797
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,403
Why?

798
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:22,135
You were hitting it off with Do Hyun.

799
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:26,206
Do Hyun's too good for her.

800
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,376
He's wasted on Jun Kyung.

801
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,498
Honestly, I don't like it either.

802
00:57:32,498 --> 00:57:33,978
Why's that?

803
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:35,434
Because now,

804
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:37,985
whenever something fun happens,

805
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:41,235
she'll tell Do Hyun first, not me.

806
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:44,958
And when things go bad, she'll lean on Do Hyun.

807
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:51,932
<i>To be honest,</i>

808
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:54,668
<i>I was scared.</i>

809
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:56,870
<i>Of what?</i>

810
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:03,681
That I wouldn't fit in with someone like him.

811
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,346
Or that he wouldn't want to fit in with me.

812
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,418
Haven't I changed so much?

813
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,321
No.

814
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:17,494
You were always like that.

815
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,460
You're just back to being Seo Jun Kyung.

816
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,515
Really?

817
00:58:31,138 --> 00:58:32,741
What are you doing?

818
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:35,342
You're not even changed.

819
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:41,384
It's bedtime, and now I'm sobering up.

820
00:58:42,616 --> 00:58:45,919
I guess I got a little too excited today.

821
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:54,027
I think today will stick with me for a while.

822
00:58:56,009 --> 00:58:58,799
It was such a good day,

823
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,935
I almost feel like I don't deserve it.

824
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,212
Actually...

825
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:17,684
It hasn't been long since my mom passed away.

826
00:59:34,096 --> 00:59:35,869
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

827
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,127
I take after my mom a lot.

828
01:00:03,695 --> 01:00:05,865
But toward the end,

829
01:00:07,668 --> 01:00:10,136
we really grew

830
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:12,972
to resent each other.

831
01:00:21,048 --> 01:00:23,383
I never even got to say

832
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,419
I was sorry.

833
01:00:29,467 --> 01:00:31,524
We didn't make up.

834
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:36,096
It just ended.

835
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:50,710
Even if you never said it,

836
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:56,149
just carrying

837
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:03,323
that feeling,

838
01:01:03,323 --> 01:01:05,467
your mom

839
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:07,527
would say,

840
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,466
"It's okay."

841
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:40,727
What day do you remember most?

842
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:43,997
- What?
- Except the day we met.

843
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:00,079
Well...

844
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:06,653
The day I remember most...

845
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,863
is the day my son was born.
