00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,900
(Seo Hyun Jin)

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
(Yoo Jae Myung)

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,040
(Lee Si Woo)

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,970
(Yoon Se A)

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,270
(Chang Ryul)

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,300
(Dahyun)

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,940
(Love me)

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,300
(Hure: Prostitute)

9
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,140
(Aunt)

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,940
My gosh. Come on, stop it.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Goodness.

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,140
Mi Kyung.

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,540
Jin Ho, you weren't answering your phone.

14
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
Who are you?

15
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,770
Hello.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,970
- Mi Kyung. - I asked who you were!

17
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,500
I slept with Beom Jun.

18
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,440
What did you just say?

19
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,300
What are you sorry for?

21
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,300
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

22
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,470
What?

23
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,970
You're sorry you didn't tell me sooner?

24
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,970
For not telling me sooner?

25
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,200
If you told me you were cheating, would it have been okay?

26
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,500
Would that have been okay?

27
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,110
How could you do this?

28
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,440
It hasn't even been that long since my sister died.

29
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,670
This is unbelievable. It hasn't been long since she died!

30
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
So...

31
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,110
You two were carrying on like this before she died?

32
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,400
- She knew, didn't she? - Mi Kyung, come on.

33
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Let go of me!

34
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,670
My sister decorated this house.

35
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,900
You were using the plates and bowls she used.

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,110
And her clothes are still in there, just as she left them.

37
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,700
How could you pull this kind of nonsense in this house?

38
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,110
- Honey, that's enough. - Does it look like I can just stop?

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,670
That wench was in my sister's house as if she lived here!

40
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,200
Mi Kyung, I'm sorry.

41
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,140
But don't call Ja Yeong a wench. She's a good person.

42
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,140
I care for her.

43
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,170
You should have just lied...

44
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,870
and said it was nothing.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,870
That there was nothing between you two.

46
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,940
You really should have just lied...

47
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
No.

48
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,570
Why was I feeling sorry for a lowlife like him?

49
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Honey!

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm...

51
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm such an idiot!

52
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,040
Darn it!

53
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,340
- Come on, honey. - Let go of me!

54
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,640
Fine, break it. Smash it all to pieces.

55
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,600
Darn it. Come on!

56
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,900
How can everyone be so selfish,

57
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,100
so completely self-absorbed?

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,440
Maybe we should just ignore each other...

59
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,140
and live like strangers. Don't you think that's for the best?

60
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,540
Just like we used to.

61
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,370
Jun Kyung.

62
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't say that.

63
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,500
Just because we're family,

64
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,399
we're expected to know, understand,

65
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
be patient, and fight over everything.

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm just so sick of it.

67
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
You feel the same way, Dad.

68
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,670
Don't you?

69
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
What about you?

70
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,900
Is that what you think too?

71
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Was that...

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,370
really so wrong of me?

73
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,740
No. Let's hurry up.

74
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
- Hey, what's going on? - Hey.

75
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,300
- Sorry. - Sorry about that.

76
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,570
- Come on. - Hey, guys.

77
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,670
Excuse me.

78
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,370
One moment.

79
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,770
That'll be nine dollars.

80
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,270
Oh, my gosh!

81
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,700
You've finally lost your mind.

82
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
What are you doing here?

83
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,640
- Hey! - What?

84
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,040
Good grief. You reek of alcohol.

85
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,640
Hey. You little punk, get up.

86
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,440
Just because you've finally done something with your life,

87
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,300
you couldn't wait to go get wasted.

88
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,169
Gosh, you're heavy.

89
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,570
Come on. Darn.

90
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,370
No, come on. Yes, that's it. That's good.

91
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,340
(Spicy Ramyeon)

92
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,040
You're getting better.

93
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,870
Did you feed the fish this morning?

94
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Yes.

95
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,070
Daniel, he's your friend, so feeding him is your job now.

96
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,970
Got it? Three times a day. Don't give a lot.

97
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,670
Okay.

98
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,370
What did you decide to name him?

99
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Oscar.

100
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,140
Oscar?

101
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
That's a cool name.

102
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,370
When we thought spring's yellow dust was behind us,

103
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,140
many are now expressing their frustration...

104
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,300
with the recent spike in fine dust levels.

105
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,800
Today, the forecast calls for cloudy skies across the country,

106
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,900
with scattered showers expected depending on the region.

107
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,870
So you can expect much-needed rain to clear the stifling air.

108
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Hello?

109
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Who's calling?

110
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
What's the plan for today?

111
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,900
Skateboarding again?

112
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,940
It's supposed to rain today.

113
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,770
Want me to take you to Grandma's?

114
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,570
It's awkward.

115
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Hey, listen.

116
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm going to see Jun Kyung later.

117
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Do you want to come with me?

118
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
No.

119
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,770
Okay.

120
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,970
You'll make plenty of friends when you start school this fall.

121
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm...

122
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm fine.

123
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,300
Why is everything always just fine with you?

124
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,670
Because I really am fine.

125
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,970
My gosh.

126
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,500
You have no idea how happy it makes me...

127
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,170
that you're here...

128
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,140
to spend time with me.

129
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,470
- Come on, honey. - Let go of me!

130
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,070
Fine, break it. Smash it all to pieces.

131
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,200
("Mrs Dalloway")

132
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,799
(General Garbage Prohibited)

133
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,970
(Household Garbage)

134
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,970
So you're saying you dropped it when you were visiting Unit 703?

135
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,170
- Yes. - Please take a look.

136
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,910
See if anything's missing.

137
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,300
Is it all there?

138
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,370
Yes.

139
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,070
Thank you so much.

140
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,840
- Hey, Do Hyun. - Hey, Jun Kyung. Have you eaten?

141
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,040
Yes. I just did.

142
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,140
Are you aware that it's supposed to rain today?

143
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Is that right?

144
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,440
So I think we should have a drink at your place tonight.

145
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,239
Everyone knows...

146
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,410
we must eat savoury pancakes and drink makgeolli on a rainy day.

147
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,970
I'll come pick you up later.

148
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,800
No, it's okay. I just...

149
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,240
I might end up working late.

150
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,440
In that case, I'll just head over to your place first.

151
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,340
I can get started on the pancakes or something.

152
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,300
All right, then.

153
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,300
- Jun Kyung? - Yes?

154
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,670
Make today a happy one.

155
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,800
Okay. You too, Do Hyun.

156
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,240
All right, see you later.

157
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,870
Okay.

158
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,640
You startled me.

159
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,070
Mom, you know that trick I was telling you about?

160
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,000
I can make it 3 times out of 10 now.

161
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,600
Really? Send me a video. I'll have to see it to believe it.

162
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,170
Okay. I'll ask Dad to film it and send it to you right away.

163
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,340
So are you and Dad getting along?

164
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Yes.

165
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,140
We're getting along well.

166
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
It's fun.

167
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,070
That's a relief.

168
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,940
Mom, guess what?

169
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm really good with chopsticks now.

170
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,040
Sweetie, I have to go now. Let's talk again soon.

171
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,410
Okay.

172
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,270
My dad's not here.

173
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
I know.

174
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,770
This.

175
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,370
You know where I found this, don't you?

176
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,770
So what makes me a prostitute?

177
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,600
I don't want to see you anymore. Got it?

178
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,600
And don't you say another word.

179
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,100
I hate people like you.

180
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,240
So piss off.

181
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,410
And don't you ever come back here.

182
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
You...

183
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're a real coward.

184
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
(Eternal Love)

185
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,370
- No way, you made a move on her? - What do you take me for?

186
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,500
Darn, all right, I'll give you that. Man, you've got game.

187
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,000
She told that loser yesterday.

188
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,400
- So they finally broke up. - Really?

189
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,440
You startled me.

190
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Well,

191
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,040
what's it to you anyway?

192
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,540
Yes, you're right.

193
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,040
It's none of my business.

194
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,500
Darn it.

195
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,870
Come on. Look at this.

196
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,470
I just bought this yesterday. This is so annoying.

197
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,340
I know for a fact that Hye On is the most meticulous...

198
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,840
at proofreading.

199
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,400
I just can't seem to pick up on these typos.

200
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,670
Either I was ignorant,

201
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,499
or I just missed them...

202
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,900
even though I came across them.

203
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
But you know...

204
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,600
the 5th line on Page 37...

205
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,200
That's not a typo.

206
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,499
It said, "She finds him agonizing," but shouldn't it be "misses him?"

207
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,200
As you know from reading it,

208
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,940
the characters don't even understand their own feelings.

209
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,140
Besides, they're in no position to express themselves.

210
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,170
He's a fool, and she's an even bigger fool.

211
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,500
She can't stop worrying.

212
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,640
It drives her crazy just thinking about him.

213
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,100
So she gets so angry that she could just burst.

214
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,940
Can a feeling like that...

215
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,840
be summed up as just missing someone?

216
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,400
(She finds him agonizing.)

217
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,940
I think "agonizing" is more like it.

218
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,870
What about you, Hye On?

219
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Is there anyone you like?

220
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
At her age,

221
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,870
do you really think she'd agonize over someone?

222
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,900
At most, she'd probably just miss them a little.

223
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,499
That's not true. For all we know,

224
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,840
she may have had every relationship she ever wanted.

225
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,940
Or maybe,

226
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,070
she didn't realise it was love, so she never pursued it.

227
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,640
Wait a minute. This is totally...

228
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,140
your own story, Writer Jeong.

229
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,540
So what if it is?

230
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,370
You're saying you were that innocent?

231
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,100
Innocent? No, I was just an idiot.

232
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,070
Missing someone is just a feeling,

233
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,140
but when that feeling turns into agony,

234
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,300
you start to feel it physically.

235
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
It was really nagging and irritating at first,

236
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,740
but later, it actually ached.

237
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,440
- It ached? - Yes. You've never experienced it?

238
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,800
No. Don't ask.

239
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,470
- You've lived a boring life then. - I said don't ask. I haven't.

240
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,240
I slept with Beom Jun.

241
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,500
I'm sorry, Jun Seo.

242
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
Okay.

243
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,670
It's all been arranged,

244
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,470
so do a good job. Don't make me look bad.

245
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,070
Got it?

246
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Pardon?

247
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,870
What's on your mind? Are you even listening to me?

248
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,770
Professor Song.

249
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,670
I can't do it.

250
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
What?

251
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,670
I don't think any of it matters anymore.

252
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,370
Ja Yeong,

253
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,500
I've left home.

254
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
You what?

255
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,500
You'll let me stay, won't you?

256
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,670
I know I saw you yesterday, but it's good to see you again, Bom.

257
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,700
This is terrible timing.

258
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,970
I have to leave for a meeting with a travel agency right now.

259
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,140
I'll be back soon. Please feel at home and rest.

260
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,069
Don't worry, I'll watch Bom.

261
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,040
- You should go to the meeting. - Okay.

262
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you want a ride?

263
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,040
They said it was going to rain, but the weather is perfect.

264
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,300
Ja Yeong, after your meeting,

265
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,370
do you want to go for a drive?

266
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,900
- This... - Oh, the side mirror?

267
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,100
It's fine. I can get it fixed. It's a quick fix.

268
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,700
My sister-in-law...

269
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,470
She's a bit of a hothead.

270
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,370
A side mirror can be fixed,

271
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,940
but not her heart.

272
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,970
It's not so easy to mend.

273
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
It's fine.

274
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,640
What about your daughter?

275
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,370
What did she say?

276
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,970
Jin Ho.

277
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,600
Are you really sure you're okay?

278
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm telling you. I'm really fine.

279
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,640
Everything looks normal.

280
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,540
I'll see you at your next appointment.

281
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,770
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

282
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,370
Bye.

283
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,099
I'm free until 5pm, right?

284
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,240
- Let me take a 30-minute break. - Dr. Seo.

285
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,470
You have a visitor.

286
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,600
Over there.

287
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,640
I'm sorry to drop in unannounced.

288
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,570
Actually, I don't have your number.

289
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,300
- I just heard you worked here. - Did my dad send you?

290
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,540
No, I just...

291
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,340
came on my own.

292
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,870
Aren't you embarrassed?

293
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,670
Is this something I should be...

294
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,970
- embarrassed about? - Shouldn't you be?

295
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,270
Especially after a scene like that.

296
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,340
I know I would be.

297
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,470
How long will it take...

298
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,040
until a situation like this stops feeling awkward?

299
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,340
Jin Ho and I...

300
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,370
We might break up someday.

301
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
But if we do, it will be because of an issue between us,

302
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,270
not because of his family.

303
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
What's your point?

304
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,940
I just like Jin Ho.

305
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,940
I'm not trying to join your family or play mom.

306
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,440
So I thought none of it mattered.

307
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,939
So?

308
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,540
But it doesn't matter to your family...

309
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,740
what kind of person I am...

310
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,970
or how Jin Ho and I feel about each other.

311
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,870
I realise now how selfish I have been.

312
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,000
That's what I came to say.

314
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,940
("Mrs Dalloway")

315
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,570
Honey.

316
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,970
Yes?

317
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm sorry.

318
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,170
For what?

319
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
For everything.

320
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,270
You're getting better.

321
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,400
Everything's going to be okay.

322
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,040
But don't I smell something burning?

323
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,940
Oh, no. The sauce. Oh, dear.

324
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,140
I have to start over. Oh, no. I can't believe this.

325
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,770
("Mrs Dalloway")

326
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,810
I wasn't sure if I should celebrate our 35th anniversary...

327
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,100
or feel sorry for it.

328
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
I just didn't know what to do.

329
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Instead,

330
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,640
I've decided to be grateful.

331
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,340
For 37 years,

332
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,670
you've always been the same.

333
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,900
The kind smile you give me.

334
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,640
The smell of your bland cooking.

335
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,370
The clumsy sounds you make when you move around.

336
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:00,500
The way you talk and laugh at your own unfunny jokes.

337
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,900
I...

338
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,670
I love all of you.

339
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,170
Honey.

340
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,400
Today is...

341
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,740
our 35th wedding anniversary.

342
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,600
Dad, do you need any help?

343
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,440
What? Perfect timing.

344
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Wash these for me.

345
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,440
I'll help too.

346
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,370
It's okay, Jun Kyung. Go sit down.

347
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,170
("Mrs Dalloway")

348
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,040
I should have known how you'd feel about someone like me.

349
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,200
I was thoughtless.

350
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,770
At the very least, you just needed some time.

351
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
But not my time.

352
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,740
But time for yourself and your family.

353
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,140
I was the most selfish one.

354
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,940
I convinced myself only I was struggling.

355
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,000
I cried out that I was the only one who was hurt.

356
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,970
Aren't you embarrassed?

357
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,500
I was her.

358
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,440
And I was Daniel too.

359
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,040
So who was I to resent anyone or call him a coward?

360
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Seo Jun Kyung.

361
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,310
You're so pathetic.

362
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,240
You're here.

363
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,900
You got caught in the rain?

364
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,570
Come on, you should have called if you didn't have an umbrella.

365
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,940
I just wanted to get rained on.

366
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,310
But why?

367
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,170
Yoon Sol.

368
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,000
Yoon Sol!

369
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,470
I can't break up with you.

370
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,700
We're done talking.

371
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,040
- You might be done, but I'm not. - Hey, Seo Jun Seo!

372
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,470
Let's go talk outside.

373
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,310
- I have nothing to say, Jun Seo. - Well, I do.

374
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,940
Just stop!

375
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,239
Sol said she was done talking to you.

376
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,470
Who are you to butt in?

377
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,270
If you broke up, be an adult. Stop being so pathetic.

378
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,540
Hey, you stop it too.

379
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
What a loser.

380
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,869
- You piece of trash. - I said, stop it!

381
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,270
- You loser. - You!

382
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,040
- You little... - Come at me.

383
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,870
- I'll kill you. Let go. - Call the cops.

384
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,199
- Go on, call the cops! - I told you to let go!

385
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,440
Let go, you jerk.

386
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,900
Hey, he bit me.

387
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,640
What are you doing?

388
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,170
I told you to stop it!

389
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,939
- Oh, no. What should we do? - I'm okay.

390
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,600
Oh, no. Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

391
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,170
You think it's that bad?

392
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,669
- Darn. What should I do? - That must hurt a lot.

393
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,040
You!

394
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,500
What are you doing here?

395
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,440
What happened to your face?

396
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Go beg the professor's forgiveness and say you'll take the offer.

397
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,770
What kind of idiot throws away a chance like that over a breakup?

398
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,700
You think your life is over now?

399
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,000
Why would you go over there just to get a beating like this?

400
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,600
If my face looks like this,

401
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,770
you should see the other guy.

402
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,970
I beat him to a pulp. A complete pulp.

403
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,600
So...

404
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,840
do you feel better now?

405
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
No.

406
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,640
I'm miserable.

407
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Gosh, it hurts.

408
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,870
So you can feel pain?

409
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,440
I'm in agony.

410
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
Hey.

411
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,740
Why are you crying?

412
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,100
- Why? - Because I'm in agony.

413
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,400
Why are you in agony?

414
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,310
Because I like you.

415
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,810
The fact that I like someone like you,

416
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,500
a stupid, pathetic idiot, is absolute torture.

417
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
What?

418
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,810
I'm saying...

419
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,270
I like you.

420
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,970
Jun Kyung, you have a fever.

421
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,370
I made some porridge. Be sure to eat and take medicine.

422
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,270
Why aren't you eating?

423
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,800
It's getting cold.

424
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,770
Mom.

425
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm just the worst.

426
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,340
I'm pathetic,

427
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,340
cowardly, and just plain mean.

428
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,370
I think Soo Jin was right. I'm just a cold-hearted person.

429
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,670
The day we first brought Jun Seo home,

430
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,700
you were so fascinated by him. So you just kept staring.

431
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,240
You don't remember, do you?

432
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,870
So when I asked you why, you said...

433
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,470
Because he's so cute.

434
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,200
So I said, "Go on. Pat him gently..."

435
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,570
"and tell him he looks beautiful."

436
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,670
Do you know what you did then?

437
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,569
You said your hands were too cold.

438
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,899
You were worried...

439
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,040
you might give him a cold if you touched him.

440
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,870
Jun Kyung.

441
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,170
You have such a warm heart.

442
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,200
- Really? - Of course.

443
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,570
I'm home.

444
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,600
Did you sleep over at a friend's?

445
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,840
Hey, you could've at least sent a text.

446
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,170
Hey.

447
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
What happened to your face?

448
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,100
I fell.

449
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,940
Have you been drinking?

450
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,370
No.

451
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,300
I was running down the subway stairs.

452
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,840
You should be more careful. What's all this?

453
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,499
It's fine. I put some ointment on it.

454
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,540
It's nothing, really.

455
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,000
- Seriously. - Gosh.

456
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,540
That must hurt.

457
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,840
Why did you suddenly wash Mom's clothes?

458
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,400
It's nice and sunny.

459
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Jun Seo.

460
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,340
Do you want to go see your mom?

461
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,900
Dad.

462
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,000
- Yes? - Here's your food.

463
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,870
Thank you.

464
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,100
I think I was a little too harsh the other day.

465
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,540
Not at all.

466
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,600
From your perspective,

467
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,900
you had every right to feel that way.

468
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,340
Anyway, I'm the one...

469
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,240
who should be sorry.

470
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,540
Does Jun Seo know?

471
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,140
If Jun Seo found out, he'd flip out, right?

472
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,800
Knowing him, yes. Probably.

473
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,369
You should find the right time to tell him...

474
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,140
and break the news gently.

475
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,000
The right time?

476
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,040
He must be on cloud nine right now.

477
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,700
Jun Seo? Did something good happen?

478
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm saying...

479
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,700
I like you.

480
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,040
I heard you got the research internship.

481
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,940
Yes.

482
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,870
I was bragging about you.

483
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,270
That you beat out all the master's and PhD candidates for the spot.

484
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,140
Congratulations. Seriously.

485
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,400
Hey, eat up, all right? Have some of these perilla leaves.

486
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,140
Actually,

487
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,240
I quit.

488
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,940
- Why? - Why?

489
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,300
It just sort of happened.

490
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,540
- Wait, why? - What? Why would you pass up...

491
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,270
a great opportunity like that? Why...

492
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,600
Sol and I broke up.

493
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,570
What?

494
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,100
I'm sorry, Dad.

495
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,270
I know how happy you were.

496
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,200
- No, I wasn't that... - What a dumb reason to...

497
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,570
You must have been really upset, Jun Seo.

498
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,740
Why'd you stop? Go on, lay into me like you normally would.

499
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,400
I totally deserve it.

500
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,170
Forget it.

501
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,600
The fact is, you earned that internship on your own merit.

502
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,540
That's a relief.

503
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,100
I was so worried about how I was going to tell you all.

504
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,640
I miss Bom.

505
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,940
Dad, isn't your friend going on a trip again soon?

506
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,800
You should bring Bom over again.

507
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,700
Who's Bom?

508
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,400
Dad's friend's dog.

509
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,440
Bom's owner isn't just my friend.

510
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,070
What?

511
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,440
She's my girlfriend's dog.

512
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,200
What?

513
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,700
We've been seeing each other for about two months.

514
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,500
And we've known each other for about three.

515
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,900
It's just...

516
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,999
Neither of us really made a move. We just fell for each other hard.

517
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Dad.

518
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,170
I don't think we need all the details.

519
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,640
Wait a minute. Your timing is pretty similar.

520
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,300
So are things still going well with the guy next door?

521
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,000
That's right. How are things with your guy?

522
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Well...

523
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,470
What?

524
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,270
Did you get dumped already?

525
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,640
The thing is...

526
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,340
The thing is, he actually...

527
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,870
has a son. He's in eighth grade.

528
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,840
- What? - What?

529
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,740
Hey! Watch out!

530
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Nobody move. Stay still.

531
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,140
- What? - Hold on.

532
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,439
Wait, so he was married?

533
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,039
Are you crazy? Why would I date a married man?

534
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,170
So he's not married? Thank goodness. That's a relief.

535
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,969
He's cute. A really sweet kid.

536
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:09,600
He's cute? Gosh, that's a relief too.

537
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,400
No! We're going to fall. Don't move! Stop!

538
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,140
- Don't even breathe. - Don't breathe.

539
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,970
We came to see Mom.

540
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,870
- And we almost saw her for real. - You little...

541
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,970
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

542
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
By the way, are you guys...

543
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,700
okay?

544
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,900
Yes, I'm fine.

545
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,740
I think I'm okay too.

546
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,570
- How about you, Dad? - Yes, I'm fine too.

547
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,240
As long as everyone's okay, that's a huge relief.

548
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,000
But look at us.

549
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,300
Are we actually okay?

550
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,140
- Hey, Jun Seo. - Yes?

551
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,870
Try turning the wheel just slightly to the left.

552
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,270
No, don't! Stop it. Just stay still.

553
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:06,770
(Love Me)

554
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,000
Was it something you did in the heat of the moment?

555
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,870
I felt like I owed you an apology.

556
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,370
My feelings are my problem, and I expect nothing from you.

557
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,440
So you don't have to say anything else.

558
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,070
I thought we were coming to the campsite for fun.

559
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,240
But I never imagined that we'd come here to buy it.

560
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,640
It's a house without its owner. It's filled only with memories.

561
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,040
I'm thinking of selling this house.

562
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,300
The kids will understand, right?

563
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,499
I want to get along with Daniel.

564
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,670
Why?

565
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,339
You don't think I can?

566
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,400
Daniel.

567
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,240
I don't like her.

568
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,040
Can't you break up with her?

569
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,670
Something about this spring feels unusually bitter.

570
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,000
Don't you think it's going to be an especially cruel one?
