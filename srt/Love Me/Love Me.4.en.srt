00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:04,170
How are you doing, Dad?

185
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,870
Oh, it's nice here.

186
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,229
Great weather, a breeze, the ocean.

187
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,776
<i>How about you?</i>

188
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,490
I'm at home with Jun Seo right now.

189
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,755
<i>Yeah?</i>

190
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:19,185
<i>That's really good.</i>

191
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,251
<i>So you're having dinner together then?</i>

192
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,463
But Dad...

193
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,096
Yes?

194
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,843
Hold on a second.

195
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,348
- Dad?
- Hi, Jun Seo.

196
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,750
I felt bad leaving without seeing you,

197
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,788
<i>but hearing your voice like this
makes me feel better.</i>

198
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,464
- Dad.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

199
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:53,344
I'm sorry about what happened before.

200
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:55,930
Have a good trip.

201
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,473
We don't want to ruin his day. Right?

202
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,804
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

203
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:19,643
They call just to check in,
even when nothing's wrong.

204
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:22,176
It's usually parents who worry like that.

205
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:24,590
Now that they're grown,
they're the ones worrying about me.

206
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,850
Sounds like your children turned out well.

207
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,596
They did.

208
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,656
My daughter is an OB-GYN,

209
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,756
and my son is in grad school.

210
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,862
They are so nice.

211
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,107
You must be proud.

212
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,916
But it's not that simple.

213
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,175
My son still hasn't found
what he truly loves to do,

214
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,389
and that worries me.

215
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,262
And my daughter hasn't found
someone she loves yet,

216
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:46,295
that worries me too.

217
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,369
When did we take that picture?

218
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,050
Was it the year you started college?

219
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,423
It was my orientation day.

220
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,050
A few months before Mom's accident.

221
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,782
It feels so awkward.

222
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:10,415
Why were we smiling like that?

223
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,301
You...

224
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:19,309
You look good.

225
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,482
Honey?

226
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:30,089
You know... thinking back,

227
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:34,089
our family wasn't that happy
even before Mom's accident.

228
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,935
But we weren't unhappy either.

229
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,470
Do you think so?

230
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,483
Right.

231
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,263
We were just... ordinary.

232
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,353
We...

233
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,456
No, I...

234
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:05,260
I think I blamed Mom for my unhappiness.

235
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:08,235
It was just my fault.

236
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:17,230
Geez, the power is out again.

237
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,072
- Hey.
- Yeah?

238
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,610
Do you think this ever happened
when Mom was alone?

239
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:50,022
<i>She must've been scared.</i>

240
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,593
<i>Yeah.</i>

241
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,566
<i>Probably lonely, too.</i>

242
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:05,699
Honey.

243
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,912
Why are you sitting in the dark?

244
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,586
Oh, the power is out.

245
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:23,110
There.

246
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,285
It's bright now.

247
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:28,718
Next time the lights go out, over there...

248
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,817
Honey.

249
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,260
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,926
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

251
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:46,056
Don't cry.

252
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,262
You were scared, weren't you?

253
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,830
I'm so sorry.

254
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,550
I'm sorry I came home late.

255
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,436
Honey, don't cry.

256
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:20,975
It wasn't too late.

257
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,760
I always had you

258
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,230
right by my side.

259
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,570
That's why I felt sorry every day,

260
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,876
and grateful every day.

261
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,916
- Honey.
- Don't cry.

262
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,609
Everyone is waiting for you outside.

263
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,056
You...

264
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,309
You look amazing today.

265
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,709
Huh?

266
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,436
That woman, Ja Yeong.

267
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,570
She's pretty.

268
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,662
She looks good with you.

269
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,469
Don't say that.

270
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:04,629
Don't hesitate anymore. Don't hold back.

271
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,470
You should

272
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,163
think about yourself,

273
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,970
and live for yourself.

274
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:19,636
I want you to be truly happy.

275
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,383
Okay.

276
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,550
Every single day...

277
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,216
be happy.

278
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,082
Honey.

279
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:34,083
Honey.

280
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,010
Honey.

281
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,685
Honey.

282
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,412
Honey.

283
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,258
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

284
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:12,560
Is there a tall, slim middle-aged man inside?

285
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,181
There's no one here.

286
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,039
Mr. Seo Jin Ho?

287
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,433
Mr. Seo Jin Ho?

288
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:31,819
Mr. Seo?

289
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:58,538
What are you doing here?

290
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:03,036
Did something happen?

291
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:10,846
You probably wouldn't understand

292
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,553
why I'm like this.

293
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,488
I feel like I'm the only one living well,

294
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,532
and that makes me feel so guilty.

295
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,465
It hurts so much.

296
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,153
It would be stranger
if you didn't feel that way.

297
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:34,297
No.

298
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:38,597
You've already gotten through it.

299
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:41,127
Someone weak like me...

300
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:43,060
these feelings...

301
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,179
you wouldn't really understand.

302
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,639
I understand you...

303
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:53,765
more than anyone else.

304
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,446
<i>My husband was always busy and distant.</i>

305
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:05,550
<i>Whenever he felt sorry,</i>

306
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,766
<i>he made me a promise</i>

307
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,513
<i>that when he retired,</i>

308
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:11,993
<i>we'd walk the pilgrimage trail together.</i>

309
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:14,957
<i>But he...</i>

310
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,471
<i>he never got to keep that promise.</i>

311
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,076
<i>I thought about it for a long time.</i>

312
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:25,603
<i>'What would it even mean to go alone?'</i>

313
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,429
<i>But in the end...</i>

314
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:32,642
<i>I went by myself.</i>

315
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,336
<i>Just like you.</i>

316
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:55,684
<i>Do you know what I packed when I left?</i>

317
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,423
<i>For the last day of the pilgrimage.</i>

318
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:05,430
<i>For that day...</i>

319
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:10,469
<i>I went from hospital to hospital,</i>

320
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,963
<i>collecting sleeping pills.</i>

321
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:40,276
<i>I poured all of them out,</i>

322
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:44,462
<i>and lay still on the bed.</i>

323
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:47,196
<i>And suddenly,</i>

324
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:49,763
<i>I felt so sorry for myself.</i>

325
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,215
<i>It wasn't that I wanted to live for my husband.</i>

326
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,626
<i>I just felt so pitiful,</i>

327
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,040
and my life felt so unbearably sad.

328
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:30,749
The life I still had left...

329
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:35,075
it felt too precious to give up.

330
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:48,009
Thank you.

331
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,135
That must've been hard to talk about.

332
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:53,186
I just wanted to say

333
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:56,972
your life is not over yet.

334
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,220
They say life is a festival.

335
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,976
Our festival isn't over yet.

336
00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:21,549
Would you like to go outside?

337
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,143
For our last song, we're taking requests.

338
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,300
If you have one...

339
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,080
How about a song your wife loves?

340
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:15,630
No.

341
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:18,833
Let's request a song you like, ma'am.

342
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,398
My name is Ja Yeong.

343
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,698
Jin Ja Yeong.

344
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,866
Alright, Ja Yeong.

345
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,882
Let's listen to a song you love together.

346
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,879
Aren't we kind of overdoing it?

347
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,596
I mean, coming all the way to pick him up?

348
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:36,366
We're not usually this kind of family.

349
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,312
Dad must've been so lonely traveling alone.

350
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,318
Yeah...

351
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:46,585
He probably was.

352
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:50,331
By the way...

353
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,666
Since when do you say the right thing?

354
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:55,533
Yeah, well.

355
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,579
Guess your conscience is kicking in.

356
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:00,706
You've been busy dating the guy next door, huh?

357
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,013
How long has it been now?

358
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,563
What...

359
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,021
I was waiting for a comeback. Why so quiet?

360
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,823
We really...

361
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:17,790
aren't the good family to each other.

362
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,270
Let's try.

363
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,283
Quietly, so no one notices.

364
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:27,116
Hey, Dad is here.

365
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,154
Watch your faces. For Dad.

366
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,974
Worry about yourself.

367
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:36,284
Everyone in our group
had such strong personalities.

368
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:37,784

Yeah. I get it.

501

When she said we should take it slow,

502
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,663
I thought... okay.

503
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,936
I'll wait for the right moment.

504
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:27,007

You really liked her.

507
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:56,611
Then,

00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:59,011
why don't you just reach out again?

509

We're already over.

510
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,473

She said she was pregnant.

00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:08,322
Suddenly,

526
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:15,315
the idea of having a child...

527
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:19,221
honestly...

528
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,701
it scared me.

529
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:29,515
The moment

530
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:31,248
I saw his face...

531
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,016
I felt overwhelmed,

532
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,256
and touched,

533
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,290
I was like...

534
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,843
strangely moved.

535
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,110
That's how I felt.

536
00:45:53,842 --> 00:45:55,802
But,

537
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:57,868
we were already over,

538
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,615
and trying to go back

539
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,750
just out of responsibility...

540
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:09,290
that wasn't possible.

541
00:46:11,624 --> 00:46:15,143
My ex took the baby
and went to Germany to study.

542
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:18,655
We got back in touch

543

546
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:33,881
He wanted to live in Korea.

547
00:46:37,054 --> 00:46:38,574
So,

548
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:42,640
after 14 years,

549
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,340

00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,147
Daniel.

552
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:13,099
Im Daniel.

553
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:15,750
He's 15.

554
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:18,136
And really tall.

555
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:23,451
He's at that cynical teenage phase, huh?

556
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,187
Yeah.

557
00:47:28,187 --> 00:47:29,746
It really is.

558
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:33,505
That tiny little kid...

559
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,120
while he was growing up...

560
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,259
I couldn't do anything for him.

561
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:51,778
That's it.

562
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:54,905
That's my excuse.

563
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:58,878
What I really wanted to say to you...

564
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,645
with no excuses...

565
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:09,435
is that...

566
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,970
I'm truly sorry.

567
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,123
I already forgave you.

568
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:25,563
From the moment I saw your face earlier.

569
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:43,941
Oh, there's something I want to give you.

570
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:52,011
Wait, did you have this?

571
00:48:58,093 --> 00:49:00,145
If we hadn't broken up,

572
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,045
you'd still be listening to music
from just one side, forever.

573
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:15,396
Thanks to you,
we didn't have to pay for the game.

574
00:49:15,396 --> 00:49:17,403
I feel bad for everyone else, though.

575
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:20,996
You don't look that sorry.
You were trying pretty hard.

576
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:23,494
I'm not usually competitive,

577
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,837
but tonight, I really didn't want to lose.

578
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,294
Really? Why?

579
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:30,406
I don't mind losing on my own,
but you would've lost too.

580
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:34,366
- You are so nice.
- Oh, come on.

581
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:36,414
I'm serious.

582
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:38,987
You're tall for your age,

583
00:49:38,987 --> 00:49:41,322
no belly or anything.

584
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:43,129
I'm sucking it in right now.

585
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:46,262
If you just dyed the gray a bit...

586
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:50,762
you'd probably look younger than me.

587
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,633
You said it'd been ten years since you bowled.

588
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:56,229
How were you that good?

589
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:59,142
I try hard not to forget, that's all.

590
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:04,056
When things are tough, I try to forget,

591
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:06,536
and when things are good,

592
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,347
I try not to.

593
00:50:08,347 --> 00:50:10,680
Does that really work whenever you want it to?

594
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:15,398
Are you curious?

595
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:17,423
Is this really okay?

596
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,769
What is?

597
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:22,855
Me coming over like this,
to a woman living alone.

598
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:26,675
You're not...

599
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,441
getting any weird ideas, are you?

600
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:31,141
What?

601
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:33,568
No, don't misunderstand.

602
00:50:57,131 --> 00:50:59,498
Oh! You scared me.

603
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:01,839
This is Bom.

604
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,273
Hello?

605
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:05,716
- I didn't scare her, did I?
- Not at all.

606
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:09,329
Did you have fun today? Say hello to him.

607
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:12,209
This place used to be a pool hall.

608
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:15,054
With my work and my personality,
I move around a lot.

609
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:18,069
I never needed a place that felt like home.

610
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:21,089
Kind of unusual, right?

611
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:23,496
No.

612
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,519
I think it's really wonderful.

613
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,326
It kind of feels like...

614
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,479
a hideout.

615
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:54,453
You really are

616
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,906
an incredible person.

617
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:04,593
Some people buy souvenirs,

618
00:52:04,593 --> 00:52:06,477
take pictures,

619
00:52:06,477 --> 00:52:09,059
and post them on social media.

620
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,059
But I just...

621
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:12,872
draw.

622
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,830
The things I want to remember,

623
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,434
the way they felt,

624
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,405
the people I met
and the conversations we shared.

625
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:22,331
So I don't forget them.

626
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:26,233
That's how I remember things.

627
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,946
What do you want to remember right now?

628
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,339
May I see it?

629
00:52:40,479 --> 00:52:42,652
- Yes.
- Thank you.

630
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,510
Oh.

631
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:57,296
It still has a long way to go.

632
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,415
Are you really Seo Jun Seo?

633
00:53:27,135 --> 00:53:29,415
- What?
- What is that?

634
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,582
Are you being punished or something?

635
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,789
- Doesn't suit me, right?
- Yeah. Not at all.

636
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:36,529
Sol bought it for me.

637
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:38,953
It really doesn't suit you.

638
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,879
I thought so too.

639
00:53:48,374 --> 00:53:51,341
Why are you two dating if you don't even match?

640
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:55,041
Because I like her.

641
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,881
Because she's pretty, right?

642
00:53:57,845 --> 00:53:59,575
Well...

643
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:00,952
She is cool.

644
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:03,602
She knows what she wants.

645
00:54:03,602 --> 00:54:05,855
She does everything well.

646
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:10,309
So why would she like me?

647
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:12,375
A loser like me.

648
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,468
How are you a loser?

649
00:54:17,566 --> 00:54:19,446
You're cool too.

650
00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:22,006
Seriously?

651
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,452
In what way?

652
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:32,075
She is always busy,

653
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:34,658
always making you anxious.

654
00:54:34,658 --> 00:54:38,299
That skinny girl.
I don't even think she's that pretty.

655
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:40,559
But you're always on her side.

656
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,718
Yeah, that's what makes you a cool guy.

657
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,377
What are you doing?

658
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:55,680
What does it matter if you think I'm cool?

659
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,454
Sol is the one who needs to think so.

660
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:59,560
Why can't it be me?

661
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:03,267
Let's stop.

662
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,014
See you later.

663
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:23,109
Dad?

664
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:34,424
A grandma in my sister's village raised Bom.

665
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:38,355
She passed away, and Bom was left alone.

666
00:55:38,355 --> 00:55:39,869
That's awful.

667
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,275
I was lonely, so I took her in.

668
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:48,162
But she spends more time
at doggy daycare than with me.

669
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:50,349
I keep telling myself I'm busy,

670
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:52,789
and I think it's making her feel lonely.

671
00:55:56,884 --> 00:56:00,430
Is the man in that drawing your husband?

672
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,974
Never.

673
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:05,660
Yeah? That's a relief.

674
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:09,867
He was a guest on a couples tour,

675
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,758
and he kept hitting on me.

676
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:16,430
I mean, his wife was right there.
What was he even thinking?

677
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,120
It was a cruise,
so there was nowhere to escape.

678
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,097
It was really uncomfortable and upsetting.

679
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:26,317
I drew him so I could curse him for life.

680
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,567
What the...

681
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,672
That guy is a total jerk.

682
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:33,057
A married creep, seriously.

683
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,541
Oh, you swear too?

684
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,812
Anyone with common sense would.

685
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,623
He is a bastard.

686
00:56:49,124 --> 00:56:50,755
- You can take the call.
- Okay.

687
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,468
[My Son]

688
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:57,102
Hey, Jun Seo.

689
00:56:57,102 --> 00:56:58,127
What?

690
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:00,356
Oh, is it that late already?

691
00:57:00,356 --> 00:57:01,446
Yeah.

692
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:04,207
I'm just hanging out with friends.

693
00:57:04,207 --> 00:57:07,856
Okay. I'll head home soon, don't worry.

694
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:09,842
I'm coming now.

695
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:11,689
I said I'm on my way.

696
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,255
Bye.

697
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,867
You should probably go home.

698
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,067
Yeah.

699
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:29,552
We're out of drinks anyway,

700
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:31,793
and it's pretty late.

701
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,070
Hey, Bom.

702
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:55,258
I'm heading out now.

703
00:57:55,258 --> 00:57:58,437
Hope we can see each other again.

704
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,051
Take care.

705
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:04,144
I'll get going.

706
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:06,907
Do you want to stay the night?

707
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,839
Weren't you heading home?

708
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,192
I felt like I needed another drink,

709
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,805
so I stopped by the convenience store.

710
00:58:51,202 --> 00:58:52,641
Is it really...

711
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:56,877
Is it okay if I stay over?

712
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,444
- Doesn't she have a lover?
- Yeah, but he is not a good boy for Sol.

713
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,925
He's some grad school loser.

714
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:46,165
So I'd shoot my shot.

715
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,864
- I want to say it's true love, but...
- Call the cops!

716
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:51,531
Do you think I'll be in Sol's future?

717
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:55,326
I was scared that people might notice

718
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:56,933
how much I like you.

719
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:58,916
Do you really think Julia would want to see

720
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,779
you beating yourself up like this?

721
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:02,610
You don't need to blame yourself.

722
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,875
I'm done worrying about
what other people think.

723
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:08,379
Dad?

724
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:10,312
What was that?

725
01:00:10,312 --> 01:00:11,696
Hello.

726
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:15,186
Daniel, I want you
to get to know my girlfriend.

727
01:00:15,186 --> 01:00:16,784
You're cooking? That's new.

728
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:19,544
Why are you being so nice to him?

729
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:22,103
She is insane.

730
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,066
Sorry, Jun Kyung.

731
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:27,676
What? Did you already get dumped?
