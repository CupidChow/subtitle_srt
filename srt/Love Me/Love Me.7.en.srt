Dad's heading out.

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,920
Okay.

10
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,960
Feed Oscar for me.

11
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,270
All right, you have fun.

12
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,610
Oscar, why are you so down?

13
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,850
Are you hungry?

14
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,130
Daniel, you...

15
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,940
Oscar's food...

16
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,680
I don't like her.

17
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,390
Dad.

18
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,430
Can't you break up with her?

19
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
If you don't,

20
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,080
maybe I should go back to Mom's?

21
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,330
I used to feel so tired but fulfilled after my shift.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,230
I've been walking on eggshells around the director.

23
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
It feels uneasy.

24
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
I know, right? We have so few expecting mothers.

25
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,810
I've been enjoying the downtime, actually.

26
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,780
Hey, if you're not busy, that means we're overstaffed.

27
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Especially us.

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm feeling kind of blah, and I've got so much pent-up energy.

29
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,220
What do you say we go out for a team dinner?

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,749
- Sounds great!
- I'm in!

31
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,389
- Count me in.
- So where are we going?

32
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,890
- I'm feeling grilled intestines.
- What? I'm craving lamb skewers.

33
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,030
- How many rounds are we going for?
- Hi, Do Hyun.

34
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,530
- At least three rounds!
- Then lamb skewers for round one.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,800
- What?
- Yes, I just got off work.

36
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,530
Sashimi sounds good too.

37
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,700
- Do Hyun, are you drunk this early?
- What's going on?

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,400
This is bad.

39
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
Do Hyun.

40
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Are you okay?

41
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,930
Want to walk for a bit?

43
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,580
"I'm fine."

44
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,450
"I'm fine."

45
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,650
All he ever said was "I'm fine."

46
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,860
But...

47
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,690
there's no way it could be fine.

48
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,760
That should have been obvious.

49
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,970
I really had no idea.

50
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,970
Of course you wouldn't know.

51
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,580
No one ever knows things like that.

52
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,110
They don't say a word or give any sign...

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,920
because they're desperately trying to hide it.

54
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,430
I...

55
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
want to get along with Daniel.

56
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,910
Why?

57
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,540
You don't think I can?

58
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,110
No.

59
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
It's just that...

60
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,420
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

61
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,890
Let me handle it.

62
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,530
Daniel has his own pace and his own way of doing things.

63
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know when that will be or what it will take,

64
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,370
but I'll just have to watch closely for an opening.

65
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,510
And who knows? It might happen sooner than expected.

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,620
Seriously, I...

67
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,890
Jun Kyung...

68
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,560
I never expected you to say that.

69
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,830
Daniel's feelings...

70
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,010
I can't control them,

71
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,680
and this is going to be hard on you too.

72
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,110
"What if you decide to leave me?"

73
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,090
"What if you abandon me?" I was worried like that.

74
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Goodness, spoken like a true artist.

75
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,860
So dramatic.

(Catholic Church)

77

Two single adults, a man and a woman,

78
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,910
spent the night together.

79
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,340
Consensually.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,050
What seems to be the problem?

81
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Well...

82
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,790
- It's not so much a problem...
- Was it just a one-night stand?

83
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,060
No, I wouldn't call it a one-night stand.

84
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,030
Then it's love, I suppose.

85
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,630
Well...

86
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,600
- I wouldn't say it's love...
- Well...

87
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,210
Brother, what is troubling you the most right now?

88
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,280
We first met back in kindergarten, you see.

89
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,110
So?

90
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,350
What I'm trying to say is,

91
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,290
what if this goes wrong and ruins our 20-year friendship?

92
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,890
- That's what I'm worried about.
- So what if it's ruined?

93
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,890
Sorry?

94
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,030
I said, so what if your precious 20-year friendship gets ruined?

95
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
Well...

96
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,770

98
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,710
Hey, come on out.

99
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
Sorry?

100
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,390
I said, come out.

101
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,330
Aren't you a little old to be getting beaten up like this?

102
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,370
I didn't get beaten up, Father.

103
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,200
- This was an act of retribution.
- Good grief.

104
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,810
You really are your father's son, aren't you?

105
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,810
What?

106
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,750
Just drop the "Father." Talk to me like you used to.

107
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,920
All right, Chang Sik.

108
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Right, so...

109
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,920
This is one of those "between love and friendship" things, isn't it?

110
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,160
The classic, boring dilemma.

111
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,360
You can't just sum up our relationship that simply.

112
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,130
Back when we were in school,

113
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,400
you remember what was up with me and Jun Kyung, right?

114
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,270
Could you even call that a "thing"?

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
If I had to put a label on it,

116
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,910
you chased my uninterested sister and told everyone she was your girl,

117
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,150
until my mom threw a bucket of water on you. That "thing"?

118
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Back in the prime of my passionate youth,

119
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,390
I wonder why I gave up on Jun Kyung, instead of enduring the humiliation.

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
What?

121
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,430
Back then, I chose friendship.

122
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,930
I was torn between love and friendship.

123
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes, right. Some "great friendship" that was.

124
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,410
Hey...

125
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,910
- You were never my sister's type...
- Shut it.

126
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,020
Friendship, my foot.

127
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,180
I just didn't have the courage or the confidence.

128
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,990
It was a loser's excuse, plain and simple.

129
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
Are you sure you don't actually like her?

130
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,830
If you don't like her, why are you agonizing over it?

Gosh, what a jerk.

134
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Listen up!

135
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,840
I know this is sudden,

136
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,450
but our marketer, Beom Jun, just quit on the spot.

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,550
He feels bad for leaving so suddenly so he's treating us all tonight.

138
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,990
Let's all get together after work,

139
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,660
so he can show off how rich he is before he leaves.

140
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,990
He said he's buying the good stuff!

141
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,300
See you all later! I'll treat you to something good!

142
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,170
How cool is that?

Quitting his job for love and heading to Europe indefinitely.

144
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,280
I wish I were your age again, Beom Jun.

145
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,850
Come on, Chief. It's not too late for you.

146
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,850
- I lack the guts and the ability.
- Ability has nothing to do with it.

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,390
That's only for guys like him who treat work like a hobby.

148
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,060
So where in Europe are you going?

149
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,590
She said she wanted to visit Estonia,

150
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
so I think we'll start with the three Baltic states.

151
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,330
The Baltic states? I've only read about them in books.

152
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Where are the Baltic states?

153
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,040
- So he's really going?
- She's actually going?

154
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,110
Looks like it.

155
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,430
- To think she kept denying it...
- Gosh.

156
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,470
- Just knock it off. Hey, enough.
- Gosh, cake!

157
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,770

- What's this about?

Yes, sir. I just sent you a text. Did you get it?

Yes, that's right. A hundred each of gray, pink, and white.

180
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,200
Wonderful? Did the fiery pit freeze over or something?

181
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
A person has to have some...

182
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,010
I'm not asking her to be like a soft, fluffy new towel.

183
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,710
But still, you know? Gosh, she's just so abrasive.

184
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,750
She shouldn't be like an exfoliating towel, at least.

185
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,420
What was that about an exfoliating towel?

186
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
You scared me.

187
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,820
When did you get back?

188
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,960
- What about the shop?
- It's empty. Now hurry up and go.

189
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
What?

190
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Right.

191
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,300
Jin Ho, I'll come visit you soon.

192
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,730
When my sister brought you home and said you were getting married,

193
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,130
everyone was dead set against it. It was a whole ordeal.

194
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
- Can you blame them?
- Right?

195
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,710
Think about how old you two were.

196
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,410
But do you know that I was the only one on your side?

197
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,150
Of course I do.

198
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,140
My sister asked me why I was for it.

199
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,340
What do you think I told her?

200
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,020
I said you seemed so dorky. You'd never be popular with women.

201
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,950
So I was sure you'd never cheat on her.

202
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,730
What am I supposed to say to that right now?

203
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,299
But listen, it's a huge misunderstanding.

204
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
- It really is.
- I mean,

205
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,270
while my sister is alive and well,

206
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,370
do you really think you have the guts to cheat on her?

207
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,910
Of course I know you don't.

208
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,410
Right?

209
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,850
I've spent over 20 years living with a man...

210
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,480
who jokes around with people who won't even pay their debts.

211
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,660
Maybe it's because I'm more cynical,

212
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,560
but seeing my husband act like that just drives me crazy.

213
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,460
If...

214
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,370
my husband got into an accident and ended up in that state,

215
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,670
and for seven years, I had to clean up all his messes,

216
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,140
put up with his temper,

217
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,210
and wait on him hand and foot, I...

218
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,750
I could never do it.

219
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,020
But I bet he would do it.

220
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,690
Because he's a fool in that way.

221
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,830
Even though she's my own flesh and blood,

222
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,870
I only thought about how much my poor sister was suffering.

223
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,670
I never considered...

224
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,840
how hard it must have been for you. I'm sorry.

225
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
No, it's all right.

226
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,300
I still can't bring myself to be happy for you and her.

227
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,740
No, I don't think I ever will be.

228
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,380
You took such good care of my sister.

229
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,690
I was so grateful for that.

230
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,020
I really mean it.

231
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
- You should get going!
- Go on! Hurry! Go!

232
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,310
Walk straight, will you? Walk straight!

233
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,150
- Having fun?
- Yes, a blast.

234
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,490
Let's go for round two.

235
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,510
Why are you always here?

236
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,310
Is this the only place you can go?

237
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,450
Is my place some kind of crash pad?

238
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,290
Why are you...

239
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,290
- being so prickly?
- What are you doing here?

240
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,860
- And what happened to your face?
- I asked why you're here.

241
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,440
I felt like I should come...

242
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,370
and say I'm sorry.

243
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
What are you sorry for?

244
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
For me,

245
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,020
it hasn't been long since Sol and I broke up.

246
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,720
- And...
- Enough.

247
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,460
My feelings are my own problem.

248
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,760
I don't expect anything from you.

249
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,900
So you don't need to say anything else.

250
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Right.

251
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,710
Actually,

252
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,470
there is one thing I want.

253
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
What's that?

254
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,110
- I'll do anything I can...
- That internship of yours.

255
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,880
Promise me you'll go back to it.

256
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,360
You said you regret doing nothing for your mom before she passed, yes?

257
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,860
And you know I'm invested in this too, right?

258
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,100
So go back,

259
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,230
and you'd better treat me to something nice.

260
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,910
And...

261
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,950
stop walking on eggshells!

262
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,550
Some people can just up and quit their jobs and act so shameless,

263
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,720
break up on a whim, and even go on a trip to Europe together.

264
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,990
But you and me...

265
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,030
Why are we such pushovers?

266
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,330
Gosh!

267
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,680
You have no idea how happy you've made me.

268
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,420
You...

269
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,420
coming all this way to see me.

270
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,050
Daniel!

271
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,800
I came to tell you something.

272
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh, no.

273
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,110
Gosh.

274
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,520
Hey, kid! Watch where you're going!

275
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,890
What is wrong with you? A child fell and is hurt!

276
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,590
Hey, I didn't hit him. The kid just...

277
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,760
- He fell all by himself.
- He's a child, just as you said.

278
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,530
You should've asked if he was okay before anything else.

279
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,300
Look, there are cars everywhere. He shouldn't be riding that here.

280
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,210
Who are you to butt in, anyway? What are you, his mother?

281
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
Yes.

282
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,410
I'm his mother.

283
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,990
Let me see.

284
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,870
I'm sorry.

285
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,910
For saying you're my mom?

286
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
No.

287
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,150
For not asking if you were okay,

288
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,690
or if you were hurt before anything else.

289
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,500
I had plenty of chances, but I didn't.

290
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
I told my dad...

291
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,510
that I wanted him to break up with you.

292
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I regret...

293
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,950
it.

294
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Why?

295
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't like you,

296
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,900
but I don't like seeing my dad upset either.

297
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,400
You don't like me either, right?

298
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,880
It's hard to like someone who says they don't like you.

299
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Gosh.

300
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,420
You should wear pads next time you ride.

301
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,690
But then,

302
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,560
it's not cool.

303
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm hungry.

304
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,540
Want to go get something to eat?

305
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,530
Is it not too spicy?

306
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,660
I'm practising.

307
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,240
If it's too spicy, don't eat it. What's the point of practising?

308
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,340
Because I want to get closer...

309
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,580
to people.

310
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,860
Can I ask you something?

311
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,470
Why "Oscar"?

312
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,570
The name of the fish.

313
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,010
Do you...

314
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,980
- want the real story?
- Yes.

315
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,720
When I was in Germany,

316
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,190
there was a kid who always bullied me...

317
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,460
and made fun of me. It's his name.

318
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,430
He was the one I hated the most.

319
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,870
I see.

320
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Is that right?

321
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm sorry.

322
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,710
I'll change it.

323
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
No, don't.

324
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,320
I like that name.

325
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Are you sure it's not spicy?

326
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,800
- The milk helped, didn't it?
- This is my first time trying it.

327
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
You've never had this before?

328
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,040
I guess your dad never bought it for you.

329
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,750
All right, let's have a drink.

330
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,960
- Try it with garlic. Is it good?
- It's delicious.

331
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,430
Help yourselves.

332
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Have some garlic.

333
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,440
- This is so delicious.
- I'm glad. Eat up.

334
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,770
Hey, aren't you only looking after our guide?

335
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,180
Talk about tyranny of the tongs.

336
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,510
Tyranny? Come on, I was just...

337
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,450
See? Don't just give it all to me. You have some too, Jin Ho.

338
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,650
- What?
- Eat up.

339
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,550
- What's going on with you two?
- What's this? What's going on?

340
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,920
The way you two have been looking at each other... Something's up.

341
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,230
What gives? Are you and our guide dating or something?

342
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,900
- Sorry?
- Oh, my, he's not even denying it.

343
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,800
- No way.
- Gosh, what's going on?

344
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
For real?

345
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,810
- What?
- What?

346
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,110
Yes, we're dating.

347
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,750
- I knew it!
- What a development.

348
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,100
Your turn to sing one.

349
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,670
No, I'm a terrible singer. You should sing another one.

350
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,040
What, did you just come to watch? If this is a concert, you must pay.

351
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,380
- Come on, get up here!
- And just sit there clapping.

352
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,610
- I can't sing...
- Hurry up and pick a song. Come on.

353
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,110
- I'll sing.
- Yes!

354
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,450
Goodness.

355
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,280
("Love Battery")

356
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,420
All right!

357
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,260
Fill me up with your love

358
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,330
Fill me up!

359
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,630
I think my love battery has run out

360
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,900
I can't live without you, I really can't live

361
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,440
You are my battery

362
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
- Battery!
- Battery!

363
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,610
- You enjoyed today, Ja Yeong.
- I did.

364
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,280
I know. Who would've thought that one trip together...

365
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,420
would lead to us getting so close? It's really something.

366
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,650
You know what made me really happy today?

367
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,220
Not having to hide us, or worry about what anyone thinks.

368
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,930
Me too.

369
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,160
Ja Yeong.

370
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,230
Can I ask you for a favour?

371
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,570
How about you do me a favour first?

372
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,010
And then I'll do yours.

373
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,210
Deal.

374
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,180
What is it? I'll do it.

375
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,850
Sing a song for me.

376
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
What?

377
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,050
No, I can't. I'm a terrible singer. No way.

378
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Then I guess I can't do your favour.

379
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,490
Hey, that's not fair! I mean, come on...

380
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,520
How about I give you a piggyback ride instead?

381
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,790
- No.
- But I'm really terrible at it.

382
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Fine. But don't you laugh.

383
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,970
Now?

384
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,230
Right here?

385
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,340
When and where else?

386
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,570
Don't laugh.

387
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Promise.

388
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,910
Promise.

389
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,750
By my side

390
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Don't laugh.

391
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,120
Just stay

392
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,190
By my side

393
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,700
Don't you ever

394
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,870
Leave me now

395
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,310
I can't leave this longing behind

396
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,610
And travel so far

397
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,220
Just to find

398
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,460
Your rainbow

399
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,720
In the blowing

400
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,030
Cold and biting wind

401
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,730
You may cry from loneliness

402
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,470
But I will always

403
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,680
Stay here by your side

404
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,650
I will never leave

405
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,160
I'm a terrible singer, aren't I?

406
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Not at all.

407
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,230
I loved it.

408
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Really?

409
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
So now,

410
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,410
tell me what your favour is. I'll do anything.

411
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,180
Ja Yeong.

412
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,950
The thing is...

413
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,190
Dinner with your family?

414
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,890
If you're pressured, we can wait.

415
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,530
Pressured? Why would I be?

416
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,430
Really?

417
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,640
Then bring Daniel along.

418
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,310
I've already told my dad and Jun Seo about Daniel.

419
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,180
So, if Daniel's okay with it,

420
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,310
let's all meet them together.

421
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Okay.

422
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,630
Thanks for dropping me off.

423
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,870
No, I'm the one who should be thanking you today.

424
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,970
Is that all? Just a "thank you"? Aren't you forgetting something?

425
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,720
Dad?

426
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

427
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
Yes. You too.

428
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,470
- Dad.
- Yes?

429
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,970
You should've called first.

430
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,180
I was just leaving a meeting nearby...

431
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,950
and thought I'd stop by.

432
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Okay.

433
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,620
He's a handsome guy.

434
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,490
- He seems like a nice guy too.
- Yes, he is.

435
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,390
- Goodness.
- Oh, no.

436
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,070
- Gosh.
- Here's a napkin.

437
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,130
Thanks.

438
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,300
- I'll get it. Let me.
- Okay.

439
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,540
- He seems like a good kid.
- Yes. Right.

440
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,710
- Well...
- Well...

441
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,950
- Go on, you first.
- No, you go first.

442
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,420
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

443
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,490
Do you want to grab a meal with me and Ja Yeong sometime?

444
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,230
Is this too sudden?

445
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,670
I don't mean to put you on the spot. It's just...

446
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,910
I'd like that.

447
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Let's all have a meal together.

448
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,250
Are you sure?

449
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,420
- Go on in.
- Okay.

450
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,390
- Hey, Jun Kyung.
- Yes?

451
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,390
- Never mind. Go on, go inside.
- Dad...

452
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,830
- Yes, go on in.
- Okay. Get home safe.

453
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,430
- I will.
- Okay.

454
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,010
We have a story from our listener, Midnight.

455
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,150
Late nights at the convenience store where I used to work.

456
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,720
Always around the same time,

457
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,690
always dressed the same,

458
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,560
a customer would come in to buy the exact same beer.

459
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
What?

460
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,930
She never said much,

461
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,990
and her face was always blank.

462
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,100
Seeing her like that...

463
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,530
somehow felt like I was looking at myself.

464
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,210
I guess the dead of night is just like that.

465
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,310
A time when you can't hide.

466
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,980
During the day, you can pretend to be happy,

467
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,580
pretend you're not lonely,

468
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,690
whether you're happy or lonely,

469
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,020
you can hide somewhere in between.

470
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,930
But you can't do that in the dead of night.

471
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,800
It tells you that you're not in that gray area.

472
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
It's a time that makes things perfectly clear.

473
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,150
- She never asked me anything, - She never asked me anything,

474
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,280
- without saying a word, - without saying a word,

475
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,450
but her presence was a comfort.

476
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,890
For being there with me,

477
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,460
I wanted to thank her for being like me,

478
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,900
but I couldn't.

479
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,070
Then one day, she stopped buying beer at that hour.

480
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,150
I was relieved.

481
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,180
(Police Exam Prep: Criminal law)

482
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,480
It felt like she wasn't lonely anymore.

483
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,990
Thank you.

484
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,190
If we ever happen to meet again,

485
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,330
the next beer is on me.

486
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,660
Gosh.

487
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,270
Didn't you say you felt like none of this mattered anymore?

488
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,510
Yes. That's what I told you.

489
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,180
That was just one week ago.

490
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,280
And now, all of a sudden, it all matters again?

491
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,520
I thought none of it mattered anymore,

492
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,490
but I realised there's still something important to me.

493
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,090
No wonder. I thought you were sentimental for a science student.

494
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,630
Aren't you embarrassed? Breaking your word so dramatically?

496
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,510
I am embarrassed. Very.

497
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Does this count as trying?

498
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,780
Gosh, it's so hard to be fair.

499
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,380
Hye On! Did Professor Park Jin Hyung's endorsement come in?

500
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,519
- Yes, I just sent it to print.
- Right. Marketing.

501
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
- Yes.
- The writer's interview schedule.

502
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,620
Yes, I'm confirming it now.

503
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,990
- Hurry it up! Faster!
- Right away.

504
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,000
I decided to take the internship again.

505
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,800
It was all you back then,

506
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,540
and it's all you now.

507
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,910
(I decided to take the internship again)

508
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,210
(It was all you back then, and it's all you now)

509
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,930
Bean paste...

510
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,500
Oh, my! Raphael!

511
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
Hello.

512
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,740
- Father, fancy seeing you here.
- It is, isn't it?

513
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,480
We're with the Father to give communion to a new member.

514
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,750
- I see.
- Raphael, how have you been?

515
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,690
Yes, I've been doing well, thanks to your prayers.

516
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,090
You're looking so well.

517
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,060
You seem much more at peace.

518
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,830
I am, thank you.

519
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,100
But I've heard it's not always that simple.

520
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,970
The first year after losing a spouse is a critical time.

521
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,800
You still need to finish your shopping.

522
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,670
It's just that I'm so worried about you, Raphael.

523
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,780
Oh, my, Father! Look who's with Raphael...

524
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,910
Jin Ho. This should be enough, right?

525
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,520
And you are?

526
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,690
This is...

527
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,360
She's my girlfriend.

528
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,270
Ja Yeong, please say hello. This is the priest from my church,

529
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:58,670
the one I told you about. These are parishioners. Say hello.

530
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

531
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,520
- We should get back to shopping.
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

532
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,520
Honey, let's go check over there.

533
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,600
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

534
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,300
One, two, three, four.

535
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,510
I should get out some more.

536
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,910
- Smells good.
- Want a taste?

537
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,010
Sure.

538
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Be careful, it's hot.

539
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
It sounds like someone's here already.

540
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,760
You're here early.

541
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,930
Yes.

542
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,660
Hello.

543
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Hello.

544
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,870
This is...

545
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,040
Well...

546
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,710
Jun Kyung, could you come taste the soup for me?

547
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,380
Sure.

548
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,950
What do you think?

549
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,850
It's a little...

550
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,360
bland, I think.

551
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,990
Really?

552
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,430
- I thought it was fine.
- You did?

553
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,940
Maybe it is okay.

554
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Maybe it is bland.

555
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,740
I can't really tell...

556
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
- What is it?
- What?

557
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,910
No, it's just...

558
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,550
The seasoning seems fine,

559
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,820
but why do you two look so comfortable with each other?

560
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,860
So, should we let it simmer a little longer?

561
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,060
No, it might get too salty if we do. I think it's fine as is.

562
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,010
Dad, are you okay?

563
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,280
Hey, this thing won't stick properly.

564
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,150
What? I haven't seen that before. Is it new?

565
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,210
Yes, I just bought it.

566
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,220
I wasn't sure how much I'd use it, but I figured I'd find a use for it.

567
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,990
Good call.

568
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,030
I'm home.

569
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,630
- Hey.
- You're home.

570
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,370
Hi, Bom!

571
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,210
You remember me, don't you, Bom?

572
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,110
Have you been a good girl?

573

Hi. Hello.

575
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,990
He's handsome. Good thing he doesn't take after his dad.

576
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,690
What? Hey, I clean up pretty well myself.

577
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,500
See, Ja Yeong? Smoke always finds the best-looking person.

578
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,430
I'll get it.

579
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,140
Yes?

581
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,209
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

582
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,250
Goodness.

583
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,280
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

584
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,790
Come on in. Go say hello.

585
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,930
Hey, come on in.

586
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,230
Good to see you.

587
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,730
- Hello.
- So you must be Daniel.

588
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,100
Look at you. Handsome, just like your dad.

589
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,840
- Here, this is for you.
- You really shouldn't have.

590
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,440
- Come on in.
- Okay.

591
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,380
Hello.

592
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,050
- Hello.
- Are these for me?

593
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,080
They're so beautiful!

594
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,790
- Go on, have a seat.
- Come on in.

595
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,990
Thank you for the food.

596
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,800
- Eat up, everyone.
- Looks like he can't make one yet.

597
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,570
When eating meat, you've got to add some garlic and peppers like this.

598
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,140
- Here you go.
- Why are you doing that?

599
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,840
- Dad.
- Just one more. Let's add one more.

600
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,640
- Dad, come on!
- Spice cuts the grease. It's great.

601
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,510
- So? It's good, right?
- This is crazy. No!

602
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,650
- What? Why?
- Drink some water.

603
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,120
- I can't with him.
- Goodness.

604
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,190
Dad!

I swear.

610
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,820
- He can't handle spicy food.
- Here, eat it like this.

611
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,720
- Oh, no, you don't. Absolutely not.
- Are you okay?

612
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,450
- Yes.
- Just swallow it. Just get it down.

613
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,260
- Do you want to spit it out?
- Look, his face is all red.

614
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,130
- What should we do?
- I'm going to step out for a bit.

615
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,530
- Okay.
- Let's all have some water. Cheers!

618
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,550
You're eating that dry pork cutlet by itself?

619
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,820
Excuse me! Could we get an order of jjolmyeon here too?

620
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460
What was that for?

621
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,830
Not seeing you for a few days,

622
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,500
and not being able to talk to you,

623
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,030
was kind of...

624
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,240
torture.

625
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,810
I didn't realise it until now,

626
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
but the truth is...

627
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,880
I think I like cutting up your pork cutlet for you.

628
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,390
Yes.

629
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,350
What are you talking about?

630
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,890
I like stealing a bite of the pork cutlet I cut for you,

631
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,960
and the pork cutlet I cut,

632
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,340
all the noise you make when you eat it.

633
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,480
I like it.

634
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,650
So...

635
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,660
- So, what?
- So this one's on me.

636
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360

I'm a student.

639
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,270
Here, eat this too.

640
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,670
Open up.

641
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,590
Is it good?

642
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,990
Yes.

00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,860

And sweltering summer...

645
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,030
was coming to an end.

646
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,600

took their place.

00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,950
One season taught us that things we were terrified of...

650
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,990
weren't such a big deal after all.

651
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,320
Car number 15, you have passed.

652
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,990
And a season that brought the joy of seeing us,

653
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,330
once so clumsy, grow more alike.

654
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,970
And a season that welcomed the end...

655
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,309
of something we planned for long.

656
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,610
Congratulations on quitting.

657
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,480
Congratulations on quitting.

But no matter how much we anticipated and prepared,

659
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,120
there was a season...

660
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,850
when sorrow was simply inevitable.

661
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,320
For coming into my life as my daughter,

662
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,260
for making me a mother,

663
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,630
thank you.

steadily...

670
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,550
passed us by.

671
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,790
And now...

672
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,690

I have a class, so I have to head over to Ansan right now.

691
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,900
- Sorry.
- Okay, then.

692
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,230
Go on, then.

693
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,430
I'm being so melodramatic, aren't I?

694
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,300
It's pathetic.

695
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,210
It's not like you to be so sentimental, Ja Yeong,

696
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,840
but I think it makes you even sexier.

698
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,920
Of course. It'd be a waste to break up after all this time.

709
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,780
Oh, man. It'll take even longer if I have to find a flower shop.

710
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,050
Gosh, seriously. I'll get them. Just get there.

711
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,290

00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,240
I thought you'd never change

714
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,080
The first time I saw you

715
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,690
Vacant eyes, messy hair a skinny frame

716
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,220
(Daniel Rocks!)

717
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:43,860
They don't know us

718
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,800
See the truth behind the glasses

719
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,470
Let's go!

720
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:58,440
Beneath that clumsy exterior an angel

721
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,010
Everyone else is already here.

722
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,310
- Isn't this the exit?
- Dad!

723
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,980
- Yes.
- Congrats! You were amazing.

724
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,590
I seriously thought you were going to smash those drums.

725
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,260
You were like Aerosmith up there.

726
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,690
Come on, I'm nowhere near that level.

727
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,800
- You must be hot. You're sweating.
- Daniel.

728
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,270
Mom!

729
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,970
- Mom? When did you get in?
- I got in yesterday.

730
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:35,910
It's been a while.

731
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,350
Yes.

732
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Hello.

733
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,960
Hello.

734
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,600
I've heard so much about you.

735
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,650
(Love Me)
