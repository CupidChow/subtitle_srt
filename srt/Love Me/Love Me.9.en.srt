(Chang Ryul)

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,210
(Dahyun)

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,820
(Love Me)

8
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,910
Gosh, you scared me!

9
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,210
What? You slept here?

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,150
Don't stay out late drinking with the undergrads. Got it?

12
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,750
You're 30 now. Stop acting like a kid.

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,490
Anyway, where'd it go? Have you seen a red USB?

14
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,560
- Sorry?
- The red USB.

15
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,500
Gosh, I'm running out of time. Just find that USB for me.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,940
When you have a moment, clean up, will you? This place is a mess.

18
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,740
Isn't it about time you got your act together?

19
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,140
Professor.

20
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Yes?

21
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,950
Do you remember what you once told me?

22
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,990
What? What did I say?

23
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,960
You asked if I even cared about my own life.

24
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,200
That I was just getting in my own way.

25
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Did I? That was harsh. Sorry.

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Professor, I...

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
I don't want to get in my own way anymore.

28
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,550
I'm much more invested in my life now.

29
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,610
Hey.

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,850
Me? Same as always. How have you been?

31
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,060
I'm sorry?

32
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,090
I feel perfectly fine, but they're telling me it's cancer.

33
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,260
But you seem perfectly fine.

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,970
Tell me about it.

35
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,170
Ignorance is bliss, I guess.

36
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,270
And knowing is the real illness.

37
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,310
- Hey.
- I don't even feel it's unfair.

38
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,540
I mean, look at my age,

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,980
and all the drinking and smoking I've done.

40
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,850
- Here, have some of this.
- You shouldn't have.

41
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,890
Here, honey, you eat this.

42
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,390
Aren't you cold, honey?

43
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,290
Cold? Dressed like this? Of course not.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,360
We can't have you catching a cold.

45
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,930
- I'll go get you a blanket.
- Here, wear this.

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,870
- Wear it.
- I'm hot.

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,910
I'll be right back.

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,550
My youngest got a job, so my kids are giving me a generous allowance.

49
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,050
I was all set to travel everywhere with my wife,

50
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,960
but then I had to go and get stupidly sick.

51
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,690
Last year, when we were planning a trip,

52
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,300
my wife suggested we use her mileage to fly business class for once.

53
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,570
I regret telling her to save it, thinking it was a waste.

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,200
You can just get better and fly then.

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,970
You think I'll ever get to use that mileage?

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,370
Of course.

57
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,510
- You have to. Of course you will.
- Don't talk like that.

58
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
You're right.

59
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,450
I'll get better and travel everywhere. Leave no regrets.

60
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,030
This might sound strange,

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
but I'm not as worried about the person who's sick...

62
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
as I am for the loved one who has to watch them.

63
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,740
Still, they're both so optimistic,

64
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,610
so I'm sure they'll get through this.

65
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,320
I heard someone had this engraved on their tombstone.

66
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,920
"I dithered and dallied,"

67
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,220
"and I knew this is how it would end."

68
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,330
Even though I swore I wouldn't live like that,

69
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,300
I was indecisive all over again,

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,570
and I dithered again.

71
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm going to live my own life,

72
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
and my kids will live theirs.

73
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm going to fight doggedly to be happy.

74
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,090
Father, are you looking for something?

75
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,860
Where's our tent?

76
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,260
- The tent?
- Yes.

77
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,270
The one we use for the retreats.

78
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,340
If only things had worked out with Jun Kyung,

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,540
I wouldn't have just stood by as your brother-in-law.

80
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,080
Thank me for becoming a priest. It saved your neck.

81
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,350
Anyway, thanks.

82
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,890
Get this back before the summer retreat.

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,190
I don't know if you'll even make it that long.

84
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm sure I'll have it back by then.

85
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,630
I'll get it back to you.

86
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
I'll get it back to you. Okay?

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,070
Mr. Seo is worried enough as it is.

88
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,270
I'm starting to think I'm making a mistake.

89
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,110
Hey, you absolutely cannot tell my dad about this.

90
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,180
This is as sacred as a confession.

91
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,420
It's a promise with the guy who was almost your brother-in-law.

92
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Come on.

93
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
That's it.

94
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,560
Don't you dare say a word.

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Swear to God.

96
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,010
I came back for you.

97
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,040
To give us another shot.

98
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,630
Don't you think this might be too much for her?

99
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,330
I've yet to meet a woman who thinks a diamond is "too much."

100
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,470
Usually, it's the men who find them to be too much.

101
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,470
The woman who receives this will be very happy, I'm sure.

102
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,770
A man's sincerity is what makes a woman truly happy.

103
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,140
And the sincerity of a successful man...

104
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,510
makes a woman even happier.

105
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,820
What did I do that was so wrong?

106
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,460
I worked my fingers to the bone, did all the legwork myself...

107
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,900
to buy this house. And now I want to sell it...

108
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,730
to find my own happiness.

109
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,570
Do I deserve to be treated like this for that?

110
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,940
What's weighing on your mind?

111
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,080
You tend to walk when you're lost in thought.

112
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,720
But walking all the way home seems a bit extreme, right?

113
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,020
Jun Kyung, please, get in.

114
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,400
I don't get my dad, who'd sell his own house on a whim.

116
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,140
And I don't get Jun Seo's tantrum when it's not even his house.

117
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,940
They're not kids, so why are they acting like this? Seriously.

118
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,710
I think I can kind of see where they're coming from.

119
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,180
And where is all this compassion coming from?

120
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,290
It's not just understanding. To be honest, I'm actually envious.

121
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,960
- Envious of what?
- Your father.

122
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,990
To be so bold for the person he loves...

123
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,630
to be able to make a decision like that.

124
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,670
I think that's pretty admirable.

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,870
You don't find many men like that.

126
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
But he's not just a man. He's also a father.

127
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,340
You've moved out,

128
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,080
and Jun Seo is barely home between school and his dating life.

129
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,220
Since your father's home all alone, I see why he might feel that way.

130
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,950
Then she could just move in and live with him.

131
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,150
Do you think she'd be comfortable? Jun Seo wouldn't be, either.

132
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,300
What is it?

133
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,930
This is what I love about you, Do Hyun.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,580
Being a father, being a man...

135
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,750
I'm not doing a great job myself. It's so complicated.

136
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,950
It is.

137
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,460
I moved out a long time ago,

138
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,360
and I thought the house didn't mean much to me anymore.

139
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,130
But the thought of it suddenly being gone...

140
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,670
It just feels strange.

141
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,240
You've kept this place in great shape.

142
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,180
For its age, the floors, the molding...

143
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,510
There's nothing that needs work.

144
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,620
It's move-in ready as is.

145
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Is that right?

146
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,990
This is my first time selling a house.

147
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,930
I'm envious, sir. At least you have a house to sell.

148
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't even have one of those yet.

149
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
No, not like that.

150
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,800
Draw a straight line from here, got it?

151
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,380
It'll look more spacious that way. Gosh, I've already told you.

152
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,210
How long do you think it'll take to sell?

153
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,010
Oh, right.

154
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,650
You'd be surprised how many people want a house with a yard.

155
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,890
It's great for raising kids, great for dogs.

156
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,660
A place like this could get an offer by tomorrow.

157
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,860
And the photos and video we took today...

158
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,130
will be up on our blog by the end of the day.

159
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Really? That soon?

160
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,170
In this day and age, you have to be fast to survive.

161
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,210
Get a shot of that side. Yes, from over there.

162
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,710
Is it a sure thing?

163
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,510
The instructor position?

164
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,620
It's not set in stone yet.

165
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,750
But he promised he'd give me a strong recommendation.

166
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,690
Because he trusts me.

167
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,490
The guy who still lacks credits to graduate?

168
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,260
What's there to trust?

169
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,930
Your patience and perseverance?

170
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,170
Right. I guess that's a talent in itself.

171
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,880
You gave your dad such a hard time for selling the house secretly,

172
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,810
and now you're setting up camp here without asking me?

173
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,380
I just thought we could share some of this extra space.

174
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,850
Maybe share some of your food while we're at it.

175
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,720
And I'll only use the bathroom when you're not in it.

176
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,630
Once I'm an instructor,

177
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,700
even if you cry and beg me to stay, I'll get my own place and move out.

178
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,070
Don't you worry about a thing.

179
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,930
Oh, gosh.

180
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
But...

181
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,610
did you actually want to be an instructor?

182
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,610
As of today, I have been reborn...

183
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,150
as a man destined to become an instructor.

184
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,090
You know why?

185
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,620
I have to get even with my dad and sister for this humiliation.

186
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,100
You cannot tell them I'm here. Got it?

187
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,830
Promise?

188
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,900
(Ji Hye On)

189
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,670
Jun Kyung, Jun Seo is at my place.

190
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,570
I figured you and your dad would be worried.

191
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
I know.

192
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,050
How did you know?

193
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,280
The priest told me.

194
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,050
Chang Sik did?

195
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,990
How would he know?

196
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,190
I'm done worrying about him. He can take care of himself.

197
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,390
Like you said, he's not a kid anymore.

198
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,230
And...

199
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,430
I listed the house.

200
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Just so you know.

201
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,670
Okay.

202
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,550
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, yes. Come on in.

203
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,020
- Right this way.
- Thank you. Excuse us.

204
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,550
- Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,990
Sir, we'll start with the back rooms.

206
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,390
- Yes, of course. Take your time.
- Right.

207
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,830
Come this way, please.

208
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,310
Here, please have a drink while you look around.

209
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,910
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

210
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,980
It's a lot more dated than it looked in the video.

211
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,880
It's pretty old-fashioned, isn't it?

212
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,850
When we redo the wallpaper and flooring,

213
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,350
we'll have to replace all the doors too.

214
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,490
You'll definitely want to do that.

215
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,230
Judging by your fashion, you two have great taste,

216
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
so I'm sure you'll do wonders with this place.

217
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,100
The living room seems a bit small for the square footage.

218
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,200
But you said you needed a nursery and one other room,

219
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,470
you could just knock down this wall here.

220
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,410
Knock down a wall?

221
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
Is that structurally sound?

222
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,780
Of course! Older houses are sturdy. This thing's a tank.

223
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,980
You could open the whole place up.

224
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,690
Won't it get really buggy in the summer?

225
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,960
We don't really need a garden. What if we put a deck here instead?

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,260
Exactly! You can add a nice big deck out here,

227
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
add a parasol, and have your own private cafe.

228
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,110
Hey!

229
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,640
Look, if you don't like the house, don't buy it.

230
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,180
What right do you have to talk about tearing it apart?

231
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,280
- What is all this nonsense?
- Sir.

232
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,250
They're just saying that because they want to make it theirs.

233
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,680
This guy's unbelievable.

234
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
You think I'm unbelievable?

235
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,220
What's so unbelievable about me?

236
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,020
From where I'm standing, you're the unbelievable ones.

237
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,790
This isn't just any house.

238
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm not selling! Now get out.

239
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,760
Sir, I believe there's been a misunderstanding.

240
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,430
You're the worst of them all! I ought to...

241
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,670
You said it was move-in ready.

242
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Get out! I'm not selling to you, so get out!

243
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,070
- Get out! Get out now!
- Sir, please!

244
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Get out of my house!

245
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,240
- Sir?
- Yes.

246
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,280
I think they're interested. I'll give you a call.

247
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,150
All right.

248
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,580
- Okay.
- We should go.

249
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,950
Thank you for your time.

250
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,990
About the other day...

251
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,800
My mom was rude to you, wasn't she?

252
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,170
No, of course not.

253
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,740
She must have been.

254
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,810
But still,

255
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,280
please don't hate my mom too much.

256
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,350
I don't.

257
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,120
Now that I'm leaving, you don't have to walk on eggshells.

258
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,090
You can sleep over at my dad's house now.

259
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,460
It sounds like we're never going to see each other again.

260
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,560
Why wouldn't we see each other?

261
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,370
Ms. Seo, if you...

262
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,240
and Dad break up,

263
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,740
would you stop seeing me?

264
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,910
What?

265
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,110
No, I just mean...

266
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,480
You never know what might happen.

267
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,510
I don't mean you two should break up, though.

268
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
My dad...

269
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,960
is a pretty great guy.

270
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
Gosh.

271
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,530
Gosh, your Korean is so good now. You've become a smooth talker.

272
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
There we go.

273
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,820
You brought your fish?

274
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Yes.

275
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,820
Why? Is that a problem?

276
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,160
No, of course not. Let's go in.

277
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,870
I'm going to take off.

278
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,910
- Get settled.
- What? You expect us to carry this?

279
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,940
It's not that much.

280
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,350
You don't have a recording today, do you?

281
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,450
It's not like you're intruding. Stay and have dinner.

282
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,590
I made that curry you love. I went all out today.

283
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,090
I have plans to meet Jun Kyung.

284
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,670
Fine. Maybe some other time, then. I'm not trying to rush you.

285
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,870
We'll have to see each other for Daniel's sake, anyway.

286
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,810
I can wait.

287
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I've got to go.

288
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,380
Hey, Jun Seo.

289
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,010
Working late again?

290
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,710
Gosh, that sounds rough.

291
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,980
All right, make sure you get something to eat.

292
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,320
Okay.

293
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,130
When I was a kid,

294
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,860
right around this time,

295
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,600
my mom would bring in the laundry...

296
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,870
and fold it on the living room floor.

297
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,670
And every time, I'd be right there next to her, helping her fold.

298
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,610
Even though I did a terrible, crooked job of it,

299
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,680
my mom would say, "You're such a good boy, Jun Seo."

300
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,350
"You're doing such a good job."

301
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,150
And while we were doing that,

302
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,560
my sister would get home from school.

303
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,290
Then a little while later,

304
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,460
my dad would come home from work,

305
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,970
and then we'd all have dinner together,

306
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,670
and have my mom's favourite ice cream for dessert.

307
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,140
That's a sweet memory.

308
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,080
We were so happy back then.

309
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,860
Hello?

310
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,130
Jun Kyung.

311
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,000
Are you done already?

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,110
- You must be sad to see Daniel go.
- I am.

313
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,770
Now when I get home, Daniel will be gone,

314
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,310
and Oscar will be gone too.

315
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,550
The only thing moving in that house will be the robot vacuum.

316
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,420
I think I might move out.

317
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,960
My lease is almost up anyway,

318
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,760
so I should probably move to a place...

319
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,460
that's better suited for one person.

320
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,900
Where are you, Jun Kyung?

321
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,910
I'm at my dad's house, but nobody's home.

322
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,340
What are you doing there all by yourself?

323
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Just...

324
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,620
sitting here.

325
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,520
Being here all alone,

326
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,530
I'm starting to understand my dad, just like you said I would.

327
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,170
Now I don't think I could say a word if he decides to sell the house.

328
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,000
Jun Kyung.

329
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,170
Yes?

330
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,710
Do you want to move in together?

331
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,420
Those people were way out of line.

332
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,250
Who badmouths a house like that right in front of the owner?

333
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,290
I'm offended just listening to it.

334
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,730
It's a house the owner doesn't value enough to keep.

335
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,100
Why would anyone else speak highly of it?

336
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,970
Even getting rid of Bom's little doghouse,

337
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,240
I felt so strange, as if our memories of Bom were fading.

338
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,080
For both you and me, Jin Ho,

339
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,580
it's not that we don't cherish this place.

340
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,090
Hold on a second.

341
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,630
Hello?

342
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,369
(Seo Jun Kyung)

343
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,370
What?

344
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,310
You scared me!

345
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,150
Why didn't you answer my call?

346
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,150
What? How did you know I was here?

347
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,720
Is your location a state secret or something?

348
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
What?

349
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,020
Seriously, you can't trust anyone.

350
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,260
- It's a secret to Dad.
- Dad already knows.

351
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,500
You told him?

352
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,100
What part of "already knows" did you not understand?

353
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,870
Gosh, Chang Sik.

354
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,810
For a priest, he sure has a big mouth.

355
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,610
Just get out of here.

356
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,740
Where are we going?

357
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,350
You have to tell me.

358
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,680
Isn't Do Hyun's idea brilliant?

359
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,660
If Do Hyun and I both end our leases and move into this house,

360
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,120
we wouldn't have to sell the house,

361
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,330
Dad could run the camp with Ms. Jin, and Jun Seo could stay in his room.

362
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,900
No way.

363
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,630
- Why would I mooch off of you?
- You stubborn little punk.

364
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,970
This time, I'm determined to move out on my own.

365
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,070
Knock it off. Stop being a burden to Hye On.

366
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:04,140
He's not a burden at all. I feel a lot safer with him here.

367
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,210
Not really, but...

368
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,620
He's like my own personal bodyguard, minus the salary.

369
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,490
I'm fine with it.

370
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,030
What do you think, Ms. Jin?

371
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,400
Do I get a say in this?

372
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,230
Of course.

373
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,170
I'd be happy enough just not having to sell the house.

374
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Right?

375
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,710
But are you really sure you're okay with this?

376
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,510
I know you're wearing rose-coloured glasses now,

377
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,810
but they're going to come off eventually.

378
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,520
What will you do about this house you're now financially tied to?

379
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,350
I'd love that. If the house means we can never break up.

380
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,400
What about you, Dad?

381
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
Dad.

382
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,650
I...

383
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,350
You're all being so...

384
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,430
What's wrong? Is he still sulking?

385
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,070
He's acting like such a kid.

386
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,340
One more word out of you and I'll sew your mouth shut.

387
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,480
What's wrong, Dad?

388
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,260
In this house...

389
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,470
It's not just my history that lives here.

390
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,240
Your history is here,

391
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,040
Jun Seo's history is here,

392
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,740
and your mother, Kim Mi Ran's, history is all here too.

393
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,580
I've been so selfish and pathetic.

394
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm too ashamed to even look at you two.

395
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,930
That's not true.

396
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,940
The first day we moved into this house,

397
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,340
I couldn't sleep. "Did we deserve to live in such a nice place?"

398
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,110
Especially since we were just renting.

399
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,580
Mom really loved this house.

400
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,120
Your mom and I loved this house so much...

401
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,720
that we went from renting to putting down a large deposit,

402
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,290
to eventually making it our own.

403
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,660
That night, the two of us just bawled our eyes out.

404
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,400
Through all that, your mom was so frugal.

405
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,510
She must have gone through so much.

406
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,840
We had Jun Seo here,

407
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,710
we raised you,

408
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,680
and she took care of me.

409
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Jun Kyung.

410
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,460
Your mom, up in the skies,

411
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,460
must be really cursing me out, right?

412
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,730
Knowing Mom? You think she wouldn't have?

413
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,540
Your mom and I had you, Jun Kyung, when we were 20.

414
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,510
What did we know back then?

415
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,880
We were just kids having a kid.

416
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,290
- It might seem like we raised you.
- Honey.

417
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,930
But you were the one who made us parents.

418
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,129
- What time is it?
- And made us...

419
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,200
- into adults.
- It's 5am.

420
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,270
Here in this house,

421
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,870
you and I...

422
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,110
- This way.
- grew up together.

423
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
There.

424
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,320
Jun Kyung. Do you remember that time?

425
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,520
- Remember what?
- That time you and I...

426
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,490
looked up at the sky together from right here.

427
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,530
Dad, where are we going?

428
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,900
Jun Kyung, you're awake?

429
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,530
It's the Lunar New Year. We have to go to Grandma's.

430
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,210
- Dad.
- Yes?

431
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,840
Why is the sky this colour?

432
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,820
This is what they call "dawn."

433
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,520
- Dawn?
- Yes. First time seeing the dawn?

434
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,390
It's pretty, isn't it?

435
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,390
It's so pretty.

436
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,630
- Dad.
- Yes?

437
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,530
Thank you for showing me the dawn.

438
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Right.

439
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,400
Sure.

440
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,740
Jin Ho, we're going to be late. Come on!

441
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,180
Okay, I'm coming!

442
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,780
- Let's go.
- You're awake, Jin Kyung?

443
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,910
You must be cold.

444
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,390
- Dad, isn't that heavy?
- I'm fine.

445
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,530
- Is that yours?
- What, the bag?

446
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,030
- The bag.
- Yeah, it's mine.

447
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,700
Ja Yeong, the one on top.

448
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,509
- Come on in.
- Okay.

449
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,380
- That looks heavy.
- I'm fine.

450
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,090
- Jun Kyung.
- Yes, Dad?

451
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,630
I left Mom's things as they were, like you said.

452
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,200
Right. We'll just use my room.

453
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,670
The master and Jun Seo's rooms will be left as is.

454
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,170
All right, then.

455
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,390
All right.

456
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,530
- Okay, everyone.
- Yes.

457
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,359
- Let's all keep in touch.
- Okay.

458
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,630
And see each other often.

459
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,860
Anyway, let's all take care of ourselves...

460
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,470
and live well.

461
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,469
- Okay. You too, Dad.
- You too, Dad.

462
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,170
- Come visit us at the campground.
- Okay, we will.

463
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
I'll be sure to stop by.

464
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,170
- I'm heading out.
- Okay. Drive safe.

465
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,810
- Okay, I'm really leaving now.
- Bye.

466
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,310
- Drive safe.
- Dad, drive carefully.

467
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Okay.

468
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,050
- We should get going too.
- Right. What should I do now?

469
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,290
Just say goodbye. And don't be a burden to Hye On.

470
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,320
- Jun Kyung, don't you hurt him.
- Whatever.

471
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,460
I'm heading out. See you guys.

472
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,630
I told you I'm going first.

473
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,240
What on earth did you pack in here?

474
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,310
What is this?

475
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,910
Thank you so much.

476
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,090
I could have carried that, you know.

477
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Seriously.

478
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,560
This thing...

479
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,770
Hey, this isn't bad.

480
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Ja Yeong.

481
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,850
- Yes?
- Come here a second. Quick.

482
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,720
- Why?
- Hurry.

483
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,820
- Why? What's going on?
- Hurry!

484
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,820
- Quick! Something amazing. Hurry!
- What's going on? What is it?

485
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,120
- Look.
- What?

486
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,330
Where's the circle part?

487
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,730
I thought you said the Northern Crown was a circle.

488
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,600
I must have forgotten to mention something.

489
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,970
You can only see it if you're a good person.

490
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,710
Finally, we're done.

491
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,280
What a relief.

492
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,350
That was a lot of work, right?

493
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,330
In this stately old house,

494
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,460
sitting out on the deck,

495
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,040
don't we feel like an old married couple?

496
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,800
An old married couple?

497
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,170
Yes.

498
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,880
Who never really argued,

499
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,880
and lived happily in this house for...

500
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,780
about 30 or 40 years?

501
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,890
A sweet, old couple like that.

502
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,890
How about...

503
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,690
a nice, cold beer?

504
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm in.

505
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,330
Lots of ice, please.

506
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
You got it.

507
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,090
Let's eat.

508
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,060
You're really digging in.

509
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,640
If you want to go to your dad's, just let me know.

510
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,170
I'll take you.

511
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,070
It'd be a little weird for me to go to Dad's now.

512
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,810
I can take a hint, you know.

513
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Why?

514
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,410
What?

515
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:53,130
Dad is living with Jun Kyung.

516
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,930
Didn't Dad tell you?

517
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,570
I should get some coffee.

518
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,270
Hey, the coffee in our breakroom is actually good.

519
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,780
If it's so great, why'd you quit the hospital?

520
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,380
Anyway, your family is so progressive.

521
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,849
Three couples from three generations...

522
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,720
all living together, unmarried.

523
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,320
Gosh, so progressive. Super cool.

524
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,190
Is that an insult?

525
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,630
Hey, since when is "progressive" an insult?

526
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,070
But this whole sudden moving-in thing...

527
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,380
was partly to because of that bold catfish, isn't it?

528
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,350
Well, like a "two birds with one stone" kind of thing?

529
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,150
(Seah Women's Hospital)

530
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,849
What are you doing later? I'm going to the kids' cafe...

531
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,590
with my kids. Do you want to come?

532
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,160
Dream on.

533
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,360
Hello.

534
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
Your lunch break isn't over yet, right?

535
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,670
I hear you're living with Do Hyun.

536
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,380
And that's a reason to show up at my work?

537
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,550
Well, it's more than that.

538
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,860
I'm curious if you're planning on marrying him.

539
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,990
Why would you be curious about that?

540
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,170
Someone once told me...

541
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,340
you can date, break up, be apart, and still get back together.

542
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,580
They say a spouse is the only family you can actually choose.

543
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,850
What's your point?

544
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,650
My point is, this isn't as simple as you think.

545
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,590
You can't choose parents or kids, nor can you become strangers.

546
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,890
Do Hyun is Daniel's father, after all.

547
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,730
And I'm his mother.

548
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,270
I'm not sure yet,

549
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,910
but if we do get married, I'll be sure to let you know.

550
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,190
Jun Kyung.

551
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,020
You know, every time I see you,

552
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,520
I can't help but feel that we're a bit alike.

553
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,770
- How so?
- We're both bad at showing emotion.

554
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,400
We get jealous easily, so we get hurt easily.

555
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,410
We run away the second we feel exposed.

556
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,980
And we don't know how to give or accept an apology.

557
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,380
Am I wrong?

558
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,700
You know, every time I see you,

559
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,970
I can't help but feel that we're a bit alike.

560
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,050
Alike? How are we anything alike?

561
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,760
Hey, you all made it. Thanks for coming.

562
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,330
Thank you for making the trip.

563
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,169
- Hi. You've been well, I hope?
- Thanks for making the trip.

564
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,200
Good to see you.

565
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,640
Well, would you look at you?

566
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,670
From community chief, to unemployed, and now a business owner?

567
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,240
Your life's been quite a ride, hasn't it? Congratulations.

568
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,579
- Oh, you really shouldn't have.
- Ta-da!

569
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,320
- What?
- Lose the "Jackpot!" It's tacky.

570
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,150
Bom's Campsite Jackpot!

571
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,420
- Thank you.
- Sure.

572
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,090
All right, everyone, let's go! Let's go! In we go.

573
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,360
Your hands!

574
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,870
- Please, go on in.
- Okay.

575
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Gosh, the air is so fresh out here.

576
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,770
- This is so delicious!
- You like it?

577
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,870
- Eat up, everyone.
- Thank you.

578
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,140
Go on, have some.

579
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,710
- Okay.
- All right.

580
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,020
- Liking it?
- I'm loving it. It's so nice.

581
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,260
I love it.

582
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,890
- Stop using your hands!
- Here, eat.

583
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,830
Leave it. I'll get it myself.

584
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,200
- Hey! I don't want it.
- Just eat.

585
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,150
What's on your mind?

586
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,690
Just thinking.

587
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,990
It's kind of amazing.

588
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,260
How we could meet without knowing the other existed,

589
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,770
and after all this time, end up right here together.

590
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,170
It is, isn't it?

591
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,180
If not for your brave confession that day,

592
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,580
we probably...

593
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,120
wouldn't be here together right now.

594
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,960
Wait, I confessed to you?

595
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,630
Look at you, pretending you don't remember.

596
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,700
No, seriously. That day...

597
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,210
Don't you remember what you said after you rang my doorbell?

598
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,580
What did I say? But wait, I don't think that was a confession.

599
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,650
My goodness.

600
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,050
You really don't remember, do you?

601
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,649
I remember everything you wore,

602
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,820
right down to your shoes.

603
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,590
No way.

604
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:37,300
A white shirt with a big collar that looked like wings,

605
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,500
and your pants were also white.

606
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,540
You must've been in a rush because you flew to my door in slippers.

607
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,110
Like a little cherub.

608
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,310
I've got goosebumps. That's incredible.

609
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,950
What could I possibly not know about you?

610
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,420
I spend my days observing you, studying you,

611
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,920
and trying to figure you out.

612
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,430
I'm the top expert on Seo Jun Kyung.

613
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,100
An expert on Seo Jun Kyung, are you?

614
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,170
- Gosh!
- What's wrong? What's happening?

615
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,340
Since I have a desk job,

616
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,680
- my back's been aching right here.
- Your back? It hurts right here?

617
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
That's the spot.

618
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,180
- Right here?
- Gosh, that feels good.

619
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,019
- But if it hurts, - That's so relieving.

620
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,520
Doesn't pressing on it make it hurt more?

621
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,750
- That's the stuff.
- Doesn't it hurt more?

622
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,590
Inviting people over for a housewarming party...

623
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,760
I thought it was just a thing you do since others do, but I was wrong.

624
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,660
What do you mean?

625
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:50,240
It feels like a way to show people, "Hey, look, I'm doing well."

626
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,440
And it's like promising yourself you'll live even better from now on.

627
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,450
I'm not exactly sure what "living well" means, but...

628
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,020
Living well...

629
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,790
Take a towel, for instance.

630
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,960
When it's all fluffy and soft, you use it for your face.

631
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:18,460
Once it gets frayed and rough, you use it for your feet.

632
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,540
And when the stains won't come out, and it's gotten limp,

633
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,470
you turn it into a rag.

634
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,010
I guess living like that...

635
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,450
That's what it means to live well, I suppose.

636
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,350
Thank you for coming.

637
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,660
I really mean it.

638
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,660
Ja Yeong.

639
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:21,230
Here's to the good life

640
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:27,070
Let's give it our all, here's to the good life!

641
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,270
Here's to the good life

642
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,910
Look at her. She's totally wasted.

643
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,580
She's the only one who's drunk.

644
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,160
Wait a second, hold on.

645
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,600
What? What are you doing?

646
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,870
I've always wanted to do this.

647
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
Do what?

648
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,270
- What?
- Honey, be home early.

649
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,650
What was that? That makes us sound like newlyweds.

650
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,650
But that suit is so dated. Is this the only one you own?

651
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,390
It's not like I have many chances to wear a suit.

652
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,960
It just goes to show how I've been living.

653
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,630
If I win the prize money, I'll get you a tie.

654
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:35,970
No, I'll buy you a whole new suit. A designer one.

655
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,470
You're just saying that because you don't expect to win?

656
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,440
Once I'm a novelist and you're a professor,

657
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,580
should we get married?

658
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,620
Stop it. That's so embarrassing. Seriously, don't.

659
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,090
Do a good job, hubby.

660
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,950
- Okay. You got this.
- Sure.

661
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,989
- I'll call you.
- Okay, you got this!

662
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,990
Bye.

663
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,630
Professor Song vouched for me, so you don't have to worry.

664
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,540
Right, okay. Don't be nervous. When asked, be clear...

665
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
and answer them confidently, like "Yes, sir!" Got it?

666
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,210
Gosh, I'm not nervous.

667
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,610
Okay, son. Go do your best. You got this, and don't be nervous.

668
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,110
- I told you, I'm not nervous.
- Right, okay.

669
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,780
He seems nervous, though.

670
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,540
Jin Ho! Jin Ho, look at this!

671
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,040
So many wild shoots up there! Jin Ho, look.

672
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,110
Right.

673
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,150
Oh, no, where is my head?

674
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,260
- Interned at a broadcast station?
- Yes, I did.

675
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,100
- Your thesis passed.
- Yes.

676
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,300
- Six more credits and you graduate?
- Yes, that's correct.

677
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,570
So why are your undergraduate grades such a mess?

678
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,850
I was dealing with personal issues at the time.

679
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,410
Like what?

680
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,190
- Not that I'm actually asking.
- Right.

681
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,220
Professor Song did recommend you,

682
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,560
we have an opening for a liberal arts lecturer,

683
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,959
but I need to see the department head.

684
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,970
It's policy, but I'll contact you.

685
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,170
- Yes, thank you, sir.
- All right.

686
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,570
Jin Ho.

687
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,240
Are you still mad at me?

688
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,210
I'm not mad.

689
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,620
A fire out here in the mountains would be a total disaster.

690
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,920
You're right. That could have been a disaster.

691
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,090
I guess I got carried away. I wasn't thinking straight.

692
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,590
I'm so sorry.

693
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,600
I promise, I'll be more careful from now on.

694
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm glad you like it here enough to lose your head over it.

695
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,910
So does that mean you're not mad anymore?

696
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,950
No. Still mad.

697
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,110
- Come on.
- Stop it. What are you doing?

698
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,720
Hey, stop. I'm not over it, so just get away from me.

699
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,120
Stop it.

700
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,970
Do you know what's more important than the diamond for a proposal?

701
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,230
What is it?

702
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,100
Timing.

703
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
Is that too cliche?

704
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,640
It's not about your timing or even your timing as a couple.

705
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,880
It's all about her timing.

706
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,050
How are you supposed to know that?

707
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,880
That's what makes it so difficult.

708
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,090
I told you I could've just taken the shuttle.

709
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,030
I was bored.

710
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,800
Your mom's unemployed, you know.

711
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,000
Then get a job.

712
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,640
Why don't you skip class and go get some tteokbokki with me?

713
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,280
Better yet, just quit your classes and hang out with me all the time.

714
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,680
How could I not go to my classes?

715
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,120
Mom, you're really so different from other moms.

716
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,620
So you wish I were like the other moms?

717
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,760
No, I'd hate that.

718
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,230
But...

719
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,860
aren't you going to find a boyfriend?

720
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,370
Why do you ask?

721
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,140
No reason.

722
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,770
I was just wondering.

723
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,410
Well, Dad has a girlfriend now.

724
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,240
I thought you hated the idea of me dating.

725
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,649
You said you didn't want a new guy, just me, Dad, and you.

726
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,980
You wanted it to be just you, Dad, and me.

727
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,790
That was ages ago. I was just a kid.

728
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,290
And now?

729
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,660
So now you'd be okay with me having a boyfriend?

730
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,290
I just...

731
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,630
I just don't want you to be lonely.

732
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,700
Do I seem lonely to you?

733
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,310
I mean...

734
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,110
Maybe a little?

735
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,520
Okay. I'll do my best not to be lonely, then.

736
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,220
Hey, I'm really sorry.

737
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,430
The session's running late, so I'm going to be a while.

738
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,560
Oh, really? But I was just making curry.

739
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,970
After such a long, hard day.

740
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,770
Coming home to curry from my love...

741
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,700
That should've been today.

742
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,510
The timing's just off, I guess.

743
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,930
- Yes!
- Here it is!

744
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,430
- Quit.
- Okay, quiet.

745
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,570
- Yes, Professor?
- Yes, it's all been approved,

746
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,080
- so we'll go ahead with your class.
- What? For real?

747
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,510
We'll give it a trial run for a semester.

748
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,350
And if the students like it, you can keep doing it.

749
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,850
Yes, thank you so much.

750
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,990
- Oh, and one more thing.
- Yes?

751
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,320
You'll need about 5,000 dollars ready.

752
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
Excuse me?

753
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,960
A lot of people are competing to teach these electives,

754
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,970
and it's a desirable position, so that amount isn't out of line.

755
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,500
- Soo Jin said...
- I see.

756
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,210
- this spring will be very bitter, - Oh, yes.

757
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,380
- and even crueller.
- So by when...

758
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,410
When you think about it, we have spring all wrong.

759
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,050
The sunlight is warm.

760
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,360
A pleasant season that's neither too hot nor too cold.

761
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,360
It feigns a gentle nature, as if to put us at ease,

762
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,170
but spring was never such a gentle soul.

763
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,140
- Thank you.
- Of course. Enjoy your stay.

764
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,270
We will, thank you.

765
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Bye!

766
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,110
Just when you think it's only going to get warmer...

767
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,180
- Hey, Ja Yeong.
- Have you seen my Bom?

768
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:07,050
An unexpected late-season cold snap can return.

769
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,350
It's just that I can't find Bom.

770
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,460
Bom!

771
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,230
Bom, where are you?

772
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,570
The unstable air creates drastic temperature swings,

773
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,010
the day and night wear different faces,

774
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,610
which can often throw us off.

775
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,950
With its colourless, shimmering heat haze,

776
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,750
this is the spring that leaves us disoriented.

777
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,460
This year,

778
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:48,930
once again,

779
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,600
is proving to be...

780
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,170
anything but peaceful.

781
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,680
(Love Me)
