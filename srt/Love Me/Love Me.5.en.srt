1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,280
(Seo Hyun Jin)

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,580
(Yoo Jae Myung)

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,720
(Lee Si Woo)

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,730
(Yoon Se A)

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,940
(Chang Ryul)

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,810
(Dahyun)

7
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,160
And then...

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,930
Let it steam.

9
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,140
(Lastly, chop the carrots to your desired size.)

10
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,840
(I usually quarter them or cut them into sixths.)

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,990
Hey.

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,100
- Why are you up so early? - The bathroom.

13
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,330
The bathroom? I see.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,740
When did you get home? I didn't hear you come in.

15
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,610
- It's just... - Dad, did you just...

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,010
get home?

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
I'm just heading out.

18
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Is that so?

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,520
- Yes. - And here I was thinking...

20
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,050
But this early?

21
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Yes, early...

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,460
The early bird gets the fresh air, right?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Just how much fresh air are you planning on getting?

24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,470
- Have a good day. - I will. See you.

25
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,920
Where can I even go at this hour?

26
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
She said she's with someone.

27
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,910
Yes, but I don't really think he and Sol are a good match.

28
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,410
Why?

29
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,950
He's just some loser who goes to grad school.

30
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
So what?

31
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,250
Not "so what," that's why. That's why I'm making a move.

32
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,790
Hey, it's the first time in a while my dopamine is pumping, you know?

33
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Is that so?

34
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,730
But my competition is so weak, so it's a bit anticlimactic.

35
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What?

36
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,740
Darn it.

37
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,940
What's up with Ji Hye On?

38
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,180
You think she's into you?

39
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Never mind.

40
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,760
Idiot.

41
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
What's she on about?

42
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,430
- This is so... - I love this.

43
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,570
Hey, what are you up to?

44
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,340
Practising, of course.

45
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
- When do you get done? - Probably...

46
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,910
When I run out of energy and collapse?

47
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,150
Gosh, you're so cool. So darn sexy.

48
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,850
Still, save some energy to hang out with me.

49
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,990
If you're bored, you can just go to my place and wait.

50
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,620
What would I do there, all bored by myself?

51
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,960
When I'm free, you're busy, and when you're free, I'm busy.

52
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,430
See? We're just not a good match, are we?

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Come on, what do you mean we're not a good match?

54
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,900
I can just bring some good food to the practice room.

55
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,340
- Really? That'd be amazing. - What are you in the mood for?

56
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,680
Meat. I want to stuff myself until I explode.

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
You got it. Just you wait.

58
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,550
I love you.

59
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,730
That little...

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,070
It reeks of sweat in here!

61
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,140
- What the... - Hello.

62
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,469
- You're all working hard. - Hi.

63
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,780
How's everyone been?

64
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,210
- My arms are killing me. Help me. - Thank you.

65
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,810
- It's nothing fancy. - Thank you.

66
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,010
I brought some food. Here you go.

67
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,380
What the heck is this guy doing?

68
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,820
- What is all this? - Steak! Thank you!

69
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,590
- Thank you. - Enjoy your meal.

70
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,530
- Thank you. We'll enjoy the food. - Thank you.

71
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,430
What's this?

72
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,730
- It's steak! - What are you doing?

73
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,270
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

74
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,100
Surprise?

75
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
And why would you?

76
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,070
To get on your good side, of course.

77
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,410
That's why I came all the way here with all that.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
What is this all about?

79
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
(Eternal Love)

80
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,760
My professor suddenly called me in, so I don't think I can make it.

81
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Sorry.

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
Your food's getting cold.

83
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,910
- What are you doing after this? - What's it to you?

84
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Shouldn't you be at work?

85
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,780
I told them I'm working off-site so I could hang out with you.

86
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,650
How do you even know when I'll be done?

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm going to be working really late.

88
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,790
I've got plenty of it. Time to spend with you.

89
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,290
Come on, eat something.

90
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,730
I bought that for you. At least have some as a thank you.

91
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,830
Come on, take your pick. I've got three different sets here.

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
You? Cooking?

93
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
With your own two hands?

94
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,770
You? The girl who can't even make a good cup of coffee?

95
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,800
I know, right? But here I am.

96
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,640
After all my warnings, and after talking so much trash...

97
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,809
Do you really want to go that far for him?

98
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,910
Yes.

99
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,420
But I thought you said you were happiest being single.

100
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,820
Didn't you say guys are all the same and to focus on their good points?

101
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,790
So? Did you find any?

102
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,890
I didn't even have to look. They were just obvious.

103
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,430
He must have had it so rough at such a young age. Heartbreaking.

104
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,970
And it's touching how hard he tries to be responsible.

105
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,340
So much you're ignoring your 20-year friend's advice...

106
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,070
You must be completely head over heels.

107
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,010
So to offer him some comfort and encouragement,

108
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,680
you're going to do the whole naked-under-the-apron thing?

109
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,310
Are you crazy? That's so tacky.

110
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,050
Why? I mean, maybe if someone else saw you and called it tacky,

111
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,190
but what's tacky with you two? If you're doing it, go all out.

112
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,690
They say it's a guy's fantasy. Who knows?

113
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,160
It might just lead to some hot reunion sex.

114
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Come on.

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,340
She's nuts. No.

116
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,650
That's not it. No way. Absolutely not.

117
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,050
"Dice the potatoes." Done.

118
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Jun Kyung.

119
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Jun Kyung.

120
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Ta-da!

121
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,650
Dad, where's our luggage?

122
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,510
You should've told me he was coming with you.

123
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,850
You should've told me...

124
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,310
you were dressed like that.

125
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I'm so embarrassed.

126
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,420
The curry smells good, though.

127
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,920
He's just really shy around new people.

128
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,530
Who wouldn't be, after seeing me like that?

129
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,900
- I've made such a bad impression. - Still...

130
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,770
- Thank you. - Stop it.

131
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,040
I'll invite you when we're settled. You can meet Daniel properly then.

132
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm sure you two will hit it off.

133
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,450
Daniel.

134
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,450
Bye.

135
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,680
(Guide)

136
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,420
Without you,

137
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,890
what could I possibly do?

138
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,860
And without you,

139
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,970
what could I possibly do?

140
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
Another woman...

141
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,090
I've taken her into my arms.

142
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,120
You mean in your heart?

143
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,390
In my heart.

144
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,600
And in my flesh.

145
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,940
Does this woman have a spouse?

146
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,240
Her husband also passed away. A long time ago.

147
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,910
Do you love each other?

148
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
Yes.

149
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,220
If what I'm feeling is love...

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,590
Then I do love her.

151
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,060
Then what is the problem?

152
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,140
I'm so confused and tormented by this situation.

153
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,410
I feel like I'm having an affair,

154
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,650
and that I'm betraying my late wife.

155
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,690
Someone's in here.

156
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,730
Come on out.

157
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,000
Why, Father?

158
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,940
Julia is with our Lord now. How can you call it an affair?

159
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,610
I know, but Father...

160
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,380
For now, just call me Chang Sik.

161
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,850
I couldn't possibly.

162
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,120
Come on. Remember 20 years ago when you caught me sneaking a smoke,

163
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,460
and I kept chasing after Jun Kyung?

164
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm Moon Chang Sik, the problem child you used to scold.

165
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,760
Still...

166
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,970
You're just as uptight as ever.

167
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,370
Come on, sir.

168
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,710
What are you so afraid of?

169
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,510
It hasn't even been that long since my wife passed away.

170
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,580
So how long is long enough then? Six months?

171
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,150
Or a year?

172
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,220
Do you think Julia would want you to be alone, miserable like this?

173
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,799
- If you died, would she be lost? - Chang Sik.

174
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Yes?

175
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,130
No, no, Father...

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Chang Sik.

177
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,410
I must seem pretty pathetic, right? Coming to Confession for this.

178
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,210
Mr. Seo, you know our parishioners?

179
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,550
They complain about their husbands, complain about their wives,

180
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,390
doubt each other, fight, and are filled with regret.

181
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,420
It's always the same story.

182
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,820
When I'm hearing confessions,

183
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,860
I feel less like a priest and more like a marriage counsellor.

184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why bring their marital problems to a guy who's single?

185
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,000
- That must be hard, Chang Sik. - It is.

186
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,410
You don't need to blame yourself.

187
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,410
Loving someone is a blessing.

188
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,850
Yes, I get all that, but...

189
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,450
But we have to consider what others think.

190
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
Why on earth do you care so much about what other people think?

191
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
Hey, watch your tone.

192
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,130
There's no need to get upset.

193
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,150
Dear Lord.

194
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,980
Thank you for guiding me to become a priest...

195
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,420
and sparing me from the awful burden of marriage...

196
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,990
that people can't seem to let go of even after death.

197
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,560
For that, I am truly grateful.

198
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,070
Amen.

199
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Here, I'll get you a fork.

200
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,490
That's okay.

201
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,490
I want to get good at using chopsticks.

202
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,680
So this one...

203
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,550
You hold this one steady.

204
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,950
And with these two fingers,

205
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,720
you move it like this.

206
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,770
Did you have dinner yet?

207
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,210
I'm eating right now. Curry.

208
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,010
You said you were making it, and I got a craving for it.

209
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
Soo Jin.

210
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,050
How am I supposed to eat all of this?

211
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
There you go.

212
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,450
Thank you.

213
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,160
Nothing to thank me for.

214
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm the one who should be grateful.

215
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,970
When you're starting something new,

216
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,370
it's always hard.

217
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,240
And awkward.

218
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Eat up.

219
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,620
- Hey, Dad? - Yes?

220
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,190
That lady.

221
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,090
Do you like her?

222
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I guess so.

223
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,770
I mean, she's my girlfriend.

224
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,740
What do you think of her, Daniel?

225
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,150
Can I be honest?

226
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Of course.

227
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,420
I think she's crazy.

228
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,790
You're Sol's boyfriend, not that jerk.

229
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,700
So why are you slinking back here like some loser?

230
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,970
Next to the steak,

231
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,440
my pork cutlet looked so pathetic.

232
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,940
Hey. Not all steaks are the same,

233
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,180
and neither are all pork cutlets, you dummy.

234
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,480
Besides, what's wrong with Matna Tonkasu?

235
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,980
I want to believe our love is forever.

236
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,320
But do I have a place in Sol's future?

237
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,970
Around this time of year,

238
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,570
you can see Scorpio down there.

239
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,370
But I can't see it. Just like me.

240
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,410
Fading into the background. That's so you, Scorpio.

241
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,520
Scorpio horoscope.

242
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,520
Who even reads horoscopes anymore?

243
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,730
"Tangled emotions of others will leave you feeling overwhelmed."

244
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,100
"This is a time of great heartache from an unwanted love triangle,"

245
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,640
"so it is best to be prepared."

246
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,170
Yes, you'd better be prepared, Scorpio.

247
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,010
But wait, aren't you a Scorpio too?

248
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,760
(Guide)

249
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,230
Hello?

250
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,600
So you're not dead.

251
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,470
Excuse me?

252
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,969
If you're alive, why aren't you answering your phone?

253
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,040
Or am I dumped?

254
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,110
No. Dumped? Of course not.

255
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,720
- Are you playing hard to get, then? - Goodness, no. Of course not.

256
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,050
- I was just about to call you. - Liar.

257
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,850
I'm not! I'm absolutely not lying.

258
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,890
I was just about to call to ask if you wanted to meet tomorrow...

259
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,000
Weren't you just on the phone with someone?

260
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
On the phone?

261
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,370
What are you talking about? No, I wasn't.

262
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Bom.

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,410
What's with this guy?

264
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,740
But I'm sure I heard you talking.

265
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,210
Dad, what about dinner?

266
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,910
I was about to. And you?

267
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,480
I brought home some pork cutlets.

268
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,280
Pork cutlets.

269
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Sounds delicious.

270
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,320
- Let's eat together. Come on out. - Okay.

271
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,160
- Dad, by any chance... - What? What is it?

272
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,530
Do you ever talk to Mom's picture and stuff?

273
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
What?

274
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,510
Well...

275
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,150
I guess so. I do sometimes.

276
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,020
- Take your time. - Right, okay.

277
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
I will.

278
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,830
What do I do?

279
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,790
Gosh, what am I going to do?

280
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,340
Good.

281
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,710
Here.

282
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
What brings you here?

283
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,890
I should be asking about your getup.

284
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,990
- Dad, have you eaten? - We're just getting it ready.

285
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,610
Jun Kyung, don't you know the code?

286
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,680
Your mom insisted,

287
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,750
so I set it to your birthday.

288
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,190
You should've just made it my birthday.

289
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,590
Why use the birthday of someone who's not living here?

290
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,960
Then change it to your birthday.

291
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,460
You've been coming over a lot more lately, though.

292
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,000
So what if I have?

293
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,570
I, for one, am just happy we can all eat together often.

294
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,240
You should've visited this much when Mom was around.

295
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,680
So this is the first meal you made, Jun Kyung.

296
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,500
How is it? Is it good?

297
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,300
Of course it has to be.

298
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,700
It's the first dish you've ever made.

299
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,610
Really? That's a relief.

300
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,550
Right. For your first time cooking...

301
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,980
It tastes about how you'd expect.

302
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,020
But what's the occasion? You've never cooked in your life.

303
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,230
You brought so much. Just how much curry did you make?

304
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,930
Seriously, who were you planning to eat all this with?

305
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,829
You're supposed to make a lot of curry at once.

306
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,010
They say it tastes better over the next couple of days.

307
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
That's true.

308
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,780
So it'll taste better tomorrow, right?

309
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,610
What?

310
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,960
- Much better. - Sorry?

311
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,230
I'm saying it'll be even tastier.

312
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Right?

313
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,160
- Give me some more. - Should I?

314
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,730
But I wonder who would've told you that.

315
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,670
- Dad. - Yes?

316
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm seeing someone...

317
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,110
- What? - What?

318
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,550
What did you say?

319
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,150
What?

320
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,350
- What? - What?

321
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
What was it?

322
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,330
I'm seeing someone.

323
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,730
I know the timing is a little weird, but...

324
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,040
Are you okay with that?

325
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,650
Of course I am.

326
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,180
Liking someone...

327
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,620
is a true blessing.

328
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,120
Congratulations.

329
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Thank you.

330
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:05,530
This is how you come clean? How anticlimactic.

331
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,800
I should have held onto that card a little longer.

332
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
What a shame.

333
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,570
A big shame.

334
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,390
You still not done unpacking?

335
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,030
I'm all done.

336
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
I'm...

337
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,230
done too.

338
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
I see.

339
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,440
A little bare, isn't it?

340
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,280
You should put up some posters of idols or something.

341
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,580
And if you need anything, just let me know.

342
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,920
I don't.

343
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,920
Come on, what kind of son are you?

344
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,290
You're supposed to whine and ask your dad to buy you stuff.

345
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,960
Whine?

346
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,210
Let me spoil you a little.

347
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,780
Spoil me?

348
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,550
I just want us to be closer.

349
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Okay.

350
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,130
Finish up.

351
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,010
Daniel.

352
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,250
My girlfriend.

353
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,380
Would it be okay if I invited her over?

354
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,590
I want you...

355
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,560
to get along with my girlfriend.

356
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,740
Okay.

357
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,810
Really?

358
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,280
If you're happy,

359
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,680
then I'm happy too.

360
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,890
Your hair dye...

361
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,960
Yes, I stopped halfway through dyeing it.

362
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,520
Just these parts.

363
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,590
It looks weird, right?

364
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
- Let me see your phone. - What?

365
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,300
Why?

366
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,050
See? I knew it. "Guide?" Seriously?

367
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,220
I have a name, you know.

368
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,160
(Ja Yeong)

369
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,930
Then what do you have me saved as?

370
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,910
(Jin Ho)

371
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,750
All right, let's hear it.

372
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,260
Hear what?

373
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,390
Your excuse for not calling me for days...

374
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,830
after we spent the night together.

375
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
The truth is,

376
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,700
it made me terrified.

377
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,370
Of what?

378
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,340
The thought of people finding out about my feelings...

379
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,680
for you.

380
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,290
- So? - But now...

381
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,560
you've given me courage.

382
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,030
So I've made up my mind, just now.

383
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,530
No one else is going to live my life for me.

384
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
So...

385
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,030
I guess I have to find my own happiness.

386
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Right?

387
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,310
From now on, Ja Yeong, I'm not going to care what anyone else thinks.

388
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,410
Sir?

389
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,380
- Hey. - Sir.

390
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,820
- Hi. - What brings you here?

391
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,520
Me? Oh, you know.

392
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,060
It's a nice day, so I just came out for a walk.

393
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,560
- With her? - No, I don't know her.

394
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,530
- What about you? - We're promoting the Care Program.

395
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,170
Everyone else is over there.

396
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,540
- The Care Program? - Yes. You should come say hi.

397
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,470
- Should I? - Yes.

398
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,210
This way.

399
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,610
- I'm sorry. - Where are you...

400
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,510
It's our director.

401
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,280
- Hello, sir. - Hey. It's been a while.

402
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,400
Who are you?

403
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,930
A friend of mine is going on a trip and asked me to watch her,

404
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,230
so I brought her over this morning.

405
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,870
Which friend?

406
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,770
It's... You know.

407
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,140
The one who moved to Bundang or Dongtan. You don't know him?

408
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm sure you do.

409
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,350
I don't.

410
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,250
- Hey, you're handsome. - Jun Seo, she's a girl.

411
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,760
My bad. I mean, you're pretty.

412
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,630
Seeing this little one reminds me of raising you and Jun Kyung.

413
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,060
Feeding you on time, cleaning up after you, and playing with you.

414
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,930
You know, those were the most fun times of my life.

415
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,510
Hey. This guy Jun Kyung's seeing, what's he like?

416
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,740
Is he someone I know?

417
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,810
I've seen him once.

418
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,540
But I don't know if that counts as "knowing" him.

419
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,950
Well...

420
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,550
I'm sure he's a good guy.

421
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,420
What do you mean by "I'm sure?"

422
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,950
He must be, if he's willing to date Jun Kyung.

423
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,690
That's true.

424
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,560
- What's her name again? - What? Bom.

425
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,900
- Bom. - Bom.

426
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,340
It's an honour to meet you.

427
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,950
My name is Ju Do Hyun.

428
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,160
Thank you for suggesting we meet here.

429
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,930
Of course. It's only right.

430
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,930
I wanted to pay my respects.

431
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,410
This is unexpected.

432
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,580
This is where the person they loved is laid to rest,

433
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,820
but they don't seem all that sad.

434
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,550
Everyone's smiling.

435
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,130
I think enough time has passed.

436
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,900
So now,

437
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,970
when they miss them...

438
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,200
and want to see them,

439
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,510
they can come here with happy hearts.

440
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Is it this nice...

441
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
so that we'll visit often?

442
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,330
I'm okay, but it's my dad I'm worried about.

443
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,980
Hurrah!

444
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,780
Goodness. Hurrah!

445
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,320
Look, it's Mommy!

446
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,420
It's Mommy! Look, it's Mommy!

447
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,890
Hey, what time is it over there?

448
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,960
There's only a one-hour difference in Hong Kong.

449
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,800
One hour. I wouldn't know. I've never been abroad.

450
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,930
How's our little Bom doing?

451
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,610
I was just playing with her. She's hopping around so cutely.

452
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,470
I miss you, Bom.

453
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,810
- I'll see you in two days. - I miss you too.

454
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,750
I miss you too, Jin Ho.

455
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:06,390
I was so scared this kind of laser treatment would hurt,

456
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,460
but it doesn't hurt one bit.

457
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,900
See? I told you.

458
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,229
Jun Kyung, you should get it too while you're here.

459
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,230
Right?

460
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,170
No husband, kids, or mother-in-law.

461
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,310
She's got none of the stress that causes all those skin problems.

462
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,710
It's all about preventative care.

463
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,680
He's probably too old for something like this, right?

464
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,280
Of course. He's too busy with tutoring and extracurriculars.

465
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,950
Darn, what would be a good gift?

466
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,590
You're the mom of an eighth grader. Give me an idea.

467
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,990
- You're really thinking about this. - I can't go empty-handed, can I?

468
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,790
Just do what you always do. Isn't cash always king with you?

469
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,300
She hates wasting time and emotion, so she just throws money at things.

470
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Whatever. You can't just give a kid money.

471
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:52,310
Says the one who gave my daughters cash for their fourth birthday.

472
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,410
What's with the parent act? Do you really care what he thinks?

473
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,579
A good impression is impossible.

474
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,880
But I don't have to be the worst, do I?

475
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,480
What do you think? He'd like this, right?

476
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,690
You dare to guess what a middle schooler finds stylish?

477
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,090
Hey, this is it, right? This is the one.

478
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,460
All their classes are on that now. Every kid's got one.

479
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,700
Since when?

480
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
All done.

481
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,710
Already? Give me a mirror.

482
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,440
Oh, my gosh.

483
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,410
- Hey. - What?

484
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,180
- My skin looks so bright. - Right.

485
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Yes?

486
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,590
- Are you Ju Do Hyun? - Yes, that's me.

487
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,030
- Can I get your signature, please? - Right.

488
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Gosh.

489
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,040
- How did you think of such a gift? - Is it okay?

490
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,840
I went back and forth on it. Do you think Daniel will like it?

491
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,480
He'll love it, of course.

492
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,050
He would never even dream of a gift like this.

493
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,280
So, who's the lucky guy that gets to live in this house?

494
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,850
Look forward to finding out.

495
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,870
It feels so nice and cool out here. This is great.

496
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,540
They look happy.

497
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,060
- Yes. - May I come in?

498
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,430
Come on in.

499
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,100
All right, I got it.

500
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,170
Okay.

501
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,670
- I'll get going now. - You shouldn't have... All right.

502
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,480
Have a seat.

503
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,520
Any idea why I called you in?

504
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,760
I'm not sure, sir.

505
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Want a drink?

506
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Excuse me?

507
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,769
She should be focused on her work.

508
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,070
And yet, she never forgets things like this.

509
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,170
Should I consider this an effort too?

510
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,810
Let's see.

511
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,050
So, you resubmitted your assignment?

512
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,790
Yes.

513
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,790
Why'd you do that?

514
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,960
Were you annoyed because I chewed you out?

515
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,460
No. That's not it at all.

516
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,830
If that's not it, there's no reason you would've resubmitted.

517
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,730
The deadline passed, and your grade has already been finalized.

518
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,000
It was completely pointless.

519
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,070
It's just...

520
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,610
I wanted to know what it feels like to really put in the effort.

521
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,210
Effort?

522
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,350
Right, your undergraduate major was astronomy, wasn't it?

523
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,760
Yes.

524
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,290
That must be it.

525
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,160
You're a bit of an idealist.

526
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Thank you.

527
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
How would you like an internship?

528
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,040
What?

529
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,710
A former student at JCBC needs a media studies research intern,

530
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,180
and they asked me to recommend someone.

531
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,580
Hyo Jung was just here asking about that, actually.

532
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,510
It's funny, you know?

533
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,620
I try to be fair, but you can only do so much. Right?

534
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,160
Your attitude is much more endearing than this kind of thing.

535
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,870
So, you in or out?

536
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,240
Is the water temperature okay? Yes? You like it? You do!

537
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,880
You little rascal. You're so cute.

538
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,949
- Yes? - Dad,

539
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,420
I might get a research internship at a TV station.

540
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,320
- A research intern? - Yes.

541
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,060
Gosh, that sounds really impressive.

542
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,930
My professor is recommending me over all the grad and PhD students!

543
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,160
That's my boy! Incredible! Congratulations!

544
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,370
I'm going to be a little late tonight.

545
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,100
Sure. Go have a drink with your friends.

546
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,970
I've got to step out myself, so don't worry about it.

547
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,340
I might not even come home tonight.

548
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,370
Not coming home? Fine. Go out with your friends. Just stay out.

549
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,410
- Okay. - Hey, Dad.

550
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,450
I love you.

551
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,220
Bom, where'd you go? There she is.

552
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,660
Come here. That's it. There we go.

553
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,300
Let's get you all finished up.

554
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,230
There we go. So cute.

555
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,570
For real?

556
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,780
That's incredible, Seo Jun Seo!

557
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,810
This is seriously all thanks to you, so I'm paying for everything.

558
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,780
What did I tell you? I said you're not pathetic, right?

559
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,780
I told you you're awesome just the way you are, didn't I?

560
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,650
Those are the facts.

561
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Okay.

562
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,460
From pork cutlet, jjolmyeon, sushi, to tteokbokki. I'm buying, okay?

563
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,330
Thank you!

564
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,270
All right! I'm officially a working man!

565
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Hi.

566
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,560
Hey. You're here.

567
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,000
A half-moon betta.

568
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,830
Gosh.

569
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,270
It looks so mysterious.

570
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,740
But it looks a little lonely all by itself.

571
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,010
Should we get another one to be its friend?

572
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,080
This species isn't social, so they're usually kept alone.

573
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,250
In that case...

574
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,720
You can be its friend then, Daniel.

575
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,030
Once it fully adjusts to the tank, it'll come to the surface for food,

576
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,530
and they're as playful as puppies, so people call them "water dogs."

577
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,570
Pretty, isn't it?

578
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,010
Like I said, he's shy with new people.

579
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,610
You don't have to be shy with a fish, man.

580
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,120
Here, look.

581
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,490
Ja Yeong, it's time to come back to reality.

582
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,400
But I like this reality much better.

583
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,030
Bom, have you been a good girl?

584
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,030
Did you have fun playing with him?

585
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,540
It must have been tough.

586
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,910
Yes, it was torture. I was dying for some kimchi stew.

587
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,010
What? Kimchi stew?

588
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,210
I know this amazing place for kimchi stew.

589
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
Let's go.

590
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
Ja Yeong, come on in.

591
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,860
It's all right.

592
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,730
Goodness. This is so nice.

593
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,360
It's nothing special.

594
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,030
My son said he's coming home late tonight.

595
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,240
He might not even make it home.

596
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,910
As a welcome-home present, I'll make you kimchi stew.

597
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,040
I brought a gift too.

598
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,610
- A gift? - Matching T-shirts.

599
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,950
Matching T-shirts?

600
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,250
But...

601
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,820
- Are you sure it's okay to come in? - It's fine.

602
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,460
Ja Yeong, wait just a second. Hold on.

603
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
For crying out loud.

604
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Man.

605
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,940
(Eternal Love)

606
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,050
Is practice still not over?

607
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,150
What's taking so long?

608
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,060
Wait a minute.

609
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Gosh.

610
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,470
Hey, Auntie.

611
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,340
Hey. I have an errand in your neighbourhood,

612
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,870
so let me bring some young radish kimchi over.

613
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,110
You know how your dad loves it.

614
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,840
I'm stopping by after my errand. You're home, aren't you?

615
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,680
Your dad's not answering his phone.

616
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,080
I'm actually out right now.

617
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,450
Dad said he was going out soon too.

618
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,850
Really?

619
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,850
Then what am I supposed to do with all this?

620
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,970
Daniel, what do you like to do?

621
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,600
You know, hobbies and stuff.

622
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,910
Why?

623
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
Just curious.

624
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
I don't have any.

625
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,720
You like skateboarding, don't you?

626
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,090
You're always watching videos and practising tricks.

627
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,000
And he takes after me, so he loves music too.

628
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,500
But our tastes are a little different.

629
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,870
He's strictly into hip-hop.

630
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,840
Want some of this? It's really delicious.

631
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,550
- No, I'm good. - I feel bad eating this alone.

632
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,950
No, that's not...

633
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,590
Are you okay?

634
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
Yes.

635
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,460
Are you okay?

636
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
I'm fine.

637
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,090
I'm sorry, Dad.

638
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,870
It's okay. It was just an accident.

639
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
Yes?

640
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,730
I'm sorry, Jun Kyung.

641
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,430
For what?

642
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,630
I feel like I might have made things unnecessarily awkward.

643
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,400
If anyone was uncomfortable, it was Daniel, not me. Don't worry.

644
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,380
- So you were worried for nothing. - Yes.

645
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
It's fine.

646
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,050
What is it?

647
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,090
I'm just going to walk her out.

648
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,090
Jun Kyung, your clothes.

649
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,540
Daniel, see you around.

650
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,410
Hure.

651
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,350
Sorry? What does that mean?

652
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,950
It's nothing.

653
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,630
Come on, let's go.

654
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,070
I said I'd take you home.

655
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,570
Who hires a designated driver just for a ride? I'm fine, really.

656
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,950
What were you and Daniel talking about earlier?

657
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,890
It's a secret.

658
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,260
You have no idea.

659
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,230
About what?

660
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,470
Just how nervous I was.

661
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,540
I only just became a dad out of the blue.

662
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,410
And then introducing my girlfriend...

663
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,220
to the son who just popped into my life.

664
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,460
You made a real effort,

665
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,360
and I'm so grateful for that.

666
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,870
- It's here. - It's here.

667
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,730
- Here you go. - This looks amazing.

668
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,630
Thank you for the meal.

669
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,240
So? What do you think?

670
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,270
You were right, this place is great.

671
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,340
- It's so delicious. - That's a relief.

672
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,150
Ja Yeong, try the rolled omelet.

673
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,760
This is so good. How are you such an amazing cook?

674
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,700
Why are you looking at me like that? You're making me blush.

675
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
Because you're beautiful.

676
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,780
Because you look so beautiful, enjoying the food I made for you.

677
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,060
It's fine, sir.

678
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,330
Of course. Yes.

679
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Right.

680
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,670
Okay, take care.

681
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,270
They said the sports center won't pay until next week.

682
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,110
See? This is why you don't deliver before you get paid. Right?

683
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,180
People these days.

684
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,920
You'd think there'd be some trust, you know?

685
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,190
They'll probably pay eventually.

686
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,430
They wouldn't just stiff us, would they?

687
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,070
Yes, who would stiff us over that? They'll pay.

688
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,070
So, what's on your mind?

689
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,710
Even when I'm lost in my worries about making ends meet,

690
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,310
I start worrying if Jin Ho is eating properly,

691
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:44,750
and I worry he might suddenly get sick all by himself.

692
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,820
Gosh, it just breaks my heart.

693
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,200
You're back. You said you were craving meat.

694
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,270
So I bought a ton of pork belly.

695
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,370
Check this out.

696
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,710
Hey, why haven't you been answering your phone?

697
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,410
I had some really great news today.

698
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,410
You're not going to believe it.

699
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,520
Jun Seo.

700
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,060
I was with Beom Jun.

701
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,090
Whatever. I don't get jealous over stuff like that anymore, okay?

702
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,990
I'm not jealous one bit. Seriously, not at all.

703
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,730
Hurry up and wash up. I'll have this ready for you.

704
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,240
I slept with Beom Jun.

705
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,910
Gosh.

706
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,780
Six, five, two, seven.

707
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,549
Here. I'll be back...

708
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,490
- after putting this in the fridge. - Okay.

709
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,470
- Stop it. I'll do it. - No, it's fine.

710
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Goodness.

711
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Mi Kyung.

712
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Hure.

713
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,120
(Hure in German)

714
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,760
There are moments in life.

715
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,930
Jin Ho, you weren't answering your phone.

716
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,540
- So incredibly sudden... - Who are you?

717
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,870
And impossible to escape.

718
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,050
What did you just say?

719
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,050
I'm sorry.

720
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,590
Impossible to understand...

721
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,060
and impossible to accept.

722
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,800
Sorry for what?

723
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,340
Just bleak and endless.

724
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,840
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

725
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,139
(Hure: Prostitute)

726
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,850
When things are utterly out of your control.

727
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,150
Just one of those wretched moments.

728
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,160
I asked who you were!

729
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,190
That all-too-familiar moment...

730
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,800
had found me once again.

731
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,250
(Love Me)
