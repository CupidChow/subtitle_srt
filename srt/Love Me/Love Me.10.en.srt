1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,110
(Seo Hyun Jin)

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,550
(Yoo Jae Myung)

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,650
(Lee Si Woo)

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,830
(Yoon Se A)

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,240
(Chang Ryul)

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,980
(Dahyun)

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,720
(Love Me)

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,930
(Love Me)

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,230
All right, let's try that again.

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,580
Let's keep that and go for one more take.

11
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,590
Let's do it one more time.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,330
We'll keep that and go again.

13
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,330
We'll keep this one too.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Gyu Hee.

15
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,770
Gyu Hee.

16
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Gyu Hee.

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,380
- I can't do this. - Gosh, what's wrong?

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,820
Of all days for Na Ra to get sick, it had to be today.

19
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,390
And you had to go and make the song so difficult.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,460
Where do we find someone to pull this off on short notice?

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,530
What about Hui Jeong?

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,100
Hui Jeong? You think I didn't already call her?

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,800
She saw the score and said she'd need a week to practice.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,370
I'm not trying to blame you, but you could've been more flexible.

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,780
This is definitely...

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Yoon Ju?

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,750
You really did just fall out of the sky.

28
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,680
I heard you were back in town,

29
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,320
but I can't believe you're actually here.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,990
Hi, Do Hyun.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,300
Hey, Jun Kyung, have you eaten yet?

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,030
I was waiting to eat with you, so not yet.

33
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,370
Are you going to be much longer?

34
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,840
It's going to take a little longer.

35
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,670
I'll probably grab a bite with Jung Hoon later,

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
so go ahead and eat without me.

37
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,880
You must be starving.

38
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,390
Jin Ho.

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,760
Have you seen my Bom?

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,730
It's just that I can't find Bom.

41
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,170
Ja Yeong.

42
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,370
Are you okay?

43
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,770
I must have dozed off.

44
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,710
I was dreaming about Bom.

45
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,980
The dream felt so real, I thought she was actually here.

46
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,190
Goodness.

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,720
So it was a dream.

48
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,330
I must have scared you.

49
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,790
Gosh.

50
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,630
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, and one more thing. You'll need about 5,000 dollars ready.

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,570
A lot of people are competing to teach these electives,

53
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,910
and it's a desirable position, so that amount isn't out of line.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,720
All right. Wrap things up and come quick.

55
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,530
The director loved it.

56
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,640
- Send Jung Hoon your account info. - Gosh, so transactional.

57
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,240
Thank you.

58
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,950
- Enjoy your meal. - We will, thank you.

59
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,180
It's been ages since I've had hagfish.

60
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,390
Playing earlier brought back so many memories.

61
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,060
Remember that street piano in Jongno from our freshman year?

62
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,060
I played your piece on it back then, remember?

63
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,270
A huge crowd gathered around us. Remember that?

64
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,640
Do you have any idea how much I liked you back then?

65
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,620
Come on, we don't need to be awkward about old memories.

66
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,560
I was thinking about the old days earlier too.

67
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,790
Back then,

68
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,130
I really liked you too.

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
But...

70
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,670
like you said,

71
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,870
it's all in the past.

72
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm sorry, but I should get going.

73
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,230
Jun Kyung is waiting for me. I don't feel right staying longer.

74
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Then what about me?

75
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,370
You're the one I need right now.

76
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,230
We were over a long time ago.

77
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,770
I'll do my best as Daniel's father,

78
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,070
but there's nothing more between us.

79
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,270
Do Hyun, where are you going? Hey!

80
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,910
Do Hyun!

81
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,510
(Grilled hagfish, eel noodles, pork rind)

82
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,960
I know.

83
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,660
I know Jun Kyung is with Do Hyun now.

84
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
But it's only been two years.

85
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,340
We go way back.

86
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,510
And we have...

87
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,610
Daniel.

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,350
I just figured I had the upper hand.

89
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,850
Come on, it's not a competition.

90
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,230
So,

91
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,960
what are you going to do now?

92
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,830
I don't know.

93
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
What am I supposed to do now?

94
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,610
Both joy and sorrow...

95
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,520
always seem to come out of nowhere.

96
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,590
This feels especially true for sorrow.

97
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,600
There's a certain tribe in Africa...

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,470
that believed that rain was a sign of the Almighty's sorrow.

99
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,270
When it rained, they wouldn't leave their village...

100
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,170
until the rain stopped.

101
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,380
Not until the sun was shining and the ground was dry.

102
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,090
Here in Seoul, unforeseen rain is falling.

103
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,960
Could it be a sign of sorrow...

104
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,160
that the Almighty is sending us?

105
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,230
Listeners,

106
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,660
did you remember your umbrellas?

107
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
With Bom...

108
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,110
She'd stay still when I'd pet her like this.

109
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,680
I can still feel how soft the back of her head was.

110
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,220
The happy memories...

111
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,850
are what make things harder.

112
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,890
If I'd known it would be this hard,

113
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,030
I wouldn't have tried to be so happy.

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,530
I wonder if that Oblivion Package is still a thing.

115
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,510
Remember the tourists on Jeju, when we were eating?

116
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,010
- Jin Ho. - Yes?

117
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,850
Do you hear that?

118
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,490
The rain?

119
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,990
Jun Kyung, where have you been?

120
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,290
You're soaked. You should have taken an umbrella.

121
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,490
It's like an umbrella can be right by your side,

122
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,460
but it's never there when you actually need it.

123
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,240
I lied to you, Jun Kyung.

124
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Earlier,

125
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
when you called me,

126
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,490
I was with Yoon Ju.

127
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,030
I was worried you'd be uncomfortable if you knew,

128
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
so I couldn't tell you.

129
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,870
I thought it was better to lie.

130
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,820
I went by the studio earlier.

132
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,570
Thank you for being honest with me.

133
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,400
I've been giving this a lot of thought,

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and...

135
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,370
I hope that moment is now.

136
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,850
When you need me,

137
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,780
and even when you don't,

138
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,490
I...

139
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,960
will always be by your side, Jun Kyung.

140
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,070
Jun Kyung.

141
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,580
Will you marry me?

142
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,650
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, Jun Kyung.

143
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,520
- Is now a bad time? - No, it's fine. What's up?

144
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,720
It's not a big deal,

145
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,820
but it's about Ja Yeong.

146
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,890
I thought she was doing better here,

147
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,460
but lately, she's been having trouble sleeping,

148
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,300
she seems much more on edge,

149
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,630
and she just seems depressed.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,130
I've heard of something called Pet Loss Syndrome.

151
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,400
Maybe that's what she's going through?

152
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,170
Pet Loss Syndrome?

153
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,740
Yes. It's after you lose a pet.

154
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,340
I heard a lot of people even go to therapy for it.

155
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,920
They were family, after all.

156
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,620
Jun Kyung. Why don't you all come visit sometime?

157
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,860
I haven't seen you all in a while, and I miss Daniel too.

158
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,560
We will, Dad.

159
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,730
I'm sorry for not checking in.

160
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,230
I know you're busy. Thanks.

161
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,200
- Okay. - Jun Kyung.

162
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,170
And you're doing okay, right?

163
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
I'm doing fine.

164
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,950
All right, I'll see you soon, Jun Kyung.

165
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,750
Okay.

166
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Ja Yeong.

167
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,530
What are you looking at so intently?

168
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,110
The five-day market should be open. Want to go check it out?

169
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,080
We can pick up a few things we need,

170
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,010
and grab some jjajangmyeon while we're there.

171
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,050
Jin Ho.

172
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,650
Yes?

173
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,820
Do you think...

174
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,690
we rushed into moving here?

175
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,360
I wonder if running away like that was the right decision.

176
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,530
Jin Ho.

177
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Jin Ho?

178
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,310
You don't like it here?

179
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,580
- What? - Answer me. Don't you like it here?

180
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,680
- It's not that... - You were the one who said it.

181
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,710
You wanted to see the first flowers bloom,

182
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,280
get the first kiss of the sun,

183
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,050
step on the first fallen leaves. You'd like a place like this.

184
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,420
You're the one who told me that, Ja Yeong.

185
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,960
What do you mean, "running away"? We're not running from anything.

186
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,800
I was just feeling a bit suffocated, and...

187
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,630
I didn't really mean anything by it.

188
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,770
I'm sorry.

189
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
I guess I was being a little sensitive.

190
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,420
You're living with Jun Kyung, right?

191
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,190
Which means you're basically in a common-law marriage already.

192
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,730
All you have to do is take just one more step.

193
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,700
Just one more step.

194
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,170
But for Jun Kyung, that one step is the hard part.

195
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I know.

196
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
It's because...

197
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,580
my job isn't stable, and...

198
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,310
- I have a kid too. - If there's even a one percent...

199
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,920
of ulterior motive in his proposal,

200
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
it'd just feel wrong.

201
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,820
It's not because of her.

202
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,690
And it's not because of the kid.

203
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,560
If it's not because of his ex,

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,130
then what on earth is it?

205
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,630
I'm telling you, it's not about you.

206
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,970
For Jun Kyung, the issue is with marriage itself.

207
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,410
It's... How should I put this?

208
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,940
She's already gone through countless mental rehearsals...

209
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,310
and run pointless simulations in her head.

210
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,220
It's typical for smart pessimists who think they know it all.

211
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,420
The point is, whether it's you or someone else,

212
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,560
it's not a problem with her partner. You get me?

213
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,890
What I mean is, for Jun Kyung, it's about herself.

214
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,000
This compulsion to never, ever fail? This perfectionism?

215
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,330
That's what's kicking in.

216
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,430
I'm the problem.

217
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
You don't get it, do you?

218
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
No.

219
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,250
I really don't get it,

220
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,250
and I can't relate at all.

221
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,220
Do Hyun is a really great guy.

222
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,160
He's the one who made me realise that joy and happiness...

223
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,660
all come from our relationships with others.

224
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Then why?

225
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I don't have the confidence.

226
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,240
It's already overwhelming dealing with what I expect.

227
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
If something unexpected happens between us,

228
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,010
a tragedy that's completely out of our control,

229
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,890
I'm sure I'd want to run away and let it all go.

230
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,890
Right.

231
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,060
Your dad had it...

232
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,060
really tough.

233
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,170
No.

234
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,140
It's because I imagine how hard it was for my mom.

235
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,340
She couldn't hold on, but she couldn't let go either.

236
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,580
She must have been in so much agony.

237
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,010
- How's it going? - It's a total train wreck.

238
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
And Jun Kyung?

239
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,550
She's being sincere.

240
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,910
Sincere enough to turn down a diamond.

241
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,480
I've never seen Do Hyun look so serious.

242
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Don't tell me...

243
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,320
They're not going to break up, are they?

244
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,790
A couple in their prime fails to take the next step?

245
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,130
- The chances are high. - No way, they're so in love.

246
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,240
The culmination of love is marriage. It's the destiny of a social animal.

247
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,640
Love and marriage are inseparable. They're a package deal.

248
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,110
If you realise there's no future with someone,

249
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,880
it's instinct to go out and find someone who is.

250
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,810
Are you very disappointed?

251
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
No.

252
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
A little.

253
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm disappointed.

254
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,450
Your own...

256
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,950
special moment,

257
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
will come. I truly believe that it will.

258
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,930
I'll be waiting eagerly. I really will.

259
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,850
Thank you for understanding.

260
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,070
Gosh, this is all rotted out.

261
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,940
Oh, you scared me! You really startled me.

262
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,150
Are you sure you can handle that?

263
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,520
You've never done this before. Shouldn't you call a professional?

264
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,890
What? It's my own house. I can't always call for help.

265
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,960
I've got to do it myself.

266
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,229
- Need a hand? - No, it's fine.

267
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,990
It's dangerous. Go on, get down.

268
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,600
It's dangerous. Get down.

269
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,200
Are you still sulking?

270
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,970
Sulking? Who's sulking?

271
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Just get down already.

272
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,780
All right.

273
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,280
What does she take me for? Watch me fix this perfectly.

274
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,890
Okay. A little thing like this?

275
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,090
Okay, here we go.

276
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,860
Goodness, this thing is loud.

277
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,990
See? Nothing to it.

278
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,229
- Oh, no! - Jin Ho!

279
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,870
Ja Yeong, help me! I've been shot!

280
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,240
What am I going to do about this?

281
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,910
- Look at this! What do we do? - What do we do?

282
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,740
No, don't! It's dangerous! Get back!

283
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,810
- Oh, no! - Just do something about this!

284
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
- Like what? - Don't pull it!

285
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,050
(Bom Campground)

286
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,249
- Hey, you brat! You little... - Come here.

287
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,290
My goodness.

288
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,560
Did you just laugh?

289
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,100
I'm sorry, Jin Ho.

290
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,440
It's just, you look so ridiculous right now...

291
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,540
- What? - I can't believe this!

292
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,510
Goodness.

293
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,380
- Cheers. - Cheers.

294
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,220
Feels good to be done, right? You worked hard.

295
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,120
Hey, I told you I'd treat you to something even better.

296
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,960
Whenever I was up writing late at night,

297
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,090
I'd get a huge craving for a thick, loaded seafood pancake like this.

298
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,530
I told myself I'd get one tomorrow, but then I'd forget,

299
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,200
and then the craving would hit again in the middle of the night.

300
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,940
You seem to be in a really good mood.

301
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,440
- Looks like you have good news. - Gosh, is it that obvious?

302
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,980
Okay, let me brag for a second.

303
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,350
My boyfriend isn't a professor,

304
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,250
but it looks like he's going to be teaching at the university.

305
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,320
So it's a double celebration!

306
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,990
I just assumed you'd heard the news too.

307
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,420
Heard what?

308
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,070
I've printed the sophomore materials and am now organising the juniors'.

309
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,200
Thanks.

310
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Oh, right.

311
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,010
I heard from Professor Choi.

312
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,580
- Congratulations. - It's all thanks to you, Professor.

313
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Thank you.

314
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,720
The semester's almost over,

315
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,250
so finish strong.

316
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,720
- Yes, sir. - Okay. Finish up and then head out.

317
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,589
If you need anything while prepping for lectures,

318
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,130
or if you have any questions or run into trouble,

319
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,460
don't hesitate to let me know.

320
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,000
Professor?

321
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,270
Yes? What's up?

322
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
Well...

323
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,880
If you have something, spit it out. I have to get to class.

324
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,080
It's nothing. I'll do my best to finish strong.

325
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,120
- All right! - All right!

326
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,860
Hey, you have a minute? I wanted to ask you something.

327
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
Yes, go ahead.

328
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,100
This is kind of random, but...

329
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,300
Nowadays, do lecturers still have to give their supervising professor...

330
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,640
money or something?

331
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,780
Who even does that anymore?

332
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,610
Why?

333
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,680
Don't tell me... Professor Song?

334
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,250
No. Someone just asked me about it.

335
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,050
Okay, thanks. I'll talk to you later.

336
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,950
Bye.

337
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
What?

338
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
You're here?

339
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,839
- Jun Seo, wake up. - Why?

340
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,940
- Get up. Give me your hand. - Why?

341
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,950
Goodness. Gosh.

342
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,450
- What is it? - Our big-mouthed writer said...

343
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,220
- Yes? - I...

344
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,890
won the Grand Prize!

345
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,190
Really?

346
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,170
In the Woori-deul Publishing Contest,

347
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,740
I won the Grand Prize!

348
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,570
- Hey, good job. - Oh, my! I can't believe it!

349
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,110
- All your hard work paid off. - I'm so happy!

350
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,620
- You packed a toothbrush and towel? - Yes, I got everything.

351
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,420
You've wanted to go camping, Daniel, so this is perfect.

352
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,960
Yes. And Jun Seo and Hye On are so much fun.

353
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,770
Mom, what are you going to do?

354
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
While I'm gone?

355
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,170
I have plenty to do.

356
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,210
- I'll see my friends and have fun. - Mom.

357
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You should still...

358
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
feed Oscar.

359
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,050
Don't forget.

360
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,620
Hey, do you really think I'd forget to feed Oscar?

361
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,620
No, that's not it.

362
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,060
It's just that I once didn't feed him on purpose.

363
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,560
Because of Ms. Seo.

364
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I was so mad at her.

365
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
I think Dad's here.

366
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,110
- Mom, I'm heading out. - Okay, have fun.

367
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,320
Gosh, you're washing my face and even my hair.

368
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,450
I'm really getting the royal treatment.

369
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,650
Getting hurt was totally worth it.

370
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,590
Maybe I'll injure my right hand. Then you'd have to feed me, right?

371
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,600
Would you please be quiet? Everyone will be here any minute.

372
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,030
Here comes the water.

373
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,240
Oh, so refreshing.

374
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,040
(Bom Campground)

375
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,710
- Dad. - Hey, glad you made it.

376
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,850
- Hello. - Hi, welcome.

377
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,180
- It's good to see you. - Hello. Hey, Dad.

378
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,420
- Gosh, look how tall you've gotten! - She's so pretty.

379
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,590
I got taller, didn't I?

380
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Hey!

381
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,290
Get it! Come on!

382
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,830
- Did you get it? - Jun Kyung! Look at this!

383
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,230
I can't believe this.

384
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,570
There are so many fish, but I can't seem to catch any.

385
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,010
Come on, how could you miss that? Seriously, how did you not catch it?

386
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,310
It's cold.

387
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,510
What's the problem?

388
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Do Hyun...

389
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,560
The more I see of him, the more I like him.

390
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,890
You think so too, Mom?

391
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,730
I do. You two look wonderful together.

392
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,270
Why are you hesitating?

393
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,450
Jun Kyung.

394
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,820
My life wasn't just a series of hardships.

395
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,520
You may not understand it right now,

396
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,290
and that can be scary,

397
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,630
but as you go through life, you'll understand.

398
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,770
That love isn't just about the joy...

399
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,810
and happiness of being together.

400
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,580
When you look at someone and your heart just aches,

401
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,490
and you feel for them,

402
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,560
that's also a part of love.

403
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,630
For me, all of it was happiness,

404
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,130
and I was grateful for every moment.

405
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,210
The part of me that wanted to let go...

406
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,980
and wanted to run away...

407
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,120
I'm so sorry that you saw that side of me.

408
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,730
Jun Kyung.

409
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Don't be afraid.

410
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,240
You, Jun Kyung,

411
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,170
are so much stronger than I ever was.

412
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,220
Yes, I got one!

413
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,720
There are so many!

414
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
Jun Kyung!

415
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,990
- Look at this! Fish! - Look at this!

416
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
There are a ton!

417
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,700
Hey, awesome, right?

418
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,840
All right, everyone.

419
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,210
- That's way too much. What do I do? - Bottoms up!

420
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,440
- You guys! - No way!

421
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,210
- I give up. - Cheers!

422
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,720
- Here you go. - Thank you.

423
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,450
- Cheers. - Gosh, this is good.

424
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,000
All right.

425
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,670
I'll find the hope my anxiety has been hiding.

426
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,100
Even if I can't be the person I imagine,

427
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,810
I won't be disappointed.

428
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm going to try and trust myself.

429
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,950
The moment I made up my mind,

430
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,250
I realised something.

431
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,690
Why was I even...

432
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,530
hesitating?

433
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,400
- He ate two whole peppers. Oh, no! - He did?

434
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,000
I can't with you. Dad, seriously!

435
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,810
He ate them himself.

436
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,580
- There's something I need to say. - Yes?

437
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,020
I'm going to marry Do Hyun.

438
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
If this was your plan,

439
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,380
you should've just said yes from the start.

440
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,450
Why did you...

441
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,290
have to put me through all that?

442
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,590
Because back then, that's truly how I felt.

443
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,000
So that sincerity...

444
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,330
What made you change your mind?

445
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,870
Greed?

446
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,580
I couldn't get that diamond ring out of my head.

447
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,590
The more I thought about it,

448
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,530
I can't find a single reason not to marry you.

449
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Ju Do Hyun.

450
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,250
Will you marry me?

451
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,990
Are you...

452
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,990
proposing to me right now?

453
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,530
Yes.

454
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,770
Yes.

455
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,070
Jun Kyung.

456
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,210
I will marry you.

457
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
I miss those days.

458
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,930
How you'd escort me after my performances.

459
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,360
Just a manager doing her job.

460
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,570
How's it going? Any luck with what you went to Korea for?

461
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,270
It's not that easy.

462
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,310
Why not?

463
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,510
Didn't you want it more than anything?

464
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,580
It seems someone else wants it more than I do.

465
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,020
Yoon Ju, you said you were suffocating here.

466
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,450
You went there so you could finally live.

467
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,460
What are you doing, drinking alone on your birthday?

468
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,560
I miss you, Anna.

469
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,030
Then come back.

470
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,200
You can come back anytime. You have family here too, you know.

471
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,910
Me.

472
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,740
Thanks, Anna.

473
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Daniel.

474
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
What did you think?

475
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,730
It was fun.

476
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
No.

477
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
I don't mean that.

478
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,910
About me...

479
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,750
and Jun Kyung...

480
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,150
getting married.

481
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,690
Well,

482
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,190
I'm fine with it.

483
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,240
Mom will probably be fine with it too.

484
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,690
Should we keep it...

485
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,330
a secret from Mom for now?

486
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,370
Yes.

487
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Okay.

488
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
As for your mom,

489
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,570
I'll be the one to tell her.

490
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Congratulations.

491
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
Dad.

492
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,290
Sorry I didn't say it sooner.

493
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,770
Thanks for taking our Jun Seo in and feeding him.

494
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,310
But hey,

495
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,650
you can just take the bed. Are you sure you'll be comfy there?

496
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,450
I love it here. I'm going to sleep right here.

497
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,420
- Well, if you insist... - This is great.

498
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,590
This feels like a getaway with my besties.

499
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,800
I know, right?

500
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,030
I have a feeling this will be a night to remember.

501
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,070
I don't want this night to end.

502
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,570
Then let's not let it end.

503
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,310
What?

504
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:15,420
Then how about we have just one more beer?

505
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,020
- Deal! - Deal!

506
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,450
I'll go get them!

507
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Here we go.

508
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
Dad, you're still up?

509
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,740
I can't sleep.

510
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
What about you?

511
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,780
I can't either.

512
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,690
Why aren't you in bed?

513
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,520
I don't think we'll get any sleep tonight.

514
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,860
We're too busy chatting.

515
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,130
Weren't you here to get this?

516
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,700
It's fine, we have more.

517
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Here you go.

518
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,440
- Cheers. - Cheers.

519
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Congratulations.

520
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,480
I heard you're going to be teaching next semester.

521
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,050
Hye On was bragging about you.

522
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,890
Thanks.

523
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,460
Look at you, all grown up.

524
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,500
I thought you'd tease Do Hyun, saying he'll regret marrying me.

525
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,200
What, you think I'm a kid?

526
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,110
I used to have...

527
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,980
a couple of worries about you two.

528
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,280
Our Jun Kyung is pretty, smart, and has it all.

529
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,990
But it was a shame she hadn't met someone to love.

530
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,260
And for Jun Seo...

531
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,390
He's handsome, kind, a great kid.

532
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,500
But a shame he hadn't found a career he was passionate about.

533
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,670
But all that worrying was for nothing.

534
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,710
Jun Kyung, congratulations.

535
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,040
- Thank you. - Jun Seo, you keep working hard.

536
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Okay.

537
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,050
Thank you, kids. I know I...

538
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,890
haven't really done much for you.

539
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,800
On a day like today,

540
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,230
I wish your mother could have been here to see this.

541
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,150

00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,880
(Professor Choi Sung Min, Media and Communication)

552
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,710
Jun Seo and I came here all the time as kids.

553
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,580
- The soup here is amazing. - Right.

554
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,440
The soup? Should we sit here?

555
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,150
Yes, let's sit here.

556
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,520
Jun Kyung...

557
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,450
Chang Sik, long time no see!

558
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,850
- How've you been? You been good? - Yes. Good.

559
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,820
And this is?

560
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,890
This is my boyfriend.

561
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,860
My fiance.

562
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,800
Hello. Nice to meet you.

563
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,640
What has Jun Kyung told you about me?

564
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,510
She mentioned a classmate of hers became a priest.

565
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,050
Just a classmate, is that it?

566
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,860
- Yes, that's it. - Right.

567
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,930
It seems our Jun Kyung really likes Mr. Do Jun...

568
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,460
It's Do Hyun. Ju Do Hyun.

569
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,930
Right, I'm sorry.

570
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,170
It seems our Jun Kyung must really love you, Do Hyun.

571
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,540
For her to just brush me off as a "classmate."

572
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,910
Of course.

573
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,880
I guess you don't need to know everything.

574
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,760
Yes, I think that's for the best.

575
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,930
It's probably better if you don't know.

576
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,860
- Here you go. - You're back? Thanks.

577
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,570
I'm not letting anyone else officiate your wedding.

578
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,270
What are you talking about?

579
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,100
You must wed in our Catholic Church. No exceptions.

580
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,610
That'd be amazing. Thank you.

581
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,210
It's so hard to book a venue these days.

582
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,340
- Jun Kyung. - Won Yeong! Hey!

583
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,550
I just moved into this neighbourhood.

584
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,250
Really? That's awesome.

585
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,220
But who's...

586
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,890
This is the priest from the local Catholic church.

587
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,450
He's just an old high school friend.

588
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,060
- This is my boyfriend. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

589
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,530
Nice to meet you too.

590
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,260
But...

591
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,500
you look so familiar. Have we met?

592
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,800
I know, right?

593
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,340
You look really familiar to me too...

594
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,870
- The convenience store... - Do you have a criminal record?

595
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,910
Excuse me?

596
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:26,350
I was so stressed I couldn't even taste the pork cutlet.

597
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,790
If I mess up with you a little bit in this town,

598
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,220
I'd be in serious trouble, wouldn't I?

599
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,590
You're just figuring that out now?

600
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,390
I'm starting to have second thoughts about this marriage.

601
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,700
Then go ahead and call it off.

602
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,240
What? No, I can't do that.

603
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,070
Our whole future is right there in front of us.

604
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,880
Goodness.

605
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,979
For our second kid, would you prefer a boy...

606
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,480
or a girl?

607
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,150
What? Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

608
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,550
I'm thinking a girl for the second, then a boy after that.

609
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,760
Says who there's going to be an "after that"?

610
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,860
For now,

611
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,960
we've at least agreed that our next baby will be a girl, right?

612
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:21,330
Who did? Did I? I don't think so.

613
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,710
Jin Ho. Aren't you ready yet?

614
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,540
Just a second. Okay, I'm done.

615
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,880
I think it looks awkward.

616
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,150
Hurry, come out. Let me see how you look.

617
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,350
It's weird, right?

618
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,150
It is weird. I knew it.

619
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,220
Shoot!

620
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,000
What's wrong? Is something not right with it?

621
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,430
Hurry up. I feel so awkward.

622
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,540
This is awkward. Hurry up.

623
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,110
Okay, hold on. I'm coming.

624
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,710
Let's go. Come on.

625
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,920
Leg. One, two, three.

626
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,090
Say cheese!

627
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,260
Simple happiness, without anyone ever knowing...

628
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,200
can fill our lives to the brim.

629
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:01,870
What?

630
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,270
- Ta-da. - Living our ordinary,

631
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,940
everyday lives...

632
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,510
Just these moments alone...

633
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,550
are fulfilling enough,

634
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,890
so I never expected greater happiness...

635
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,030
nor did I even wish for it.

636
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,100
But life...

637
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,300
has a way of bringing unexpected moments...

638
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,640
and placing them right before us.

639
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,710
My period was late, so I thought I was pregnant.

640
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,550
Are you disappointed?

641
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,720
I guess I got my hopes up.

642
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,020
But now that it's negative,

643
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,260
I'm more worried than I am disappointed.

644
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,370
What's the rush? There's no need to hurry.

645
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,700
We haven't even had the wedding yet,

646
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,570
and to be honest,

647
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,540
I've barely even been trying this whole time.

648
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,680
Just wait until I start trying day and night.

649
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,880
But what if...

650
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,250
there's something wrong with me?

651
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,880
What could be wrong with you, Jun Kyung?

652
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,630
I'm an OB-GYN, you know.

653
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,270
I'm 38, and this would be my first.

654
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,610
Should we go get tested?

655
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,110
How can I get tested at my own hospital?

656
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,180
It'd be embarrassing at our hospital.

657
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,780
We'll just go to a different hospital.

658
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,520
Let's go together, and we'll both get tested.

659
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,750
Why? You're fine, Do Hyun.

660
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,760
That's what couples are supposed to do.

661
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,660
They go and get tested together.

662
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,130
It's a mountain road.

663
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,530
It gets dark fast. Be careful.

664
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,900
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.

665
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,890
The number dialled is unavailable. Please leave a message.

666
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,320
What masterpiece are you so absorbed in...

667
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,090
that you can't even answer your phone?

668
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,110
(Searching for driver)

669
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,320
- Hello? - Hey, where are you?

670
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,760
- I'm at the university. Where else? - You're going to be late again?

671
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,390
You know how my professor got that research grant.

672
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,060
He asked me to help, so what can I do?

673
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
My professor's calling me.

674
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,500
I'll be late tonight, so don't wait up.

675
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,400
Okay.

676
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,950
I'm at what looks like a plaza right now.

677
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,950
- Okay. Yes. - Hurry up! Come on!

678
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,020
- Come on, hurry up! - Just one more.

679
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,220
- Just one more. - What time is it? Let's go!

680
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,020
- What time is it? We gotta go. - Hold on! What?

681
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,790
- The car over there! Let's go. - Okay, I see it.

682
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,330
The number dialled is unavailable. Please leave a message.

683
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,020
Ja Yeong!

684
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,270
Ja Yeong! Why aren't you answering your phone?

685
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,470
I've been looking all over for you.

686
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,210
What are you doing out here? Seriously.

687
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,290
Ja Yeong?

688
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,060
Are you okay?

689
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,630
I don't know where I am.

690
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,840
I don't know what I was doing here.

691
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,470
I suddenly can't remember.

692
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,780
I was so scared.

693
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,650
I wanted to get home.

694
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,880
I was trying to get back to you, Jin Ho.

695
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,690
I don't know where this is, where I am,

696
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,490
and I don't know the way home.

697
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,930
It's okay. You're okay.

698
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. Okay?

699
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,670
It's just dark out. That's why.

700
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,200
The path is dark, and all the trees look the same.

701
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,570
- Even I would have gotten lost. - No.

702
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,940
When we first moved here, I loved this forest so much...

703
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,110
I walked this path every single day without fail. You know I did.

704
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,180
How could I...

705
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,920
not know the way?

706
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,970
Your results look good.

707
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,600
Conceiving won't be an issue.

708
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,640
Really? That's such a relief.

709
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,240
See? I told you it would be fine.

710
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,410
However, about your results, Mr. Ju...

711
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,080
Yes?

712
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,650
I'm afraid your results were negative.

713
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,490
What do you mean, negative?

714
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,530
What does that mean?

715
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,770
It means you're infertile.

716
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,770
That's impossible.

717
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,180
Of course, nothing is ever 100 percent certain.

718
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,880
We... No...

719
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,620
No, I mean...

720
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,520
I already have a child.

721
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,460
You do?

722
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,430
Your hormone levels are low,

723
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,400
and based on your FSH levels,

724
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,230
it looks like non-obstructive azoospermia.

725
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,899
Non-obstructive means...

726
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,670
it's a congenital condition.

727
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,710
Are you absolutely sure?

728
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,310
As I said before, there's no such thing as 100 percent.

729
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,790
A genetic test would be the most definitive way to know.

730
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,260
If I were you, I'd talk to the child's mother.

731
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,440
Do Hyun.

732
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,780
Do Hyun.

733
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,420
Do Hyun? I'm coming in.

734
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,700
I'm sorry.

735
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,770
I guess I didn't hear you.

736
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,720
I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

737
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,030
Please, don't say that.

738
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,700
Daniel...

739
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,870
He's my son.

740
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,940
I'm not going to question it any further,

741
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,240
and I don't need to.

742
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,750
We can act like nothing happened. No.

743
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,450
Nothing really did happen.

744
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:50,220
And no one has to know.

745
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,860
Right? I'm right, aren't I?

746
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,900
Daniel...

747
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,670
He's my son.

748
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,420
You're right. Daniel is your son.

749
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,620
Promise me, Jun Kyung.

750
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,230
That you won't tell a soul...

751
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,360
about what happened today.

752
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,500
All right.

753
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,610
No one will ever know.

754
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,950
- So, should we go too? - Let's.

755
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,420
Until every mom is happier...

756
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,170
(Piano Performance by Pianist Im Yoon Ju)

757
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,020
Yoon Ju...

758
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,490
I wondered what your first official event back in Korea would be,

759
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,190
and it was a commercial.

760
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,790
Who reached out first?

761
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,560
Was it Do Hyun? Or you?

762
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,700
Does it really matter? It's not like we're strangers.

763
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,529
We know Do Hyun too, you know.

764
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,300
But he's never asked that of us. Has he?

765
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,440
Hey! Are you comparing us to her? Come on.

766
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,780
But are you okay?

767
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,010
About what?

768
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,050
I heard Do Hyun's getting married.

769
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,850
Is she out of her mind?

770
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,500
- Who said that? - Jung Hoon.

771
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,930
I spoke with him a few days ago. I was on the phone with him.

772
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,840
You really had no idea?

773
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,950
So, I hear you're getting married.

774
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,090
You don't sound like you're here to congratulate me.

775
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,160
What do you want?

776
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,730
I'm going to make an effort myself.

777
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,830
What kind of effort?

778
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,200
I'm moving to this neighbourhood.

779
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,270
- What? What? - I've already looked at places,

780
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,270
and I'm moving in next month.

781
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,110
Honestly, marriage...

782
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,440
What's the big deal?

783
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,080
As you know, we have Daniel,

784
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,250
but we broke up anyway.

785
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,890
Besides, you're not married yet.

786
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,520
What do you think you're doing?

787
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,320
What would you do in my shoes?

788
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,260
If you're bound to lose anyway,

789
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,730
wouldn't you want to shatter everything?

790
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,900
Are people's hearts a game to you?

791
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,040
Imagine how happy Daniel will be, living close to his dad.

792
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,810
For Daniel's sake,

793
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,310
I'm prepared to make even more selfish choices.

794
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,580
You don't know how Do Hyun feels.

795
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,120
I bet Do Hyun would be happy to have his son.

796
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,140
There's something I need to ask you.

797
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,640
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's son?

798
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,650
What did you say?

799
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:11,120
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's biological son?

800
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:19,760
(Love Me)

801
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:55,730
I'm going to get famous and be even more successful now.

802
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,030
So you'd better feel the pressure.

803
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,970
I have no desire to congratulate you on your award.

804
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,040
You want me to break up with you, don't you?

805
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,070
You stupid jerk.

806
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,210
There's nothing to worry about.

807
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,110
I came to make sure everything's okay.

808
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,380
Darn it!

809
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,150
I truly wanted you to be happy.

810
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,050
And I thought I could be happy by your side.

811
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,650
But I don't think that's going to happen now.

812
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,290
Is that really what you think?

813
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,360
That Daniel isn't your son?

814
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,160
Is liking you a crime worthy of this punishment?

815
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,270
Why did you do that?

816
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,370
We promised we wouldn't say anything.

817
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,800
I know I'm the one who was wrong,

818
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,140
but I still wish he'd ask me to stay.
