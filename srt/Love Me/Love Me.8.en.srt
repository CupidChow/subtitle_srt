1
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,109
Daniel.

2
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,741
Mom!

3
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:05,279
- When did you get here?
- Yesterday.

4
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:23,210
Long time no see.

5
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,629
Hello.

6
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:34,489
Oh... Hello.

7
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,896
I've heard a lot about you.

8
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,809
From Daniel, of course.

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,310
Oh, really?

10
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,943
Every time he talked about you, I wondered.

11
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,942
About me?

12
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:54,603
I was curious about you.

13
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:58,343
What you'd be like, how you'd seem.

14
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,843
But you are...

15
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:09,591
You have this dignity.

16
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,686
I mean...

17
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:14,225
you're even more impressive than I imagined.

18
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,959
When I say 'impressive,'
that's a compliment, right?

19
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,198
Yeah.

20
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:23,425
Daniel.

21
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,055
Hi, Daniel.

22
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,677
You were amazing today.

23
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,711
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,750
- I'm Ji Min's mom.
- Hi, you must be Ji Min.

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,509
You were wonderful. You did such a great job.

26
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,569
I always thought Daniel was handsome,

27
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,182
and now I see it runs in the family.

28
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,948
- Hello.
- Nice to see you.

29
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,331
Jun Kyung.

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,919
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,246
What do you have to apologize for?

32
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,976
I just didn't expect her to show up like this.

33
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:32,336
Of course she would.

34
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,752
She is Daniel's mom.

35
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,609
- Do Hyun.
- Yeah?

36
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,526
You should see Daniel's homeroom teacher.

37
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,549
I already said hello to her.

38
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,452
Wait a second. Don't go yet.

39
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,646
Why is he so flustered?

40
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,679
Wouldn't he be?

41
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,829
Why?

42
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,703
Oh, because of me?

43
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,379
Hey, everyone here looks
uncomfortable except...

44
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,298
My name is Im Yun Ju.

45
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,893
...except you.

46
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,904
Is this amusing to you?

47
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,045
Let's have dinner together.

48
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:35,044
You came all this way to see Daniel perform.

49
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,556
Yeah, I'm going out now.

50
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,714
You can start without me.

51
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:45,587
Okay, sorry.

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,224
Even if it's late, finish up before you go.

53
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,955
Got it.

54
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,212
Oh, right.

55
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,533
As for the sophomores' field practicum...

56
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,915
Wait.

57
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:59,729
You know my PC password, right?

58
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,723
- But I'm in the middle of this...
- This is more urgent.

59
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,313
If you're hungry, order something.

60
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,654
Okay.

61
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:13,747
- Do the notice first.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,936
- Hello.
- Finally...

63
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:30,145
I pushed the button.

64
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,804
What button?

65
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:34,211
Isn't that a little cold

66
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,378
for the start of your girlfriend's journey
to becoming a bestselling writer?

67
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,601
I told you, today was the deadline.

68
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,265
I submitted it!

69
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,102
Oh... right.

70
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:46,926
How about pork cutlet and a beer?

71
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,627
We could celebrate together.

72
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:52,103
Good, I'll finish up as soon as possible.

73
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,448
See you later.

74
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:54,917
Please come in.

75
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,969
Is the professor not here?

76
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,562
He already left.

77
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,227
Why?

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,086
Well...

79
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:16,205
Can I submit this now?

80
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,532
- You should've done this sooner.
- Sorry.

81
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,925
And this too...

82
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,124
- Thank you.
- Bye.

83
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,352
Bye.

84
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,125
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

85
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,804
It's still so clean...

86
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,826
I almost feel bad just taking it.

87
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:05,426
I'm just glad it'll be put to good use.

88
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,770
Thank you.

89
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,879
- I'll take really good care of it.
- Thanks.

90
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,723
Live well, in that pretty house.

91
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,580
Ja Yeong.

92
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,400
Are you okay?

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,284
It's an empty house now, just memories left.

94
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,270
It doesn't matter to me now.

95
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,354
Let's go eat something good.

96
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:38,660
What do you want?

97
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,446
Whatever you want.

98
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,086
Well, what I want is...

99
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,985
This is what you wanted?

100
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,596
They say the best food in the world is

101
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,238
ramen someone else makes for you

102
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:55,958
under open skies.

103
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,138
I guess you're right.

104
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:01,012
Eating ramen you made with you

105
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:04,686
tastes better than cup noodles in the Alps.

106
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:07,059
I didn't make it. The machine did.

107
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,492
Be careful. It's dripping.

108
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,019
Do you still not feel like working?

109
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,325
Yeah.

110
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,553
After Bom got sick,

111
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:28,593
I took time off work
just to stay by her side a little longer.

112
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,590
It's already been six months.

113
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,710
Yeah... time really flies.

114
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,996
Those birds...

115
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,753
They fly freely, anywhere they want.

116
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,491
But when they get old and tired,

117
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:50,178
and can't fly far anymore,

118
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,859
What happens then?

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,213
Do they...

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,666
end up settling down somewhere,
becoming resident birds?

121
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,270
Probably, yeah.

122
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,540
I've never thought about it before.

123
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,707
It's kind of sad.

124
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,660
I think that's okay too.

125
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:18,649
They've spent their whole lives
chasing good seasons.

126
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,706
A place where you see flowers bloom first,

127
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,992
get the first sun on your skin,

128
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:41,551
step on fallen leaves first,

129
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,172
and clear snow first.

130
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,845
If there's a place like that...

131
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,303
like a resident bird,

132
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,927
staying in one spot,
welcoming and seeing people off,

133
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,683
that might be nice.

134
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:01,309
You know, I've lived my whole life
like a migratory bird.

135
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,716
Who says pork cutlet goes well with beer?

136
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,842
That's just broke people comforting themselves.

137
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:27,715
Pork cutlet pairs with whiskey.

138
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,375
At least 30 years old.

139
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,126
What's wrong?

140
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,519
Your face doesn't exactly scream "celebration."

141
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:45,871
While everyone else was padding their GPA
and building a career,

142
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,191
what was I doing?

143
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,079
You were too busy being lovestruck
and dating instead.

144
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:56,391
I sent you my manuscript,

145
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:59,122
thinking you'd be perfect
as a romance novel reviewer,

146
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:00,800
and you didn't even finish it.

147
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,504
Right?

148
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:03,973
Sorry.

149
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:05,724
But I know it will work out.

150
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,409
Of course it will.

151
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,675
You remember the plan

152
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,968
I made when I joined the publishing house

153
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,747
after graduation, right?

154
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:14,597
I will save just 24 million won

155
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:17,227
so I can focus only on writing until I turn 30.

156
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,030
Then I will quit my job

157
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,678
and submit to the contest

158
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,485
in the spring of my 29th year.

159
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:25,243
And when the result comes out in three months,

160
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,128
I will publish my book

161
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,783
before I turn 30.

162
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,275
Just like I planned.

163
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,300
You've done drinking?

164
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,299
It's still too early to drink
just because I submitted the contest entry.

165
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,870
Something really good is coming soon.

166
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,976
That's when I'll finish this bottle.

167
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:54,376
You really think...

168
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,476
life goes according to plan?

169
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,000
Why are you always so pessimistic?

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,313
Why are you always so optimistic?

171
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,704
I'm neither

172
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:08,833
pessimistic nor optimistic.

173
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,746
I'm idealistic.

174
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,475
If that woman had just been
a little more polite,

175
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,415
or if she didn't look younger than me,

176
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:28,534
or if she wasn't that pretty...

177
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,748
would I still be feeling this way?

178
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,716
But you know

179
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,094
"Have dinner with your family."

180
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,730
That line was just too much.

181
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,563
That was the worst, huh?

182
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,440
That's understandable.

183
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,188
Your current boyfriend's ex,

184
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:47,534
his son, and all four of you.

185
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,606
Anyone would lose it.

186
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,730
They looked like the perfect family.

187
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,123
And I was just some uninvited villain
dropped into the scene.

188
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,747
I totally understand that feeling.

189
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,598
Every time I go to my in-laws' gatherings,

190
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:02,344
uncles, aunts, cousins, distant relatives...

191
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:05,190
Everyone's so weirdly happy.

192
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,790
And I'm the only outsider
wedged into their family.

193
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:12,022
And my husband is trying so hard

194
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,067
to read the room, stuck in the middle...

195
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,419
Does he even know
that just makes me like him less?

196
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,390
Kids, Dad is home!

197
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,162
- Daddy!
- Daddy.

198
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:24,609
Were you having fun?

199
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,002
What is this?

200
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,115
He really doesn't know.

201
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,890
Jun Kyung, when did you come?

202
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,223
When did you come?

203
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:34,076
I was so bored at the hospital today.
Guess you came to save me.

204
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:35,429
So, what happened?

205
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,150
You didn't go too far without me, huh?

206
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,009
What is it?

207
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,163
Is it serious?

208
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:41,696
Is this a serious situation?

209
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,370
Just wait. I'll give you the best advice ever.

210
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,270
Let me change real quick.

211
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,016
Don't go anywhere.

212
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,237
Have some pizza too.

213
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,657
Thanks.

214
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,429
Looks delicious.

215
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:05,138
Want a glass of wine?

216
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:07,735
I'm good.

217
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,481
If you want some, go ahead.

218
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,229
I quit drinking.

219
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,423
By the way,

220
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,382
weren't you supposed to come next week?

221
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,362
I just came early.

222
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,442
I wanted to see Daniel's performance too.

223
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,855
You should've told us.

224
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,289
I was trying to surprise you.

225
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,046
Yeah, it was a total surprise.

226
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,475
Right?

227
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,768
I saw everything from the start.

228
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,679
- From the very beginning?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,888
You were amazing.

230
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:53,726
Birth rates are down,
so I'm walking on eggshells at work.

231
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,340
Psych patients keep increasing,
and everyone's asking for Hyeong Jun.

232
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
I thought things would ease up

233
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,433
now that the kids are older,
so I handed things over all confident...

234
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,271
But all that's grown

235
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,430
is my know-how for making liquor

236
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,210
and my belly fat.

237
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,275
And I don't even have anything to wear
to Dr. Hong's wedding.

238
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,806
It's not that "same old nothing to wear" thing,

239
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,619
this time I really have nothing.

240
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:28,963
Sorry.

241
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,650
That's not comforting, is it?

242
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,909
Nope.

243
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:39,005
I don't know why, but this spring...

244
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,089
it feels especially bitter.

245
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,014
Like it's going to be extra cruel.

246
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:50,040
The kids finally fell asleep.

247
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,226
So what is it? What's the real mess?

248
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,550
Gosh, we're out of booze.

249
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,750
Just wait. Don't start yet.

250
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:06,339
Why hasn't Do Hyun

251
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,172
even called you?

252
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,207
Thanks.

253
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,227
For taking good care of Daniel.

254
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,297
It's nothing.

255
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,110
It's what I'm supposed to do.

256
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,708
Of course it is.

257
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,748
You're Daniel's dad.

258
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,823
Daniel's moving this month, right?

259
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,164
Yeah.

260
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,376
She's pretty. I mean, Jun Kyung.

261
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:50,729
You're still charming, I guess.

262
00:16:51,663 --> 00:16:53,256
Have you found a place?

263
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:57,096
Changing the subject?

264
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,734
I'll stay at my mom's for now.

265
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,000
She's in Canada, visiting my brother.

266
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,787
I didn't expect a warm welcome,

267
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,827
but you're exactly the same.

268
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:15,453
That look on your face,

269
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,275
that's exactly how you looked
when I left Korea 16 years ago.

270
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,199
You know,

271
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:31,912
just an ordinary day,

272
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,120
I'm on the bus,

273
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,333
and someone is reading my book.

274
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,944
- Yeah.
- And then,

275
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,849
I'm watching them read it.

276
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,479
Doesn't your heart feel like it might burst?

277
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,886
You don't want to be some big, famous author.

278
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:54,493
You don't need to be a bestseller
or make tons of money.

279
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,379
Is that really such a small dream?

280
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,633
No matter how much a pessimist
throws cold reality at it,

281
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:05,835
the idealist felt strangely at peace.

282
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,021
And the drinks tasted sweet.

283
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,034
- Bye.
- Bye.

284
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,768
- Go first.
- You go first.

285
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,153
- I'm going.
- Okay.

286
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,459
- Bye.
- Bye.

287
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:31,636
Want me to walk you?

288
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,022
Yeah.

289
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,896
Let's go.

290
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:39,303
Are you going to walk me back again?

291
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:40,989
I'm already getting tired.

292
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,207
What, I'm gonna be bored alone.

293
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,087
Huh?

294
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,479
Then stay over at my place.

295
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,753
Should I?

296
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:52,679
Aren't you hungry?

297
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,786

304
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,505

00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,316

<i>Don't wait up.</i>

308
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,909
It's an empty house now,

309
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,536
just memories left.

310
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,469
It doesn't matter to me.

<i>Or, are you lonely?</i>

327
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh.

328
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,559
Good timing.

329
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,746
I was craving a beer too.

330
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,843
Sorry.

331
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,310
What do you have to be sorry for?

332
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:40,499
I'm the one...

333
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:43,505
who should be sorry.

334
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,586
I'm really tired today.

335
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:09,261
I'm going in.

336
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,626
You said I didn't do anything wrong,

337
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:23,138
but you're treating me like I did.

338
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,512
Right. Why do you make me feel like this?

339
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,046
I know you have a son.

340
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,938
I knew Yun Ju was coming back.

341
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:40,878
But standing there,
the three of you together...

342
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,251
I was the only one who looked stupid.

343
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:54,359
I know no one did anything wrong.

344
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:58,937
But I hate myself for feeling this way.

345
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,323
I feel pathetic and childish.

346
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:06,300
I really hate this.

347
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:09,687
See.

348
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,383
I'm the one who's wrong.

349
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,803
You've always been like this.

350
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,950
For the two years we've been together.

351
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,019
Whenever it gets like this,

352
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:28,698
you turn away first.

353
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,365
You run.

354
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,206
You hide.

355
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:03,859
So, I'm sorry.

356
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:09,846
For making you

357
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,839
feel like this again.

358
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,597
- Welcome.
- Hello.

359
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,153
- Hello.
- Hi.

360
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,045
- Nice mountains, right?
- Yeah.

361
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:46,492
This way.

362
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,130
This is the cooking area.

363
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,096
Good water pressure, nice and cold.

364
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:54,817
Since it's small,

365
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:56,910
there isn't much to maintain.

366
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,549
This is the office, and also the shop.

367
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:05,268
We've got everything.

368
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:06,937
Take a look around.

369
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:09,757
And,

370
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,303
this is

371
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,446
where my spouse and I live.

372
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,525
Please come.

373
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,076
I thought

374
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,566
you just came to camp.

375
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,745
I had no idea you were thinking of

376
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,471
buying the place.

377
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:37,516
I just thought I'd try camping first.

378
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:41,122
But plans never go exactly as planned.

379
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,455
Seeing this place,

380
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,109
I feel like I'd regret it if I passed.

381
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,027
Are you sure?

382
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,233
Is this really okay?

383
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,713
What do you think?

384
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,044
For me, it's fine. I'm on my own.

385
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,780
But you...

386
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,899
you have children.

387
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:09,076
My wife's death anniversary is coming up.

388
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:12,089
You know what I regret the most

389
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:15,823
after losing her?

390
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,476
I should've retired sooner.

391
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:25,422
I should've spent more time with her.

392
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,474
I've made up my mind.

393
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,328
She would've wanted me to live this way.

394
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,956
And the children...

395
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,302
they'll understand.

396
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,111
Hey, Jun Seo.

397
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:53,920
Dad,

398
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,690
I think I'll be late again tonight.

399
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,480
Are you home?

400
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,794
No, I'm out too.

401
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,509
<i>Where are you?</i>

402
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,147
Camping with Ja Yeong.

403
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:07,278
<i>Sounds great. Have fun with her.</i>

404
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:09,213
<i>Don't just stay home all the time.</i>

405
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,171
Jun Seo.

406
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,232
By the way, did I...

407
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,279
Did I give you your allowance?

408
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,879
<i>Yeah, I still have it.
You gave it to me last week.</i>

409
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>Don't worry about me. Have fun, okay?</i>

410
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,270
Okay.

411
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,809
They'll understand.

412
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,397
Is the house in your name?

413
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,655
Yes.

414
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:56,750
Did your children help financially
when you bought it?

415
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,350
No.

416
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,738
Then what's the problem?

417
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,076
It's your house. You just want to sell it.

418
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,761
I wonder...

419
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:09,480
if I'm being selfish,
just chasing my own happiness.

420
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,990
Even sins of the heart are sins, right?

421
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,447
All humans are selfish.

422
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:17,555
I'm saying... maybe I'm just extremely selfish.

423
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,915
Then don't sell the house, sir. Please.

424
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,300
Hey, Chang Sik.

425
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,293
My life matters too, right?

426
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,313
Sir,

427
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,031
yesterday another man came to confession.

428
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:33,897
He said he heard a hot tip
and asked if he should buy some stocks.

429
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:37,363
He said his wife would kill him
if she found out.

430
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,942
You know what I told him?

431
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:42,723
I don't know.

432
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,474
I said,

433
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:47,700
"Go home right now
and talk to her first before she finds out.

434
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:51,045
And if you do make lots of money,

435
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:53,651
donate more to the church."

436
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:59,491
What am I? A fund manager?
Or a real-estate investor?

437
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,189
Sir,

438
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:03,793
those decisions...

439
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:06,176
they're not for God, and not for me.

440
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:09,775
Talk to Jun Kyung and Jun Seo.

441
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,167
Yeah. I see.

442
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:19,254
You must be tired, listening to all of this.

443
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:26,055
- Congratulations!
- You earned it.

444
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:29,775
Do I deserve congratulations
for getting a job at this age?

445
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,535
Getting into a public corporation isn't easy.

446
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:33,504
Winning a housing lottery is also hard.

447
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:36,210
I never thought I'd have a day like this.

448
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,154
How about you?

449
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,078
What's so special about being an adjunct?

450
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:42,560
It's just keeping students happy,
watching professors' moods.

451
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,436
Sounds exhausting.
You're doing your PhD and teaching.

452
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:48,610
Still, Professor Song looks out for you.

453
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,690
I'm always the odd one out.

454
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:57,363
Just a second.

455
00:30:58,377 --> 00:30:59,950
Hello.

456
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,389
Oh, right. It's today.

457
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,847
You forgot Mom's death anniversary?

458
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,731
No, I didn't forget.

459
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:11,231
I knew. I really did.

460
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:12,361
I just... slipped my mind.

461
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:13,987
So you forgot.

462
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
Anyway, be home by six.

463
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,328
Actually...

464
00:31:18,328 --> 00:31:19,968
I'm with friends. It's been a while.

465
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,637
So what?

466
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,260
Okay.

467
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,309
I don't understand.

468
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,289
- Hey, Jun Kyung.
- Hey.

469
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:35,475
You look pretty today.

470
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,469
Last time the dues were 50,000 won,

471
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:41,179
and he only paid only 30,000 won.
I covered the rest.

472
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,863
Hey, don't invite him next time.

473
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:44,350
It's just awkward.

474
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,955
Come on.

475
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:48,533
People can be broke sometimes.

476
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,984
That's fine when you're in school.

477
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:51,222
But seriously...

478
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,986
Why is he even a TA?

479
00:31:52,986 --> 00:31:55,190
Trying to become an adjunct or something?

480
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,076
If he wants to be a professor,

481
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:59,101
he should've managed his grades.

482
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:02,066
He couldn't even graduate on time.

483
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:05,679
He's doing that
because he can't do anything else.

484
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,152
Did he ever even try to get a job?

485
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,396
He doesn't even have a TOEIC score.

486
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,573
Maybe he's just scared.

487
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,455
He knows better than anyone
that he's nothing out there.

488
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,460
I don't care.

489
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,556
Just tell him to pay his share.

490
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:26,498
Don't talk like that behind his back.

491
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:28,327
That's enough.

492
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,557
<i>Your transaction is being processed.</i>

493
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:41,165
[Cash Withdrawal: 70,000 won
Balance: 87,208 won]

494
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,559
Hey, where did you disappear to?

495
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,759
The food is cold. Eat up.

496
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:53,178
That's the 20,000 won I owed from last time,

497
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,973
and 50,000 won for today.

498
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,173
Right?

499
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,226
Huh?

500
00:32:59,886 --> 00:33:01,586
I asked if it's right.

501
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:04,393
Yeah.

502
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,177
Hey, your bag...

503
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:12,130
You forgot your bag.

504
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,083
Yun Ju.

505
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,496
Hey.

506
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:27,490
It's been forever.

507
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,007
Look at this awkward hug.

508
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,764
What does she even have to worry about?

509
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:33,590
One comeback recital after moving back,

510
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,557
and everyone will be fighting
to hire her as a professor.

511
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:38,167
And if she gets tired of it,
she can just... not work.

512
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,301
I know.

513
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:42,357
Worrying about her is
the most pointless thing in the world.

514
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:43,811
You should've stayed in Germany.

515
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,441
You're messing with the natural order here.

516
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,754
- Don't exaggerate.
- Exaggeration?

517
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:50,245
Our side is brutal these days. It's cutthroat.

518
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,305
Yeah.

519
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:53,562
Out of all of us,
Do Hyun is the one who is popular.

520
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:56,269
I actually texted him today,
asked if he was coming.

521
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:57,986
He said he couldn't. He's recording today.

522
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,156
- Recording?
- Yes.

523
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:00,389
- On a weekend?
- Yeah.

524
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,553
Wow.

525
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,766
He must really be in demand.

526
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:09,696
Hey, Do Hyun and I dated in our freshman year.

527
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:13,068
It was a long time ago.
You guys can talk about him.

528
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:15,682
Are you okay with that?

529
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,133
I saw him a few days ago.

530
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:21,071
We're totally fine.

531
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,931
What is this chill energy?

532
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:25,487
Is this Hollywood or something?

533
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:27,954
So, are you back for good?

534
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:32,673
I thought about it a lot before coming back.

535
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,171
But yeah, I've decided to live here.

536
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,807
Good for you.

537
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,605
It's disappointing, but...

538
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:42,634
I understand.

539
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:44,371
My patients' water breaks out of nowhere.

540
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:46,194
Deliveries get scheduled suddenly.

541
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:50,447
I've missed plans with you plenty of times too.

542
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:53,167
Thank you for understanding.

543
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,474
It's okay.

544
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:56,287
Good luck with the recording.

545
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,907
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

546
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,440
I haven't been here in so long.

547
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,957
Sorry for sticking you
with the kids all weekend, babe.

548
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:14,297
You know how advertisers are.
They change their minds all the time.

549
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:16,217
Yeah.

550
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:19,468
Okay, babe.

551
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:21,716
I'll try to wrap it up as fast as I can.

552
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:23,516
Okay, bye.

553
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:28,982
Look at you.

554
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,420
You were going to dress up

555
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,869
and go to the wedding with your girlfriend.

556
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,069
But the schedule blew up. Right?

557
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,122
Why?

558
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,375
You and your wife...

559
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:50,382
were just as anxious

560
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:53,822
as Jun Kyung and me.

561
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:55,969
So how did you...

562
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:58,289
get married?

563
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,506
Yeah. We were scared.

564
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:03,889
There were a lot of crises.

565
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,269
But honestly,

566
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:07,649
once I got married,

567
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:11,461
all that anxiety just disappeared.

568
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:15,942
Sounds ridiculous, right?

569
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:22,599
- Ugh.
- Total nonsense.

570
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,085
That hurts.

571
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:28,254
If you keep being considerate

572
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:31,042
and worrying about circumstances,
you'll never get married.

573
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,440
You need a little selfishness.

574
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,497
Putting yourself first.

575
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:36,569
That's the only way it works.

576
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,282
How can I be selfish in my situation?

577
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:41,253
Why?

578
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,859
Because of Daniel?

579
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:45,192
See. You already can't.

580
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:53,158
I don't even know how she feels.

581
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,313
Wow.

582
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,338
You're really arrogant.

583
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:00,415
How do you expect to know
someone's feelings for free?

584
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:04,255
If you want to know how she feels,
pop the question.

585
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,455
Then you'll know for sure.

586
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,839
That giraffe, Dr. Yeom,

587
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,319
stretched those long arms all the way out

588
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,884
and just lifted it up.

589
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:19,152
And it somehow flew right over
and landed straight in your arms.

590
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:20,717
That's fate.

591
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,799
So...

592
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,605
when are you two doing it?

593
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,639
What?

594
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,379
Marriage?

595
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:31,829
We haven't even talked about it.

596
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:33,372
Come on.

597
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:36,076
Blink once and you're 40.

598
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:38,929
How have you two never talked about marriage?

599
00:37:39,629 --> 00:37:42,246
Why do we need something
this expensive and formal

600
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:44,616
that just puts everyone through trouble?

601
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:46,463
Do Hyun and I are good right now.

602
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:47,732
That's enough for us.

603
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:52,652
I don't think just being good
with each other is enough, though.

604
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:56,667
Oh.

605
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,120
Jin Kyung?

606
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:03,233
Oh, hi.

607
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:05,866
Aha.

608
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,106
So there really was a recording.

609
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,420
Sorry?

610
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,566
I thought he lied about having a recording

611
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:17,026
just to go on a date with you.

612
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:22,756
Just kidding.

613
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,497
Looks like you came from a wedding.

614
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:34,337
They say if you don't get married
within six months after catching that,

615
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:36,677
you can't for three years.

616
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,695
That's a joke too.

617
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:49,103
I guess we'll see each other again, right?

618
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,831
Wow.

619
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:04,324
She really walks the line.

620
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,356
She doesn't filter anything.

621
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:09,971
She just says whatever comes to mind.

622
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,341
So it wasn't my problem
that my mood got ruined back then.

623
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:14,014
It was hers.

624
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,148
See.

625
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,916
Still not thinking about marriage?

626
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,662
A pretty strong rival just showed up.

627
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,974
Is this all you brought?

628
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,566
Thanks to your mom,

629
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,826
we're all together like this again.

630
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,751
Back then it was spring, but it was freezing.

631
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,731
This year feels warmer. Right?

632
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:22,200
It does.

633
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,613
Yeah.

634
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,807
Did something happen?

635
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,366
What? Nothing.

636
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,768
Yeah. Nothing happened.

637
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:48,282
Want to have a drink together?

638
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,628
It's been a while.

639
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,254
Let's have one.

640
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:56,609
Okay.

641
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,008
You're not drinking, right?

642
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,161
- I'll just hold the glass.
- You drove here, right?

643
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,292
- Yes.
- Okay.

644
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,608
Here.

645
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,190
Dad, is something going on?

646
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:31,744
I've been thinking about

647
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,086
whether I should say this today.

648
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:38,133
But you've both been busy.

649
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,472
And since we're all together now,

650
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:44,567
I think I should.

651
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,487
Are you two...

652
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:52,040
getting married?

653
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,960
What?

654
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:58,067
Come on.

655
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,584
Are you getting married for real?

656
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:09,831
No. I'm too old for marriage.

657
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:14,358
That's not it.

658
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,330
I'm thinking about...

659
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,103
selling this house.

660
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,563
You're selling the house?

661
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:37,156
Does that even make sense?

662
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:39,569
That's why Dad wants to talk about it.

663
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,438
I'm against it.

664
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:42,782
What about you?

665
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:49,946
Dad wants to sell the house

666
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:52,967
to run a campsite with that woman.

667
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:55,362
This is the house Mom lived in with all of us.

668
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,326
You're okay with that?

669
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:03,386
Huh?

670
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:10,053
I asked if you're okay with it.

671
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:11,672
This is Dad's house.

672
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:14,452
He has the right to decide.

673
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:19,040
But...

674
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,477
it does feel sudden.

675
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:23,403
How is this Dad's house? It's our house.

676
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:24,464
Right?

677
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,955
Then where do we go?

678
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:30,645
Now we meet as a family at barbecue places?

679
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:31,975
Stop exaggerating.

680
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:33,949
He's just thinking about it.

681
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:37,169
Just thinking about it is already insane.

682
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,242
How could you, Dad?

683
00:43:40,962 --> 00:43:43,639
This is the only home I've ever stayed in.

684
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:46,839
I was born here.
I've lived here my entire life.

685
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:48,689
How could you do this to me?

686
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:51,906
I'll obviously get you a place to live.

687
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:53,149
Aha.

688
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:56,561
So I'm the problem.

689
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:59,915
I'm the only one with no future,
no place to go.

690
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:01,571
So as long as I'm gone, you can sell the house.

691
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:02,596
No.

692
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,026
Am I not family?

693
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:07,028
- Am I just baggage?
- Hey.

694
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:18,042
Today is Mom's death anniversary.

695
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,469
How could you...

696
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:29,373
This wasn't even my room.

697
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:31,008
It was Dad's house. Dad's room.

698
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:35,848
Sorry, I've been freeloading here for 29 years.

699
00:44:35,848 --> 00:44:37,761
Stop it.

700
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:58,485
I don't need a studio.

701
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:00,751
I don't need your money.

702
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,521
You and that woman go live happily ever after.

703
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:05,194
A campsite?

704
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:08,795
Sounds fun.

705
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,012
Okay, I'm going to be happy with her.

706
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:12,314
We'll live well.

707
00:45:12,314 --> 00:45:14,140
Now get out.

708
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,664
How are you even going to survive?

709
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:20,516
You have no money. No skills.

710
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:21,580
Nothing.

711
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,511
Are you going to live off your sister again?

712
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,137
Is that the plan?

713
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:26,530
Just go.

714
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:39,530
Well, I mean...

715
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,374
Jun Seo.

716
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:42,983
Jun Seo.

717
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,941
What did I do so wrong?

718
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,764
I worked myself to the bone.

719
00:46:20,764 --> 00:46:22,117
I bought this house.

720
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:25,017
And now I want to sell it

721
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:28,963
and find my own happiness.

722
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:33,177
Is that really such a crime?

723
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:48,322
I don't know well.

724
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:54,716
I'm going.

725
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,279
<i>We were four in this house.</i>

726
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,433
<i>One day, we suddenly became three...</i>

727
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:28,421
<i>then two...</i>

728
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,043
<i>and now, just one.</i>

729
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:41,864
<i>Can we still...</i>

730
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:46,264
<i>call it a family...</i>

731
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:51,977
<i>even if there's only one left?</i>

732
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:57,334
<i>The number you have dialed is not available...</i>

733
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:03,431
[Phone call]

734
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,050
[My son]

735
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:14,191
[My dad]

736
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:22,494
Are you really not going to answer?

737
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,543
What would I even say?

738
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,390
I didn't do anything wrong.

739
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,590
I didn't say anything wrong.

740
00:48:44,142 --> 00:48:46,575
Dad would just say he's sorry again.

741
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:51,367
And now... I don't want to say I'm okay.

742
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,019
Everyone was just putting up with me.

743
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,786
Even though I was a burden and annoying.

744
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,185
They all knew.

745
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:16,859
And I was the only one who didn't.

746
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:21,839
Like an idiot...

747
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,419
I'm the last one to realize it.

748
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:33,348
When I was little,

749
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:37,882
people always called you Jun Kyung's mom.

750
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,369
Why didn't they ever call you Jun Seo's mom?

751
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:45,676
I thought...

752
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:49,629
it was just because Jun Kyung was born first.

753
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:53,308
But everyone knew.

754
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:58,042
That she was smart and did well in school.

755
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,941
And that I was the stupid one.

756
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:02,568
The useless one.

757
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:09,015
Were you ashamed of me too, Mom?

758
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:10,655
Why would I?

759
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:13,533
You're the most beautiful thing

760
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:15,769
in the world to me.

761
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:19,055
You're what I'm proudest of.

762
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,906
Don't say that.

763
00:50:23,906 --> 00:50:26,106
That's why I hate you the most.

764
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:28,480
You should've scolded me sometimes.

765
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,728
You always said I was good,
and that's why I turned out like this.

766
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:38,070
Do you even know how I feel?

767
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:44,711
How could I not know?

768
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:47,911
Your heart is written

769
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,898
all over your back.

770
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,470
What are you doing here?

771
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:08,457
The field's been closed for a while.

772
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:10,130
Get out.

773
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,517
Mister...

774
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:19,561
I don't have anywhere to go.

775
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:21,014
What?

776
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,567
Get out.

777
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:42,416
Hey, Daniel.

778
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:44,536
What's going on at this hour?

779
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:47,659
Ma'am, just a second.

780
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,172
<i>It's me. Im Yun Ju.</i>

781
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:57,598
<i>What happened earlier today
has been on my mind.</i>

782
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:01,925
<i>It seemed like you took
a harmless joke the wrong way.</i>

783
00:52:06,142 --> 00:52:08,592
Were we close enough to be joking like that?

784
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,625
That's why I called. I wanted to apologize.

785
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,916
Is that an apology I'm supposed to accept?

786
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,799
<i>If you're not going to accept it,</i>

787
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:23,112
there's nothing I can do.

788
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:27,699
<i>Sounds like you're driving. I'll hang up now.</i>

789
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:32,765
What is wrong with her?

790
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:37,742
Hey!

791
00:52:37,742 --> 00:52:39,360
Roll your window down!

792
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,708
I said roll it down!

793
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:43,356
The light changed ages ago.
Why are you still stopped?

794
00:52:43,356 --> 00:52:44,878
You crazy bitch.

795
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:46,182
What?

796
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:48,702
Sorry, ma'am.

797
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:50,448
Drive better next time.

798
00:53:02,598 --> 00:53:03,641
Hey.

799
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,408
You call that an apology?

800
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:09,098
You pretend to be the nice one

801
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:11,065
just to make yourself feel better?

802
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:14,162
If you're going to apologize, do it properly.
If not, don't bother.

803
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:16,981
And stop smiling. You're just making it worse.

804
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,699
What the hell...

805
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,295
Babe, let's go.

806
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:23,035
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

807
00:53:50,065 --> 00:53:51,531
They are insane.

808
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:23,065
This woman hit us on purpose.

809
00:54:23,065 --> 00:54:25,206
Okay, just a moment.

810
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,395
You keep saying "just a moment."

811
00:54:27,395 --> 00:54:29,363
You're taking forever. Damn it.

812
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:31,828
Sir, please stop swearing.

813
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:44,629
This wasn't intentional.

814
00:54:48,014 --> 00:54:50,714
What? How is that not intentional?

815
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:53,754
You deliberately blocked her lane.

816
00:54:53,754 --> 00:54:55,188
You can see it here.

817
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:57,561
- How was she supposed to avoid that?
- No, she...

818
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:01,728
She didn't move when the light changed.

819
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:03,505
I was in a hurry.

820
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:06,985
So when you're in a hurry,
you swear and drive aggressively?

821
00:55:06,985 --> 00:55:09,062
No! This woman...

822
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:10,892
Okay, let's stop.

823
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,506
If you're going to ticket us, do it quickly.

824
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:13,919
Or just let insurance handle it.

825
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,872
Talking to her is pointless.

826
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:19,076
This can't be handled
with a ticket or insurance.

827
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:21,376
Threatening driving isn't a traffic violation.

828
00:55:21,376 --> 00:55:24,222
It's criminal intimidation
under the penal code.

829
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:25,422
Darn it.

830
00:55:29,832 --> 00:55:32,678
After a rough day with nothing but hard people,

831
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:35,231
you end up meeting someone who brings comfort.

832
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:38,091
Sorry?

833
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:41,918
I was just happy to see you.

834
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:44,985
So you work around here.

835
00:55:46,192 --> 00:55:48,832
Funny running into each other like this.

836
00:55:48,832 --> 00:55:51,938
My dad lives nearby. I was just stopping by.

837
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,159
So your name is Won Young.

838
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:04,632
I knew the uniform suited you.

839
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:12,079
That's unexpected.

840
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:15,163
I thought you were just a tough local

841
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,429
who likes drinking alone.

842
00:56:18,085 --> 00:56:20,251
But you are an OB-GYN.

843
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:23,363
You've really changed a lot.

844
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:24,916
In a good way.

845
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,646
You're the same.

846
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:30,446
Still bold and cool.

847
00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:35,769
Officer Oh.

848
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:39,661
If the station contacts you,

849
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:42,143
you'll need to come in and give a statement.

850
00:56:42,143 --> 00:56:43,409
Okay.

851
00:56:44,643 --> 00:56:46,749
Mind if I reach out again?

852
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:50,316
Of course.

853
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:52,380
I'll buy the beer next time.

854
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,782
Sounds good.

855
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:05,813
Next time, I'll call you sister.

856
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,833
Okay.

857
00:57:18,158 --> 00:57:19,557
Who was that?

858
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,771
A friend.

859
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:24,061
A friend?

860
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:26,010
She looked a bit older than you.

861
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:30,237
She's someone who stayed with me
when I was tired and lonely.

862
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:32,310
So yeah... A friend I'm grateful for.

863
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:41,647
Great, thank you.

864
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:44,038
- Good work.
- You did great.

865
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:45,559
- You too.
- Get home and get some rest.

866
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:47,172
Thanks for your hard work.

867
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,674
Daniel.

868
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,223
Sorry, I'm late.

869
00:57:51,223 --> 00:57:52,991
I got your pizza...

870
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:54,527
Good evening, Dad.

871
00:57:57,261 --> 00:57:58,554
Nice.

872
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:08,432
Hey.

873
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:09,781
Hi.

874
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:14,077
Why do you always look surprised
when you see me?

875
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:16,057
Did I come somewhere I shouldn't?

876
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,829
We already ate pizza.

877
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,309
Mom brought it.

878
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,735
I won!

879
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:32,382
He couldn't even eat himself properly,

880
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:34,715
but he still fed the fish.

881
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:39,848
He must be pretty close with Jun Kyung.

882
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:42,695
It makes me a little jealous.

883
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:50,671
Yun Ju.

884
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:52,257
Yes?

885
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:54,801
What? Uncomfortable again?

886
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:56,450
Awkward?

887
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:01,759
You're curious, right?

888
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,022
The reason I suddenly came back to Korea.

889
00:59:07,063 --> 00:59:08,303
Yeah.

890
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:10,828
For Daniel, I guess.

891
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,396
Hey.

892
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:18,315
Am I really that uncomfortable for you?

893
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,401
Do you really think I spent my time in Germany

894
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,493
just thinking about you

895
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:26,499
and missing you?

896
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,474
I dated people who liked me.

897
00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:35,720
Work was going well,

898
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,638
and I was having a good time.

899
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:39,900
Yeah.

900
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,554
I figured you did.

901
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:44,827
But Do Hyun...

902
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,120
No matter how much I thought about it,

903
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,660
it always came back to you.

904
00:59:57,421 --> 00:59:59,621
I came back because of you.

905
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:04,756
I want to try again with you.

906
01:00:52,163 --> 01:00:54,309
I'm going to stand on my own this time.

907
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:55,350
Why?

908
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:59,008
To get back at the humiliation I felt
from my dad and my sister.

909
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:01,828
Don't tell my dad, please.

910
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:04,101
Never tell him.

911
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:07,053
Coming here...

912
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:09,313
Do you think we rushed it?

913
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:10,908
Jin Ho.

914
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:12,581
Are you still upset?

915
01:01:12,581 --> 01:01:14,219
I'm sorry.

916
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:16,752
I think I was a little sensitive.

917
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:18,206
Ja Yeong.

918
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:19,919
Ja Yeong!

919
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:22,685
When I was playing earlier,
it brought back old memories.

920
01:01:22,685 --> 01:01:24,856
Me too.

921
01:01:25,465 --> 01:01:28,160
Do Hyun is still Daniel's dad.

922
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,964
Parents and children can't choose each other,

923
01:01:29,964 --> 01:01:31,258
and they can't just be strangers either.

924
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:32,530
What are you trying to say?

925
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,953
If you were me, what would you do?

926
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:37,013
Wouldn't you want to break it?
