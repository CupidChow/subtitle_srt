1
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,370
I never really knew what it was like to be lonely.

2
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,340
I guess I never had time to be lonely.

3
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,840
Ms. Seo Jun Kyung.

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,540
Are you listening to me?

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Yes.

6
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,220
Anyway, I've been feeling especially lonely lately.

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
You know what I mean.

8
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,420
It's a void that work and family just can't fill.

9
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,260
I feel women only like me for my background.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,030
Being a lawyer is common now, but I worked hard to get where I am.

11
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,000
So I think I deserve the perks that come with it.

12
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,740
Aren't you having any?

13
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,070
Right.

14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,910
Are you uncomfortable?

15
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,140
It is our first time meeting.

16
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,280
We were getting coffee, dinner, and then drinks anyway, right?

17
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,120
That just seems like a hassle, and I don't like to waste time.

18
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,160
I see.

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,120
Have I been talking about myself too much?

20
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,490
It's just that I was already told all about you.

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,270
And what exactly were you told?

22
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,969
You're 36 and graduated from Yonsei University.

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,499
You're a doctor at Seah Women's Hospital.

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,710
Your family consists of your parents and a younger brother.

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,480
Your height is 167cm. Your weight seems...

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,740
a bit different from what I heard.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,050
For busy people like us,

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,790
coming here to trade resumes is just a waste of time.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,290
Sounds like you did your homework. It saves time too.

30
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,060
How do you know the director?

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,160
We go to the same church. He's older than me, though.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
And he said that given our jobs and our ages,

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,670
we'd probably be a good match. So that's why I agreed to come.

34
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,970
But we can tell right away, can't we?

35
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,650
You're not attracted to me, are you?

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
I'm not.

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,550
The feeling's mutual.

38
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,359
I'd rather date someone in their 20s,

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,460
but I know that might seem a little shameless.

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Besides, it's not like anyone in their 20s would go for me anyway.

41
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,400
But we both took time to come all the way out here.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,170
We should at least see this through to the end, shouldn't we?

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,910
See if we're compatible or not.

44
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,550
I already booked a room.

45
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,870
I see.

46
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,870
You're saying that you and I...

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,810
should have sex?

48
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,650
We just met for the first time today,

49
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,520
- and it hasn't even been an hour. - Look.

50
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,760
- Could you keep your voice down? - Right. So we won't waste time,

51
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,730
and we can find out if we're compatible much faster.

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
Check, please.

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,900
Are you uncomfortable?

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,530
You're being a little rude.

55
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,600
Judging someone based on their looks is incredibly rude.

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,400
- Your looks? - Then what?

57
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,840
Is there any other logical reason for what you just said?

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,410
He said you haven't dated for a while.

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,080
And now I see why.

60
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,779
You're the one with the chip on your shoulder.

61
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,810
If you had better manners...

62
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,449
or weren't so boring, maybe I wouldn't have acted this way.

63
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,190
Not that I would have ever slept with you, of course.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Thank you.

65
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,290
So there's no point getting to know each other further then, right?

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,670
And for a woman who's not worth getting to know,

67
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,470
I see even less reason to pay the entire tab.

68
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
Put it away.

69
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,309
You wasted time on a woman...

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,409
you were never going to get lucky with.

71
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,580
Why waste your money too?

72
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,620
Rude to the very end.

73
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,490
Are you going on a second date?

74
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,860
Did you turn him down?

75
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,000
You can tell after one meeting. Why waste time?

76
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,740
What a shame. He's tall and has a sense of humour.

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,440
Plus, he's a gentleman and a big spender.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,740
A handsome lawyer like that would be a catch for one of us.

79
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,380
I'm telling you. There's no way he'd be good enough for Dr. Seo.

80
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,080
Dr. Seo.

81
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,510
Don't ever get married. Okay?

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,550
Why bother with all that in this day and age?

83
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,890
Being single is like veganism. Like this spinach.

84
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,790
It might be bland, but it's healthy. And you've got to stay healthy.

(Seah Women's Hospital)

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,170
- So you'll just keep pretending? - Pretending what?

87
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,469
That you're an elegant single woman.

88
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,210
I'm not pretending. That's the real me.

89
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,010
- Hello. - Hi.

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,079
Today's special is spicy fried pork.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,580
- Okay. - It's good.

92
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,150
- Who's that? - New nurse at the fertility center.

93
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,550
She's pretty.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,990
Everyone's pretty when they're young.

95
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,290
So true.

96
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,430
Then again...

97
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,040
you went and bought a new outfit for your first date in ages,

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,310
only to get a short, balding horn dog...

99
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,140
who said that even though you were old and not his type,

100
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,649
you should just sleep with him to see if you could be compatible.

101
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,550
Admitting that you were humiliated on the date

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,490
would be a bit much, wouldn't it?

103
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,220
The dress and coat? I needed new ones anyway.

104
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,960
He's a tall gentleman with a sense of humour?

105
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,270
It's not like he was going to be the father of your child.

106
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,970
So why sugarcoat it?

107
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,710
You should've just ghosted him to let off some steam.

108
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,180
Aren't you the one who always sugarcoats your mother-in-law?

109
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,750
You say she's the sweetest person and basically paints her perfect.

(OB-GYN Bae Soo Jin, OB-GYN Seo Jun Kyung)

112
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,760
I said I didn't want a blind date. Why was he so pushy?

113
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,630
Did I do something to piss off the director?

114
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,470
No. The lawyer must've done something to piss him off.

(Chief Director Kim Jun Hyung)

116
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,970
You give up your weekend for a date at some cliche spot.

117
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,450
If he's tolerable, you get closer. Then once you're close, he meddles.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,550
Next, you set a date, meet families, send invitations, and have kids.

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,850
Is that supposed to be fun?

120
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,620
Isn't it all just exhausting and cliche?

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,190
Keep up the great work, everyone. Now, let me shake your hand.

178
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,300
- All right. - Thank you for everything, sir.

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,060
- Here, return this. - Right.

180
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,069
- I forgot to pack the mouse. - I'll put it in.

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,500
- Thank you for everything. - No need to walk me out.

183
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,900
- Thank you for your hard work. - Good luck.

184
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,540
- Thank you for everything, sir. - You all keep up the good work.

185
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,670
- Thank you, sir. - Good luck.

He's true to form, right to the very end.

188
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,190
Look at that. He even had cash ready, so he could skip dinner.

189
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,520
I wonder what he does for fun. Our boss, I mean.

190
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,660
I thought he was a great boss, though.

191
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,190
But still, why did he have to go and resign?

192
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,330
He was so close to retirement. Such a waste.

193
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,830
I know, right?

197
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,490
Right.

198
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,540
Oh, my goodness! Raphael.

199
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,910
Is that you? Raphael?

200
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,870
Yes, hello.

201
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,379
I haven't seen you at church in ages.

202
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,280
Funny running into you here.

203
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,880
How is Julia doing?

204
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,120
We still pray for Julia at Mass in our parish group.

205
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,960
Yes, thank you. She's doing much better.

206
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,860
You should stop by sometime. My wife would love to see you.

207
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,760
She must be doing much better then.

208
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,430
She almost died, didn't she?

209
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,270
We all die when it's our time.

210
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,140
I was so worried.

211
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,910
- Sorry. I have some shopping to do. - Of course.

212
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,650
This didn't happen at our parish, but at another one.

213
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,320
There was a sister in a similar situation to Julia's.

214
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,420
In the end, she couldn't cope, took her own...

215
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,590
Oh, dear. She probably couldn't join the Almighty.

216
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,430
- I'll be on my way. - Okay.

217
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,130
I can only imagine...

218
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,330
Raphael.

219
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,200
It's such a relief to see that you're stronger than we expected.

220
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,310
I'm not the one who's sick. I'm fine.

221
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
You're so strong.

222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,180
You're doing a great job.

The Lord will watch over his little lamb, Raphael.

224

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,310
They were all like, "Oh my gosh, we're getting Korean beef."

228
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,980
They were trying to tempt me with it.

229
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,380
My gosh.

230
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,050
My gosh, they can't afford fancy meals like that.

231
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,590
I feel bad.

232
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,360
That you're missing your farewell party because of me.

233
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,260
Don't be silly.

234
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,600
Young folks don't want an old-timer crashing their party anyway.

235
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,810
Earlier today,

236
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,780
I dozed off for a moment.

237
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,720
I saw this brilliant blue ocean right in front of me.

238
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,260
A white yacht...

239
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,430
was slicing through the waves.

240
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,270
I was standing on the bow, with the wind in my face.

241
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,310
My gosh, what a wonderful dream.

242
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,880
Wonderful? It's a nightmare, knowing I can never do that.

243
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,620
What about Jun Kyung?

244
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,690
Did she call?

245
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,959
She did. I was surprised...

246
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,400
she remembered to call, busy as she is.

247
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,430
Who am I kidding?

248
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,300
It's not like I don't know our daughter.

249
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,010
It's food. Open your mouth.

250
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,180
Say "Ah." Open up. Here it comes. It's going in!

251
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,180
Hey, don't throw that at your aunt. Goodness!

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,879
- Hey, you guys aren't going to eat? - Isn't it tasty? Yes?

253
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,019
Where are you going?

254
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,419
- Look at you eating all that. - Come back here. You'll fall.

255
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
Open up.

256
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,590
That's it. Just look at you go. It's yummy, right?

257
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,490
Come here. Don't you dare.

258
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,960
- Come here and eat your food. - Is it yummy? Look at you.

259
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,030
- No! - Open up.

260
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,210
Do you have to mope around all by yourself like this?

261
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,549
You'll catch your death. Cover up.

262
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,650
My day started with caffeine and ended with alcohol.

263
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,050
And just like that, another tedious day is over.

264
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,520
This is my favourite time of day.

265
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,090
Right after the day is finally over,

266
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,590
while Hyung Jun puts the kids to bed and gets some drinks ready,

267
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,370
this brief moment I have to myself, quiet and alone,

268
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,600
is just pure bliss.

269
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,210
You know what's funny?

270
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,180
I got married because I didn't want to be lonely.

271
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,510
And Hyung Jun is okay with that?

272
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,450
Hyung Jun doesn't really have a say in it.

273
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,850
He's the one who wanted three kids.

274
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,120
He enjoys it, though.

275
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,990
Says he's a natural.

276
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,229
My mother-in-law gives me such a hard time...

277
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,400
for making her precious son...

278
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,960
trade his white coat for an apron...

279
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,070
when I'm a precious daughter too.

280
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,210
They're finally asleep.

281
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,370
What'll it be tonight?

282
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,880
Let's go with the black raspberry wine.

283
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,050
Right. And for food, it's up to the chef.

284
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,379
Black raspberry wine and a chef's special it is.

285
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,520
Sit tight.

286
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,820
You have a good thing going.

287
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,290
Of course. I shower him with love.

288
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,660
Love?

289
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,370
What?

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,470
Too cheesy for you?

291
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,470
You have all these people out there,

292
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,810
so full of love that they're cheating left and right.

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,250
So how can my dear friend, Seo Jun Kyung, be so cold-hearted?

294
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,250
- Gosh, your arm is heavy. - Hey.

295
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,850
Love is supposed to be heavy and cheesy, you know?

296
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,060
- It feels nice, doesn't it? - No, it doesn't, you weirdo.

297
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,890
Love is a great thing, isn't it?

299
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,670
Enjoy your meal.

300
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,540
Thank you.

(Matna Tonkasu)

302
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,190
- Welcome. - Hey.

303
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,860
You're just eating some dry old pork cutlet?

304
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,329
- Ma'am, jjolmyeon, please. - Go eat at home.

305
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,460
Do you know what time it is? My parents ate and cleaned up.

306
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,170
You should get home earlier. It's not like you're busy.

307
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,770
I don't want to go home early.

308
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,339
- I feel like I'm on eggshells. - And we're splitting the bill.

309
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,770
Come on, buy me a meal. You have a job.

310
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,809
My team had a work dinner last week.

311
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,810
I didn't ask.

312
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,079
First, we had grilled intestines, and for Round Two, we hit a club.

313
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,090
I still don't care.

314
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,720
Your girlfriend was performing, by the way.

315
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,290
You saw Sol?

316
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,730
All the guys from my office were going nuts.

317
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,360
That's my Sol for you. Absolutely dazzling.

318
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,530
A junior from my marketing team went to middle school with her.

319
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,830
They quickly exchanged numbers that night.

320
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,040
He said he was going to make a move.

321
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,270
Hey, that guy only wears designer brands.

322
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
He basically treats his job like a hobby.

323
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,049
Hey! You see this? Right here?

324
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,609
It's a symbol of our faith and trust.

325
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,220
That's disgusting. We're eating.

326
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,320
See? This is why you're single.

327
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,660
But weren't you supposed...

328
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,260
to eat at home today of all days?

329
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,230
Today?

330
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,830
Why?

331
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,840
You forgot today was Dad's last day, didn't you?

332
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,070
Was that today?

333
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,410
Since you live by yourself, shouldn't you be more caring?

334
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,910
I get a pass since I live with them and can just see them at home.

335
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,480
You're freeloading. You're not living with them.

336
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,080
Call him now before it's too late.

337
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,290
And just in case you forgot, Mom and Dad's anniversary is Sunday.

338
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,660
Why is Dad getting us all together for their anniversary?

339
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,530
I told you. It's for his retirement. We're celebrating two occasions.

340
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,330
It's on Sunday. Seriously, don't forget.

341
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
What's this?

342
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,610
Your mom likes mint chocolate chip.

343
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,140
Make sure to thank your dad for all his hard work.

344
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,850
And don't be silly and say it came from me.

345
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,820
- I'm off. Bye. - Thank you.

346
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
Bye.

347
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,650
(Dad: Jun Kyung, call me when you're off work.)

348
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,590
Sorry I couldn't call sooner. I was busy.

349
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,690
Thank you for all your hard work, Dad.

350
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,930
(Dad: Jun Kyung, call me when you're off work.)

351
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,520
Gosh, that startled me.

352
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,150
All right.

353
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,620
Here you go.

354
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,969
We're going to set sail today.

355
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,539
- So we rented a boat. - My gosh.

356
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,310
- A boat? - Yes. A boat.

357
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,310
How about we pack lunch...

358
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,980
and go for a walk in the park tomorrow?

359
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,350
No.

360
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,550
Why not? The weather's so nice and warm.

361
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,290
Watching people strolling...

362
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,660
and seeing them out and about just makes me feel lonely.

363
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,660
- Let our tour begin. Let's go. - Let's go.

364
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,990
I bet this is expensive.

365
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,129
It is a bit expensive.

366
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,530
But I have so much time on my hands now,

367
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,730
and there are so many places I want to go with you.

368
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,300
That's my point. Who told you to just quit your job?

369
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,210
It was a waste of time.

370
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,950
Aren't you...

371
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,290
sick and tired of me?

372
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
Come on.

373
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,790
How could I ever be sick of you?

374
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,030
You're just as charming as ever.

375
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,300
So you'll go to the park with me tomorrow, right?

376
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Some other time.

377
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,170
Right, some other time.

378
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,080
There's no such thing as next time.

379
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,720
Guys who just want to sleep with you will do anything to win you over.

380
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,120
But on the other hand,

381
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,830
what about the guys who take it slow and get to know you?

382
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,890
And what are they like?

383
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,060
They'll take their time, getting to know you...

384
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,499
and in the end, they'll still do anything to get you into bed.

385
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,969
My point is, all guys are the same.

386
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,770
That's why I don't want to date. They're all cut from the same cloth,

387
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,809
so why waste my emotions on them?

388
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,610
Seriously? Then why bother going on a blind date?

389
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,280
That was...

390
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,009
- part of my social life at work. - Please.

391
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,450
I can be sociable for work.

392
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,689
Says the one who bought new clothes and shoes for it.

393
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,090
She totally got her hopes up.

394
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,660
That was...

395
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,489
- just being polite. It was manners. - Give me a break.

396
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,889
My point is I don't have to worry...

397
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,199
about being polite and having manners...

398
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,900
when I'm on my own. It's just easier.

399
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,160
Look, Jun Kyung.

400
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,670
- The number one is perfect. - Yes.

401
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,899
- It's stable. - Yes.

402
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,910
No surprises. It's all predictable. In fact, there's nothing to predict.

403
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
- But... - That's great.

404
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,610
It's boring.

405
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,419
When you add another to make two, that's when things get complicated.

406
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,149
But it's fun.

407
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,649
Jun Kyung, think about it. You can't do anything by yourself.

408
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,719
- Right. - See?

409
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Just like that. With two people, you can nod along.

410
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,989
Cheers. You can even make a toast.

411
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,130
You can even give a compliment, "Gosh, you're a natural at this."

412
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,100
You can comfort each other and say, "It's going to be okay."

413
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,170
You can also get into a fight.

414
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,500
Exactly, you can fight. But you can also make up.

415
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,240
But then you add 1 more person and become 3.

416
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,640
Then someone can take sides or break up the fight.

417
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,210
See? Isn't this so much more interesting?

418
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,650
Five is a bit much, though.

419
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,110
What?

420
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm sorry, did you want six instead?

421
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,060
No. Seven is a lucky number. Honey, we're having black raspberry wine.

422
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,590
How about we try for twins tonight? Come here.

423
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,459
Don't you dare lay a hand on me. You must be crazy. Seven kids?

424
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,729
What are we, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?

425
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,969
See, Jun Kyung? Happiness isn't that close.

426
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,239
It's far away. That's why you have to work for it.

427
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,770
Isn't the act of trying to be happy a sign that you're unhappy?

428
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,080
If you actually try,

429
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,650
do you really end up happy?

430
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Dad, you're home.

431
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,040
- You're back. Did you eat? - Yes. What about Mom?

432
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,340
She's asleep. Maybe it's because they changed her painkillers,

433
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,840
but she's been getting really tired lately.

434
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,550
This is...

435
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,120
for your retirement, Dad.

436
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,490
Congratulations? Is that the right thing to say?

437
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,290
Anyway, thank you for all your hard work.

438
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,790
- You knew about it? - What?

439
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,100
To be honest, I completely forgot. I'm sorry.

440
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,400
- Hye On bought it. - Hye On?

441
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,800
That's so thoughtful of her. What a sweetheart.

442
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,210
Your mom is going to love this, you know?

443
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,279
Let's put this in the freezer and we can all eat it on Sunday.

444
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Sounds good.

445
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,080
- I'm going to sleep. - Okay. Get some sleep.

446
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,410
Out of everyone from our year,

447
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,380
I always thought you'd be the first to get married.

448
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,920
What makes you say that?

449
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,820
You don't remember? Remember Kyung Min?

450
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,130
I have no idea what you saw in that stuffy, clueless nerd.

451
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,300
You were always chasing after him.

452
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,230
- You even told him how you felt. - Just to get turned down.

453
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,140
You confessed your feelings, got turned down,

454
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,940
and then immediately found someone new to crush on.

455
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
That fearless and amazing Seo Jun Kyung...

456
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,850
I miss her.

457
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,550
I was young.

458
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,350
Come on, I told you to spend the night.

459
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,490
The population density at your place is too high.

460
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,290
Hey.

461
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,530
What can you even do alone? Besides getting lonely?

462
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,400
Too bad.

463
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,070
Because I'm not lonely. Not at all.

464
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,140
Bye.

465
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,559
Am I the only one who doesn't know this phrase?

466
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,390
- What? - That's a new one on me.

467
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,430
Right? I've heard of sayings like "Heads for fish, tails for meat."

468
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,000
I've heard of that phrase along with her name, Oh Na Mi.

469
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,500
Oh, that's a good pair.

470
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,790
- When you're done, do it again. - Okay.

471
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,620
Keep your composure.

472
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,230
The Environment Foundation helps companion dogs naturally...

473
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,429
(Through agility training, )

474
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,540
(dogs also learn everyday manners.)

475
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,900
("You and I," Episode 6, Rerun)

476
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,480
("You and I," From Episode 5 to 6)

477
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,910
("Men on a Mission")

478
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,810
Loneliness is a shameful secret.

479
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,450
A secret that must never be revealed to anyone.

480
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,860
If by chance, someone tries to look into that secret,

481
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,760
our defence mechanisms kick in.

482
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,530
Some of us rush to make excuses,

483
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,430
some of us get angry,

484
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,670
and some of us run away.

485
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,110
Some say loneliness shouldn't be hidden,

486
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,850
but acknowledged.

487
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,420
Yet, that's as difficult as facing death.

488
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,020
That's why we wear flashy clothes,

489
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,290
put on even more extravagant makeup,

490
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,400
and meet people with smiles that feign warmth.

491
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,900
All to keep our shameful secret from being exposed.

492
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,110
That was a passage from "The World's Many Joys and Sorrows."

493
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,440
Shall we listen to a song that goes perfectly with this book?

494
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,440
That'll be nine dollars.

495
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,410
My gosh.

496
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,180
What was that?

497
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,520
- Thank you. - Gosh, you startled me.

498
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,330
Why are you following me?

499
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,030
I'm going this way too.

500
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,210
I suppose I could have run past you...

501
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,480
or taken the long way around.

502
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,210
But it's just so cold today.

503
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,250
I can do that now if you...

504
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Don't bother.

505
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,400
- This isn't following you, right? - Gosh, you're startled me.

506
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,840
See? This isn't following. It's walking together.

507
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,040
I'm going to drink this with my husband.

508
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,510
You live in this building?

509
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,650
Do you live in this building?

510
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,930
No, I don't live here.

511
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,540
What's with that new breed of weirdo?

512
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,210
Who knew I could have fun on my own?

513
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,820
This is perfect.

514
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,030
(Golden Tour)

515
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Excuse me.

516
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,470
My wife has some mobility issues,

517
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,380
so travelling internationally is a bit tough.

518
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,510
So for domestic travel,

519
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,650
we'd like a destination without too much walking.

520
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
I see.

521
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,660
If possible, somewhere with no walking at all.

522
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,200
We do have a place with fully accessible facilities.

523
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,970
How about a resort on Jeju Island?

524
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Jeju Island.

525
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,470
You'll get premium services. How does that sound?

526
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,740
That sounds great,

527
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,550
but it must be expensive, right?

528
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,050
It's the All-Inclusive Full Package.

529
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,580
What does "inclusive" mean?

530
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,160
Included?

531
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,060
- Everything's included. - I see. But...

532
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,400
we don't need the full package. The basic option is good enough.

533
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,100
Our premium resort offers a wide variety of packages.

534
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,939
We have Special Gold, Fantastic Silver,

535
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,610
and Beautiful Bronze.

536
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,849
(All-Inclusive: 5,999 dollars, Special Gold: 4,999 dollars)

537
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,180
(Fantastic Silver: 3,999 dollars, Beautiful Bronze: 2,999 dollars)

538
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,020
Don't you have anything cheaper?

539
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,250
Like Normal Copper...

540
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,260
or something like Simple Brass?

541
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,030
Take a look, sir. These are special off-season prices.

542
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,140
We could take off another 20 percent if you remove some perks,

543
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,640
but if you do, the booking becomes non-refundable.

544
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,470
We won't be cancelling once we book. We're definitely going.

545
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,680
This package is perfect for you. Take a look.

546
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,179
- Is the yacht tour included? - Of course.

547
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,290
You can opt for a private yacht tour for just the two of you.

548
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,000
Excuse me, how much is that one?

549
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,470
This one's 260 dollars. Would you like it?

550
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,510
No, let me think about it.

551
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,610
How much is that one over there?

552
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
This one is 180 dollars.

553
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,620
Okay, then...

554
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
what about this one?

555
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,000
What's the occasion, if you don't mind me asking?

556
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,000
It's for a celebration.

557
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,209
(Steak, potatoes, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, )

558
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,479
(diapers, ice cream, tofu, dried pollack, onions, )

559
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,819
(Hamburg steak recipe)

560
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,950
Has it been...

561
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,050
37 years?

562
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,550
What?

563
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,059
Come on. We must count from the day when we got our pictures taken...

564
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,130
and signed the papers for our wedding anniversary.

565
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,830
Let's see. We registered after Jun Kyung turned one.

566
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,530
It's our 35th anniversary.

567
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,900
It feels like the time has flown by.

568
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,710
But at the same time, it feels like it's crawled.

569
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,740
You think so?

570
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,880
For me, it only crawled.

571
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,650
What are you going to wear, honey?

572
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,920
Just like Jun Kyung said,

573
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,320
- I should be in a nursing home. - Don't say that.

574
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,160
Why would you go there when I'm right here?

575
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,730
Honey.

576
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,670
How about this one? I always loved it on you.

577
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,830
That won't fit.

578
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,280
The problem is,

579
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,820
I knew it was broken, but I just let it be.

580
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,320
You should've gotten it fixed.

581
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,690
You think they can just come the same day you call?

582
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,560
The technician's schedule has to line up with my day off.

583
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,700
If it's this hard to see a repairman,

584
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,030
how can I meet anyone?

585
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm getting off work soon.

586
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,170
Just do it at my place.

587
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,470
- There's something I have to do. - Like what?

588
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,980
Something exhausting.

589
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
No.

590
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,460
Actually, it's something terrifying.

591
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,230
If you see a missed call, you're supposed to call back.

592
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,600
I told you I was going to sleep in after practising all night.

593
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,730
You were sleeping for so long, I got worried.

594
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,869
What's there to worry about when I'm sleeping?

595
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,240
You're so pretty, I get worried guys will hit on you in your dreams.

596
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,040
Come on.

597
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,440
Who are you meeting up with?

598
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,480
Just some friends you don't know. Friends from middle school.

599
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,050
They're coming to my club show, so we're hanging out after.

600
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,290
Friends from middle school?

601
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,320
- Which friends from middle school? - I have another call. Talk later.

602
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,760
Okay, call me later. You'd better. Love you.

603
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,290
Okay.

604
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,210
What's going on?

605
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,210
What do you mean?

606
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,410
You can't be on your way out already.

607
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,780
Mind your own business.

608
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Come on.

609
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,890
You're family.

610
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,429
Don't tell me you were waiting for me.

611
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,930
Are you crazy? Why would I wait for you?

612
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,770
Because it'd be awkward to go in alone.

613
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,970
Who gets awkward around their own parents?

614
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,540
You're one to talk.

615
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,739
- I do just fine. - As if. You're only good at dating.

616
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,310
I don't think I've asked you for money in a while.

617
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,279
Do I really have to take that from you?

618
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,120
Don't be ridiculous. I pay for half your tuition.

619
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,389
Undergrad in Astronomy.

620
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,450
Master's in Cultural Complex Whatever, was it?

621
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,190
It's Cultural Convergence, actually.

622
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,460
So what's the PhD going to be in?

623
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,829
- Traditional Korean dance? - I'm still figuring out my career.

624
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,829
You just keep flip-flopping. Can't you stick to one thing?

625
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,129
We haven't seen each other in ages, and this is the first thing you say?

626
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,800
Was I wrong about a single thing?

627
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,270
You think you know everything, don't you?

628
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,309
People don't just say what's right all the time.

629
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,580
Even if something isn't true,

630
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,209
you still tell them what they want to hear.

631
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,010
And it's kinder to do that.

632
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,920
On a day like today, you should've suggested we eat out.

633
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,150
You know Mom hates crowds, don't you?

634
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,890
Go on, keep pushing Mom's buttons. Seriously.

635
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,000
There we go. Here. All set.

636
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,040
There we go. One more time.

637
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,580
There we go. Perfect.

638
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Perfect.

639
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,320
Do you want me to put lipstick on you?

640
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,220
My hands work just fine.

641
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,310
What do you think? You look good, right?

642
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,410
- Honey. - Yes?

643
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,750
I'm sorry.

644
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,380
For what?

645
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,690
For everything.

646
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,390
You're getting better.

647
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,330
Everything's going to be okay.

648
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,530
But don't I smell something burning?

649
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,900
Oh, no. The sauce. Oh, dear.

650
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,920
(Jeju Island Trip Voucher)

651
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,560
Okay, this is all set.

652
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,460
- Dad, should I put this here? - Yes. Go ahead.

653
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,600
- After that, add potato slices. - Okay.

654
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,730
Right there.

655
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,469
Jun Seo. Hang on. Come here. Grab this.

656
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,470
Okay.

657
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,540
Be careful.

658
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,710
Gosh, it's hot.

659
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,880
I told you to be careful.

660
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,980
Okay, that's ready.

661
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,780
- Here, grab that first. - Okay.

662
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,120
Dad, do you need some help?

663
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,260
No, it's okay. We're all done. You just sit tight.

664
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
What's wrong?

665
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,710
Nothing, it just feels awkward.

666
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
What does?

667
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,520
My clothes?

668
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,050
No.

669
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,640
Mom, do you need anything?

670
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,670
What would I possibly need?

671
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,470
It's not like I go anywhere.

672
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,980
Have you been going...

673
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,550
to your hospital appointments?

674
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,850
How's your blood pressure?

675
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
My dear mother.

676
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,630
Oh, my.

677
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,430
Aren't you looking sexy today?

678
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,760
You're such a sweet-talker. I wonder who you take after.

679
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,570
That must be why I'm so popular.

680
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,770
You have no idea. My professor's always asking for me.

681
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,410
It's honestly a pain.

682
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,880
How have you been?

683
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,320
At the hospital, you mean? Things are fine.

684
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,120
When you're young,

685
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,360
being a doctor can be something to be proud of.

686
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,229
But when you're older, it's harder for a successful woman to meet men.

687
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,230
Mom.

688
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,840
We haven't seen each other lately. Can't we talk about happy things?

689
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,570
Why? She's not wrong, you know.

690
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,740
All right. Mom, Dad.

691
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,480
Happy anniversary.

692
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,680
Happy anniversary from me too.

693
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:43,760
Gosh, you shouldn't have. Seriously. Thank you.

694
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,190
I'll hire a caregiver, so you can go out with your friends,

695
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,760
go hiking, and do things like that.

696
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,830
You've been working so hard lately without any rest.

697
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
What are you talking about? When would Dad have time for that?

698
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,470
Mom's always here by herself.

699
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,140
Come on.

700
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,639
Your mother used to wait up alone until I got off work.

701
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,940
That was hard on her.

702
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,750
Isn't it better she doesn't have to? Right?

703
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,220
Honey, do you remember?

704
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,090
For our first anniversary, we splurged at a Western diner.

705
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,259
We ordered the hamburg steak.

706
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,030
That was our first time trying wine, remember?

707
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,630
And we couldn't stop laughing at our purple lips from the wine.

708
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,870
You remember that. Don't you, honey?

709
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,700
I don't.

710
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,510
Right, Gosh, it was a long time ago.

711
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,010
It's ancient history. It was over 30 years ago.

712
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,710
So of course, you wouldn't remember.

713
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,950
Here you go, honey.

714
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,460
I've already had painkillers twice today.

715
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,490
That's right.

716
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
You can't drink then. Sorry.

717
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,170
You have it.

718
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,400
No, I'm not really in the mood for it now anyway.

719
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Water's the best drink there is.

720
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,740
I'll have some.

721
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Do you want some too?

722
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,190
I should have just died back then.

723
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,430
Then you...

724
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,630
wouldn't be stuck drinking plain water.

725
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,270
You could be enjoying all the wine you want.

726
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,510
Do you always have to be so morbid?

727
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,260
I feel like I age ten years every time I come home.

728
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,930
Why did you say "home?"

729
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,830
Just say it's me.

730
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,060
Just admit seeing me is what ages you.

731
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,969
Mom, you know emotions are contagious.

732
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,100
Hey, Jun Kyung.

733
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
All right.

734
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,110
Everyone, let's just stop, okay? How about we all make a toast?

735
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,910
- Come on, it's a special day. - Is it really that hard...

736
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,210
for you to celebrate on a special day like this?

737
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,390
That thing you're doing isn't being considerate.

738
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,990
You're torturing me.

739
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,730
- Drink it. - Mom!

740
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,630
It's okay, Jun Kyung. It's fine.

741
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,040
All right, fine. I'll drink it. No big deal.

742
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,840
- Drink all of it! - Mom!

743
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,250
That's enough. All right.

744
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,930
Okay, it's time to blow out the candles. All right, hold on.

745
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,000
Okay.

746
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,350
Mom, your dress is a little tight, right?

747
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,740
- Honey. - Yes?

748
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,610
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

749
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,510
- I need to lie down. - Right, okay.

750
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,850
- Okay, I've got her. - No. Dad, I'll do it.

751
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,610
No, you stay here. I'll do it. Just sit.

752
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,450
Stay put.

753
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,730
Are we only supposed to say what Mom wants to hear?

754
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,040
It was just an unfortunate accident. Thank goodness that she didn't die.

755
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,510
How long must we be miserable if Mom won't even try to get better?

756
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,550
- Just don't ruin Mom's day. - She ruined mine too, you know?

757
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,320
Grow up. Please.

758
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,640
I knew it. Four is too many.

759
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:08,850
Honey.

760
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,750
Don't be upset. Okay?

761
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,320
I guess Jun Kyung is right.

762
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:21,930
I...

763
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,530
I should probably lose some weight.

764
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,630
Even the doctor said I should.

765
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,370
Okay. But don't push yourself. Take it slow.

766
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,510
We can do it together, nice and slow. Okay?

767
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,510
What is it?

768
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,780
Without you,

769
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,360
what could I possibly do?

770
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,600
And without you,

771
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,570
what could I possibly do?

772
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,110
I'm leaving now.

773
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,210
Get some sleep.

774
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,520
You're leaving already?

775
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,790
Might as well leave.

776
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,060
Your mom will feel bad if you just leave like this.

777
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,240
Some other time.

778
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,490
- You should go back inside. - Go ahead now. It's cold out.

779
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,690
Go on now.

780
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
Jun Kyung.

781
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,500
You haven't been home in six months, you know that?

782
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,010
Okay?

783
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,580
Say if your mom and I live for another 20 years.

784
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,920
The number of times we'll all eat together...

785
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,620
would only be 40 more times. You get it?

786
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,160
We just used one up, so that leaves 39.

787
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,130
Right?

788
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,140
Come home more often.

789
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,240
Come eat with your mom more often.

790
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,310
Okay?

791
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,210
Okay.

792
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,420
Go on.

793
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:02,890
I'll get going.

794
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,260
Go.

795
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,440
Hey, Sol.

796
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Hello?

797
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,150
Why aren't you saying anything?

798
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,920
Sol, I think you might've pocket-dialled me.

799
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,460
- Hey. - Hey, that tickles. Stop it.

800
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,100
- Is this your erogenous zone? - I told you to stop.

801
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,330
Oh, my. Your slaps hurt like crazy.

802
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,270
- Sol. - I said stop!

803
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,970
- Hey! - That actually hurts.

804
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,710
- Sol. - Stop it.

805
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,870
What are you doing?

806
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,600
Thirty...

807
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,170
five.

808
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,680
(Golden Tour)

809
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:25,100
I'm not sure how you'll...

810
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,200
I don't know how you'll take this.

811
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,670
So...

812
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,240
in our life together...

813
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,040
we had our share of hard times, of course,

814
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,540
but we've also had...

815
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,950
so many wonderful days.

816
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,680
So from now on...

817
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,350
What?

818
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,860
My gosh.

819
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,360
From here on out,

820
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,730
for the rest of our lives,

821
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:06,440
let's just be happy together. Okay?

822
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,240
I love you, honey. Sleep well.

823
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,630
Honey.

824
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,430
I'm heading out for a bit!

825
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:38,170
Jun Seo, call 911!

826
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,170
Honey.

827
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,140
Honey.

828
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,510
Honey.

829
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,160
But still...

830
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,030
I thought there would always be a next time.

831
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,370
A chance to gift her a big basket of flowers without a second thought.

832
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,370
Honey, please open your eyes.

833
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:16,270
A time to sit side by side on the grass at the park...

834
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,510
and share a picnic.

835
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,450
"Good night, Mom."

836
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,720
A next time to say those simple words.

837
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,930
I thought we had...

838
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,070
so many of those ordinary tomorrows left.

839
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:01,190
(Love Me)
