00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,210
(Seo Hyun Jin)

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,120
(Yoo Jae Myung)

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,450
(Lee Si Woo)

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,430
(Yoon Se A)

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,770
(Chang Ryul)

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,650
(Dahyun)

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,820
(Love Me)

8
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,050
You don't know what Do Hyun thinks.

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm sure he'd be thrilled if he knew his son was coming.

10
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,470
There's something I need to ask you.

11
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,680
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's son?

12
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,650
What did you say?

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,150
I'm asking, is Daniel really his biological son?

14
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,290
What on earth are you talking about?

15
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Did Do Hyun tell you that?

16
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,760
That Daniel isn't his son?

17
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,570
Promise me, Jun Kyung.

18
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
That you won't tell a soul...

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,820
about what happened today.

20
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,790
All right.

21
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,860
No one will ever know.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,970
The door I promised myself I would never open...

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,230
is now open.

24
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,140
No.

25
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,970
I was the one who opened it.

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,150
How did this happen again?

27
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,820
How could this happen again?

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,330
I'll just regret it,

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
be anxious,

30
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,440
and look the other way.

31
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,350
Then I'll just run away again.

32
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,580
(Im Yoon Ju)

33
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,150
In the end,

34
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,660
again,

35
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,090
(Im Yoon Ju)

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,600
I'll just be a coward.

37
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,600
There's nothing to worry about.

38
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,930
I'm sure everything's fine. We're just here to confirm that.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,140
You get what I'm saying, right?

40
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,210
- Ms. Jin Ja Yeong.
- Yes.

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
We're ready for you now.

42
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,850
See you soon.

43
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,720
Ja Yeong, let's get something good to eat after this.

44
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
(MRI Room)

45
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,420
Darn.

46
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,860
- Mr. Seo.
- Father.

47
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,470
Please pray for me.

48
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,670
Here is a child of the Lord.

49
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,710
A child of the Lord who is filled with fear.

50
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,080
Lord, come to our side,

51
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,390
and hold our hands, which feel so weak and fragile.

52
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,860
Please, Lord, take them in yours.

53
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,790
Let love be a beacon of hope on our path.

54
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Let us believe...

55
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,500
that our faith will make us stronger.

56
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,400
Whatever comes our way,

57
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,440
may the love that we share in our eternal embrace...

58
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,540
be all that remains.

59
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Amen.

60
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,860
Time between school runs flies by, doesn't it?

61
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,430
But at least they're old enough now, right?

62
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,460
We can finally get out and catch our breath.

63
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,270
- Come back soon.
- "Soon"?

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,500
- I'll be here every day.
- You will?

65
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,640
What about you? How's married life treating you?

66
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,970
I'm going crazy from lack of sleep. I had no idea he snored so loudly.

67
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
So he was hiding it from you.

68
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,710
And you got played.

69
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,320
Looks like trouble's brewing.

70
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,090
Daniel.

71
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,060
Ma'am. Can you meet me for a minute later?

72
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Is everything okay?

73
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,470
There's something I need to tell you.

74
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,150
The thing is, I like Ji Min...

75
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,380
but I think she likes Geon Woo.

76
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,090
If I confess and she turns me down,

77
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,360
it'd be kind of embarrassing.

78
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,690
The three of us are best friends,

79
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
and I'm worried I'll make things weird between us.

80
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
That's it?

81
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,500
What do you mean, "that's it"?

82
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,340
This is a huge deal for me.

83
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,970
If it's such a huge deal,

84
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,680
why are you telling me instead of your mom?

85
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,880
If I told my mom I have a crush,

86
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,090
I feel like she might get a little lonely.

87
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,330
Daniel, you're so sweet.

88
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,270
I just felt so stuck and had to talk to someone.

89
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,200
If I told my dad,

90
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,940
he'd just tell me I'm the best...

91
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,940
and that I should just go for it.

92
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,280
I thought you'd give the most honest and straightforward advice.

93
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,380
Plus, I knew you could keep a secret.

94
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm not that honest.

95
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
And I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

96
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,710
Okay, I'm out of here.

97
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,380
Oh, hi.

98
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,710
I should get to my tutoring class now.

99
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,510
- Ji Min?
- Ji Min and Geon Woo.

100
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,150
Ms. Seo.

101
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,820
To my dad...

102
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,490
Don't tell. Promise?

103
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,260
I'm really counting on you.

104
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,690
- I'm off.
- Study hard.

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Hurry up.

106
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Ms. Jin Ja Yeong?

107
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
What did he say?

108
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
You're okay, right?

109
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,040
Right?

110
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,540
See? What did I tell you? I told you you were fine and not to worry.

111
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,940
I wasn't worried one bit.

112
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,660
Looking at your medical questionnaire,

113
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,630
I see you've had symptoms before.

114
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,300
This area here is the temporal lobe.

115
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,510
If you compare it to a scan of a healthy brain,

116
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,740
you can see significant atrophy, can't you?

117
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,510
Based on the combined test results,

118
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,220
it appears to be Alzheimer's disease.

119
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,190
Doctor, but I...

120
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm still so young.

121
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,590
Yes, you're in your late 40s.

122
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,860
This is what's known as early-onset dementia.

123
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,660
Early-onset dementia...

124
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,100
tends to progress more rapidly than other types.

125
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,610
How rapidly?

126
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,510
(Exit)

127
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,020
I'll go get the car.

128
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,090
Wait here for a second.

129
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,070
Typically, within 1 to 2 years,

130
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
you'll gradually lose your memories.

131
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
Darn.

132
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,650
This is so unfair.

133
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,090
I prayed so darn hard. Just this once...

134
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,930
I begged you to help me this once.

135
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,630
How could you do this to me?

136
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,730
Darn it! How could you do this to me?

137
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,170
How could you do this to me again!

138
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,200
Darn it!

139
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Hey!

140
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
Great work, sir.

141
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,730
Your materials for today, the order of the graphs and charts was a mess.

142
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,340
They were?

143
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,770
I told you to be extra careful so we could finish on a high note.

144
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm sorry, sir.

145
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,710
Dozing off like that kills the mood in the room.

146
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,620
But seriously, is something going on with you lately?

147
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,350
Are you not sleeping?

148
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
I'm sorry, sir.

149
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
And you look completely drained.

150
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,100
- Excuse me, I have a question.
- Yes?

151
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,540
With a machine like this, is it going to hurt?

152
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,600
I think you'll be surprised.

153
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,240
- I will?
- Because it doesn't hurt at all.

154
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,510
- I see.
- You have nothing to worry about.

155
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,940
- Okay.
- Here we go.

156
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,090
All done. Here, take a look in the mirror.

157
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,630
- Take your time getting up.
- Thank you.

158
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,370
I absolutely love it. I'm definitely coming back.

159
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,670
Hello, gorgeous.

160
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,340
Refresh complete.

161
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,710
Goodness.

162
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,020
What are you doing? Trying to get sunspots?

163
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,750
This weather is absolute trash.

164
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,220
There's no such thing as trash weather.

165
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,560
Only different kinds of beautiful weather.

166
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,460
John Ruskin.

167
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,830
So? Don't I look as radiant as the day?

168
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,470
Right. It'd be nice to see your radiant face at home more often.

169
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,370
Why drag me out when I'm exhausted and look like hell?

170
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
Follow me.

171
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,280
Let's just go inside. It's hot.

172
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
How about this one?

173
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,390
Right.

174
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,920
- It's not bad.
- Yes! That was high praise.

175
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Goodness.

176
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,089
Stop trying them on. You aren't buying them.

177
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,360
I am buying this.

178
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,830
Are you crazy?

179
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,570
- Do you know how much this costs?
- Did you forget?

180
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm the writer who's about to win a 50,000-dollar prize.

181
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm already in the fast lane to riches.

182
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,710
You have to dress for the occasion.

183
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,750
You have to wear something this nice for the awards ceremony.

184
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,520
All right, you've earned it.

185
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
You should try one on too.

186
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm good. What are you talking about?

187
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,860
Gosh, you keep forgetting.

188
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,100
I promised you a designer suit when I win the grand prize.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And...

190
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,840
I think I have you to thank for this too.

191
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,510
I feel like you set things in motion with your good news,

192
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,410
and I feel like your luck rubbed off on me.

193
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,920
You look incredible!

194
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,990
If you lecture in this, your students will go wild.

195
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,930
Come on. It doesn't even look good on me.

196
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,800
You are Ji Hye On's boyfriend. What do you mean it doesn't?

197
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,540
I'm the guy pushed onto the shoulder of that fast lane. This is too much.

198
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,910
But I'm about to get famous and even more successful.

199
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,440
You'd better get used to the pressure.

200
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,780
Oh, my!

201
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,250
We look like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

202
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,560
See? I told you we should wear them together.

203
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,430
Gosh, this is so awkward.

204
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,200
I have nothing to celebrate like you do.

205
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,270
Come to think of it,

206
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,310
it's not about wearing nice clothes when something good happens.

207
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,110
Don't you think good things happen because you wear nice clothes?

208
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,020
Look. It seems everyone here came hoping for something good to happen.

209
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,560
Gosh, if I'd just taken out a loan and bought this last year,

210
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,160
I could've been enjoying this win a year sooner.

211
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,730
Look at us, going from pork cutlets to steak.

212
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,400
See? Things are already different.

213
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,130
This steak is fine and all,

214
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,940
but Matna's pork cutlets are better.

215
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,310
And you...

216
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,440
Do you really think that dress looks good on you?

217
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,210
Of course I do.

218
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,350
Must be nice.

219
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,630
Is that the professor again?

220
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,260
Just because he set you up with that instructor position,

221
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,260
he's giving you such a hard time.

222
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
Let's go inside. It's getting chilly.

223
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,150
But the embers are still glowing.

224
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,990
Let's put them out before going in.

225
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,630
But they're still alive.

226
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,400
Why put them out on purpose?

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,500
Ja Yeong, do you remember when we first met?

228
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,070
On Jeju Island.

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,910
My pants ripped while I was hiking up a hill.

230
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,640
And you took off your jacket in a flash...

231
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,680
and tied it around my waist for me, remember?

232
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,920
I was so grateful to you for that, Ja Yeong.

233
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,450
- Jin Ho.
- Yes?

234
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,260
Please don't be so nice to me.

235
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,400
I'll just...

236
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,430
end up forgetting everything anyway.

237
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,820
Ja Yeong, how about I sing for you? It's been a while.

238
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,960
Okay.

239
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,630
It's been so long.

240
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,930
I'd love to hear it.

241
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,070
Stay by my side

242
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,680
Stay with me

243
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,710
Don't you dare

244
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,420
Go away

245
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,460
And leave me longing

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,430
On this long, lonely road

247
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,640
You will never find

248
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,540
Your rainbow

249
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,250
If you go

250
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,690
Please fill me up with your love

251
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,470
My love battery is dead

252
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,770
I can't live without you

253
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,710
No, I can't live

254
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,010
You are my battery

255
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,350
Please fill me up with your love

256
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,220
My love battery is dead

257
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,499
I can't live without you

258
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
- No, I can't live - No, I can't live

259
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,940
- You are my battery - You are my battery

260
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,380
A little brighter. No, a lot brighter.

261
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Let's do one more take.

262
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,520
How many times has it been? It's like this every time.

263
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,290
I told you the song was too dark. See? They said it's depressing.

264
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,830
Look, let's be real. We're not making fine art here.

265
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,200
Can't you give them what they want?

266
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,099
It was approved ages ago.

267
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,070
- What is this?
- Tell me about it.

268
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,170
But I don't call the shots.

269
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Neither are you guys.

270
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,650
Do Hyun.

271
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,580
I hate to be a pain about this,

272
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,420
but please, do me a solid this one time.

273
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,230
I'm not changing it.

274
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,000
Hey, come on.

275
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
What's gotten into you suddenly?

276
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,330
This isn't like you.

277
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,040
I said I'm not changing it.

278
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,870
Hey!

279
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Ju Do Hyun!

280
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,610
Hey, stop yelling. You're the one out of line.

281
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,310
What's with him?

282
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,630
Do Hyun.

283
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,290
You started smoking again?

284
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,830
Look, even if you're pissed off,

285
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,340
you're supposed to fight it a little and then just give in.

286
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,570
It's not like this is the first time.

287
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,380
Do Hyun.

288
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,110
What's gotten into you lately?

289
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't know where he found them, but Do Hyun brought strawberries.

290
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,260
I hope Little Bean takes after their kind father.

291
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,590
Do Hyun and I listened to Little Bean's heartbeat together.

292
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,730
On the way home, Do Hyun suggested we buy shoes for Little Bean,

293
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,840
but we didn't know whether to get blue or pink,

294
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,440
so we bought yellow ones.

295
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,310
At seven weeks, Little Bean is only half an inch long.

296
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,210
Little Bean grows 1mm a day. It's so adorable.

297
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Gosh!

298
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,630
Gosh.

299
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,810
Mom! Are you okay?

300
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
Are you okay?

301
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Where is Daniel?

302
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,030
He's at Geon Woo's for a sleepover. I already spoke with his dad.

303
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
He was...

304
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,030
really shaken up.

305
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,840
I'm such a terrible mother.

306
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,320
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's son?

307
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,390
I'm asking, is Daniel really his biological son?

308
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Yes, Jun Kyung.

309
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,260
Aren't you done recording yet?

310
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
I need to talk to you.

311
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,330
I'm at the hospital right now.

312
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
What?

313
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,370
Yoon Ju got hurt.

314
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,640
What? How...

315
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,250
Is it serious?

316
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,820
Yes.

317
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,920
Let's talk later.

318
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,160
Don't wait up for me. I might be late.

319
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,190
Okay.

320
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,010
- What are you doing?
- I want to go home. I hate it here.

321
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Thanks.

322
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Sure.

323
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Get some rest.

324
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm fine. You can go now.

325
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,490
Let me just clean this up, then I'll go.

326
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,330
It's fine.

327
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Just go.

328
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,740
Is that what you really think?

329
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,350
Are you saying Daniel isn't my son?

330
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Why?

331
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,250
Didn't you say that?

332
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,260
So, did that woman just make it all up?

333
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,460
Did she make this entire thing up?

334
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,000
Just because I love you,

335
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
does that mean I deserve to be punished like this?

336
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
It's true, right?

337
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,730
Daniel really is...

338
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,430
my son, right?

339
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,470
Don't you remember?

340
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,910
When we heard his heartbeat for the very first time?

341
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,210
When we bought his first shoes?

342
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,350
You said you saw him in the nursery and knew at once he looked like you.

343
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,230
- Does Daniel know?
- Why?

344
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,760
And that's what you're worried about?

345
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,600
You don't have the right to worry about Daniel anymore.

346
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,150
Do Hyun, when did you get here?

347
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,210
I didn't even hear you come in.

348
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,460
Do Hyun.

349
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Do Hyun.

350
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,630
Why did you do it?

351
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,370
You made a promise...

352
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,970
to me.

353
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
That you wouldn't say a word.

354
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,780
You promised me.

355
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,290
Do Hyun, your hand...

356
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,160
Oh, no.

357
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Why did you do it?

358
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,980
Why did you do it?

359
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm sorry.

360
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,060
Don't just say you're sorry.

361
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,630
I'm asking you why you did it.

362
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,970
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,280
At least give me an excuse.

364
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm sorry.

366
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,940
- Hey.
- Sorry. Is it too early?

367
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,340
- Did I wake you?
- Not at all. I've been up.

368
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,680
The thing is...

369
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Sorry?

370
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,480
Yong Jun from Bundang...

371
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,310
He passed away early this morning.

372
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,280
When I stopped by last week,

373
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,450
he was doing well with his chemo and seemed so much better.

374
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,520
For it to be so sudden...

375
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,200
I tried to be quiet, but I guess I woke you.

376
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,700
I woke up because something smelled so good.

377
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,440
It's ready. Have a seat.

378
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,860
You're barely eating.

379
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,530
Is it too bland?

380
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,200
No, it's delicious. See? See how much I've eaten?

381
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,040
Want me to make more omelets?

382
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,910
No.

383
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,910
I'm full.

384
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Time for your medicine, then?

385
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,720
Jin Ho, thank you.

386
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
For what?

387
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
For being so good to me.

388
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,110
Give me your hand. Ja Yeong.

389
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,350
I have to go to Seoul for something today.

390
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,250
Why? Is something wrong?

391
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,050
No, it's nothing like that.

392
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,660
I'm just worried about you being here alone.

393
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,840
You should've gone to school. Why did you come here?

394
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,370
How could I when I was so worried about you, Mom?

395
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,150
But...

396
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,950
I thought you quit drinking.

397
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,620
So why did you drink?

398
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,990
Was it...

399
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,760
because Dad's getting married?

400
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,260
No, it's not that.

401
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,800
I'm sorry.

402
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Let's go buy a new tank for Oscar later.

403
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,750
I won't let it happen again.

404
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,350
I'm sorry for making you worry.

405
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,200
You'll be late for school. Go on, get ready.

406
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,360
Mom?

407
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,390
I can't find my toothbrush.

408
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,460
Did you put it away?

409
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
What is it?

410
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,000
It's been a while since I've seen you in a suit.

411
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,770
You look so handsome.

412
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,610
Why can't I use the car? I'll just get the invite and be right back.

413
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,780
"Be right back"? You used to say you'd never go to your work dinners.

414
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,350
You haven't seen your old coworkers in forever. Have a drink with them,

415
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,120
sing one of your signature songs, and just go have fun.

416
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,790
Fun? This isn't for fun.

417
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,300
It feels so nice sending you off like this.

418
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,170
I'll come meet you when you get back.

419
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,670
Okay.

420
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,640
Be sure to eat dinner.

421
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,140
And take your meds.

- You already told me.
- I did?

424
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,090
Right. I completely forgot.

425
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,929
- Your bus is here.
- Go back now.

426
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,490
- Have a good trip.
- Go on.

Forget a no-show. This is her first absence ever.

At least he went quickly and didn't drag it out for her.

00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,480
What do you mean, "went quickly"?

439
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,390
She said she didn't care if he was just lying in bed,

440
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,860
as long as she could have him by her side a little longer.

441
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,960
That's how she feels now. But even the devoted get exhausted.

Still, this way, we'll only remember him at his best.

445
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,780
Just last week, he said the chemo seemed to be working,

446
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,320
and we'd go to Jin Ho's campsite when he was discharged.

Is Ja Yeong working again?

452
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,770
I guess she's planning on it.

453
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,370
That makes sense. Ja Yeong's still young, after all.

- No way.
- I told you it's out today.

they said I was playing favorites. Can you believe that?

473

It was a unanimous decision from the external panel. Right?

474

What am I supposed to do about it?

475
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,620
You've all read it, so you know what I mean, right?

476
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,360
Absolutely. The writing itself is phenomenal,

477
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,230
and as a top-notch proofreader, there wasn't a single typo.

478
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,930
Exactly!

479
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,700
We just should've changed the title. That's my one regret.

- Get home safe, sir.

539
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,410
- Come on, I said, let's go!
- Bye!

540
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,940
I said, let's go! Come on, let's get going!

541
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,660
Yoon Ju. What brings you here at this hour?

542
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,630
Is Do Hyun here?

543
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,160
I need to talk to him, but I can't reach him.

544
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,330
He's not answering? He just stepped out for a bit.

545
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,830
Where to?

546
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,370
I'm not sure. He left without saying where.

547
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,410
- I'll wait.
- Okay. He'll be back soon.

548
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,110
He has to finish this and send it out tonight.

549
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,510
You can wait in his room for a bit.

550
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
What happened?

551
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,520
How on earth did you hurt your precious, money-making hands?

552
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,290
It's nothing serious.

553
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,680
(Ananysis Report)

554
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,390
(DNA extracted from a hair follicle found on the toothbrush)

555
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,090
(Test Report Number)

556
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,430
We'd fight whenever we met,

557
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,430
and then we'd have to meet again just to make up.

558
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,740
And I got so tired of going around in circles like that.

559
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,370
That's why I was the one who asked Hyung Jun to move in.

560
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,120
I know it's different from you two, since you're both so madly in love,

561
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,820
so what I'm trying to say is,

562
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,050
just fight with him.

563
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,490
Just fight it out!

564
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,320
You can always make up later.

565
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,760
And if you fight again, you just make up again. Right?

566
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,630
What's the big deal?

567
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,970
There's nothing I can do.

568
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,770
There's nothing for me to put up with,

569
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,750
nothing to work on, no way to even get through to him.

570
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,420
There's absolutely nothing I can do right now.

571
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,900
I didn't want to pry,

572
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,940
but what on earth is going on?

573
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,510
Did he cheat on you?

574
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,810
No.

575
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,250
So did he get caught with that woman?

576
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,020
I'm the one who was wrong.

577
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,700
I know it was my fault,

578
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
but still...

579
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:41,440
Still, I just wish he would come to me and say he's sorry.

580
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,450
For no reason, just a simple "I'm sorry."

581
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,720
Just that he's sorry.

582
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,090
I know I messed up, but still.

583
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,830
I wish he would just hold on to me,

584
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:10,170
so I don't run away again.

585
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,590
(Bus Schedule)

586
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,220
At 9:30pm...

587
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,140
Jin Ho, did you get on the bus?

588
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,510
No, not yet.

589
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,180
But the buses have stopped running.

590
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,850
I was catching up with some people I haven't seen in a while,

591
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,010
and it got later than I thought.

592
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,050
But it's raining so hard, and you don't even have an umbrella.

593
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,690
I'll just grab a cab, so don't worry.

594
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,700
Jin Ho.

595
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,770
So where are you right now?

596
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,770
Listen, Ja Yeong, they're calling for me.

597
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,040
I'll take a cab home, so don't wait up for me.

598
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,610
I've got to go.

599
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,680
Okay.

600
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,950
Get home safe.

601
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,310
Hey! Seo Jun Kyung!

602
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,370
Hey!

603
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:11,720
(Love Me)
