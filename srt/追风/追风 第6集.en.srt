How should I put it?

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
Maybe it's because when I sing

I'm doomed because of you.

It’s just a song. What’s the big deal?

181

Did I do something that wrong?

182
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,930
You said you wrote that song thinking about me.

183
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,700
Yes.

184
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,240
I wrote that song thinking about you.

doesn't exist anymore.

189
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,370
