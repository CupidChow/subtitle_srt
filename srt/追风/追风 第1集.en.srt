175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,980
You can sing it for me, right?

176
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,800
I have high expectations.

177
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,120
Okay.

178
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,730
â™«It's as if it's stoppedâ™«

179
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,580
â™«The whole worldâ™«

180
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,560
â™«The moment I look at youâ™«

181
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,010
â™«Something I can't reachâ™«

182
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,030
â™«Like a small satelliteâ™«

183
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,250
â™«Always spinning around youâ™«

184
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:09,570
â™«Wooâ™«

185
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,160
â™«In my heart filled with starlightâ™«

186
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:24,500
â™«Wooâ™«

187
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,090
â™«Spreading clearly and filling up my nightâ™«

188
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:37,800
â™«I'm walking among the stars that is youâ™«

189
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:45,510
â™«I got lost because of the dazzling lightâ™«

190
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,390
â™«It's my faultâ™«

191
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:58,980
â™«Rising above the horizon before you know itâ™«

192
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:07,460
â™«Like the back of the moon that shines coldlyâ™«

193
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:21,500
â™«It's okay to lose your shine, because I'll still be by your sideâ™«

194
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,370
Wow.

195
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,800
It's really good.

196
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,830
Did you write this song?

197
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,450
Yes.

198
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,390
What's the title of the song?

199
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,340
Letter of Apology.

200
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,450
Wow.

201
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,820
Haha.

202
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,610
Han Baram's style of sentimentality.

203
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,470
By the way, Baram.

204
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,030
How about this?

205
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,780
Switch up the tempo here,

206
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,530
and your strokes should be bright and energetic.

207
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,940
Just like how you are in my eyes.

208
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,660
What do you think?

209
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,010
Not bad, right?

210
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,560
What's wrong? Why aren't you answering?

211
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,060
You don't like it?

212
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,240
No.

213
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,480
It's very good.

214
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,250
Sir.

215
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,680
I...

216
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,030
have something to say.

217
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,360
What is it?

218
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,590
I wrote this song, Letter of Apology,

219
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,350
while thinking of you.

220
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,760
Wow.

221
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,180
It's an honor

222
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,490
to receive a song as a gift.

223
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,420
I'll scold you less in the future.

224
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,020
Because you wrote a letter of apology.

225
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,380
I...

226
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,670
Sir.

227
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:07,970
I like you.

228
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,369
Huh?

229
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,339
Me?

230
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,940
I sure am popular.

231
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,750
So many other students also

232
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,109
confess that they like me.

233
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,530
It's not like that.

234
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,730
I mean it.

235
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,720
You're so serious.

236
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,470
Then,

237
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,670
can you kiss me?

238
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,280
You're serious.

239
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,130
That's why

240
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,750
I don't call you Bro.

241
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm afraid I'll fall in love with you again when my guard is down.

242
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,990
Baram.

243
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,950
Don't be sad and just listen.

244
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,240
I

245
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,910
don't have the same feelings for you.

246
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,020
Let's pretend you never confessed.

247
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,560
I'm going to quit my job soon

248
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,750
because of something else.

249
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,830
I know the timing's too much of a coincidence.

250
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,870
I should have told you earlier.

251
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,120
Hold on.

252
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,280
Yes, Team Manager.

253
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,420
Yes, it's almost done.

254
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,990
If it's quick, by next week...

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,810
Sir!

256
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,000
Sir!

257
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,140
Hantae, what's the matter?

258
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,820
Can I ask you something?

259
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,720
There's someone about this tall,

260
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,470
with a pretty face,

261
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,120
and wears the same uniform as me.

262
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,410
The person who has classes two periods before me.

263
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,410
Baram?

264
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,100
Yes, I think it's him.

265
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,740
Where does he live?

266
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,410
Let's go.

267
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,370
Looks like I can do an ollie today.

268
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,160
Ouch!

269
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,040
Excuse me.

270
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,250
Are you crying?

271
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,490
It's because you ruined the audition because of me, right?

272
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,290
Hey.

273
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,980
Hey, can you hear me?

274
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm really sorry about earlier.

275
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,160
Just hit me as hard and as many times as you want.

276
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,000
-What the hell.
-Hit me until you feel better...

277
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,660
Don't look at me.

278
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,770
Just go away.

279
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,400
How can I just leave

280
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,230
someone that's crying because of me?

281
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,530
I'm not crying because of you.

282
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,490
And I'm not crying.

283
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,070
You're clearly crying.

284
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,470
Who would believe you when you say you're not crying?

285
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,640
And if it wasn't because of me,

286
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,140
then who are you crying for?

287
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,900
Just cry.

288
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,490
Just cry until you feel better.

289
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,430
Gosh.

290
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:39,610
Your snot! Gosh.

291
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,200
Hey.

292
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,130
What?

293
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,790
Why are you speaking informally to me?

294
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,220
We're in the same grade.

295
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,440
What about you?

296
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,670
Ouch.

297
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,650
Ouch.

298
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,990
It doesn't hurt.

299
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,930
I'm Im Hantae.

300
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,260
But...

301
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,120
It really hurts.

302
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,090
Ah.

303
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,630
-Give me your hand.
-For what?

304
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,190
Just give it to me.

305
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,590
It's okay. I won't die.

306
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,290
Why are you acting like my mom?

307
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,330
This is how you get better faster.

308
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,210
I think I'm better now.

309
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,880
Give me your number.

310
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,160
Why?

311
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,790
Because I want to eat with you.

312
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,570
My treat.

313
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,870
Why?

314
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,090
Just because.

315
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,520
Hello?

316
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,230
Han Baram.

317
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,270
I'm Im Hantae.

318
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,710
How do you know my name?

319
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,440
Oh, right.

320
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,670
Here.

321
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,790
Give me your hand.

322
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,070
Let's be friends from now on.

323
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,930
Why should we be friends?

324
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,170
Because I want to.

325
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,660
The day I said goodbye to my first love...

326
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,790
That's how...

327
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,090
I met you.

328
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,090
These fingers...

329
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,540
This voice...

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,860
Can't you give them all to me?

331
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,330
Let's work hard together, my singer.

332
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,200
Please take care of me, my boss.

333
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,980
You know

334
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,150
I love you, right?
