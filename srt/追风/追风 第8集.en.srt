2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,990
Why haven't you left?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,110
Yongmi told me to wait.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,550
Jungpal, can I ask you something?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,120
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,040
Recently,

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,090
I've been seeing someone.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,740
What?

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,060
You started dating? With whom?

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,870
Wow! Congratulations for real.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,650
But...

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,510
What?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,130
What?

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,010
We already know how we feel for each other...

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,820
Did you kiss?

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,730
That's enough then.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,460
There's nothing to worry about.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,640
But...

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,650
I haven't heard him say "let's date."

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,690
What?

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,960
That's a little ambiguous then...

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,000
Why?

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,230
Baram.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,030
Is he...

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,500
just toying with you?

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,160
Toying with me?

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,820
Although

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,520
it doesn't matter if no one says "let's date,"

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,410
as long as both of you like each other.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,590
But even so you'll feel relieved

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,120
on after hearing it.

32
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,210
I envy you.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,850
Because Yongmi was the one who said it first.

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,320
Well...

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,789
I wanted to confess to Yongmi cooly...

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,800
but she was a step ahead of me.

37
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,500
But...

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,400
it's good, yes.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,370
Baram.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,250
I was going to watch this movie with Yongmi.

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,800
I'll let you have it.

After observing the situation...

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,530

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,970
Just say it first.

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,980
-Bam! -Bam!

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,820
Give me a minute.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,610

What?

49
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,410
Okay, I'll be right there.

Goodness.

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,790

Seriously.

78
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,030

It's just the two of us.

You can speak loudly.

That's not the etiquette you should follow in the cinema.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,420
You go behind. You are distracting me me.

83
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,010
Really?

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,130
-I'm really going to the back. -Go.

are like a couple.

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,090
Yes.

102
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,150
Why?

103
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,870
When are you going to tell me?

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,560
What?

105
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,640
"Let's date."

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,700
Do I have to say that?

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,240
Yes, of course.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,840
What should I do

109
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,650
if you're just toying with me?

110
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,150
Han Baram.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,150
Am I that kind of person?

112
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,460
Why aren't you telling me it then?

113
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,280
You're toying with me too?

114
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,170
I confessed my feelings first.

115
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,409
What are you talking about? I said it first.

116
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,240
You took it back. You said its invalidated.

117
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,180
So I confessed first.

118
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,060
Even so, I did.

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,540
Okay, then...

120
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,270
Let's say it at the same time.

121
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,300
Okay, fine.

122
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,830
One.

123
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,940
Two.

124
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,300
-Three. -Let's...

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,130
You almost got fooled.

126
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,050
I got it.

127
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,350
One more time.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,950
We are really going to say it this time.

129
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,070
If we don't say it this time,

130
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,090
-we have to wash dishes for a month. -Okay.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,730
One.

132
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,530
Two.

133
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,750
Three.

134
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,570
Let's date.

135
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,480
Darn it.

136
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,040
Okay.

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,550
Let's date, Han Baram.

138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,980
Okay.

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,910
One, two, three.

140
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,130
One, two, three.

141
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,780
-Nice. -It came out well.

142
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,820
1, 2, 3.

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,510
What do you like about me?

144
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,590
Your sparkly bright eyes.

145
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,260
So don't cry easily.

146
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,920
You can only cry next to me.

147
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,390
Then from now on,

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,530
I have to go around like this.

149
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,820
This is cute too.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,180
By the way,

151
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,880
when...

152
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,640
are you going to write my song?

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,260
What song?

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,820
I...

155
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,260
want a song you write thinking about me too.

156
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,930
Let's see how you perform first.

157
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,960
So cold.

158
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,120
Stop.

159
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,670
What should I do?

160
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,280
Hey.

161
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,030
I know Im Hantae is really drunk.

162
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,300
When I opened my eyes,

163
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,550
I had my first boyfriend.

164
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,310
-Did you sleep well? -Yes.

165
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,380
How much do you want?

166
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,340
As much as your love for me.

167
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,180
That's not enough even if I give it all to you.

168
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,870
Here.

169
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,600
Hantae's.

170
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,680
Here.

171
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,230

172
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,980
It's good.

173
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,060

174
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,920
Yes, sir.

I'm calling you because

176
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,880
of the song that's releasing today.

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,060
[ENO Music Team Leader]

178
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,250
How was the response?

179
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,320
The company is looking forward to it.

180
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,780
The fans anticipation

181
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,690
is also rising.

182
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,950
There are also two good news.

183
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,250
One is

184
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,750
we received an invitation from a music show.

185
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,140
Music show?

186
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,830
Another good news is...

187
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,950
ENO Music is looking to

188
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,700
scout Im Hantae.

189
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,150
Can we have a meeting?

190
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,400
What? Me?

191
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,920
When I saw you in the studio,

192
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,020
I thought you were quite charismatic.

193
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
I know you two are close,

194
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,160
but you pointed out his flaws without hesitation

195
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,730
and guided the recording with great execution.

196
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,260
It left a deep impression on me.

197
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,670
That's...

198
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,680
First of all, thank you for the good impression you have of me.

199
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,200
Let me know a day

200
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,430
when you're free.

201
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,260
See you at the recording.

202
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,180
Okay.

203
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,370
Bye.

204
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,240
-We did it! -We did it!

205
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,070
We made it! We finally made our debut!

206
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,910
Han Baram.

207
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,870
Congratulations!

208
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,690
Congratulations to you too Im Hantae!

209
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,220
Hey.

210
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,860
What's with that face?

211
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,850
This is our band's first profile photo.

212
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,030
How can you Han Baram...

213
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,310
Stop acting cool and smile.

214
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,670
Okay, that's it. I'm taking it.

215
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,830
One, two.

216
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,380
It's getting cold.

217
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,800
We didn't even get to see the autumn leaves. What a pity.

218
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,190
Right?

219
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,950
Shall we go on a trip?

220
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,380
All of a sudden?

221
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,190
It's because you're tired. Let's go recharge ourselves.

222
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,260
The two of us have been

223
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,050
crazy busy.

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,820
Then...

225
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,560
this will be our first trip.

226
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,810
Where should we go?

227
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,960
Well... I wonder...

228
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,890
Where should we go?

229
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,530
-It's warm. -Wow.

230
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,960
Wow.

231
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,640
So beautiful.

232
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,270
There are so many stars.

233
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,370
One, two, three. Cheers.

234
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,490
-Thank you. -Thank you too.

235
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,530
-Isn't it good? -It's really good, isn't it?

236
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,550
Right?

237
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,240
Should we take a photo?

238
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,420
Since it's our first trip,

239
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,590
we should leave something to remember it by.

240
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,880
One, two, three.

241
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,530
One, two,

242
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,230
three.

243
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,510
Oh, it came out nice.

244
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,550
This place is really beautiful.

245
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,700
The meat is cooked.

246
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,740
-Cut this too. -Should I cut it?

247
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,960
I really...

248
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,680
will never forget it.

249
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,250
I've never experienced this before.

250
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,160
First time?

251
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,240
Yes.

252
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,470
Should I add something to it?

253
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,830
What?

254
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,430
We can't not have music during camping.

255
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,620
You don't even know the basic chords.

256
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,190
Are you belittling me?

257
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm Im Hantae. Don't underestimate me.

258
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,720
Let's have a look.

259
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,040
Be nervous.

260
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm going to take your place.

261
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,430
♫Twinkle♫

262
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,340
Twinkle...

263
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,440
I can do it. Wait.

264
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,830
♫Twinkle, twinkle♫

265
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,300
♫Han Baram♫

266
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,430
What?

267
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,560
♫Shining oh so prettily♫

268
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,990

269
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,580
♫Or in the east side of the sky♫

270
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,290
♫Twinkle, twinkle, Han Baram♫

271
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,410
-I can't listen anymore. -It's the ending.

272
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:57,370
♫Shining oh so prettily♫

273
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,520
When did you practice this?

274
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,350
I could've done better, seriously...

275
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,490
It was really cool.

276
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,820
It's real.

277
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,250
I want to play it again.

278
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,240
Forget it.

279
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,420
-I messed it up. -It's cold. Come here.

280
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,840
Goodness, how cute.

281
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,950
-It's cold. -It's cold.

282
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,420
My hand hurts.

283
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,510
It's fluttering.

284
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,350
Where?

285
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,590
The fire.

286
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,600
The fire?

287
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,110
It's fluttering.

288
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,260
-The fire? -No.

289
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,650
Do you know that?

290
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,500
If you didn’t give me the contract,

291
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,000
I would've almost given up on music.

292
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,440
That's why I said I would be responsible for you.

293
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,830
Han Baram...

294
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,650
it's a blessing you met me.

295
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,340
I want to be responsible for you too.

296
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,560
By singing by my side

297
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,260
is taking responsibility for me.

298
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,090
Should I turn off the lights?

299
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,760
What?

300
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,490
You're up to something.

301
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,660
This is the stage I usually stand on,

302
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,700
but it looks exceptionally big today.

303
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,950
Everyone.

304
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,980
Chest out.

305
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,630
Raise your head.

306
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,810
Look ahead.

307
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,160
Don't be nervous. Let's shout our slogan.

308
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,360
-Here? -Come here.

309
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,560
Follow me.

310
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,350
Sing!

311
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,420
-Wind! -Sing!

312
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,470
Let's go.

313
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,570
The slogan is cool.

314
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,230
-Are you ready? -Yes.

315
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,270
Don't be too nervous today.

316
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,150
The setting

317
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,120
is almost ready.

318
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,140
Let's rehearse.

319
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,880
-You can do it, right? -Yes.

320
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,370
Excuse me.

321
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,480
Baram!

322
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,540
What should I do?

323
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,590
-Oh no! Baram! -My guitar...

324
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,890
Darn it.

325
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,790
Baram!

326
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,930
Are you okay?

327
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,130
Yes, I'm fine. But this...

328
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,870
The show is about to start. What should I do?

329
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,420
Baram, it's okay.

330
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,500
I'll get you a guitar. Wait here.

331
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,130
Where are you going?

332
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,590
Just sing.

333
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,890
What should we do?

334
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,640
Are you okay?

335
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,810
Baram!

336
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,550
Here.

337
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,450
Use mine.

338
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,830
If I use it, what about you?

339
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,430
Goodness.

340
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,730
I'm just here for fun.

341
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,700
I'll do it next time, okay?

342
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,880
Good luck.

343
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,430
Why did you come out, you idiot.

344
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,800
Go inside quickly.

345
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,170
You're sweating.

346
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,910
It's okay.

347
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,470
Hurry up.

348
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,710
Hello, we're Chasing Wind.

349
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
It's an honor to introduce our song through a music broadcast

350
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,350
for the first time.

351
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,290
Today's song is

352
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,230
Chasing Wind's new song.

353
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,150
I wrote it for the person I love.

354
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,670
Putting in my feelings of thankfulness and sorry,

355
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,170
as well as love,

356
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,010
I'm giving this song to him.

357
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,680
The title is

358
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,760
"Second Wind."

359
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,230
The second wind.

360
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,840
♫Warm sunshine♫

361
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:28,550
♫Breaking like stars, at the end of the white sky♫

362
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,220
♫I'll draw you♫

363
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:38,100
♫The excitement burns through a tiny crack♫

364
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,610
♫You comforted me in the darkness♫

365
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
♫I'm made in you♫

366
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,950
♫You make me dream of love♫

367
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,790
♫Only you can make me breathe♫

368
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,950
♫Please catch me when I'm lost♫

369
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,420
♫I'm made my you♫

370
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,170
♫Where I reach out to♫

371
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,840
♫Stay by my side forever♫

372
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,510
♫Be the light in the darkness♫

373
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,920
♫You embraced my dangerous world♫

374
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,770
♫Please be my shining love♫

375
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,160
♫Even in the cold night♫

376
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,810
♫I'll still hold your hand♫

377
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,890
♫Nothing different from yesterday♫

378
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,810
♫A long day ends♫

379
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,730
♫I'm glad I can see you♫

380
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,520
♫I'm made by you♫

381
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,110
♫No matter where you are♫

382
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,860
♫I'll go through the night to find you♫

383
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,410
♫Become a splendid day♫

384
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,540
♫Come to me when I'm sick of it♫

385
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,140
♫Give me a warm hug♫

386
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,000
♫You make me shine more♫

387
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,550
♫I won't forget you♫

388
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,970
♫Become you in my world♫

389
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,480
♫I won't miss you♫

390
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,130
♫Please stop♫

391
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,640
♫Get closer♫

392
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,840
♫Spreading slowly♫

393
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,820
♫You become my everything♫

394
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,410
♫You embraced my dangerous world♫

395
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,000
♫Please be my shining love♫

396
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,250
♫Even in the cold night♫

397
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,330
♫I'll still hold your hand♫

398
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,670
♫Become you in my world♫

399
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,450
Im Hantae,

400
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,170
is better at pretending than I thought.

401
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,740
He's simpler than I thought.

402
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,520
♫I'll hold your hand too♫

403
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,010
He is more lovely

404
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,760
than I thought.

405
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,440
♫Please be my shining love♫

406
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,420
Should we change to a bigger bed?

407
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,230
Why? I prefer small ones.

408
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,150
I like small ones too.

409
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,250
Get some more sleep.

410
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,400
The weather is nice.

411
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,130
I'm so nervous though.

412
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,020
This isn't like Im Hantae. Why are you being like this?

413
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,880
You'll do well.

414
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,020
I'll cheer for you.

415
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,460
Okay.

416
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,840
Good boy.

417
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,220
Should we go?

418
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,810
There are days like this.

419
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,250
It's a normal day,

420
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,390
but it's exciting

421
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,820
and heart fluttering.

422
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,290
The wind today

423
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,260
makes people feel very good.

424
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,540
Maybe it's because

425
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
it's blowing because of you.

426
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,610
We, who welcome this wind,

427
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,390
are waiting

428
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,640
for a new season.

429
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,470
