Han Baram!

174
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,060
Baram!

175
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,560
Why is he suddenly acting like this?

176
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,630
Who's the one who wrote the song first?

177
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,700
It's Baram, of course. What are you talking about?

178
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,850
Hantae.

179
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,710
You didn't know anything about this?

180
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,330
-About what?
-The plagiarism!

181
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,840
Of course I knew nothing about it,

182
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,340
when it's something that concerns Baram.

I'd like to introduce our title song

185
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,080
that we released last week, Letter of Apology.

186
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,340
It's based on my past experience

187
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,760
and emotions

188
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,090
of my first love.

189
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,470
Isn't that what first love is like?

190
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,180
Affectionate and pure.

191
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,650
Just like us, Bluewin.

192

Why are you still standing here in the cold?

199

Where have you been?

200
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,100
You're like a fool.

201
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,370
Hello, Sir.

202
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,370
Hello, you've been hard at work.

203
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,080
Hey.

204
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,770
By the way, what's going on with this?

205
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,360
[Bluewin's Letter of Apology is very similar to this song]

206
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,650

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,810
I...

208

Well...

209
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,830
Tell me the truth before the situation gets bigger.

210
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,600
Hah.

211
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,670
Don't worry.

212
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,300
I know him.

213
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,800
You know how typical this is.

214
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,870
Someone who wants to tear us down because of jealousy.

215
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,100
Then

216
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,250
you don't need the company to deal with this, do you?

217
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,850
The online post was deleted as soon as it was uploaded.

218
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,190
Take care of it. Don't let any news of it leak out.

219
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

220
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,850
Please trust me.

221
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,060
The song is rising rapidly

222
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,500
on the charts.

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,310
You know that, right?

224
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,640
Yes.

225
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
It'll be a disaster if the reporters catch wind of this.

226
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,450
I'll take care of it.

227

We agreed not to keep secrets from each other.

232

Let's talk about it later.

I have to go for practice now.

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,600
And that Redwin or Bluewin?

237
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,570
They plagiarized your song.

238
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,850
Aren’t you upset because of that?

239
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,300
Well...

240
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,730
It might just be a coincidence.

241
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,940
What coincidence?

242
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,640
Hey.

243
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,240
That's your song.

244
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,380
Nobody knows my song.

245
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,020
The song doesn't belong to anyone.

246
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,470
No one knows?

247
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,540
I've heard of it.

248
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,240
I heard it clearly with my two ears.

249
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,570
I don't want to do anything about it.

250
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
-So...
-Why?

251
