1
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,520


2
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
Is anyone here?

3
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,720
That white-haired boy...

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
Is it really him?

5
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
What are you doing here?

6
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
To remind myself

7
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,040
Don't forget that you're hiding so many things from me.

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Don't indulge in your playing hard to get.

9
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,880
Are you awake now?

10
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you need my help?

11
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
The first day of the lunar month.

12
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes.

13
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
Since you got information about the jade carving artisan,

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,560
bring the blueprint and go there quietly.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,000
and make another piece of jade.

16
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,040
Yes.

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
His Highness told me to stay calm. I'm fine.

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,840
to keep me quiet.

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,760
I hope you will be the same.

20
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't get close to me.

21
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Sure.

22
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,640
Jiayue.

23
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
[I can't face you]

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
I can't face you.

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,520
The delay of a scholar can be explained.

26
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
It's hard to say about a girl's delay.

27
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
This is Saffron.

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
This is rose

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
It's spring grass.

30
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,680
Your Highness.

31
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
Liuli is back.

32
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
Her Majesty brought her here to apologize.

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,040
Please forgive her.

34
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,640
How did His Highness react?

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
His Highness agreed.

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't believe

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,200
Don't believe it.

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,120
What?

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,160
Are you feeling better?

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm worried.

41
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,320
I can't wait to visit you as soon as I came back.

42
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,560
I know you don't want to spend money.

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,320
I sent someone

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,440
to find the best 100-year-old ginseng for your health.

45
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,760
I hope you don't mind.

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
Zhaozhao is taking care of me now.

47
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,920
Just leave it to her.

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,320
This person is perfect for you to participate in Deer antler Soaking Wine.

49
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,080
to recharge.

50
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Please take a rest. I’m leaving.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm meeting an important guest today.

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
Mr. Xu,

54
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
to comb my beautiful hairstyle.

55
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
Honored guest?

56
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Yes.

57
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
Since I came back,

58
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
I haven't seen Her Majesty.

59
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
It must be rude.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,920
So father specially organised a family banquet

61
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,800
to fulfill our sisterhood.

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
What are you doing?

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
What are you up to?

64
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you afraid of, Lord Xu?

65
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Are you afraid that Her Majesty will find out you failed

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,000
or are you afraid that I’ll expose Shen Jiayue’s joining the army?

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,480
It’s useless for you to enter the palace as a returner.

68
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Please don't enter the palace.

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
Why are you nervous?

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,160
There's a ghost in your heart.

71
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,160
It's too late.

72
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Today, Her Majesty specially requested to leave the palace.

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,120
This banquet is held in the Ying Mansion.

74
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

75
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,120
May you be blessed.

76
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Rise.

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,240
The family banquet just said

78
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,680
You and I are sisters. No need to be courteous.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
You must do it.

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm here to thank you for sending a close lady

81
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,680
for helping her.

82
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,960
On your knees.

83
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
Sister.

84
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,360
Who asked you to go out of the palace to help others?

85
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I was wrong.

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,600
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,880
Do you know this crime is the same as deceiving His Majesty?

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Your Highness, I had no choice.

89
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,160
You lied to me.

90
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,880
That day outside the palace gate,

91
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
You didn't let me in. You didn't let me in.

92
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,840
In fact,

93
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
You don't even know I'm here to see you, do you?

94
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,960
Sister Empress.

95
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,960
She's ruined my sister.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,080
You have to punish her.

97
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
Spare my life, Your Highness.

98
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I just took a few more days off

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,960
and went out to do personal matters.

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
But he didn't commit such a crime.

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,440
Besides, I had no choice.

102
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,159
That man has taken action.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
I have to look into it.

104
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,320
Rise.

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,159
Sister, don't listen to her nonsense.

107
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,240
She's making excuses.

108
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,000
Lord Xu, pass my order.

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,840
Princess Li, Shen Jiayue joined the army without permission.

110
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,159
The evidence is solid.

111
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,560
Since he hasn't fully recovered,

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll interrogate him in my mansion.

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,200
Yes.

114
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Are you satisfied?

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160

134
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
A good deed.

135
