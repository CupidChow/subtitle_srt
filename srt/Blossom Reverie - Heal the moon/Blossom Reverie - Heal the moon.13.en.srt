1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Concubine Shen Jiayue joined the army without permission.

2
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,880
Her Majesty is kind, so she came here to interrogate her.

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,240
Bring Shen Jiayue.

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
Leave us alone.

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,280
Sister, long time no see.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,000
Kneel before the Empress.

7
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,960
Why do you treat me like an outsider?

8
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,400
[Do you also think that I'm not from the Zha family?]

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,280
But even so,

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
you watched me grow up.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,960
You know me.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,759
Jiayue, you’re still as sharp-tongued as when you were young.

13
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
Don’t forget who you are now.

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,759
Looks like it's true that you joined the army without permission.

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,520
Family blood?

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,759
and sisters.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,479
I didn't.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,960
Do you dare to be responsible for what you said?

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,880
I dare.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Bring the witness.

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,039
Greetings, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
I can prove that

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,640
when Prince Li went south,

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,079
Shen Jiayue left the mansion without permission.

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,960
My sister and Shen Jiayue are both concubines.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Shen Jiayue framed me.

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
and set me up to reflect on my mistakes.

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,640
to hide my identity

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
so that no one would find out.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,600
she followed Prince's carriage and left.

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
If it weren't for the family of servants,

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
I would have been homeless.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
I had to go home to deal with it.

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Otherwise, I wouldn't know about this.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
But if you don't know,

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
It doesn't mean others don't know.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,360
As the concubine of King Li,

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
and the adopted daughter of the Qiu family.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
How would the people

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
how would the people think of the Qiu family?

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
This is your family's statement.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,079
Do you have any other evidence?

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,560
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,560
my family is a witness.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
and your Lady-in-waiting Mr. Xu.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,440
can also prove

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Shen Jiayue was brought back by Prince.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
In the end,

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
no one can prove that I'm in the army.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,280
Bring him here.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,800
Your Majesty.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,000
I remember it was this lady.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,480
The army is full of men.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Women have different pulses from men.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,360
I've been a military doctor for more than ten years.

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
It can’t be wrong.

60
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,160
Shen Jiayue, what’s your excuse?

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Put him in the dungeon

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,800
and wait for your punishment.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
I have two concubines.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
Why should I worry about you?

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
It's just a reminder.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,000
it's not your duty to protect me.

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,640
Know your place.

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,840
Don't think it's special

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
just because you went out with Duke Duke Duke.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,000
Concubine Rong has been imprisoned for so long.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
Are you really not going?

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,360
Your Highness is very powerful.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,280
You're injured.

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm fine.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
What happened?

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
A bunch of greedy people.

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Do you need an imperial physician?

78
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
No need. I can go by myself.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,040
OK.

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,840
Sister, Shen Jiayue has been imprisoned.

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Why don’t you stay together?

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,360
How dare you!

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,640
She can die in anyone's hands,

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
but she can't have anything to do with the Tai family.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
and make the world laugh.

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,600
Your Majesty.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,159
King Li is here.

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
He said he had a treasure for Her Majesty.

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
Has he thought it through?

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
Your Highness, this belongs to the Empress.

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
How did it end up in the hands of the bandits?

93
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,000
I think when the Chu family was in trouble,

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
I went to worship them.

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
and left it at home.

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
and was taken by the greedy thief.

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,520
I returned the jade to Her Majesty.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
This is a gift from your sister.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,159
It's also her belonging.

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Keep it.

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Sister Empress.

102
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,840
You're here to uphold justice for me.

103
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,760
Have you forgotten?

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
Shen Jiayue set me up.

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,600
She must have planned the army.

106
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,560
And Lady-in-waiting Xu lied to me.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,880
She must be an accomplice.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I forgot

109
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
one of your sisters is innocent.

110
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,960
But the other one may not be.

111
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Alright.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Liuli.

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,040
Do you really want the Qiu family to be in trouble?

114
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
I dare not.

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
Your Majesty.

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,080
You know what you should do.

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
If you don't punish him,

118
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
if we don't punish him.

119
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Shen Jiayue went out without permission

120
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
and ignored the rules.

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,880
Flog her 30 times.

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm ruthless.

123
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
Slap her thirty times.

124
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,920
Your Highness.

125
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Sister Empress.

126
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,200
How could you punish me?

127
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm doing this for the sake of the Qiu family.

128
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,960
Lady-in-waiting Xu, she set me up.

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,560
She's also at fault.

130
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,560
I am the Lady-in-waiting of Her Majesty.

131
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,440
Why would I be involved in the affairs of the royal mansion?

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm here to visit my family.

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,760
It's time to accompany my parents.

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,240
Guards!

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Beat him!

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,360
Shen Jiayue went out without permission.

138
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,200
He ignored the rules and flogged him 30 times.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Chu Jingyan.

140
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,400
I won't love you anymore.

141
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,920
The only thing I can trust here is myself.

142
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Unfortunately,

143
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,919
there is no future.

144
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Jiayue.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Jiayue.

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
Don’t look at me.

147
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,880
Don't look at me.

148
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
Don't look at me.

149
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't look at me.

150
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,760
Don't look at me

151
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,880
Your Highness, sorry.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,680
The heroine Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun to the Hui Kingdom, NingJPPA, the strongest of Hui

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,680
Bay is surrounded by the tide and loneliness

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,280
Lei Jian is a young man and a young man came to Xinxin Kingdom

155
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,080
The handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun Hui, Ningzhuahua, the strong star, Cheng Ze

156
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,160
The sword is just shining and the sun is shining.

157
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
Yang Nan.

158
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,000
Zou Mei.

159
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,080
Tao Ran Red.

160
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,640
Overmanned fish

161
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,320
Kang Yan Xiao

162
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,200
Overmanned fish

163
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,200
Asui Dong wins.

164
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,880
Asahi Itou wins.

165
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
Xu Yidong wins.

166
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,280
"Min Lipeng".

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,160
Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua

168
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
Feng Yin Liang.

169
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,320
Xiao Juan.

170
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,520
Wanjuanqi.

171
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,520
Xiao Juan Xiao

172
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,240
A good deed.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Loyalty and graceful.

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,840
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,920
My promise is fulfilled.

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,920
Yang becomes Kun Yan.

177
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,600
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
