1
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,280
Your Highness, sorry to disturb you.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm here

3
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,560
to gather some food for the south.

4
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,960
Please give us some.

5
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Of course.

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,600
Your Highness, the monthly remains in the mansion

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,160
to you.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,000
Send them to their warehouse.

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,440
Your Highness is righteous.

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,120
Your Highness,

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
all the food in the mansion has been taken out.

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
I'll send the rest to the warehouse.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,759
Thank you, Your Highness.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,759
We'll take the food with us.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,320
We need to hurry up to collect the next one.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,920
Wait.

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
This...

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
Your Highness.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
What do you mean?

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
This is His Highness's order.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,039
The food for disaster relief

24
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,039
Just eat it.

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,600
If there is dust,

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,040
the refugees wouldn't care.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
But if they meet corrupt people,

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,800
they will disdain such food

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
to ensure the use of disaster relief.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,640
Jiayue is so smart.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
If possible,

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
I can help you not be trapped in the backyard.

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
But people's kinship is not as good as blood.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
You know it's impossible.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I think it's better to stay.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,920
What role am I playing?

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,320
You care about what I think of you?

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
No.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,080
You're right.

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
Your Highness,

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,240
you must have seen my value.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,400
How will you deal with

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
to frame me?

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,079
When the order is issued,

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll go to the south.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
to go to the south.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,840
If she knows about this,

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,800
do you think she will take this opportunity to come here to seek justice?

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,680
But it's a capital crime for the family of the law-abiding family to join the army.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Not to mention a sinner who was wronged first.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,440
You should be more gentle to me.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Otherwise, I'll be scared by your thoughts.

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
If we succeed today,

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,079
I'll give you the order in three days.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
One day?

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
The two soldiers today

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
They don't look like soldiers

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,040
I look more like someone from the palace.

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,640
The time you gave me to deal with Liuli

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,600
to deal with Liuli.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Can't you do it?

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
This is a good opportunity.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,600
such a good opportunity.

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,800
Father, Mother.

65
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
How dare you come back?

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,200
What did you do to Ruri?

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,440
I saw it with my own eyes that day.

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,280
Liuli killed the prince's child.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,520
Let her reflect on her mistake.

70
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,480
to let her go home.

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Mother,

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
to say that.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,040
His Highness is going to work in the south.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
I came back to inform you

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
to not worry.

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,800
Liuli is not here.

77
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,440
She came back and took the invitation and disappeared.

78
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,800
My sister, Kuang Liuli, has been living in a foreign land since she was little.

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,120
I came to visit you

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm here to visit you.

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,320
Please see me, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,200
I've been living in a foreign land since I was a child.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,920
I came to visit you

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm here to visit you.

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,920
Please see me, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,440
I've been living in a foreign land since I was a child.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,400
I came to visit you

88
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm here to see you.

89
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,000
Please see me, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Your Highness.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Without His Majesty's summon,

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Ordinary officials can't enter the palace.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
My sister, Kuang Liuli, has been living in a foreign country since she was little.

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,480
I came to visit you

95
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm here to visit you.

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Please see me, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
Your Highness.

98
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,960
I kindly remind you

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,280
If I alarm His Majesty,

100
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm afraid you'll be punished before you see my lady.

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Then you won't be able to solve your problem.

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,880
Lady-in-waiting Xu, do you know why I'm here?

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,200
It's not that I know.

104
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
but Her Highness.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,280
she sent me here to help you.

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm afraid Her Highness

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,600
in the mansion and the mansion.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,080
It’s not about Shen Jiayue’s ability,

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
but his heart.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
But he has driven me back to the Qiu family.

111
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
It's okay.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm just accompanying you back.

113
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,440
I have to

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,800
you still have to do it.

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Wait.

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
Bring more as long as there's a place.

117
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
His Highness doesn't like wet clothes.

118
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,320
You should have clothes to change.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,480
You seem to know me well.

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,960
It's just an old habit.

121
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,720
Have you found Liuli?

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,640
Fine. At least when I'm not around,

123
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,559
you are the master of the mansion.

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
I don't think she dare to do anything.

125
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,760
Your Highness, go and order something.

126
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
His Majesty ordered you to leave tonight.

127
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
Shen Jiayue, what are you dreaming about?

128
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
What are you doing?

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
Take her clothes to the backyard.

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't let her see anyone.

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,720
Consort Shen is trembling.

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,640
Did you catch a cold?

133
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,560
What's the matter?

134
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Why are you in such a hurry?

135
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
Let me help you.

136
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
What a coincidence.

137
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
His Highness is going to the south.

138
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,440
We'll depart tonight.

139
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,680
My sister is back.

140
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,960
If you're late,

141
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
I won't be able to see you.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,040
This time, he went alone

143
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,160
without anyone to take care of him.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
I thought I should pack my luggage properly.

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,520
Since you're back,

146
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
I should inform His Highness.

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,640
You must be an official from the palace.

148
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
What can I do for you?

149
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,280
Who is this?

150
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
My surname is Xu.

151
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm the Lady-in-waiting of Her Majesty.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,120
I went out to work today.

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
I ran into Consort Ke.

154
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,160
so I sent her back.

155
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,720
It's Lord Xu. Sorry.

156
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
I have something to do.

157
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
Wait for me here.

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,640
You want me to wait here?

159
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,800
The handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin Hui, NingJPPPA, the strong and strong man, Cheng Zeze, the Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Virtuous Moony

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,760
Vicky and Vicky come to Xinxin Kingdom

161
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,960
The sword is just shining, the handsome man, Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun Hui, NingJB, the strong and strong man, Cheng Zeyong.

162
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Xinmei.

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,120
Xinmei.

164
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Pearan Red.

165
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
Superfish

166
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Xu Yidong wins.

167
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,640
Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua

168
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,800
Feng Yin Liang.

169
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,840
Wanjuanqi.

170
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,000
Wanjuanqi.

171
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,000
Xiao.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,720
A good deed.

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
Loyalty and graceful.

174
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

175
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,320
Bin Hanyue.

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,400
Bin Han.

177
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,120
Ye Yang Cheng Kun Yan.

178
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Wish you success.

179
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Yang becomes Kun Yan.

180
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,880
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.

181
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Seo Jun.

182
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
The crane is shining and the snow fruit.
