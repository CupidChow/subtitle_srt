1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,240
The Lantern Festival starts on the 15th of January.

2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,600
Watching lanterns and touring the garden

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,720
First, I wish the world peace.

4
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,560
Second, I wish my family a smooth life.

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,920
Third, wish you good health.

6
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
The lights are beautiful today.

7
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,200
Wish you a happy and happy life.

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
Madam Qiu.

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,039
Are you stunned by the lights?

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,720
Why don't you call me mother?

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,600
Call me madam.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,680
Come on.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,080
Isn't Yun Shu dead?

14
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,320
Yunjuan.

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,360
What's wrong with you?

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,039
If you scare my wife and Miss,

17
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,040
can you afford it?

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,400
It's her.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,640
Madam.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
What if he fainted at the door?

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,120
They took action during Lantern Festival.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,560
Since they fainted at our house,

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,039
since he fainted at our door,

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,000
he must be up to something.

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,520
Mother,

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
We must be cautious.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,480
My son is thoughtful.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,440
Leave it to me.

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,600
Okay.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,280
Yun Shu.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,600
Tell the shopkeeper...

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,280
someone fainted in his shop.

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Please ask him to handle it.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Today is the festival.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
we'll pay the money.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,240
OK.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,640
Since you want me to start over,

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I will never let her in.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
or let Chu Jingyan

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
with the Qiu family.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,160
Miss.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Young Master Chu is here.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,920
He wants to see Master, Mistress and Miss.

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,079
It's them.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Miss, look.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
The one following Young Master Chu

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,560
seems to be the girl who hit the door yesterday.

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
I caught a thief.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
to pawn Chu Kui's engagement tokens.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm here to give it to you.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,480
Please let him know.

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
What's going on?

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
No, no.

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
This jade is mine.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
I have it with me since I was young.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,400
Give it back.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Why is it different from the last life?

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,200
Is it because I've changed?

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Give it back to me.

60
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,120
This woman said this jade has been worn since young.

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,640
Is she the illegitimate daughter of Lord Qiu?

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
Maybe.

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,000
Did he lose it on purpose?

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
You don't want to marry the Chu family?

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,440
I don't think so.

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
But she really looks like Lord Ying.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Could it be...

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Why are they together?

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,520
Could it be that she found out that I was wary of her?

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,040
Today she changed her strategy with Chu Jingyan.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Let’s go.

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,480
I wonder what Chu Jingyan is up to.

73
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,079
Do you have to argue on the street

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,840
and make so many people laugh at our family?

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
Father, calm down.

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Uncle, aunt, Jiayue.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
The pawnshop run by the Chu family said

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,840
someone

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,640
who stamped the seal of our Chu family.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,680
I think it’s

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,280
Jiayue and I lost.

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,640
I brought it here.

83
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,240
the thief who stole the jade.

84
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,520
to your uncle.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,080
This is mine. I didn’t steal it.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
I am Shen Liuli.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Thanks to your care yesterday,

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,200
I can't repay you for saving my life.

89
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
I specially made it for you since you were little.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
for your gift.

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,480
I didn't expect you to frame me.

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
The shopkeeper saved you yesterday.

93
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,800
Why didn't you thank him?

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,120
Instead, you came to thank your mother whom you never met.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Just as I expected.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,280
Young Master Ban, since we are engaged,

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
the wedding is coming.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Why did you find a woman

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,360
with a wedding token?

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
If you think I don't deserve to marry you,

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,080
and find a suitable one,

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm willing to break off the engagement.

103
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,000
and let you two go.

104
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
Chu Jingyan.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
You are the only one

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,720
You are the only one left in the family.

107
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
I pity you.

108
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
I didn't force you to break off the engagement.

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,440
What do you mean?

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Uncle, calm down.

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,640
That's not what I meant.

112
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,800
I remember my father said

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
the person I'm married to

114
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,240
has a jade pendant with him.

115
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
and the birthmark on my shoulder.

116
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,960
I have no idea about Jiayue’s birthmark.

117
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
But Jade

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
has never seen it on Jiayue.

119
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
My parents know

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
my birthmark was burned when I was young.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Master, Madam.

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
The Crown Prince came to me.

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,720
A woman with a birthmark.

124
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,400
is my daughter.

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,720
There are many people with birthmark in this world.

126
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,240
Are they all our family's children?

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,680
I think Jiayue is right.

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,240
If you have any doubts,

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
why don't we close the door

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
and identify our relatives?

131
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
so that the people outside won't be suspicious.

132
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,600
It concerns the bloodline of the Qiu family.

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,760
Test.

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,000
The Nine Twins Linglong Ball contains the remains of our ancestors.

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,960
It was used to verify

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
the bloodline

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,320
to inherit our clan.

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,680
We'll know

139
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,360
if the two girls are real.

140
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,040
You'll know who's the closest relative with just a drop of blood.

141
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,640
I think it's ridiculous.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
You said so much.

143
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm afraid you dare not.

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm willing to go first.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,120
I have tampered with the Nine Twins Linglong Ball.

146
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,159
I'm afraid you won't find anything.

147
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
Sister, it's your turn.

148
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
You can't escape now.

149
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,240
You must have known you were a fake.

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
How dare you run away?

151
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,680
Do you know how much I suffered because of you?

152
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
Uncle, I've found

153
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,159
the real daughter of the Qiu family.

154
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,919
Please don't forget our engagement.

155
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
We'll get married someday.

156
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,559
I don't want to marry you.

157
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,760
I just came back to my parents.

158
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,760
I don't want to marry him.

159
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,440
Chu Jingyan!

160
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
Shut up!

161
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,080
Father, get someone to drag him down.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Inform the elders to sink into the lake.

163
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,520
Master,

164
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
Chu Jingyan and I

165
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
are already married.
