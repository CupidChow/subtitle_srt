1
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,800
Grade 1.

2
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
Grade 1.

3
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,920
Grade 1?

4
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,160
But my parents

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
my life,

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
my emotions,

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,240
has nothing to do with me.

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,360
Why can you use me so easily

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,080
and give up on me so easily?

10
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,880
No.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,639
Liuli, you are wrong.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
We are all human.

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
We have our own wishes and choices.

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,160
We just try our best to live in this world.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Try our best to live.

16
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,160
But I'm just a pawn.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
a substitute.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
who was manipulated by you.

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,480
by you,

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,760
and sacrificed by you.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
You are all liars.

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Shen Jiayue,

23
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,960
Although I’m your substitute in this life,

24
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,280
but in the next life,

25
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,560
I hope

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
be myself.

27
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,240
Liuli.

28
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
My Ruri.

29
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,800
You killed her.

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,680
My poor child.

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Chu Jingyan.

32
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
Why did you kill my daughter?

33
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,640
Is it because you always think

34
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
was me?

35
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,000
You knew that Liuli is not your daughter.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,320
Shen Jiayue.

37
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
You take the advantage

38
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,520
because you want to save Shen Jiayue

39
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,760
I can keep Shen Jiayue alive.

40
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Mr. Ke.

41
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Your plan is really good.

42
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,040
You wanted to use Her Majesty to get rid of Liuli.

43
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,640
because she knows your secret.

44
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
Mother.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,680
You happen to want to kill him.

46
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
Mother.

47
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Mother.

48
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Will anything happen to Liuli and Jiayue?

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,640
How could they be poisoned at the same time?

50
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
Prince Li will protect Jiayue.

51
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
What about Liuli?

52
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Lady-in-waiting Xu is missing.

53
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Her Majesty doesn't want to help me with my personal salt.

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,120
Liuli

55
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,200
I don't know where she found out about the slaughter of the Chu family.

56
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,480
She even went to Her Majesty to talk.

57
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
She was suspicious of me.

58
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
What a coincidence.

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,840
make Her Majesty think that I'm her son.

60
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,440
Kill her to show her loyalty.

61
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Amitabha.

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
God.

63
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,800
What? You don’t want to leave?

64
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,040
Chu Jingyan, there are only the two of us left.

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
Just cut to the chase.

66
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,720
Do you know the shopkeeper of Hwishan Hall?

67
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
No.

68
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,560
But why did my men report that Mount Huishan Hall is not safe these days?

69
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,040
Someone went to pick a fight.

70
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
What does that have to do with me?

71
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,920
But why did I hear

72
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
Do you know?

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
No.

74
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Where did Prince Li know about this?

75
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,520
Selling salt is a capital crime.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,000
I have a daughter in the harem.

77
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,760
I won't kill her for these benefits.

78
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,840
But I heard that someone

79
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,320
someone caught someone from the rebellion.

80
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,960
was a member of the Qiu family.

81
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
The servants who make mistakes every day

82
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,320
will be expelled.

83
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Did someone do it on purpose?

84
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,560
Do you still want to quibble?

85
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,840
You used the Haesan Hall

86
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,240
to sell fresh and vegetables.

87
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
but actually they sell salt.

88
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
Now I have caught the witness.

89
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,840
I have the account book

90
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,320
are in my hands.

91
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
Let me see

92
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
Last December,

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,440
2,000 taels of gold was found in private salt.

94
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
70% of Lord Kui and 30% of the Haesan Hall.

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Am I right?

96
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Lord Ying,

97
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,840
You want me to hand the ledger to His Majesty

98
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
and let His Majesty punish me?

99
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,680
It's better for you

100
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,080
tell me the truth of the Chu family.

101
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,320
Maybe I can help you.

102
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Tze Yong Dynasty Pearl from Tao Yue, Qing Qin, Chen Xuanxuan Party, Long Xing, Xin Hua, Bin Li, the Sweetheart Dragon Peak Army.

103
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,080
Shing-taek, the Victorious of Taoyue

104
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
Lei Jian just came to the city and came to Xinchun Hui

105
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,600
Lei Jian just shines, the handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun Hui, Ningzhuahua Strong Brave, Cheng Ze

106
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,040
Yoonan.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,280
[Marvelous]

108
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,440
Superfish

109
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,280
Ui-Dong wins.

110
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
Jin Zeze.

111
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Wai Xin Bin Hui-min Hua

112
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Thank you.

113
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Feng Yin Liang.

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,360
Xiaojuan.

115
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,800
Xiao Juan.

116
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,720
Wanjuanqi.

117
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
A good deed.

118
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Da Juan is gorgeous.

119
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,040
Chungjuan is beautiful.

120
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
Qing Shabai Yi He Min

121
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

122
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,480
Bin Han.

123
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Bin Hanyue.

124
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,720
Ye Yang becomes Kun Yan.

125
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,800
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
