1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
Why do you want to go shopping with me today?

2
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,759
What do you mean?

3
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,560
Don't ask anything today.

4
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,400
You and I have never been shopping like normal couples.

5
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Why are you so happy today?

6
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,400
This is...

7
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Please bring me the letter.

8
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,400
You copied the classics so late at night.

9
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,520
That's right.

10
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm waiting for you.

11
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
So I came.

12
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Why are you playing a riddle with me?

13
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,040
I can't hide it as long as the jade is gone.

14
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,520
I thought I would be questioned when I came back.

15
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,040
I just didn't expect you to come.

16
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,000
Why do I think you'll be happy if it's me?

17
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,760
Because even if you don't come,

18
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
I have to find a way to see you.

19
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,000
You tried so hard to find a fake jade.

20
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
and lured me to steal it.

21
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,600
to scare the tiger

22
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,520
to find the murderer who killed the entire Chu family.

23
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How did you know about the Chu family?

24
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,440
I know a lot.

25
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
If you want the real jade,

26
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,360
why don't you make a deal with me?

27
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
What do you want?

28
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Nothing.

29
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,040
As long as you give me the position of Princess,

30
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,240
I will repay you with the real jade.

31
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
Forget it if you don't believe me.

32
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,600
How can I trust you to help me find the real jade?

33
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Why don't you give it a try?

34
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,240
If you don't believe me,

35
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,280
you won't lose anything.

36
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
At worst, you can complain to His Highness about me.

37
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520
But if you do,

38
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
it depends on when you can convince His Highness

39
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,720
that I am the only princess.

40
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,040
A message from the palace.

41
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,960
I disrespected the Empress.

42
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,360
She wanted to punish her to go to Hanshan Temple to pray to Buddha.

43
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
Since it's getting cold lately,

44
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,920
I beg Her Majesty to confine you

45
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,200
and punish you severely.

46
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,040
You can go back today.

47
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Your Highness.

48
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,800
I just came back.

49
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't let me leave again.

50
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,440
If you must,

51
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,600
just lock him up in the mansion.

52
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
How dare I disobey Her Majesty's order?

53
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
How did you offend the Empress?

54
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
I didn't.

55
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
I...

56
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,800
I just don't want to leave you.

57
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,640
If you insist on kicking me out,

58
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
I'll kill myself here.

59
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,920
How dare you!

60
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
You're so stubborn.

61
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,040
I'll take you to the temple according to Her Majesty's order.

62
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
Calm down, Your Highness.

63
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm just worried.

64
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,920
I didn't mean to offend you.

65
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm willing to go home with you.

66
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
What do you think?

67
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
What did you say?

68
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,920
I've been taught by my parents as Liuli for years.

69
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
I should have disciplined Ruri,

70
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,640
but failed.

71
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
We should be punished together.

72
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Thank you.

73
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
Then I won't be afraid.

74
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,520
Your Highness.

75
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm willing to go back and receive your apology.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
You...

77
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,120
Thank you, Your Highness. We'll leave now.

78
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Kneel.

79
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
Useless thing.

80
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,840
You two have disgraced our family.

81
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,760
You've been sent back to your maiden home.

82
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
It's better not to be as good as you two.

83
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,960
Father,

84
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Her Majesty punished me.

85
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Instead of letting her go to the temple,

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
than let her go to the temple.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,520
You know how to say that.

88
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,120
If it's all my fault,

89
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,920
why did you come back?

90
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,840
Do you think my son has suffered enough?

91
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,600
You came back with me

92
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,800
for my sake.

93
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Jiayue,

94
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,640
Although you are our adopted daughter now,

95
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
we raised you.

96
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,000
You should be grateful.

97
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,320
Come with me to apologize to King Li tomorrow.

98
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,120
If you don't want to affect the entire family,

99
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
you two should behave yourselves in the mansion.

100
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
Thank you for teaching me.

101
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,920
I'll have tea with you more often in the future.

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Try it.

103
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,720
This is the best tea in the world

104
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,760
I thought it was the best tea in the world.

105
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,920
But now it seems that it's something that you don't like.

106
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
A prestigious family looks noble,

107
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,880
and rocked inside.

108
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,320
The true happiness is when your heart is rich.

109
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,880
The world is so bustling

110
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,720
What does it have to do with dressing, eating and drinking?

111
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,680
I didn't know you were such an open-minded person.

112
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,760
I should propose a toast to you.

113
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,680
How did you know where the jade is?

114
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Naturally, Lady-in-waiting Xu by Her Majesty's side told me.

115
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
You don't even drink tea from your sister.

116
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
How dare I talk to you?

117
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
I was just fascinated.

118
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,080
Actually, Her Majesty wasn't the Crown Princess the late emperor wanted.

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,160
For the sake of her current status,

120
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,200
to make Lady-in-waiting Xu, a servant of the Chu family

121
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,680
to do something shameful.

122
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
The jade

123
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
is with Lady-in-waiting Xu.

124
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,480
Do you know where Lady-in-waiting Xu hid the jade?

125
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
Too much.

126
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,520
So you're urging me to make arrangements early.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
I won't disturb you then.

128
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Wait for your good news.

129
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,520

Xinmei.

134
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,880
Yang Nan.

135
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
Flash

136
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,760
Yuan...

137
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
Superfish

138
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,040

142
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,320
Hurry.

143
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Feng Yin Liang.

144
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,800
Wanjuanqi.

145
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,320
Da Juan is gorgeous.

146
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Chungjuan is beautiful.

147
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,120
Yi He Min.

148
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,400
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

149
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,440
Bin Han Yue.

150
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,560
Sung Kun-yan.

151
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,280
Ye Yang becomes Kun Yan.

152
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,480
Wish you success.

153
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,080
Wish you success.

154
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,160
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
