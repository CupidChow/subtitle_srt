1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
Although the disaster here has been solved,

2
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,880
what about Jade?

3
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,039
Why are you looking at me?

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,760
I know what to do with the jade.

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,560
I'll introduce the person who's in charge to you then.

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
You've seen him before.

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,440
I have.

8
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,120
The person is right.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,240
I forgot an important information.

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
I was so happy about Yuk-bi.

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
It's suspicious that I forgot Choi's fiancee.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,640
Why did he say she was expelled from the Chu family

13
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,160
instead of dying in the fire?

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
If she were alive,

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,120
she is suspected of arson.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,960
Report!

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
Commander, there are remnants of rebels on the west.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Get the horse ready.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
Yes.

20
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
Tell me where Choi Ho is hiding.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
I want to do something for you.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
He just needs some money.

23
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,199
Trust me.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Second House in the east market.

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
The first day of the lunar month.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Follow him.

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Yes.

28
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,560
Choi Ho.

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,880
Choi Ho!

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Get out of here! Get out of here!

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,440
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

32
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,720
Young lady.

34
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,720
You're too smart to keep her.

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Why don't we make our brothers happy before we die?

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,920
Where are you going?

37
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Do you know who I am?

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm dead.

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
I don't care who you are.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Let go of me!

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,920
Help!

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,640
Why don't you give in to me?

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,520
On the first day of the lunar month,

44
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,920
His Highness asked me to protect you.

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Where is he?

46
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,600
Jiayue.

47
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Are you okay?

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm late.

49
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,200
Who are these people?

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Let's go back.

51
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm afraid they'll find more masters.

52
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,040
are still alive.

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
Choi Ho! Choi Ho!

54
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,960
How can you be sure that your fiancee

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,520
has been expelled from the Chu family?

56
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,760
She works in the inner courtyard.

57
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,760
I didn't see her body.

58
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
What's her name?

59
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,120
We've already made a marriage contract.

60
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,280
We're still young.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
yet to bow.

62
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,680
Seo.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
What?

64
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,360
Seo.

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
Those who break their promise will die.

66
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
Jiayue.

67
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Jiayue.

68
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,040
Jiayue.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Hang in there.

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
Jiayue.

71
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Jiayue.

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
Jiayue.

73
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,240
Jiayue.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Your Highness, Her Highness has stopped the bleeding.

75
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
If she can wake up within three days, she will be safe.

76
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,760
However, this place is shabby.

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm afraid it's only possible to return to the capital.

78
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
But the way back to the capital...

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,840
Three days, right?

80
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,320
Guards!

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
His Highness ordered

82
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,400
Prepare the fastest carriage for me.

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll be back in two days.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,520
The rest of the troops should advance at once.

85
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
I'll send someone to suppress the carriage.

86
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes.

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
Take my badge to the palace and get the imperial physician.

88
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Stop!

89
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,600
The imperial physician is asleep at night.

90
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
He won't be able to come.

91
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,320
I'll explain this to His Highness.

92
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,680
Imperial physician.

93
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,200
Why did His Highness summon an imperial physician?

94
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
Are you hurt?

95
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,360
Why are you here?

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,200
Who allowed you to enter the mansion?

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,080
No one is in the mansion.

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,559
A servant and family went to the capital to look for their family.

99
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
and almost lived on the street.

100
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,039
and ruined the reputation of the mansion.

101
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,160
Fortunately, Consort Ke came back to take charge of the situation.

102
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,720
You should thank Her Highness.

103
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,920
Besides, His Highness doesn't want anyone to know.

104
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
These days

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,800
in these days, right?

106
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,520
Your Highness, you...

107
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,440
The imperial physician is already asleep.

108
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,400
I was just being kind.

109
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Lady-in-waiting Xu is an outsider.

110
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,960
Who allowed you to enter my room?

111
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,800
If you don't want others to know,

112
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
you broke into my study at night,

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,920
So I asked you to summon an imperial physician for Concubine Rong.

114
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
You're from the palace.

115
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
You should be able to do it.

116
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,360
Right?

117
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,160
I'll try my best.

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Your Highness.

119
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,560
Your Highness.

120
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
You're awake.

121
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Who's there?

122
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,760
Great! Great!

123
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
I can be saved!

124
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
Who are you?

125
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Where is Chu Jingyan?

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
I’m Song Zhaozhao.

127
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,160
I was abducted by Prince Li to treat you.

128
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,160
Please help me.

129
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Help!

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,600
This is the residence of Imperial Physician Song's only daughter, Song Zhaozhao.

131
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Many noble ladies come to her for treatment.

132
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,240
I dare not knock.

133
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,000
Why don't we wait till dawn?

134
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Is it 3 o'clock? Let me sleep a little longer.

135
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,840
You are...

136
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,840
If you don't want your family to be in danger,

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,520
come with me to save her.

138
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,200
When will she wake up?

139
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
The wound has been delayed for so long.

140
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
It's good to wake up.

141
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Just wait.

142
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
If your medical skills are not good,

143
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,240
I'll find someone else.

144
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,720
No, no, no.

145
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
I can do it.

146
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm the best doctor in the capital.

147
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Don't play tricks.

148
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,960
If anything happens to her,

149
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,240
if anything happens to her.

150
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,840
That's it.

151
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
He...

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
Really?

153
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,360
Yes.

154
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,160
I can call him over if you don't believe me.

155
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,720
Okay.

156
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,800
Don't forget to let me go.

157
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Mun Shing-taek, the Virtuous Woman of Taoyue

158
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,600
Lei Jian just came to the city and came to Xinchun Hui

159
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:34,720
A handsome man, Bin Ying and Cheng, come to Xinchun Hui, Ningjie Pohua

160
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,520
Flash red

161
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,640
Superfish

162
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Wook Yi Dong wins.

163
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Long Xinze.

164
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua.

165
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,760
Feng Yin Liang.

166
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,800
Wanjuanqi.

167
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Wanjuanqi.

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,680
Honorable.

169
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Da Juan is gorgeous.

170
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,280
Chungjuan is beautiful.

171
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,280
Qing Shabai Yi He Min

172
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,720
Bin Han

173
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,440
Bin Han Yue.

174
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,440
Cheng Kun Yan.

175
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,640
My promise is fulfilled.

176
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,360
Yeyang Cheng Kun Yan

177
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,040
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
