1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Who are you?

2
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
I don't know who he is.

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,360
But one day,

4
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,280
that heartless woman asked me

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,840
She asked me to send some blueprints outside the city.

6
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,680
She wouldn't let me ask.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
or let others see

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,880
on the drawing.

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
So I kept an eye on him.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and found that he didn't leave the city.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
He took a detour to the Ying family.

12
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
That's why I have more doubts.

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
Just like this.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
And...

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,440
I thought it was a masterpiece of some sort,

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,600
so I secretly compiled the drawing.

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,759
I wanted to make some jade pieces after getting married,

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,360
and tell them it's from the royal mansion.

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,720
to sell fake goods.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,400
and make some money.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,479
Is the drawing still there?

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Yes.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
I stayed here to confront that woman.

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,760
Bring it now.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Highness, it's cold at night.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Put on some clothes.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,200
The Chu family

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
There's nothing left.

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
I avoided my enemies.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,240
and joined the army in disguise.

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,880
He didn't dare to return to the royal mansion until he achieved military merits.

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,960
But I found

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
a broken wall.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
What do you want to test?

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
It's not a test.

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Your hands are too cold.

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,760
Do you want to hear a story?

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
I'm all ears.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,160
I was just a child

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
I was just a child.

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,960
I never had any memorable memories.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,640
Until that day,

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
Yaoyao, try this soup.

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,640
This soup

45
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,800
is very fresh.

46
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,959
Let's go play basketball.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,159
There's a spy in the house.

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,159
poisoned the mourning banquet.

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
No matter how powerful a general is,

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,200
there would be sleeping potion in his food.

51
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,080
Young Master, run!

52
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,400
None of the people in the yard survived.

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,200
How did you suspect the Shang family?

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,360
There are two reasons.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,040
First, I knew it was a man-made accident.

56
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
I came to the palace to tell on you.

57
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,000
There are always people in my way.

58
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
I can't speak.

59
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
These people are somehow related to the Qiu family.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
If they weren't guilty,

61
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
they wouldn't be like this.

62
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,240
Second, the Crown Princess

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
The current empress candidate

64
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,000
was my elder sister.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
But after my elder sister passed away,

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
she became the eldest daughter of the Qiu family.

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Your sister got the position.

68
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,640
Then, he was promoted along the way.

69
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
The cause and effect are very interesting.

70
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,040
Is there no answer about the fire?

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
Back then, Old Li was in the court for many years.

72
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
You can ask your old friend for help.

73
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,760
I was too young and no one believed me.

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Everyone in the mansion knew about it.

75
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,560
or dead.

76
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
After the new emperor ascended the throne,

77
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
and amnesty the world.

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
the case will be closed.

79
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
The one who tried to silence me never gave up.

80
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,960
We don't even know if we're friends or enemies.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
When I make a contribution,

82
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,560
and regain my family glory,

83
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,200
I found

84
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,360
there is no evidence.

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,040
So what you need to do

86
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,960
is to find out what the Qiu family was after.

87
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,640
It's probably what the man in black was holding that night.

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
Do you think of the same thing as me?

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
That jade pendant...

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
So we made the same piece.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,159
Maybe the Tai family will give themselves away.

92
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Thank you.

93
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,880
Jiayue.

94
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
After all, the Tai family abandoned me first.

95
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,360
We can only rely on each other now.

96
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm glad you remember the details.

97
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,600
I remember the man in black holding something.

98
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
How could I forget?

99
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,640
I force myself to recall it ten times a day.

100
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,000
in case he forgets the details.

101
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,720
That's why he tried so hard to approach the Cu family.

102
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,240
and even wanted to disturb the Tai family.

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,880
to find some evidence.

104
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,040
In their game,

105
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,559
I am just an abandoned child.

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,360
Chu Jingyan.

107
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,480
This time, I'm willing to use myself as bait to break the game.

108
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
Your Highness, Cui Yu has escaped.

109
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,280
I've set up an ambush at Choi's shelter.

110
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,080
As long as he dares to go back, we will catch him.

111
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,640
Great! With this one-to-one drawing,

112
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
we can make the same one.

113
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,960
If it really exists,

114
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,480
we just need to find out where it is.

115
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,480
we'll have evidence.

116
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,280
That's right.

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,280
But why do they want this jade?

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Jiayue,

119
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
Go and carve the jade.

120
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
Chu Yi and I will go after Cui Bo.

121
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay.

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Your Highness, you're injured.

123
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,640
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

124
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,160
Take a deep breath. I'm really fine.

125
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,840
Chu Yi, let's go back.

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
Chu Jingyan.

127
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
You are injured.

128
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,680
It's just a scratch.

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Let me see.

130
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
You scared me.

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,880
My Lord, I'll go feed the horse.

132
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Now you know I don't want you to get hurt.

133
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
Get a military doctor.

134
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Gerlie Yue, Qing Qin, Chen Xuan Party, Long Xing, Xin Hua, Bin Li, the sweet Longtao Zhengyang Army.

135
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,360
Viva Moonlight

136
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
Lei Jian just shines, the handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin and Xinyue to help the Virtuous Dragon Gate

137
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,160
Xinmei.

138
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,560
Yang Nan.

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
Tao Ran Red.

140
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Tao Song.

141
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,160
Superman fish.

142
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
Wook Yi Dong wins.

143
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
Xu Yidong wins.

144
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,400
Long Xin Taek.

145
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,680
Wai Xin Bin Hui-min Hua

146
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,160
Hurry.

147
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,560
Feng Yin Liang.

148
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,360
Juanqi.

149
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
Wanjuanqi.

150
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Xiao Juan.

151
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,480
A good deed.

152
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Loyalty and graceful.

153
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,600
Zhong Juan.

154
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

155
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,200
Bin Hanyue.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,240
Cheng Kun Yan.

157
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Yeyang Cheng Kun Yan

158
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,760
My promise is fulfilled.

159
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,920
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.

160
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,120
The crane is shiny and shiny.

161
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,840
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
