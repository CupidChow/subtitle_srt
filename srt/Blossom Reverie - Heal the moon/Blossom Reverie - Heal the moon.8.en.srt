1
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,960
The person who sent the order was the Empress's people.

2
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,680
What are my parents hiding from me?

3
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,600
What...

4
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,360
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
Ruri appeared.

6
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,720
The Lady-in-waiting of the Empress who serves her

7
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,600
Are you afraid she won't fall into the trap?

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm afraid Lady-in-waiting won't be able to explain to you.

9
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,240
Are you worried about me?

10
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,120
No.

11
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm afraid...

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
the Tai family is still alive.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,240
You pour it first.

14
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,680
Your Highness.

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,919
Thank you, Lord Xu.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
Forgive me for being busy.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,160
I can't entertain you.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
You're welcome.

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
I just happened to send her back.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,960
However, she decided to go back to the Ying Mansion to reflect on her mistake.

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
so she left.

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,880
Leave me here to explain to you.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Princess Qiu has pondered over her mistake.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,280
This is my family matter.

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
You're welcome.

26
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,880
Chu Jingyan.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
really

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
care about me at all?

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Stop!

30
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,960
Let go of me!

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,920
Once His Highness leaves,

32
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,440
everyone in the capital knows that I was kicked out of the mansion.

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
I hid in the carriage.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
After leaving the city gate,

35
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,480
Your Highness has been with you all the way.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
and have a baby.

37
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,079
and see what Shen Jiayue can do.

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,880
If Prince finds you hiding in the car,

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,760
he will send someone to send you back.

40
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Maybe he will punish you.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
How about

42
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,720
If Concubine Shen doesn't see you later,

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
if she doesn't see you later?

44
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,280
Let's meet her first.

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,360
But why hasn't she come out yet?

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,000
Liuli.

47
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Lord Xu.

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
His Highness asked me to send you back to the Ying Residence.

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Let's go.

50
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,640
I remember what His Majesty asked me

51
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,440
His Majesty asked me to go out of the city.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
It'll be too late if we don't leave now.

53
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,960
Please make an exception.

54
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,440
I dare not.

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
I won't delay you.

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,240
Let him go.

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Chu Jingyan.

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,000
Why am I here?

59
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,920
You're smart enough to be knocked out.

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
If you weren't saved by the first day,

61
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm afraid you can't survive in the royal mansion.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,640
Why would I keep you by my side?

63
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,200
The road ahead is long.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
You shouldn't blame yourself

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,760
Don't blame yourself.

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,160
Don't worry. I'm here.

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
Follow me to the south.

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,400
As for the disaster relief,

69
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
the disaster relief.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,480
I have other things to do.

71
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
What's your plan in the south?

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,360
You think too highly of them.

73
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Your Highness, on the way back,

74
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,640
I caught two of them.

75
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,400
His name is Cui Bo.

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
He claimed to be the military advisor of that thief.

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
He knows the most.

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,560
Your Highness, please spare my life.

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
I won't do it again.

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Wrong.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
What did you do wrong?

83
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,400
I was captured by a villain.

84
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
I had no choice but to plan for him

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
to fight against the court.

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
I deserve to die.

87
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
What else?

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
There's more.

89
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Nothing else.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,080
You'll know it's me when you're here.

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,080
Are you going against the court

92
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,159
or go to the capital for revenge?

93
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
I dare not.

94
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,000
I was deceived.

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,800
That...

96
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
The bandit said he was forced to make a living for the people.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,520
I was forced.

98
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Please forgive me this time.

99
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,080
As long as you show mercy,

100
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
I'll be your spy.

101
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,159
Really?

102
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,159
Yes.

103
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
But you were captured.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
how will the rebels trust you?

105
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
How about

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
use him to sacrifice the flag

107
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,760
saying you escaped.

108
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
No!

109
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,200
No, no, no.

110
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Are you still pretending?

111
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,400
Cui Yu.

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Your Highness is indeed wise.

113
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,520
You deserve your reputation.

114
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,000
Those rebels are no match for him.

115
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Don't talk about him.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,280
Cui Yu.

117
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,840
What brings you here, Your Highness?

118
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Get out.

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
Mr. Cui is a wise man.

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,280
I like to talk to wise people.

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
Before the case of the Chu family,

122
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
Mr. Cui was the last person to come here.

123
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
What happened?

124
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
I was chased all the way.

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm thirsty.

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
Wait.

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,240
A noble lady like you

128
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,040
Of course you don't know about my cooking.

129
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I grew up with a maid

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
grew up together.

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,200
since childhood.

132
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,760
One day, I went to her house as usual.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
but she beat me up.

134
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,520
I think

135
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,600
she might have fallen for some noble lady

136
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,280
to break our engagement.

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,440
So he came to the mansion to ask for an explanation.

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
However,

139
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,760
the old lord claimed that his wife's reputation is not allowed to be tainted.

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,520
Even a maid can't do anything.

141
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,200
and beat me out again.

142
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,000
So you took revenge

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,600
and poisoned my sister and the wedding ceremony.

144
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,640
I don't have the guts.

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
The old prince was afraid that I would disturb the time of age ceremony,

146
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,400
so he sent someone to send me out of the capital.

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,040
That's why I became a villain now.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,880
But that heartless woman

149
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,200
won't end well.

150
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,760
Maybe he was expelled by the Chu family.

151
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,240
So you can guess my intention.

152
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,400
But you have nothing to do with the Chu family.

153
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,680
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,920
But I know the real culprit behind this case

155
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,040
is the Ying family.

156
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Do you have evidence?

157
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
Of course.

158
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,160
As long as you bring me to the capital safely,

159
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,560
I will give you the evidence.

160
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Your Highness.

161
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm afraid he didn't tell the truth.

162
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,680
If there is evidence,

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,840
why didn't he

164
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,800
for some benefits?

165
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,480
He said he's going back to the capital.

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
It's still a stalling plan.

167
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
to escape.

168
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Is there really evidence in the capital?

169
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,160
His Highness won't be able to find any clues.

170
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Let me think of a way

171
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,880
to get the truth out.

172
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,560
Why bother?

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
If you don't tell the truth,

174
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,680
there's no need to keep him alive.

175
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Maybe he knows nothing.

176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll tell you.

177
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,040
I saw them at the ceremony.

178
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Tze Yong Dynasty Jack Yuan from Tao Yue Qing Qin Xuanxuan Party Long Xing HUA HUANG HUANG YUANG

179
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,640
Vicky and Vicky come from HENNING HONG HUNG HUA

180
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Vicky, Vicky, Vicky and Vicky

181
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Lei Jian is a young man and a young man

182
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,640
A handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin to have pure luck

183
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,280
Yoonan.

184
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,880
[Marvelous]

185
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
The morning of the army

186
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
Superfish.

187
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,640
Supermarket

188
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,000
Overmanned fish

189
