1
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,720
It's dry. Watch out for the fire.

2
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,000
This is the residue.

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,000
Please take a look. Is there anything wrong?

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,080
Noble Lady Wei,

5
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,320
there is nothing wrong with this medicine.

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,320
But if ordinary people take it,

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
it's easy to get heat and clogged.

8
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,120
It goes on fire.

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
It causes abdominal swelling and nausea.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Do you know the special purpose of this medicine?

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Especially in this mansion.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Noble Lady Wei,

13
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,080
If this medicine is concentrated to a woman,

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,400
the menstruation will stop.

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,440
There are similar symptoms of pregnancy.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,520
You mean fake pregnancy?

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
I have no idea.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,720
I just explained the symptoms.

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
How can it be detoxified?

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
This medicine is not poison.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
Just a cold medicine.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
Anything cold?

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes, for example, herbal tea

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,320
or cold in winter.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,040
But if a woman

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,440
you need to pay attention to the sudden smooth moon letter.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,760
More than that.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Ruri.

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
I didn't expect you to be so despicable.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
Go find your familiar servant.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,560
Change the hot tea for guests to herbal tea.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
It's already changed.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,920
Does Chu Jingyan

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
between Chu Jingyan and the Qiu family.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
What is his purpose?

36
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
Why did he find Liuli?

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,000
He took my place

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,480
and killed me.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
Is his real target the Tai family?

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
I've been away for two days.

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
I didn't know I had a child and had a miscarriage.

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
You are so busy.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
You misunderstood.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
I was framed.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
I just played along.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,600
We only told the public that we were married.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
We didn't ruin your reputation.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Isn't that ruining your reputation?

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
I don't care.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
And I know

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,840
why you gave me the power to manage the family.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,640
As long as I guide her,

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,840
I won't be able to use my skills.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
To let me compete with her,

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,360
Your Highness,

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,160
What benefits do I have?

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
to disrupt the Qiu family and take it.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,440
Why do you think so?

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Chu Jingyan.

60
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Why don't we make our family in turmoil?

61
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
You're smarter than I thought.

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,120
But smart people don't live long.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
I remember you said

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
you don't care about these.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But why are you begging me now?

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,720
I can do more than you think.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
For example, revive the royal mansion.

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
What I want

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,720
is to be protected in this mansion.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
Do you understand

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Are you threatening me?

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,720
or tempting?

73
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm very sincere this time.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Don't you only want to leave?

75
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,200
I want to use your hands

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
your right

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
to take revenge.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,360
If you can live until I return to work in the south,

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
I'll consider your suggestion.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Say it.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Did Yunjuan tell you?

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
It's you, Yunjuan.

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,360
by your good sister.

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
What a coincidence!

85
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,240
That bitch pretended to have a miscarriage and blamed it on me.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
Stop!

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,760
Yun Shu!

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Yunjuan, get up.

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,960
How dare you torture me in the mansion?

90
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
Not to mention you set me up.

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
My miscarriage is under house arrest.

92
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
How could you catch my maid?

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,480
Because my sister had a miscarriage,

94
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,280
I have to investigate

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
and clear my sister's name.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,840
and avenge my sister.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,520
In my opinion,

98
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
it's just the two girls of Yun Shuyun.

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,360
to tamper with them.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Or

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,560
it was you

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,480
and caused the trouble.

103
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
You're really sharp-tongued.

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,640
Do you have evidence?

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
Evidence?

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,320
As long as you torture him,

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
one will speak first.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,920
No one will.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,159
Until I speak.

110
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,560
It's all my fault.

111
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
I have evil thoughts.

112
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
It has nothing to do with Cloud Scroll.

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,159
Please let her go, Your Highness.

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,360
My Lady.

115
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
I'm leaving.

116
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,440
Yun Shu.

117
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Yun Shu.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
My Lady.

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,520
Someone saw me coming to the yard.

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
I was careless.

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,640
No.

123
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
I can't let this happen.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,080
Impossible.

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,680
Why do you want to drive me back

126
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,880
just because of her words?

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,160
I don't believe it.

128
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
Let go of me!

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Let go of me!

130
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,960
If I don’t,

131
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,080
Shen Jiayue will sue you for abusing and killing me.

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It won't be good for the royal mansion and the Ban family.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
Why did everyone tolerate her

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,560
and everyone tolerated her?

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,640
Why is no one

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
really treat me well?

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Since young,

138
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
he's the only one

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,360
Come on, have fun with us.

140
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Come on, don't struggle.

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Beautiful.

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
How could he do this to me?

143
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,799
How could he do this to me?

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
As far as I know,

145
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,840
it's because you betrayed His Highness after entering the Ying family.

146
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,440
That's why he trusts the other one more.

147
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Wait.

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,720
His Highness wants to see Consort Ke.

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,360
Please come with me.

150
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,680
His Highness is waiting for you ahead.

151
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
I'll take you there.

152
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,520
Where is His Highness?

153
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm here.

154
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Your Highness.

155
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
Your Highness, I'm here.

156
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,280
It's you.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
trying to hurt me.

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Do you dare?

159
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,520
If I do it,

160
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,240
what's the difference between you and me?

161
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,280
Your Highness, save me!

162
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
Watch out, Liuli!

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Your Highness.

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,400
Jiayue framed me.

165
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Thanks to your help.

166
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,040
and sent it to the Ying Residence.

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,680
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
That's right.

169
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,600
You're more courageous than you look.

170
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
There are many things you don't know.

171
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,120
The Virtuous Woman of Taoyue

172
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,080

The handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun Hui

177
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,080
Wu Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin to transport Hui, Ning Jipo.

178
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Yoonan.

179
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,520
Yang, Mei.

180
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,040
[Marvelous]

181
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Superfish

182
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720

Wan Juanqi.

187
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,080
A good deed.

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,920
Loyalty and graceful.

189
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
Zhong Juan Binyang
