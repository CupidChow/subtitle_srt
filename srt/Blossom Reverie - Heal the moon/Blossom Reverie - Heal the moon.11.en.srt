1
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Come on.

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,840
Let's go. Let's go.

3
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,479
The situation has changed.

4
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
You still have the time to talk nonsense here?

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Liuli has a connection with the palace.

6
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
To deal with them,

7
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,320
we need to use Shen Jiayue to make contracts with them.

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
It’s good that you understand.

9
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,920
You're always together.

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid you'll forget that she's the daughter of the Qiu family.

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm here to remind you

12
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,440
not to forget your plan.

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,280
You're awake.

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,760
Your Highness.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
If something like this happens again,

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Stay away if you know you're useless.

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,200
Don't cause any trouble.

18
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,240
I made you worry.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,640
You think too much.

20
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,400
I have two concubines.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Why should I worry about you?

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm just reminding you.

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,000
it's not your duty to protect me.

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Know your place.

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
Don't think there's anything special

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
with me.

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Are you worried that I'll get hurt?

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm a prince.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,280
You are the queen.

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
That's all.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm not the daughter of the Tai family.

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,520
I shouldn't have wished for his love.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Take care of yourself.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
No.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,920
Her Highness is awake.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,440
Can you let me go?

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
It's only been a day.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,480
How did he lose favour?

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
Your Highness.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,040
His Highness is in a hurry.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,040
Where are you going?

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,880
I wonder how Sister Shen is doing.

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm going to have a look.

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
Would you like to come with me?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
She's awake.

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,320
That's great. I should go check on her.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
That day,

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,000
you stayed in the mansion

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
for taking care of Shen Jiayue.

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
I didn't punish you.

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,880
But I never ordered you to go back.

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,880
Your Highness.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I meant well.

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,840
How could you be so cruel?

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
When Sister Shen was away,

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,000
I was the one who went back to host them.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,000
Your Highness, you've done a great job.

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,320
Besides, it's getting late.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,200
If we go out now,

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm afraid we won't be there until dark.

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
It's not safe.

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,400
That's why I'm asking you to leave as soon as possible.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,320
What?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,120
Is there any reason for Lord Xu to stay in the mansion?

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,640
On the first day of the lunar month, send her back.

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
Your Highness.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Your Highness, please.

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Shen Jiayue is injured and she can pretend to be miserable.

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,360
I will be kicked out overnight.

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Enough, Your Highness.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,840
You hurt your nails.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,960
You're lecturing me.

74
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,840
Come home with me.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,040
What's the use of having you?

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
How dare you sit down?

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,680
Don't be arrogant and impatient.

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Only when everything is done,

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,880
to avoid mistakes.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
It's useless.

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
What excuses are you looking for?

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
Shen Jiayue joined the army without permission.

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,040
Why don’t you use such a big mistake?

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Your Highness.

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Did Shen Jiayue join the army not delay the military?

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
and took a sword for you.

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,480
If you find out that we entered the mansion without permission,

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
it will backfire.

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
But Shen Jiayue’s injury

90
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,520
gave us a chance.

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,640
For Shen Jiayue, Chu Jingyan kidnapped Song’s doctor.

92
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,120
He has no excuses.

93
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
Why did you drag His Highness into this?

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
Do you want me to talk to Her Majesty?

95
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
If the people around her

96
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
are as timid as a mouse,

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,360
what's the point of keeping it?

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
I have no choice

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,080
I have no choice.

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
But even if I tell the Empress,

101
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
I cannot tell anyone right now.

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,280
I believe the Empress will agree.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
I'll say one thing.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
You stand up.

105
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,040
It's the opposite.

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,560
Your Highness, the cloud roll has recovered.

107
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,960
I was ordered by my parents

108
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,120
to continue serving Her Highness.

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,760
How dare you!

110
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
Did I let you in?

111
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Are you all bullying me?

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,320
You're all bullying me.

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,320
When did I let you in?

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,280
You're all bullying me.

115
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
They all bully me.

116
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,120
Assassination and poison.

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,480
I've seen too many in the mansion.

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,400
That's why I said you can't lose favour.

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,720
We must take back his heart.

120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Otherwise, he will come and kill us anytime.

121
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,760
That's not impossible.

122
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
I can still live without him.

123
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,960
What? Where was I?

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,400
Kill us.

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes, beat us to death.

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,120
It's not impossible

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,280
to kill us.

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,960
His Highness threatened me with the lives of his family.

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
Not only did he kidnap me to treat you,

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,280
and imprisoned me.

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
This is ruthless.

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,840
Crazy.

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,440
He won't let me out if I don't cure you.

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Did you misunderstand him?

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
Absolutely not.

136
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,640
You have an extraordinary status in his heart.

137
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm confident that I can help you win back your favor.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,600
and you let me go.

139
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
I don't want to see him.

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
and I don't want any favour.

141
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
Instead of worrying about love,

142
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,320
it's better to cut the crap

143
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
and do what you should do.

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
and go far away.

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,200
Look how nice the weather is today.

146
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
It's normal to be afraid of cold.

147
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,280
Just take a walk.

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
When we go back,

149
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll make you a bowl of good lotus seed soup.

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
Why is there no one here in broad daylight?

151
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,800
Do you know where he is?

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Your Highness.

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Say it.

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,720
How dare you not answer her question?

155
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Tell me.

156
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,840
His Highness entered the palace in the morning.

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,600
and was detained.

158
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,600
What?

159
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Why?

160
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,280
I heard that Imperial Physician Song complained.

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,640
Let's go to the palace.

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Slow down.

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
His Highness ordered you two to stay in the hospital.

164
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I'm afraid of you.

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
The news has spread to the palace.

166
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
I will go out one day.

167
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
It's Lady-in-waiting Xu.

168
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
For you,

169
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
because of you.

170
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,360
I was afraid they would disturb you.

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Really?

172
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Then...

173
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,680
His Highness told you not to be nervous.

174
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
He can handle it.

175
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,240
Okay.

176
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
By the way,

177
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
Forget it.

178
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
I need to check again.

179
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
No way.

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,600
Father, how's the matter with the female doctor?

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
What else?

182
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
King Li came back with merit.

183
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,560
to ask His Majesty for credit.

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Besides,

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Physician Song's daughter didn't get hurt.

186
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
His Majesty didn't scold him.

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
Lady-in-waiting Xu,

188
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
It's all your good idea.

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll rip your mouth.

190
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,720
Stop!

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
What are you doing?

192
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
That's a court lady.

193
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,880
Look at you now.

194
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,040
Are you going to help outsiders bully your daughter?

195
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,400
I...

196
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,320
used to think I owe you so much.

197
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,280
I thought Jiayue took yours.

198
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,520
But this time,

199
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,520
do you think this life is too peaceful?

200
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,040
to provoke a court lady?

201
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,120
My life is so hard.

202
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,520
I was pushed down by a fake.

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,120
and was driven back to his maiden home by His Highness.

204
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
The fake was just sick.

205
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,560
A minor injury

206
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,280
His Highness wants to kidnap the physician.

207
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,400
I'm worried that the royal mansion will be in danger.

208
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,880
But no one worries about me.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,480
It's all my fault.

210
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,520
Even the father I cherish the most

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,600
only loves her, not me.

212
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,080
Liuli.

213
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
How can I not love you?

214
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,280
Of course I love you.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,080
Right?

216
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,560
By the way, I have a big coral.

217
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,200
You must like it.

218
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,440
That's right.

219
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,520
Let's go. I'll take you to get it.

220
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,480

Nini.

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,880
A red sky.

227
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Superfish.

228
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,840
The morning of the army

229
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,440
Superfish

230
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,040

231
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
Woyi Dong wins.

Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua

235
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,200
Hurry.

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,840
Feng Yin Liang.

237
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
Wan Juanqi.

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,200
A good deed.

239
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Loyalty and graceful.

240
00:12:59,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Yi He Min.

241
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080

242
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,640

Bin Hanyue.

244
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
Ye Yang becomes Kun Yan.

245
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,320
My promise is fulfilled.

246
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,400
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.

247
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,640
The crane is shining with snow and fruit.
