1
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
The maid sent a message that you want to see me.

2
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,680
Liuli.

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,640
Jiayue.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,560
Jiayue.

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,200
Liuli.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,640
Jiayue.

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,039
Get a doctor.

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Are you sure it's poison?

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
It's highly poisonous and dangerous.

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,280
And the poison is colorless and tasteless.

11
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,440
on the glass wall of drinking water.

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,240
They won't be noticed easily.

13
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,800
Although they are guilty,

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,039
they are not fatal.

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,200
Why was he poisoned as soon as he came back?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Maybe it's because you didn't manage it well.

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,039
Besides, Jiayue hasn't fully recovered.

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
and is still very weak.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please give me an explanation.

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
I didn't say there's no way.

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
It can be detoxified.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,520
But the ingredient is special.

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,240
We need the blood of the closest family to make medicine.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Otherwise, the more effective it is,

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,079
The more dangerous the patient is.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
It doesn’t matter. Jiayue took me.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,200
Jiayue is also my mother-in-law’s child.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,160
Maybe a miracle will happen.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's go. Okay.

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,880
Okay.

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,840
Liuli said she knows where the jade is.

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,600
As long as I give it to her,

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,440
she will give me the jade.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,440
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,800
You want to use me to bring down the Qiu family?

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,280
As long as you help...

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,800
Enough.

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
I, Chu Jingyan,

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
need a woman to help me.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,040
Especially the woman I love.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Rest early.

42
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720
Jiayue.

43
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,720
Why are you doing this?

44
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,480
Where is Liuli?

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Let her keep her promise.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
You worked so hard

47
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,640
Is it worth it

48
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Is it worth it?

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Have you ever thought

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
if she lied to you

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
or she doesn't fall for it,

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
how will you crack it?

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,920
For you,

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,600
for you.

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,840
I...

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
don't deserve you to do this for me.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I lived my life for revenge.

58
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
I have no soul.

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
But until I met you,

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,800
But our identities are so different.

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,840
So,

62
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Push me away.

63
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,160
Right?

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,520
Chu Yi, why are you here?

65
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,400
Did you forget that she's from the Qiu family again?

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,840
No.

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,600
I was just reminding you.

68
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
You're awake, Your Highness. You're awake.

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Here.

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Great, madam's blood is not wasted.

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
I had a long dream.

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,480
I was told not to give up.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
But I can't see their faces clearly.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,720
Yun Shu.

75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,920
Has His Highness been here?

76
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
His Highness is in the main hall with Old Master.

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
You and Madam Cocoon are both poisoned.

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
It's very dangerous.

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
She's poisoned. Let's go. Let's go.

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,080
Weird.

81
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,120
You said

82
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,680
what she wasted.

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,640
You have no idea.

84
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,720
This poison needs the blood of a closest relative

85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
can it be effective quickly.

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
You cut your blood every day.

87
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
You finally woke up.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,480
I just don't know how Madam Cocoon is doing.

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
What?

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,680
Isn't she the daughter of the Gu family?

91
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Water.

92
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Water.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,560
Where is Shen Jiayue?

94
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,840
Is she awake?

95
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
Your Highness,

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
Lady Jiayue woke up before you.

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
I knew it.

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
I knew it.

99
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Fortunately, I took the antidote in advance.

100
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Wait for me here.

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Chu Yi.

102
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,560
Come with me.

103
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,160
Chu Yi.

104
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
I have a request.

105
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Can you promise me?

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Your Highness.

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,559
I will try my best

108
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
I can do.

109
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,840
Come with me tomorrow.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't tell His Highness, okay?

111
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Your Highness.

112
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
I need to report this to His Highness.

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,040
The first day of the lunar month.

114
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,960
Here, you're the only one

115
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
You're the only one who gave me the medicine.

116
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
Only you will help me, right?

117
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,960
What do you want me to do?

118
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,400
Help me get rid of someone.

119
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
is nothing to you.

120
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,920
I promise

121
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,920
You're a bad person. You're a bad person.

122
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,560
This is our private agreement.

123
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,920
Lei Jian is just shining, the handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin to the Hui Kingdom

124
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,280
Lei Jian has just come to the city

125
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,800
Semi.

127
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,120
Yang Nan.

128
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,520
The case is solved.

129
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
and red.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600

135
