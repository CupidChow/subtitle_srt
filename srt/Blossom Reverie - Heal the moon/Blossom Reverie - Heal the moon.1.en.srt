1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,480
This is the ancestral hall of the Chu family.

2
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,440
My ancestors,

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,560
I've killed Qiu Tongchang.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,680
I've avenged the Chu family.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
Chu Jingyan.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,480
I should return

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,440
the crown prince.

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Jing...

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
Chu Jingyan.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,520
You killed Jiayue.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
How dare you show up in front of me?

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
If you dare to kill me,

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,200
you’ll never see Shen Jiayue again.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
Chu Jingyan, you...

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,400
Everything...

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Is it finally over?

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,200
Jiayue, as long as you take the blame,

18
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,680
you can save the Tai family.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
We'll be grateful to you.

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't blame us for being ruthless.

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
Only you can save the Qiu family.

22
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,960
The adopted daughter of the Qiu family, Shen Jiayue,

23
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
seized the title of the legitimate daughter

24
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
and sold private salt.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,720
trying to frame the legitimate daughter of the Qiu family.

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,640
Let go of me!

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Remove the Princess Shen’s uniform.

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,800
and confined the backyard

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
and wait for your punishment.

30
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,200
Shen,

31
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,200
Do you have any excuses?

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,200
I...

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,200
disdain to argue.

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,880
It's great

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
to think like this.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,280
Take off her clothes.

37
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,240
Take her to the backyard.

38
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,280
Don't let her see anyone.

39
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,920
Yun Shu.

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,480
Chu Jingyan.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Chu Jingyan!

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,520
Chu Jingyan!

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
How dare you see me?

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
His Highness has pleaded to His Majesty.

45
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520
If you keep messing around,

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,400
you will be executed.

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Liuli.

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
You are still unmarried.

49
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Why are you here?

50
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,280
Your Highness, I'm pregnant.

51
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,120
However, Yun Shu who was sent to inform you...

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
was killed by someone.

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,200
Pregnant?

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,120
What?

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Do you want to add a crime of adultery?

56
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,920
You want her to shut up more.

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,800
Your Highness.

58
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,480
Please spare my sister.

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,200
At most,

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
I'll punish you to kneel in the snow for one night.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm sure you'll understand.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,440
your intentions.

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,520
That's great, sister.

64
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,800
After you get punished,

65
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,920
everything will be fine.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,800
You won't ignore your parents, right?

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,960
Take this pregnancy medicine.

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,240
The Chu family will not leave any unknown bastard.

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,520
I won’t drink it.

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Chu Jingyan.

71
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
This is your child.

72
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,280
Don't you have a heart?

73
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,520
My baby.

74
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,720
Did Kwong Dong-chang order you to do this?

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,280
If I take this pregnancy medicine,

76
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,040
I’ll take all the blame.

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
Shen Jiayue has pleaded guilty.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,120
It proves that this has nothing to do with our family.

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
She did it alone.

80
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,280
Now the grievances of our family have been cleared.

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,040
I hope you can enforce the law impartially.

82
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,680
and punish only Shen Jiayue.

83
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,440
My son Liuli has suffered a lot.

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,120
You must help my son.

85
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
I remember

86
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
you two

87
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,400
you married Jiayue

88
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,720
marry Jiayue to me.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,280
Now you want me to marry Liuli?

90
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
Don't say that.

91
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,960
We were confused.

92
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,320
Considering our years of relationship,

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,000
I married her to His Highness.

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
But now she did such a thing.

95
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
You and Ruri love each other.

96
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,080
From now on, we are still a family.

97
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,000
For our family,

98
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,720
I can only sacrifice you.

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,000
As long as you die,

100
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,120
I’ll be Princess Li.

101
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,480
Alright.

102
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,560
You

103
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
are our good kids.

104
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
Jiayue,

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
You have nowhere to go.

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
Just stay.

107
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,720
We are still your parents.

108
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,480
Why won't you let me go?

109
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,840
I won't let you have your way.

110
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
On the 15th day of the first lunar month,

111
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
The Lantern Festival

112
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
officially begins.

113
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,520
Could it be...

114
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,800
Cheng Zeyong from Tōtsuki Dynasty

115
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:29,920

Wan Juanqi.

134
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,400
A good deed.

135
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
Loyalty and graceful.

136
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,480
She looks gorgeous.

137
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,440
and elegant.

138
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,560

Wish you success.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Yang becomes Kun Yan.

145
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,880
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.

146
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,320
Your Highness.
