1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,280
You're right, Your Highness.

2
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
You flatter me.

3
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,960
Your Highness, a few days ago,

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,720
why did Lady-in-waiting Xu get so close to Liuli?

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Didn't Her Majesty bring her up

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,800
and brought her into the palace.

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
What relationship does she have with Ruri?

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,120
Lady-in-waiting Xu is a maid in Her Majesty's bedroom.

9
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Yes, everyone in the palace knows that.

10
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,240
Lady-in-waiting Xu.

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Lady-in-waiting Xu.

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
Xu.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,600
Xu?

14
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,880
Your Highness.

15
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
There's nothing here.

16
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,840
What are you praying for?

17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,680
The temple in the capital is full of incense.

18
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
But I had another wish

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
to make a wish for the gods and Buddha.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,160
People worship their own debts.

21
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,880
It doesn't matter where you pray.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,840
Her Highness is scared.

23
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,040
Regret?

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,920
Everyone has fear.

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,079
But I don't regret it.

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,600
What about you, Lady-in-waiting Xu?

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
Me too.

28
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,440
Your Highness, I have something important to see you.

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
It concerns the future of the Qiu family.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
Tell me, what's the matter?

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
You may leave.

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,880
Sister, if I'm not mistaken,

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,079
the jade must have been taken away by someone.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
to frame our family, right?

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
What do you know?

37
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,600
I only know that the Qiu family is your wealth.

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,840
And you are the wealth of our family.

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,200
I don’t know where Chu Jingyan and Shen Jiayue found this.

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
They must want to harm you.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
You're quite smart.

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm just worried about you.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
If you are willing to interact with me more,

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm willing to do anything.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,440
Fine. You don't even know what it is for.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
How dare you guess the future of a country?

47
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't know about the Chu family.

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
or a fake.

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,959
Ruri, if you still want to live,

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
just pretend you never came here.

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,800
After I leave tomorrow,

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
after I leave tomorrow.

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Ruyue,

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Would you do something for me?

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,640
You saved my life.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,640
I'll do anything for you.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,440
Yaoyao, what's wrong?

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,280
I feel a little dizzy.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,480
Are you drunk?

60
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Maybe.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,360
Do you want me to take a walk in the garden with you?

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,400
Sure.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Let's go.

64
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,960
Be careful.

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
When we go back,

66
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
I'll be fine after some rest.

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
It'll be fine.

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Place Chu Jingyao and Young Master Li in a room

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,840
and wait for everyone to look for them.

70
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,840
and found that they were intimate.

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,040
I will be the Empress.

72
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,600
Of course she won't be the candidate for the Empress.

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Don't worry.

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,800
Mr. Choi will take care of it.

75
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,560
Let me go back to the front hall with you.

76
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Take care.

77
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,280
What happened?

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,840
Miss.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,960
Let's go.

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
This way.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
Lord Xu.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
Choi Seo, right?

83
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
I have never been married.

84
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
and I'm an official.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why do you have to be surnamed by others?

86
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
But I compared it just now.

87
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,320
your palm prints were indeed printed on the engagement letter.

88
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:57,960
The contract?

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm not married to Lord Cui.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
We were engaged since childhood.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
How could we marry someone else

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
how could he marry someone else?

93
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,560
This is just his wishful thinking.

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,280
Lord Xu blamed Lord Cui

95
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,000
and killed the entire Chu family.

96
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
Don't you feel guilty?

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
It has nothing to do with me.

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,640
I remember that day,

99
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,280
it was the wedding ceremony of the eldest daughter of the Chu family.

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Miss Jing Yao is not feeling well.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Her Majesty sent her back to her room.

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
When she returned to the banquet,

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
there was a fire.

104
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,400
We asked someone to help.

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
I just didn't expect that...

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,440
Then why did you have the jade jade pendant?

107
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
I don't know.

108
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
you poisoned my family

109
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,520
and poisoned 32 of my family.

110
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,680
You set fire to my family.

111
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
I don’t know.

112
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,280
Chu Jingyan.

113
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,560
You will never know.

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
Chu Jingyan, you will never know.

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,039
You finish her.

116
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
Have a good rest.

117
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,720
Don't think too much.

118
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,680
You may leave now.

119
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,400
I think this is still related to Qiu Tongchang.

120
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
Empress Qiu and Lady-in-waiting Xu are just women.

121
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,480
They wouldn't do such a thing.

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,320
Qiu Tongchang was jealous of my father for making an exception and conferring a king for military merits.

123
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,880
But he's just a civil official.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,760
If his daughter can't become the empress,

125
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,120
he'll lose everything.

126
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Your Highness.

127
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
We don't have enough evidence now.

128
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
How can we defeat the Tai family?

129
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:21,960
Shing-taek, the Virtuous Virtuous Woman of Taoyue, Qing Qin, Xuanxuan Party, Long Xing, Xinhua, Bin Li, the sweet Longtao Zhengyang Army.

130
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Qin Chenxuan Party Long Xing

131
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,160
Lei Jian just shines, the handsome man, Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin and Xinyue

132
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,200
Lei Jian is a young man and a young man came to HENENNING and HENNING HONG JIPA

133
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Lei Jian is a young man and a handsome man

134
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,600
The handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinchun Hui, Ning Jipo

135
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Sylph.

136
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,080
A dollar.

137
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,520
Yoonan.

138
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,760
[Marvelous]

139
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,880
Superfish

140
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Wook Yi Dong wins.

141
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Long Xinze.

142
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,520
Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua.

143
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Feng Yin Liang.

144
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
Wan Juanqi.

145
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,920
Raise your hand.

146
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,240
Loyalty and graceful.

147
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,400
Qingsha, Bai Yi He Min.

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Qing Shabai Yi He Min

149
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,520
Qingsha Bai He Min

150
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,120
Qingsha.

151
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,840
Bin Han.

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
Yeyang Cheng Kun Yan

153
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,560
Heart, Yang, Sung, Kun.

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,280
The crane is shining and the snow is shining.
