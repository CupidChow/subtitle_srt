1
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,160
Why did I have such a strange dream?

2
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,440
Could it be that

3
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,920
Chu Jingyan isn't trying to cling to the Qiu family,

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,440
but to take revenge on the Qiu family.

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,600
Who?

6
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
Interesting.

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm just supervising you to stay alert.

8
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,240
The south flood

9
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Someone took the chance to win over the refugees

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Your Highness.

11
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,480
Your Highness, you've been training for years.

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,040
It's a good opportunity to show your skills.

13
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Should I

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
find some trouble for other candidates?

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
The disaster relief and pacifying are two different matters.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
There are many connections inside.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,640
I'd rather lose this.

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,200
But others may not

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,320
like you.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Besides, that thief has a military advisor.

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,280
You must be interested.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,480
He was the childhood sweetheart of the maid

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
who ran away.

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
has been thrown to the Nanban.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,920
Send a message to the Left State Councillor

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,360
The south is his jurisdiction

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,680
If I go there,

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,920
I'll only ask about the disaster.

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,960
Don't ask anything else.

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Your Highness.

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
I'll change your clothes.

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
Your Highness.

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
I haven't seen you all night.

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
I was really worried.

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
I've prepared hot soup for you to moisten your throat.

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm not interrupting.

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
you and my sister?

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,480
Your Highness, it's getting cold.

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Put on your clothes.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,880
You're up late.

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,920
You freeze His Highness with sincerity.

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Your Highness.

43
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Let me do it.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
Leave it to Jiayue.

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,840
Jiayue.

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
Change my clothes.

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,880
You'll wake up for a long time.

48
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
Come with me then.

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
But those two in your house...

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't worry.

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
I can balance it.

52
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,080
How can Ruri

53
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,920
to change clothes?

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Ruri.

55
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,480
After all, you are the daughter of Lord Qiu.

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,920
The queen ordered by His Majesty.

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll leave it to you to manage the household affairs.

58
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

59
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,240
I

60
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,880
will do my best.

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,560
Sister.

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
I have good news.

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
As for me,

64
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,960
a noble family.

65
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
As the master of the backyard,

66
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
I have to be fair.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,440
The wind is famous for its crispy skin.

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
As a sister,

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

70
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
You've worked hard to serve His Highness this morning.

71
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
So I

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
to give it to you.

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
It's only been a day.

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Can't you wait?

75
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,400
I don't understand what you're talking about

76
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,920
But if you don't eat,

77
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
you'll be dissatisfied

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,880
to take charge of the backyard.

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll eat it.

80
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,120
Since you ate it,

81
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,280
you should thank him.

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
Is this why you're here?

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Of course.

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
Sit tight then.

85
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,160
Are you kidding me?

86
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
Fortunately, I vomited out the snacks.

87
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
What's wrong?

88
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Do you need a doctor?

89
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,040
I just ate some snacks.

90
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,960
It's a little disgusting.

91
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
Yun Shu.

92
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
Get me a bowl of syrup of plum.

93
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
It's cold.

94
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
in such a cold day?

95
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Sister.

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,760
Could it be...

97
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,440
Yunjuan, get a doctor.

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Yes.

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Congratulations, Your Highness.

100
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You are pregnant.

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,000
Really?

102
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Congratulations.

103
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
That's great.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Yun Shu.

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,440
Let's go and tell His Highness this good news.

106
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,880
and make things worse.

107
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,880
Understand?

108
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Miss Leng is back.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Miss Jiayue is back.

110
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,160
I am the only young lady

111
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,000
in the capital.

112
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,400
What brings you

113
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
come to my house?

114
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,280
You're right.

115
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm just being kind.

116
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Thinking about her entering the royal mansion,

117
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,080
the royal mansion will have more children under your care.

118
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
If you don't inform me,

119
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,800
how can you show that you are blessed?

120
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Jiayue.

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,560
Jiayue, are you alright?

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Dad, mom.

123
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,560
Why don't you look at me first?

124
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
Father, Mother.

125
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,000
I have good news for you.

126
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
so I was in a hurry.

127
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,680
Really? Then tell us some good news.

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Father, Mother.

129
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm pregnant.

130
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,560
What?

131
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,400
What a great news, sister.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,400
But I heard

133
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,320
this woman can only be diagnosed after more than a month.

134
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
I wonder whose child you are carrying.

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,720
Father, Mother, I'm afraid

136
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
you won't be able to tolerate me.

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
Can you talk properly?

138
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't cry all the time.

139
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Whose parents are they?

140
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,160
Father, you know what happened that day.

141
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,200
You said you and Prince Li were married.

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
That means it's a full moon.

143
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,280
I forgot it.

144
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,960
I'll let you be happy for two more days.

145
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,080
If you can't give birth,

146
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,520
what will you do?

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,680
But I don't dare to go back to the mansion to raise my baby.

148
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
When I came in,

149
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,640
I didn't even call my parents.

150
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,960
but you called them out.

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,520
It's just a taste.

152
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Really?

153
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
I'll give you a cup of tea.

154
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
I trust you.

155
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,160
You...

156
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Father, Mother.

157
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,280
It's not convenient for me to go back to the mansion.

158
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,080
It's better to keep her at home.

159
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,440
Liuli, serve tea to your sister.

160
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Mother.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Liuli.

162
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
In the backyard,

163
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
You must be able to move forward and retreat.

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,160
Serve the tea.

165
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,240
Serve tea for your sister.

166
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Sister, please have some tea.

167
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
Thank you.

168
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,680
My stomach hurts.

169
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,440
Jiayue. Jiayue.

170
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,360
What tea did you give me?

171
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,560
Blood.

172
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,880
Her Highness is bleeding.

173
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
She had a miscarriage after drinking Madam Cocoon's tea.

174
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,240
Shut up! Nonsense!

175
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,360
The handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin Hui, NingJbo, the strong Hammer, the strongest and the strongest

176
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,960
Lei Jian, the handsome and handsome man, Bin Ying and Cheng, come to Xinxin, Xinyue, the strongest and the strongest

177
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,600
The handsome and handsome man Bin Ying and Cheng come to Xinxin Kingdom

178
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,560
Zhang Yixing: A handsome and handsome man, Zhang Ying and Cheng, come to Xinxin. Lian Huaiwei: A strong girl from Hui.

179
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,920
The sword just shines

180
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
Look at this. Look at this.

181
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Superfish

182
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,480
Ui-dong wins.

183
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,760
Garyong Shintaek.

184
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,360
Xu Yidong wins.

185
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,800
Minli Peng, three characters.

186
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
Wai Xin Bin Hui Min Hua

187
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,200
Feng Yin Liang.

188
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,240
Xiao Juan.

189
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Wanjuanqi.

190
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,440
