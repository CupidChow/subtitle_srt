00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,638
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:36,419
Hey. What are you doing?

3
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,098
He passed out.

4
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,639
Well? Is he okay?

5
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,348
Doctor, it's Yoon Sun Woo.

6
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,348
I have a patient for you.

7
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,118
- No, I'm out of Seoul. - It's of no use.

8
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:12,488
- Are you awake? - I'm a doctor.

9
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:15,329
That was a painkiller.

10
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,869
I have a stage four hepatoblastoma.

11
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,928
Even if you take me to a doctor,

12
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:23,898
it's useless.

13
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,238
Darn.

14
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,219
Yes, did Jenny Jang call?

15
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:17,358
What about Director Wi, or anyone from Deo?

16
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:20,089
Darn it!

17
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:27,499
Seriously!

18
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,019
So I guess you're half a bride.

19
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,288
You held the wedding, but actually, you didn't.

20
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,189
Mom, I told you.

21
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,799
That Jenny was trying to fool you through this wedding.

22
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:01,828
She eventually failed to take care of Mayor Do's issue.

23
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,839
It won't be easy, Jung Hyuk.

24
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,969
Please excuse us, Mother.

25
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,478
We decided to go on our honeymoon next time,

26
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,608
so we'll go and rest.

27
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,649
Will you be okay in your room?

28
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:16,478
You're still newlyweds.

29
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,519
But that room hasn't even been decorated properly.

30
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,788
Did you call Mr. Park?

31
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:21,989
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,559
He can come today if you want and start the interior work.

33
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,029
Tell him to wait.

34
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,788
It'll be decided within a few days.

35
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,799
Whether the interior work will be necessary or not.

36
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:36,899
How long do you need?

37
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:39,939
I'll try...

38
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,839
to take care of it as soon as...

39
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,578
Tell him to send a few catalogs.

40
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,908
While we choose which type to go with,

41
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,408
it'll be sorted out.

42
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:51,318
Dragging things too long won't do you any good.

43
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,619
Things like this should be sorted out as soon as possible.

44
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,459
Yes, Chairwoman Kim.

45
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,779
Mr. Yoon.

46
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:17,939
Oh, yes.

47
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,008
Do Young...

48
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:23,249
Ms. Jang said you can leave.

49
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,018
She's going to stay here starting tonight.

50
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,458
What will you do now?

51
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,099
I thought you were dying soon.

52
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,138
Why do you need money then?

53
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,508
Since I'm dying soon.

54
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,208
From the gutter to glory.

55
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,208
That's my story.

56
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,989
I struggled to become a doctor and finally became a specialist.

57
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,718
I wanted to save up money and pay back my debts...

58
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,828
and buy a house for my parents who went through so much trouble.

59
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,559
But I'll die soon.

60
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,039
From now on, you and I...

61
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,878
will become a team.

62
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,648
You need to get the money,

63
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:33,119
and I need to find my mom.

64
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:42,128
Do you have any idea what's in this video?

65
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:46,099
Do you know what kind of horrible things are happening?

66
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,869
How will you escape from...

67
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,968
the people who are involved in this?

68
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,468
That's for me to take care of.

69
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,539
Anyhow, if you go out of this room,

70
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,578
you'll be reported as a drug user right away.

71
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,809
I gave the hospital the wrong information on purpose earlier,

72
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,648
but this time, I'll give the police your real personal details.

73
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,289
I don't use drugs.

74
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:08,989
The reason why I agreed to your offer...

75
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,518
is because I didn't want to waste time explaining to the police.

76
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:13,289
The reason why I delivered drugs...

77
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,859
was because I needed money.

78
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,299
The reason I worked part-time at the hospital...

79
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,929
was because I needed narcotic analgesics.

80
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,708
Please do me a favor.

81
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,078
If something happens to me before this is all over,

82
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,278
please give the money I've saved up...

83
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:39,018
to my family members.

84
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,249
If you promise me that, I will...

85
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,189
side with you.

86
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,258
No, I won't make any promises.

87
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,758
So you should live and give that money yourself.

88
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:52,059
And get some treatment as well.

89
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,398
You should have hope to achieve a miracle.

90
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,518
I can't believe we got married.

91
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,189
On top of that,

92
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:19,888
it's a marriage with consequences and deals on the line.

93
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,198
Whatever the case may be, it doesn't matter.

94
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,599
Even if you're used?

95
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,068
That doesn't matter either.

96
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,909
You're that valuable to me.

97
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,979
And you're someone I can trust.

98
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,309
You'll regret it.

99
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,078
That's okay.

100
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,099
We need to kick her out...

101
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,128
and never let Jenny Jang...

102
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,169
set foot in this house again.

103
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:09,378
Mr. Hwang, do you know Monk Un San?

104
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,878
Monk Un San?

105
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,378
You know, my uncle.

106
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,349
Yes, of course I know him.

107
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,378
The late Chairman Wi Dong Sub...

108
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:20,849
visited him at the temple quite often, and I accompanied him.

109
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:22,888
Did you see him recently?

110
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:25,929
It's been years since he stopped contacting us,

111
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:28,588
and it's been a while since I've seen him. Also,

112
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,999
he didn't come to his brother's memorial service either.

113
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,068
I want you to find him for me.

114
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,909
What does this have to do...

115
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,208
with getting rid of Jenny Jang?

116
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,108
It has to do something with Jung Hyuk.

117
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,279
When I was a kid,

118
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,988
there was a man my mom used to date.

119
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,799
It was Jung Hyuk's father.

120
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,728
After my father and my grandfather...

121
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,468
all passed away,

122
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,208
my mom cremated all of them.

123
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:14,939
She was afraid.

124
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,578
In case someone found out Jung Hyuk wasn't blood-related.

125
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,478
Find Monk Un San.

126
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,679
He's the only person remaining who shares Deo's blood.

127
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,618
Once you find him...

128
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:30,289
and compare his DNA with Jung Hyuk,

129
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:34,088
it will be proven that he's not an offspring of Deo.

130
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,198
Jung Hyuk will be kicked out of the house,

131
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,228
and he will never set foot in Deo either.

132
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,379
How was your brother's wedding this afternoon?

133
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,179
Why aren't you answering? You're not sleeping.

134
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:03,618
They got married, but it's not actually real. Are you satisfied?

135
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,328
Go back to your bed!

136
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,068
Why do you hate Jenny so much?

137
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,338
Didn't you say you were ill when you were a kid?

138
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:19,509
Jenny became your hands and feet during that time.

139
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:24,578
The Jenny Jang I know is not a greedy woman.

140
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,279
She's better than anyone else as your brother's wife.

141
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,218
You also despised Deo Group before we got married.

142
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,218
You criticized me for being materialistic and ignored me.

143
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,318
But look at you now.

144
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:40,189
You're so desperate not to leave.

145
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:44,059
This is that sort of place.

146
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:48,169
Once you set foot in it, everyone loses their minds.

147
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,198
A place where no one can leave voluntarily.

148
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,078
This is a fight about my pride now.

149
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,909
I'll make sure she learns how to obey her master.

150
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,078
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:41,718
I apologize on their behalf.

152
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,858
Everyone here is like this Penrose triangle.

153
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,159
It looks like a triangle, but it's only an optical illusion.

154
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,399
See it from a different angle, and you realize its shape is different.

155
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,799
Everyone here is like that. They change all the time.

156
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:01,309
So don't waste your time trying to understand them.

157
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,679
It's not your fault.

158
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,659
How does it look?

159
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,669
The currents aren't that strong,

160
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,738
but we don't know where the body is,

161
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,509
so we're not sure where to look.

162
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,478
A corpse of a woman who seems to be in her 50s has been found.

163
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:17,779
The police are trying to identify the body.

164
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,318
Would you like to check?

165
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,659
(Rest in Peace)

166

(Mortuary Refrigerator)

167
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,899
Hey, Jung Hyuk.

168
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:13,139
- Where's Do Young sitting? - She doesn't get a seat.

169
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,838
This is for our family.

170
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,539
She can eat with Ms. Han.

171
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:19,879
How childish.

172
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,708
Ye Nam.

173
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:23,818
Make sure Do Young can eat with us.

174
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,218
Mom told us to do this.

175
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,358
- Let's eat. - Mom's not here yet though.

176
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,539
Is she your mother?

177
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,608
No. No.

178
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,348
She's not my mom.

179
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,689
(10 Dollars Cheaper Than Anywhere Else)

180
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,669
(Yongcheon Police Station, Chief Oh Tae Seok)

181
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,738
- Congratulations, ma'am. - Congratulations, ma'am.

182
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,639
- Congratulations, ma'am. - Thank you.

183
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,458
Good morning.

184
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,598
This has information on the girl.

185
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,539
Lee Hyun Ji, age 24.

186
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,198
An amateur go player?

187
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,169
She joined the association as an apprentice at the age of seven.

188
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:30,879
But she's still an amateur.

189
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,309
I think some stuff happened when they were selecting pro players.

190
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,009
Anyway, she quit for about three months...

191
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,179
and came back to the amateur league.

192
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,519
Three months?

193
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,218
She learned her lesson quickly.

194
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,759
She's been doing it all her life.

195
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,029
If she's going to suffer either way,

196
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:49,189
it is wise for her to just do it.

197
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,998
In order to anticipate the opponent's movements,

198
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,458
I need to read even the slightest signals.

199
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,328
Not just on the Go board,

200
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,998
but even from the opponent's energy.

201
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,368
She'll be quite useful.

202
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,639
She managed to give you the slip...

203
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,509
and disappear into thin air.

204
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,679
Without her,

205
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,649
Yang Oh Distribution's Mr. Cho would've messed with us,

206
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,189
and we'd have more things to take care of.

207
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,458
Track them down. The girl and that doctor.

208
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,389
When Oh Tae Seok was chasing her,

209
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,429
she was with a woman and a boy.

210
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:23,958
She'll respond if we find them and use them as bait.

211
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:27,429
But this time, I'll do it my way.

212
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:36,909
What happened?

213
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,008
I got a call from that girl.

214
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:44,518
I'll give you two days to bring my mom to me.

215
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,319
Do you think your mom is alive?

216
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,919
You hope she is, right?

217
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:54,329
You'll never see your mom again if you do anything reckless.

218
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,629
So what are you going to do?

219
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,899
Will you bring the dead woman back to life and take her to that girl?

220
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,169
We have to catch them.

221
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:04,698
That girl and the jerk who has the video file. Both of them.

222
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,089
You didn't eat the food in the fridge, did you?

223
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,359
Get up and have some food.

224
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,288
I've eaten.

225
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,659
You don't see anything because I've cleaned up.

226
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,258
Good.

227
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:35,429
This braised spicy chicken is from a very famous restaurant.

228
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,669
It'll be good.

229
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,909
- What's wrong? - This just feels weird.

230
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,349
I'm a doctor,

231
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,189
yet you're looking after me.

232
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:58,258
I can't believe I'm relying on a complete stranger.

233
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,288
You see,

234
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:06,159
I think I can take great care of...

235
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,198
my patients if I get to return to the hospital.

236
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,238
I want to be...

237
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,708
a good doctor. I really...

238
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:17,609
want to go back.

239
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,478
You'll recover. I'm sure...

240
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,218
you'll be able to go back.

241
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:32,518
You should call your family.

242
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,228
It's a burner phone.

243
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:38,129
From now on, use that phone when you need to call anyone.

244
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,798
No, I should go see my family in person.

245
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:45,498
To tell you the truth, I haven't told my family about my illness.

246
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:51,909
Thank you.

247
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,879
I'm sure what you're going through is hard enough.

248
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,048
But you're looking after me, who's a complete stranger to you.

249
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:00,819
Mr. Lee.

250
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:04,389
Do you just want to go back?

251
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:09,288
Do you think those jerks will let me go?

252
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:11,099
And what about you?

253
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,899
What will you use as bait to find your mom if I'm not here?

254
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,439
You're just a young, naive lady when you're being like this.

255
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,238
You need to be strong.

256
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:26,948
If you want to survive,

257
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:29,708
you need to stop being so compassionate.

258
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,258
What an honor it is to have this noble lady in this humble place.

259
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:43,798
Cut it out. Just get straight to the point.

260
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,768
Are you a snitch or what?

261
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:49,298
Why would a cop deliberately try to make the citizens' lives hard?

262
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,669
Leave that up to thugs.

263
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,069
You jerk. I guess you think I'm a joke...

264
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,468
because I'm letting you talk to me in person.

265
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,738
Enough.

266
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,278
Why did you want to see me?

267
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,149
Mayor Do's video file.

268
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:02,948
That was us.

269
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,478
But something unexpected happened.

270
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,218
We'll get the file back and also bring the girl,

271
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,089
whom you're after,

272
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:12,988
so let Yang Oh Distribution...

273
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,889
take part in the international city project.

274
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:20,869
You want in on the business?

275
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:22,998
That's the only condition?

276
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,069
Yes, that's it.

277
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:27,008
I was born a man,

278
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,069
but dead, I'm just meat.

279
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,538
I'd like to leave behind a legacy.

280
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:34,879
My hometown Yungcheon will be revived.

281
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:37,018
I'd like to play a part in it.

282
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
But that foxy Jenny Jang...

283
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:43,288
She won't take my dirty money.

284
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,518
Well?

285
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,228
Will you accept my offer?

286
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:50,498
I was going to go straight to Mayor Do,

287
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,099
but I called you instead.

288
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,869
You conglomerates are above public officials.

289
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:00,738
We don't have to take in what Jenny Jang rejected.

290
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:05,308
Accepting dirty money could hurt our legitimacy.

291
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,708
Let's go.

292
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,679
Hey, you, policeman.

293
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,579
You're in no position to be picky.

294
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,389
You shed blood before the ground was even broken.

295
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,319
Who will cover that up?

296
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:22,028
Everyone has their own specialty.

297
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,998
Don't you agree, Director Wi?

298
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,599
Sit down, Tae Seok. Let's not draw a line.

299
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,308
Find the fool with the UBS drive and destroy the evidence.

300
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,939
Then a girl making a fuss to find her mother can't do anything.

301
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,679
You must have something.

302
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,278
Throw some bait.

303
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,379
I'm not your source.

304
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,819
Why would I take orders from you?

305
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,288
It used to be an honor for a cop to even see my shadow.

306
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:56,958
Say that again, jerk.

307
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:58,829
That's enough!

308
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,028
Sort out who the bigger guy is...

309
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:02,899
after I'm gone.

310
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:05,069
If you can't sort this out,

311
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,468
this is the end for the both of you.

312
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:10,538
Okay, then.

313
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,248
- Did you drop the bait? - Yes, sir.

314
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,048
Will that do, Mr. Officer?

315
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,018
He just has to take the bait.

316
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,689
Then we won't have to meet again.

317
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:59,258
You've gotten much lighter.

318
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,159
When I first came here,

319
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:06,599
you were a firm young man of 20.

320
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:10,698
That'll do.

321
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,738
Come down.

322
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,889
Ms. Wi is looking for Monk Un San.

323
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:30,419
She seems to think that...

324
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:32,758
her brother has a different father.

325
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:37,399
I don't think she'll drop the idea easily.

326
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,758
Why not find Monk Un San...

327
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:43,899
and prove yourself to Ms. Wi?

328
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,639
Just because you enter my bedroom,

329
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,939
does it make you my husband?

330
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:56,048
What parent...

331
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:59,179
proves herself to a child?

332
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,899
- Welcome home. - Hello.

333
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,599
About your grandfather's brother.

334
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,238
You found him?

335
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,339
He's dead.

336
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,609
He's dead?

337
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,468
He died a few years ago.

338
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,579
They kept it quiet...

339
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:28,879
because that's what he requested.

340
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,589
Hyun Ji, it's me.

341
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:37,589
Ye Jun and I are fine.

342
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:40,359
I thought it would be dangerous to stick together.

343
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,958
That's why I didn't call.

344
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,359
Where are you?

345
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,899
Ye Jun misses you a lot.

346
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:50,129
Call this number when you hear this.

347
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,998
Your message was saved.

348
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,369
Will that do?

349
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,109
I did as you said, so don't treat me too rough.

350
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,948
I'll do everything you want.

351
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,109
I'm an easy catch.

352
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:08,649
Are you sure you're trying to help Hyun Ji?

353
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,389
- I promise. - Then...

354
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,558
where do we go now?

355
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,929
Hey. You're my hostage.

356
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,198
Don't you see the picture?

357
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,669
Should a hostage always be timid?

358
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:25,839
Hey. My gosh.

359
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:28,468
(Yungcheon Fishing)

360
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:32,909
(You have a new voice message.)

361
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,179
This is your message.

362
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,718
Hyun Ji, it's me.

363
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,649
Ye Jun and I are fine.

364
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,359
I thought it would be dangerous to stick together.

365
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,919
That's why I didn't call.

366
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:47,728
I'm an expert.

367
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:51,159
I get the feeling of a guy in 0.1 seconds.

368
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,058
You're not a bad person.

369
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,939
(Lee Hyun Ji)

370
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:00,268
Is it Hyun Ji?

371
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:04,278
Call her to the meeting point.

372
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:06,038
If you want to see your kid again.

373
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,528
Lee Hyun Ji.

374
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,629
I meant to...

375
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:03,468
ask your name in person.

376
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,498
The doctor with the video.

377
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,169
Where is he?

378
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,079
You said you didn't want to bargain with me.

379
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,278
Now you do?

380
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,379
Before more people get hurt,

381
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,849
let's wrap this up.

382
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:21,649
I'm sorry about your mom,

383
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,619
but this is the only way you...

384
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,419
and the doctor can live.

385
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:28,929
Trust me.

386
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,698
The best you can do now...

387
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,228
is just that.

388
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,089
That doctor.

389
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:57,889
Where is he?

390
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:02,589
This time,

391
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,758
you lost.

392
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,198
Do you feel bad your mother's gone?

393
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,738
If you can't take down your opponent in one go,

394
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:20,179
first, you'd better learn...

395
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,879
to hide your identity and lie in wait.

396
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:25,179
Take her to Sun Woo.
