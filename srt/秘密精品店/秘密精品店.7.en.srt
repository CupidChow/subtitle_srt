1
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:07,247
We've finally become a family after 20 years.

2
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:11,486
No. We met each other for the first time way before that.

3
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:13,786
I hope your father welcomes Do Young...

4
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:16,357
even if he won't approve of me.

5
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:21,497
Do Young!

6
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:22,657
(Cheonho Express)

7
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,566
My child. Take her to safety.

8
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:37,706
You must be Deo Corporation's Chairman Wi's daughter-in-law.

9
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:39,916
The chairman's urgently looking for you.

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,517
Doctor. She's Deo Corporation's heir's wife.

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,316
Please give her the best care.

12
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:45,486
Her pulse is dropping!

13
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,956
Mom. Mom.

14
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:51,956
He won't be too sad about crossing the bar.

15
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,456
Anyone would resent an unwanted death.

16
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:56,526
I had such a hard life.

17
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:59,267
In the end, I was right.

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,537
Keep it safe, Chairwoman Kim.

19
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:05,806
Until I take this ring from your finger.

20
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:08,406
Until you return to your original place.

21
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,347
(Episode 4)

22
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:24,856
Where are your shares?

23
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:26,757
And when are you leaving?

24
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,097
I might be getting kicked out, but I'll say goodbye to Dad.

25
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:32,826
I have a right to attend his memorial mass.

26
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,837
You can't stop me, even if it displeases you.

27
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:40,576
You've resorted to using your birthright.

28
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,977
You never earned anything.

29
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,877
Your birthright is your source of power.

30
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:52,546
Darling.

31
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:10,507
What's the occasion? You're on my bed.

32
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,336
Can you give everything up...

33
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,537
and move to the US for me and Su Bin?

34
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:19,447
- What are you talking about? - No, right?

35
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,877
Come up with a culprit for this case.

36
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:26,116
You wanted me to cover it up.

37
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:28,157
I'm losing hair cleaning up Oh Tae Seok's mess.

38
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,386
I know the real killer.

39
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,926
- What? - It's Yoon Sun Woo.

40
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:34,796
J Boutique's Mr. Yoon?

41
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,926
What do you get from making him the killer?

42
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,997
I won't have to fly to the US.

43
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,866
And Jenny Jang will have to leave Deo.

44
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,807
The chairwoman wants you to leave?

45
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,507
Did you mess up again?

46
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,646
If you don't sort this out,

47
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:53,146
you and me both will be kicked out.

48
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,646
Jenny Jang will make you pay for arresting Mr. Yoon.

49
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:58,247
Why bother about her when she married your brother?

50
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:59,717
She'll have to pick.

51
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,986
To remain in Deo and abandon Sun Woo...

52
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:05,986
or leave Deo...

53
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,127
and keep Sun Woo.

54
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,007
Jenny's just like the chairwoman.

55
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,176
She isn't governed by her emotions.

56
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,576
No.

57
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:26,106
I know Do Young better than you do.

58
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,916
She's not like Mom.

59
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,266
Have you decided?

60
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:22,697
Keep it short.

61
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,737
Is it Jung Hyuk or Yoon Sun Woo?

62
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:29,776
Who will you pick?

63
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,646
Will you let Sun Woo rot in prison for murder?

64
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,377
To you, was he too...

65
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,346
just a tool...

66
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,917
used to feed your greed then be discarded?

67
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:43,057
Poor Mr. Yoon.

68
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:54,067
Do Yoon was born a weakling.

69
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,906
Send him off.

70
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,317
Do Young.

71
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:14,817
Does Mom look like you?

72
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,557
When I go to the afterlife...

73
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:23,497
and Mom doesn't recognize me,

74
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,096
I want to recognize her first.

75
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,336
Why wouldn't she recognize you?

76
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,747
Don't worry, Do Yoon.

77
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,177
Don't worry.

78
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,706
Sun Woo. Sun Woo.

79
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:47,576
Sun Woo, wake up. Sun Woo. Sun Woo!

80
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,747
Are you okay?

81
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,456
How do you feel?

82
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:56,927
Sun Woo. Sun Woo.

83
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,297
Do Young.

84
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,536
It's okay.

85
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,107
It's okay.

86
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,607
You're okay.

87
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,216
Poor Mr. Yoon.

88
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,447
He devoted himself to you all his life,

89
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,857
yet he's being abandoned as a result.

90
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,687
Not Sun Woo.

91
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:05,386
You...

92
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,297
can never touch Sun Woo.

93
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,367
So you should listen to me.

94
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,297
So cut all ties with Deo...

95
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:15,067
and go live quietly with Sun Woo somewhere.

96
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,206
Then everyone will be happy.

97
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,557
Are you stupid?

98
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,326
It's obvious you're being used by Do Young.

99
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:39,826
You're the only one who doesn't know.

100
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:24,027
Our dad was such a romanticist.

101
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,667
He hid Mom from Grandpa for 10 years.

102
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,706
That's why I'm the original one.

103
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,576
I was raised in the Deo family since I was born,

104
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,177
but you and Jung Hyuk...

105
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,447
only joined when you were 10.

106
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,246
Do you remember Dad?

107
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,017
I'm not sure.

108
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:52,856
He only visited sometimes when we were kids.

109
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,677
Mom's ring.

110
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,917
I'm going to receive that instead of Ye Nam or Jung Hyuk.

111
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,216
Mom said she'd give it to the successor of Deo Group.

112
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,086
Ms. Jang...

113
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,726
I mean, you should help me since you're my sister-in-law now.

114
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:32,866
No.

115
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,236
That ring doesn't belong to you three.

116
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,076
I'll get it back.

117
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:47,746
The ring...

118
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,746
and Deo Group.

119
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,256
Okay. I hope you get the ring too.

120
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,037
Did you make your choice?

121
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,907
You're the one...

122
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,206
who will have to make a choice.

123
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,216
What are you talking about? What choice?

124
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:39,226
Wi Ye Nam wants me...

125
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,236
to leave Deo, but that won't happen.

126
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,907
And I won't back down from the international city project.

127
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,407
You will...

128
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,746
get out of here.

129
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,746
Lee Hyun Ji.

130
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,346
That girl. Where is she?

131
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,086
Lee Hyun Ji...

132
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:05,226
will replace you as the killer.

133
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:15,397
Hyun Ji!

134
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:16,767
Hyun Ji!

135
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,506
Hyun Ji!

136
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,506
Hyun Ji!

137
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,206
Hyun Ji!

138
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,777
Even if you refuse,

139
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:28,917
I will...

140
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,647
do it.

141
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,787
Where were you all this time? I missed you.

142
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,126
Did you? How have you been, Ye Jun?

143
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,527
Okay.

144
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:45,167
Go inside, Ye Jun.

145
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,067
Hyun Ji and I have to talk.

146
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,907
Ye Jun, go on inside.

147
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,216
Why didn't you call me?

148
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,387
I was worried sick.

149
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:07,287
What good could possibly happen from calling you?

150
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,956
Ye Jun could've been in danger.

151
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,387
I know I've failed miserably as a mom,

152
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:16,096
but I couldn't let my son get in danger.

153
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,767
I'd rather starve and die.

154
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:24,006
I was too thoughtless. I'm sorry.

155
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:27,907
What about your mom?

156
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,777
Did you find her?

157
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,346
You didn't find her?

158
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:38,086
Did those thugs really do something to her?

159
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:51,897
Why are you crying?

160
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,836
Don't cry.

161
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,706
Don't cry.

162
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:23,256
I've never felt like this in my entire life.

163
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,797
When I grew up without knowing who my parents were,

164
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,667
when all those guys dumped me,

165
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,736
or even when I lost touch with Ye Jun's dad,

166
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,336
I was able to endure it.

167
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:39,447
To be honest, it was so scary all this time...

168
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,047
raising Ye Jun alone.

169
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,947
If it were Mom,

170
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,887
what would she do?

171
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,787
Ye Jun...

172
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,096
Let's send him back to school.

173
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,897
Right away?

174
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:06,637
Let's live properly from now on, like we used to.

175
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:10,647
But you'll have to live in hiding all the time.

176
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:13,206
I won't live in hiding.

177
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:17,417
Then how? Do you have a plan?

178
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,187
Her name is Lee Hyun Ji, age 24.

179
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,157
Think of her as a debtor you're after, and catch her.

180
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,187
Hey.

181
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:30,626
I saw what you did in the reed field.

182
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,966
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

183
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:34,767
My mouth.

184
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,836
Your life depends on what comes out of it.

185
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,376
Use that mouth just to eat.

186
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,706
We don't have time, so find her.

187
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,876
That piece of...

188
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,277
That jerk.

189
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,147
Darn.

190
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:57,687
Ms. Jang, Lee Hyun Ji is here to see you.

191
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,276
I came to negotiate.

192
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,647
Did you say you play Go?

193
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,917
I guess negotiating with me...

194
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,857
was the next move you chose.

195
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,496
Since I need to survive first.

196
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:41,097
You'll use me as your shield?

197
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,437
Now we're talking.

198
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:49,206
First, let me tell you what I want.

199
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:57,687
In an hour from now, you'll become a murder suspect.

200
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:04,587
And of course, I will get you out at all costs.

201
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:09,026
But it can only be done if you trust me.

202
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:13,127
Can you do it?

203
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,337
If you can,

204
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,877
tell me what you want.

205
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:30,347
(Special Interview with Director Wi Ye Nam of Deo Group)

206
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,697
Is my mother still in the living room?

207
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:43,927
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,827
I hope I don't have to go to the US soon...

209
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,897
so that I can have tea in the living room.

210
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:50,536
I feel as if I'm locked in my room.

211
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:54,036
Is everything well at the other house?

212
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,577
I'm talking about Do Young and Jung Hyuk.

213
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,776
They're already making it so obvious they got married just for show.

214
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,976
It's clear that she's got some fishy motive.

215
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,187
I'm sure there's something.

216
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,556
Don't you agree, Ms. Wang?

217
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,087
I'll look into it, ma'am.

218
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:15,026
My mother goes to the reception room often, so put this there.

219
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,066
Should I have worn a fancier outfit for this interview?

220
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,746
A suspect turned herself in? Who is this person?

221
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,347
We meet again, Mr. Prosecutor.

222
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:42,986
You helped me last time regarding my mom's case.

223
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:48,857
Let's get started.

224
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:50,897
It looks like everyone is here.

225
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:53,766
I'm relieved.

226
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:56,437
I had to get changed, so I was worried that I might run late.

227
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:59,966
What's going on? When did Yoon Sun Woo get out?

228
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,607
What on earth is happening?

229
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:03,536
Because she turned herself in,

230
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,607
we can't detain him anymore.

231
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,917
He's still considered a suspect though.

232
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,816
How much money do you have on you?

233
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,087
- This is all I have. - What is this about?

234
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,597
I'll take this as my fee.

235
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:28,837
(Power of Attorney)

236
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:29,937
Please sign here.

237
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,907
The presumption of innocence allows...

238
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:34,476
even suspects to defend others as their attorneys.

239
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:39,206
As of now, I'll be representing Ms. Lee Hyun Ji,

240
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,417
the suspect in the Hwapyeong reed field murder.

241
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,597
Invite everyone up to the 15th class of the training institute.

242
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:00,597
And make sure you check all the ladies' dress codes...

243
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:03,036
- so that they don't overlap. - Yes, ma'am.

244
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,837
You look great. Very good.

245
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,806
We only lifted Yoon Sun Woo's fingerprints from the gun.

246
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:13,677
From what I know, they're re-analyzing the evidence.

247
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,447
Okay.

248
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,046
Let me know when the results are out.

249
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,697
I have to say, even the evidence seems to have been set up.

250
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,867
Where did the order come from?

251
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,097
I'm not following at all.

252
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,167
Ms. Lee.

253
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,206
Do you know why you're sitting there right now?

254
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:45,407
You're a murder suspect.

255
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,816
This will completely ruin your life.

256
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,476
Are you sure you did it?

257
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,216
Yes.

258
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:55,956
Goodness.

259
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,357
She's dropping a bomb on herself.

260
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,597
What are you guys thinking?

261
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,097
On the day of the incident,

262
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:07,566
I took Ms. Lee to the reed field.

263
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,566
And I took care of the mess after the incident took place.

264
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:14,167
Here's Ms. Lee's statement on the incident.

265
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,907
(Statement, Lee Hyun Ji)

266
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,677
(I submit this statement as a suspect in the reed field murder.)

267
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:26,216
"I went to the scene because Lee Sang Hoon said..."

268
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,486
"he'd tell me why my mom went missing."

269
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,526
"But it was a lie, and he asked for money."

270
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,197
"I got so angry..."

271
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,367
"that I went to the firing range near the reed field..."

272
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,976
Hold on. What do you mean your mom went missing?

273
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,486
As for her mom's case,

274
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,516
you can contact Mr. Cha Seung Jae to request the file.

275
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:04,827
The case...

276
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,657
was reported directly to him.

277
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:19,036
Jenny Jang pulled a trick on us.

278
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:21,077
She made Lee Hyun Ji turn herself in as the culprit.

279
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:23,937
- Lee Hyun Ji? - She admitted to everything.

280
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,377
The real problem begins now.

281
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,607
The reason why she started chasing the doctor with the video.

282
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,077
From Oh Tae Seok to what happened to her mom.

283
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:31,687
If they investigate this with her as a suspect,

284
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,917
they'll have to dig up all the other cases too.

285
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:36,216
From Oh Tae Seok and Mayor Do to you and I,

286
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,857
all of us will be dead meat!

287
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:40,327
Then stop her!

288
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:43,697
How? Jenny Jang is behind her.

289
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,726
There's got to be something we can do. We must find it.

290
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,397
Listen carefully.

291
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,437
If we fall here,

292
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,577
neither you nor I will rise back up.

293
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:57,006
My mom won't accept us back.

294
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:01,316
From your career to our family, everything will be over for us.

295
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,377
Let's stop here, Ye Nam.

296
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,786
We have too much to lose. Call Jenny Jang now.

297
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:07,786
No.

298
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:09,986
Find a solution no matter what.

299
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:32,476
Why are you getting out of this car? This is Do Young's car.

300
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,847
What's so strange about a married couple coming home together?

301
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,427
- Were you waiting for me? - What do you want?

302
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,687
Do you want all of us to die or what?

303
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,597
What are you trying to gain by taking Lee Hyun Ji to court?

304
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,026
From the girl who was drugged to death by Mayor Do...

305
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:53,496
to Lee Hyun Ji's mom, who was a cop.

306
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,496
Do you plan to reveal everything...

307
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,837
so that you can take down everyone, including me and Mayor Do?

308
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,306
If Mayor Do gets hurt in this,

309
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,306
the international city project will fall through.

310
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:05,476
Are you going to ruin everything for yourself?

311
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:10,016
If that's the extent of my luck, I guess I have no choice.

312
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:15,486
And when someone spits on my food, I knock the whole table over.

313
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,427
I can just prepare the meal again.

314
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:19,687
Jang Do Young!

315
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,496
What did you do this time?

316
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:25,327
I guess this is the first time you're hearing about it.

317
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,466
- Let's go in. - Okay.

318
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:32,536
Do you know this?

319
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:36,276
All of this is happening because Do Young chose Yoon Sun Woo.

320
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:38,476
Instead of you!

321
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,816
Are you not going to ask me what this is all about?

322
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:50,687
You understood me without asking me anything.

323
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:53,857
I'll find out when the time is right.

324
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:57,397
(Attorney at Law Yoon Sun Woo)

325
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,177
Sun Woo, this is my first time seeing your office.

326
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:15,276
I'm all right.

327
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,927
I can only spare three minutes.

328
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,637
Look at you all grown up and taking care of Do Young by her side.

329
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,566
When you were little, you said...

330
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,607
you wanted to become Do Young because you liked her so much.

331
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:43,937
Now, 2 minutes and 30 seconds left.

332
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:51,746
Thanks for staying by Do Young's side, Sun Woo.

333
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:57,056
Do you really mean it?

334
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:02,857
Can you still not wrap your head around the fact that we're married?

335
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,526
It's not that. I do understand.

336
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,367
She needs you.

337
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:09,466
To be more specific,

338
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:11,736
she needs you because you're in the Deo family.

339
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,236
I'm just worried about you two because I care about you guys.

340
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,677
Not a day in your family goes by without problems,

341
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,546
which means you two...

342
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:22,117
might end up becoming enemies down the road.

343
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:26,847
So I'm not sure whether I should hope you actually love each other...

344
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,316
or got married because you need each other to attain your goals.

345
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:33,286
I'm confused every day.

346
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:41,066
I can't tell you now,

347
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:45,036
but you'll eventually come to understand our relationship.

348
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:49,776
I'm off.

349
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:53,647
I want you to be serious about her.

350
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:58,587
At least for now.

351
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,887
- That's my job. - Okay.

352
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:49,796
And of course,

353
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:52,867
I will get you out at all costs.

354
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:55,776
But it can only be done if you trust me.

355
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,526
It seems that...

356
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,357
Jenny Jang said I'd come to see you.

357
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:17,526
You're not surprised.

358
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:20,197
How more surprised could I get?

359
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:23,566
I already saw the worst of you.

360
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:27,437
I guess you know who I am then.

361
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:29,177
I'll get to the point.

362
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:33,006
The way things are going, you'll take the fall for everything.

363
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:34,647
More than 10 years,

364
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,276
most of your youth,

365
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,847
you'll spend behind bars.

366
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,917
Jenny Jang...

367
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,187
is just someone who shares the goal we do.

368
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:47,887
Listen.

369
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,397
Think about it.

370
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,496
Yoon Sun Woo's already a free man.

371
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,236
There's no reason Jenny Jang...

372
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:57,367
will get you out of here.

373
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,367
She'll make you the killer then get you out?

374
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,377
Do you think that's possible?

375
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,716
Here's a real offer.

376
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:17,516
The misfortune that got you here.

377
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,956
My offer will clear it all up.

378
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:46,887
You look amazing.

379
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:48,716
All dressed up like that,

380
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,917
you look like you did 20 years ago.

381
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:02,566
I'd wanted to get you a suit for a while.

382
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:05,266
Wearing clothes your wife bought,

383
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:07,236
and eating the food she cooked.

384
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:12,107
You hoped for such a life once.

385
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:16,677
Let's drink today instead.

386
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,486
The situation isn't too good.

387
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:24,827
Right now,

388
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:28,796
this is the only thing we can do as we wish.

389
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:45,947
I left my phone in the car.

390
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,347
Can you get it for me?

391
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:50,877
Sure.

392
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:10,097
Take him.

393
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:13,036
That man...

394
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,337
will take the fall on his own.

395
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,607
You made the right call.

396
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:29,986
Oh Tae Seok.

397
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,956
The man who really killed your mother.

398
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,466
I'll hand him over.

399
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:43,867
Of course,

400
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,137
I'll make him pay for his crimes.

401
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,907
You ended up here...

402
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:51,006
because of your missing mother.

403
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,907
Your mother, that doctor.

404
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:59,347
Oh Tae Seok did everything on his own.

405
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:05,526
You just have to part ways with Jenny Jang.

406
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:07,157
I'll arrest Oh Tae Seok...

407
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:09,427
and let you go.

408
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,827
The real killer pays...

409
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,796
and the innocent goes free.

410
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,137
That's how things should be.

411
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:21,736
Jenny Jang never makes a move without calculating first.

412
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,437
Even now,

413
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:26,506
if she denies she has anything to do with you,

414
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,046
she loses nothing.

415
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:29,347
In the end,

416
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,947
you'll just become her sacrifice.

417
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:54,006
Will Lee Hyun Ji trust you to the very end?

418
00:33:54,536 --> 00:33:56,407
It's not about trusting me.

419
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,647
It's about trusting herself.

420
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:04,216
Wait and see...

421
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,716
if I got her correctly.
