1
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,291
I got it exchanged.

2
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:45,342
Who told you to bring dollar bills?

3
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:49,172
You volunteer at a children's Buddhist camp in an hour.

4
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,581
I heard you'll hand out...

5
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,742
dollar bills so the kids can donate.

6
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,912
- When? - When you visited last week.

7
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,922
Who told you to eavesdrop?

8
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:03,991
- 500 dollar bills... - You can go.

9
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:10,592
Where is she from?

10
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:12,402
An orphanage.

11
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:15,372
I think she ran away before she finished high school.

12
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:16,572
Something happened.

13
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,471
She's quite smart...

14
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,702
and the ladies only ask for her.

15
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:24,042
- Shall I get you bigger bills? - No.

16
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,581
Reserve her for me next week at the same time.

17
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:28,982
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,112
(Yang Oh Distribution)

19
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,161
I'm here to see Cho Yang Oh.

20
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,432
Cho Yang Oh?

21
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,161
Is he your dog?

22
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:07,312
Mr. Cho will see only the ladies.

23
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,921
Sun Woo, wait here until I call for you.

24
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,642
Jenny Jang.

25
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,812
What brings you to this shabby place?

26
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,582
You always impress me with that exceptional mind of yours.

27
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:47,282
I admit you have a knack for grasping opportunities.

28
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,421
So give me that video.

29
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:56,661
How did you know?

30
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,462
Yungcheon Ocean,

31
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,772
a yacht, drugs,

32
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,171
and a woman.

33
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,902
Those four things have come together.

34
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:09,011
Wouldn't it be stranger if you weren't involved?

35
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,112
I knew it.

36
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,212
I knew you'd come to me before I called you.

37
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:17,051
Gosh, Mayor Do has gotten himself in quite a pickle.

38
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,551
Who is that? A newbie?

39
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,322
A bonus.

40
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,861
You can have her once you give me the video.

41
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,791
If you hand her over to Director Wi Ye Nam of Deo,

42
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,231
she'll probably pay you a generous ransom.

43
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:33,402
I'll pay you for the video,

44
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,731
and Director Wi will pay you the ransom.

45
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:39,041
Like killing two birds with one stone. What do you say?

46
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:40,772
No.

47
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:44,142
No matter how much you pay me, you won't get that video.

48
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,212
The land near Yungcheon shore all belongs to me.

49
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:48,652
But...

50
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,981
Do you think it makes sense that I cannot participate...

51
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,621
in Yungcheon's international city project?

52
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,752
What kind of country...

53
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:01,962
will receive investments from a gangster for their business?

54
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:05,132
Why don't you ask for a miracle instead?

55
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,731
Deo Country Club.

56
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:10,572
You're the major shareholder, right?

57
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,702
If Yang Oh Distribution takes over that place,

58
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,811
I believe we can become a legal and official company.

59
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:22,152
A miracle within a day. Bang!

60
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,051
Show her the papers.

61
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,561
That's a memorandum stating...

62
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,661
you'll hand over Deo Country Club's shares to me.

63
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,731
Sign it and take the video.

64
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,931
My lawyer drew that up thoroughly, so don't worry.

65
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,332
Where's the video?

66
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,551
Let me check.

67
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:03,121
Wait.

68
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,361
Mr. Cho, this is the original file.

69
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,262
Right. What if you stick that in there to check...

70
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,561
and suddenly delete it?

71
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,301
I know you have a copy, so don't put on a show.

72
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,231
Do you take me for a thug or what?

73
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,002
That's the original, so sign the paper.

74
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,212
Don't sign it.

75
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:26,642
It's a lie. He looks tense right now.

76
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,582
He keeps averting his eyes,

77
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:32,882
and his lips are parched.

78
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:35,721
He seems very stiff right now.

79
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,561
You have no other cards.

80
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,361
The video won't be in that USB drive.

81
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:47,532
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,171
How are you sure of that?

83
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,801
Maybe he's just a bit nervous.

84
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,241
What are you guys doing?

85
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,512
For 8 hours a day for the last 4 years,

86
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:59,782
and when I was a trainee, I practiced Go for 12 hours a day.

87
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:01,512
In order to anticipate the opponent's movements,

88
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,311
I need to read even the slightest signals.

89
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:05,212
Not just on the Go board,

90
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,851
but even from the opponent's energy.

91
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,692
What is this nonsense?

92
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,892
You checked for sure, right?

93
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,991
Yes, I did.

94
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,762
Bring me that girl.

95
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:22,332
Sign the paper first.

96
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,731
If I turn that on first and see the video,

97
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,902
I'll go straight to Director Wi.

98
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,811
Mr. Cho, you have such a short temper as always.

99
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,111
Say that again.

100
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,842
If you're wrong,

101
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,582
you're dead.

102
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,621
Tell me.

103
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,551
This isn't a fight worth risking.

104
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,991
If you're fooled into this scheme,

105
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,192
I'm certain you will lose.

106
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,351
(They've caught a king mackerel!)

107
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,022
You really are a thug.

108
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,892
(Today's a day to celebrate!)

109
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,801
What is that?

110
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:35,941
You punk.

111
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,012
Where is the video?

112
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:42,581
Sun Woo, I think you should come in now.

113
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,522
- What's he doing? - Wait.

114
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:54,821
Catch him!

115
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:55,992
Come here!

116
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,482
Explain yourself.

117
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:21,722
Where did you put it?

118
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,492
Tell me, you punk!

119
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,301
I installed the secret camera and recorded the scene properly.

120
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,571
I'm here.

121
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:45,982
Hey.

122
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:47,482
But someone suddenly came with a new batch of drugs.

123
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,951
Wait in here for a second.

124
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,512
I think he's the one who took it.

125
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,622
Wait.

126
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:59,061
Darn it!

127
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,532
You stupid fool!

128
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,102
How dare you try to fool me?

129
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,232
Do you have any idea how important this is?

130
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,102
What's the name of that drug delivery guy?

131
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,242
I can't tell you that.

132
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,402
Let's do business next time.

133
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:17,512
I promise I'll find that video.

134
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,341
So let's...

135
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,132
Mr. Cho.

136
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,671
Tell her.

137
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,272
I'm here.

138
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:52,882
His name is Lee Sang Hoon, age 35.

139
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:54,382
Wait in here for a second.

140
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:57,252
He's a surgeon.

141
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:01,482
Let's go.

142
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,051
Bring the girl.

143
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:13,961
You punk!

144
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,872
I've avoided the worst, thanks to you.

145
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,112
You'll receive proper compensation.

146
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:24,441
Help me.

147
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,681
My mom has disappeared.

148
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,782
I didn't mean you could make requests.

149
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,681
I have no intention of negotiating with you.

150
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:39,091
I'll ask your name next time, if I have a chance.

151
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,012
I checked his IP address from his email,

152
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,941
and I'm checking all the internet cafes nearby.

153
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:01,441
You must find him before Jenny Jang, at all costs.

154
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,252
If a doctor is delivering drugs as a part-time job,

155
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,022
he's probably a serious addict.

156
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,122
It will be difficult to obtain drugs from unfamiliar places,

157
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,522
so he'll probably find them from the hospital,

158
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:14,961
where he has easy access.

159
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,691
The video was sent in Cheongju.

160
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:19,602
It will be difficult to work part-time...

161
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,632
at a large general hospital within this area.

162
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:22,872
And it will be hard to obtain narcotic analgesics...

163
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,931
at a small hospital either.

164
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,201
Here. A mid-sized general hospital.

165
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,612
There's a high chance he'll be working here temporarily.

166
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:33,581
The place he just mentioned is Sejin General Hospital.

167
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,282
They have a vacancy for a surgeon currently.

168
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:38,882
The doctor went to Vietnam for a month for medical training,

169
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:41,352
and guess who was hired for that vacancy?

170
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,152
It's none other than Lee Sang Hoon.

171
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,362
- I'll go to Cheongju. - Take the girl with you.

172
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:47,461
The girl?

173
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:50,431
Test her to see if she'll be useful to us.

174
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,301
We need to go to Cheongju.

175
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,311
I'll explain on the way.

176
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,222
I'll drop you off at the terminal, so just run away.

177
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:17,291
No, my mom is involved in this.

178
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:19,461
I need to know what's going on.

179
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,061
You'll just be used and discarded.

180
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:26,461
And it's not like she'll help you find your mom.

181
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,201
I don't care.

182
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,482
Why don't you just threaten Jung Hyuk?

183
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,352
You see, your two billion dollar slush fund...

184
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:51,421
He'll change his mind if you say that he won't get any of it.

185
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,362
Marriage isn't a big deal.

186
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:56,632
He can certainly get married more than once.

187
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,262
If he can bring profits to Deo Group this way,

188
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,002
it can't get better than this.

189
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:06,002
Your brother has always been a useless outsider.

190
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,112
I guess he'll finally score big this time.

191
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,242
- Mom, please. - We can just kick her out later on.

192
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:15,411
Do you actually think Jenny will leave voluntarily?

193
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:18,112
There are many ways we can make her leave.

194
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:23,122
Some leave because they can't stand their families...

195
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,061
or because everything feels futile.

196
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:29,091
And some leave because they've done their time in this world.

197
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,362
If you don't think you can put up with her throughout that process,

198
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,472
why don't you take care of the thing with Mayor Do...

199
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:39,402
and bring me the contract?

200
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,872
The wedding will begin in 40 minutes.

201
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,411
My, you're so adorable.

202
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,122
My bride looks so stunning.

203
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,171
Thank you for marrying me, Do Young.

204
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,841
(Sejin General Hospital)

205
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,772
I've clearly warned you, and I even gave you a chance to run away.

206
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,242
I'll take responsibility for my own decision, so don't worry.

207
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,352
- Hi. - Hello, Doctor.

208
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:55,282
Dr. Lee Sang Hoon?

209
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,352
Yes. Do I know you?

210
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:10,661
- Who are you guys? - You'll have to come with us.

211
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,931
You know the reason, right?

212
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:15,801
You're not one of the guys I met through Yang Oh Distribution.

213
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:17,732
You're not cops either.

214
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:20,701
Did Mayor Do send you?

215
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,472
You'll find out later.

216
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,311
How are you going to take me?

217
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,742
In front of all these people in broad daylight.

218
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,512
Are you going to abduct me or something?

219
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,882
I won't even budge.

220
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,892
Even though the police are here?

221
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:42,992
What about it?

222
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,532
I called and told them to come and get this drug addict.

223
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,671
You'll be disqualified as a doctor if you get arrested,

224
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,372
and you'll end up in jail.

225
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,541
You don't have time to strike a deal with us.

226
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:03,952
Let's get you out of here first. Follow me.

227
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:06,051
We don't work for Mayor Do, so don't worry.

228
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:07,952
Hurry.

229
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:32,512
How did it go?

230
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,581
Still?

231
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:38,651
We're tailing Jenny Jang, so we'll find out something.

232
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,752
Jung Hyuk, you're back.

233
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,662
You've been coming home straight from school lately.

234
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:29,532
You must be hungry. Let's...

235
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:32,462
I have a favor to ask.

236
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,172
Sit here, Do Young.

237
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,942
Someone asked me to do this for you.

238
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,732
We've finally become a family after 20 years.

239
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,432
Let me give you a hug, my dear daughter-in-law.

240
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,272
No.

241
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:56,212
We met each other for the first time way before that.

242
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:03,192
Do Young, here.

243
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:06,662
(Cheonho Express)

244
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,101
I hope your father welcomes Do Young...

245
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:20,041
even if he won't approve of me.

246
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:21,541
What are you talking about?

247
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,841
It won't make any difference if he doesn't approve of you.

248
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,811
I'll continue to live away from my family and cut all ties with them.

249
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,412
You should have some too.

250
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:33,522
It's all right. You and Do Young can have more.

251
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,422
Here.

252
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:45,932
Here.

253
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:20,162
What's happening?

254
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,571
(Cheonho Express)

255
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,502
What happened?

256
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:04,712
- Gosh. - No...

257
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:06,742
Are you all right?

258
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:09,282
(Cheonho Express)

259
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:11,212
No...

260
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:15,621
Help me. Help me.

261
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:19,222
Someone... Please...

262
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:21,492
Help me.

263
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:28,432
Help me. Help me.

264
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,801
Help me.

265
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,111
Dad.

266
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:01,032
Please help.

267
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,101
My child.

268
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,371
Take her to safety.

269
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,141
Please.

270
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:14,381
Please help...

271
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:16,351
my child.

272
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,242
Please help us!

273
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:22,982
Help us! Doctor, help!

274
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,182
Both their waters broke. It's an emergency.

275
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:29,952
I feel like I'm dying.

276
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:32,091
She's fine. Did you call the hospitals?

277
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:33,722
One hospital can operate,

278
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,192
but there's only one OR.

279
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:38,532
Their OBGYN doctor can only handle one.

280
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,702
- Send her first. - Okay.

281
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:47,871
Goodness. Help me.

282
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,012
Can someone help?

283
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:53,212
It hurts so much.

284
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:58,611
Oh, dear...

285
00:25:58,611 --> 00:25:59,682
Excuse me.

286
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:02,782
Who are you?

287
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:07,591
Hey, I found her. Call the chairman!

288
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:08,621
Yes, sir.

289
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:15,061
You must be Deo Corporation's Chairman Wi's daughter-in-law.

290
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:17,772
The chairman's urgently looking for you.

291
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:20,371
He lost his son,

292
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:23,412
but I'm so relieved that you're safe.

293
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:27,682
Doctor.

294
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:30,412
She's Deo Corporation's heir's wife.

295
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:32,611
Please give her the best care.

296
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:46,162
Wait. Send this patient first.

297
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:47,502
What?

298
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,202
Hurry up.

299
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:52,702
Come on.

300
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:14,391
Doctor! Her pulse is dropping!

301
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:18,662
Mom. Mom.

302
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,801
- Prepare for CPR. - Mom.

303
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,532
Mom.

304
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,172
Get some epinephrine and call the OBGYN.

305
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:28,571
Mom.

306
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,442
Mom, wake up.

307
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,141
Mom. Get up.

308
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:36,012
Wake up, Mom.

309
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:38,851
Mom. Get up.

310
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,182
Mom.

311
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:52,291
Let's stop.

(Secret Boutique)

313
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:59,561
Keep it safe, Chairwoman Kim.

314
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,801
Until you return to your original place.

315
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,232
You failed to solve Mayor Do's problem.

316
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:05,631
We'll join forces.

317
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:07,672
Sort it out fast.

318
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:08,901
How long do you need?

319
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:09,912
Two days.

320
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:11,641
Bring my mom to me by then.

321
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:14,111
Where's the doctor who has the video?

322
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:18,111
It'll become a problem for us eventually.

323
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,252
Yoon Sun Woo? You're under arrest for murder.
