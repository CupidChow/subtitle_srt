00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,144
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,264
- Hello, you made it. - Thank you.

3
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,524
- Thanks for coming. - Hello.

4
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:00,655
Hello. You made it.

5
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:16,145
Director.

6
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:18,944
Jenny Jang's out.

7
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,414
After just one day?

8
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:24,584
They'll investigate but without detaining her.

9
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,925
I think she'll attend as planned.

10
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:41,064
The party's VIP gathering is three hours away.

11
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,304
I'd like to bathe first.

12
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,945
Rumors spread that the party's for people in...

13
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:56,744
Yungcheon's international city project.

14
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:59,554
Everyone will try to get involved.

15
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:03,524
It's not bad if the pie grows. Anything else?

16
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:05,695
How many times must I tell you?

17
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,765
There will be no divorce!

18
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,395
General Kim's wife...

19
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:13,494
left the ministry mansion and went to a hotel.

20
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:14,705
Colonel Park!

21
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,105
There's a military event for married couples...

22
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,975
and the general seems perplexed.

23
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:30,744
Find her right now. Let's get them divorced.

24
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:39,395
You...

25
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:40,725
You...

26
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,165
Don't call it in!

27
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,334
Do you want people to see this?

28
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:57,004
Jenny Jang. Call Jenny Jang.

29
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,945
I found them.

30
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,985
They're at the Heritage Hotel.

31
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:07,355
Don't come for me later. I won't be back tonight.

32
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,395
Sun Woo.

33
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,534
Without your help, I couldn't have come this far.

34
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,265
You're the only one...

35
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:26,205
who can help me through this.

36
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,254
The bleeding stopped, and I'm done with first-aid.

37
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:47,894
I have the papers.

38
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:49,894
What papers?

39
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,434
I'm still in law school. Mr. Yoon will explain.

40
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:57,905
It's a 256-page divorce agreement.

41
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,535
Will an hour be enough?

42
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:05,415
I'm the one who got stabbed.

43
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,374
Why would I divorce you?

44
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,345
All this time,

45
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,814
you've hit your wife numerous times.

46
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:15,025
If you continue with this nonsense,

47
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,585
I'll send all of you away and call the police.

48
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,194
I'll make sure the law makes that woman...

49
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,725
pay for attempted murder.

50
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,665
Go ahead.

51
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:28,405
- What? - Call the police.

52
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,105
A lieutenant general of the army who leads 50,000 soldiers...

53
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:33,035
has been stabbed by his wife.

54
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,204
And she's also a colonel, who's under your command.

55
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:38,244
If you can't even control your own wife,

56
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,874
how can you lead thousands of soldiers?

57
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:44,115
People will devour your story,

58
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:45,215
laugh at it,

59
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:48,225
and treat it as mere gossip to entertain their dull lives.

60
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,824
Sign it.

61
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,324
Or...

62
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,025
I'll call the police.

63
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,345
They're ready for you.

64
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,235
Hello.

65
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:08,365
This is Mayor Do Jun Sub of Yungcheon.

66
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,035
This is Chairwoman Kim Yeo Ok of Deo Group.

67
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:14,644
Hello, Chairwoman Kim. I've heard a lot about you.

68
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,744
Deo Group is prepared to fully contribute...

69
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,244
for the future of Yungcheon.

70
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,314
I look forward to working with you.

71
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,285
Thank you, ma'am.

72
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:26,715
Let's go this way.

73
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,585
You and I should have a talk in private later.

74
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:31,795
Let's do that.

75
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,454
This is Minister Kim Ik Tae...

76
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,925
of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

77
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,324
Ma'am, this way please.

78
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,934
This is Mr. Park Young Ho of the Board of Audit and Inspection.

79
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:42,934
- It's nice to meet you. - He'll oversee Yungcheon's...

80
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,204
- Free Economic Zone... - Jenny Jang has Deo on her back.

81
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,235
I heard she already agreed with the mayor...

82
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:48,804
to become a partner for the international city development.

83
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,475
Who on earth is that woman, Jenny Jang?

84
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,175
I heard rumors she used to be an attorney.

85
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,884
No way. I heard she grew up at an orphanage...

86
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,754
and she only graduated from high school.

87
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:01,855
I also heard her assets amount to 100 million dollars.

88
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,564
You want to do something this fun all alone?

89
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:22,675
I'm such a fortunate person.

90
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:26,574
Recognizing your worth and taking you in 20 years ago...

91
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,285
was the best choice of my life.

92
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,785
You've already done much more than paying back your debt.

93
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,324
The deal you struck this time...

94
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,954
is the biggest present you can give to Deo Group.

95
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:44,764
I'm more fortunate...

96
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,494
to be able to work for you.

97
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:50,934
I guess Ye Nam has been...

98
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,634
bothering you a lot lately.

99
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,415
It's all because she's a greedy and foolish girl.

100
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:11,595
I should be going now.

101
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:15,394
Please excuse me,

102
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,264
Ms. Wi.

103
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:32,044
Why is she addressing you like that when you're friends?

104
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:35,445
Who said we're friends? We were different from birth.

105
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:36,985
Mom.

106
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,784
If you become too close with a worker at our home,

107
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,685
she'll only find out your weakness.

108
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,524
Are you that afraid of Jenny Jang?

109
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:47,894
Why would I be afraid?

110
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:51,195
Then why do you keep calling the prosecution to hinder her?

111
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:54,095
She keeps acting up, without knowing her place.

112
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:56,904
It's all because you've been too generous to her, and she thinks...

113
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,034
Let her be mistaken all she wants.

114
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:03,105
You must learn how to control people without using a penny.

115
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:05,815
If reckless people like you keep trying to take them down,

116
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,674
you'll miss something very important.

117
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:24,065
You know, when you address me,

118
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,565
it doesn't feel sincere at all.

119
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,904
It feels as if you're mocking me.

120
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:37,305
Address me again. Politely.

121
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:42,784
Ms. Wi.

122
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:49,555
If I sleep with that man, what do you think will happen?

123
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:50,955
What?

124
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,065
I will...

125
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,774
become your sister-in-law.

126
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:11,945
Ms... Wi?

127
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:16,315
Does that sound more sincere to you?

128
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:26,955
I was just talking about... You're here.

129
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,164
Do you know Jenny Jang? Say hello.

130
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,254
Have a seat.

131
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:57,225
I have something to say before breakfast.

132
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,435
I will appoint a holding company that has the most shares...

133
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:11,335
invested in Yungcheon's international city project.

134
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,504
And I will support that company in full.

135
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,534
Mom.

136
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,874
Let's talk about the family affair after sending Jenny out.

137
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,014
Deo Hotel, which Jung Hyuk oversees...

138
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,945
will partner up with Jenny Jang...

139
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:24,685
and be chosen as the developer of...

140
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,185
Yungcheon's international city project.

141
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:29,985
Jung Hyuk and Jenny, there isn't anything...

142
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,254
I need to help out with your wedding, right?

143
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:33,294
Wedding?

144
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,624
Jung Hyuk, when did you and Do Young...

145
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:39,365
Deo Construction will win the construction work.

146
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,805
A beauty and fashion complex, stem cell institute,

147
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:43,705
plastic surgery center, general hospital,

148
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:47,075
and various infrastructures will be built from phase 1 to 5,

149
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:49,544
over a period of 10 years.

150
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,914
The city hasn't made an official announcement yet.

151
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:55,085
Deo Cosmetics still has a chance, Mom.

152
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,644
Chairwoman Kim, breakfast is ready.

153
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,615
Let's eat.

154
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:05,455
Chairwoman Kim, I'll join you for breakfast next time.

155
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,695
Why? You should stay.

156
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:11,465
I need to visit the prosecution this morning.

157
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,294
Thanks to someone in here.

158
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,805
Mom makes friends with enemies as long as there's money involved.

159
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:26,744
But what's wrong with you?

160
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,414
You'll marry her?

161
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:31,445
You've never dated with anyone, but you'll marry Jenny Jang?

162
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:34,254
Do you really want to go that far just to beat me?

163
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:35,355
Ye Nam.

164
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:37,825
She's the person I chose.

165
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,195
Don't get smart with me.

166
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:44,494
You always had the worst taste since we were kids!

167
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,095
Why do you think you'll become the owner of Deo?

168
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,305
Why do you think that way?

169
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:52,205
Jung Hyuk and I are also Mom's children.

170
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,874
You should be ashamed of yourself and act wisely.

171
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,715
Do you think working for a servant who you used to order around...

172
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:00,975
makes any sense?

173
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,215
Do you think this is the Joseon Dynasty era or what?

174
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,455
I'm going to make Jenny Jang my person.

175
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,154
To me, she seems like an admirable woman.

176
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,924
Unbelievable.

177
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:14,924
You have all lost your minds.

178
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,825
Trying to flatter a mere servant to be chosen.

179
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,664
You'll thank me one day...

180
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:24,865
for getting rid of Jenny Jang.

181
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,144
Oh, my. It's been a long time.

182
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:40,284
I'm finally treating you to a meal.

183
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:43,355
Here. You should have a drink too.

184
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,555
Since this will be your last visit here.

185
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,095
The case will be closed without indictment.

186
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:51,624
Thanks to you,

187
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,365
I've returned to the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

188
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,634
I heard you were summoned several times.

189
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:59,235
It's nice to be able to see you again like this.

190
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,174
Gosh, how time flies by.

191
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:06,174
I'll introduce another prospective wife for your son this time.

192
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,985
My wife is very fond of our elder son's wife.

193
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:11,445
She says they have the exact same taste in everything.

194
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,585
Your wife is such a wonderful person.

195
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,654
- Yes, she certainly is. - Is she the woman...

196
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,524
who got rid of the senior prosecutor and the one in charge of warrants?

197
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,494
"Owner of J Boutique"?

198
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,504
She just owns a clothing shop,

199
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,004
so how is that even possible?

200
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,174
J Boutique is...

201
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,374
a secret hangout of all the power brokers.

202
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,555
She sells clothes and accessories while acting...

203
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:47,685
as a personal assistant for financiers' wives during the day,

204
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,485
but the real deal is something else.

205
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,294
People call her the night manager.

206
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,794
About Ms. Jang of Way Group...

207
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:57,494
Since this is her third wedding,

208
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:59,335
we're thinking of using some gold, her favorite color.

209
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:03,004
Wedding is all about innocence whether it's the 3rd or 4th time.

210
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:05,705
Purity and reverence.

211
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,945
- White should be the focus. - Understood, ma'am.

212
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,874
Her business also acts as a boutique law firm...

213
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,414
that specializes in specific areas.

214
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:17,115
She looks after cases that can't be handled...

215
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,185
by other law firms because they must be kept strictly confidential.

216
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,784
She knows everything about these families,

217
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,725
from how many spoons they have to what the husbands are up to.

218
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:24,585
That's why she has so much power.

219
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,055
She sponsors other companies through her boutique,

220
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,524
and she's well connected to powerful politicians as well.

221
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,465
General Kim Jin Seok has signed the divorce papers.

222
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,205
The application will be filed as soon as his tenure ends,

223
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,805
and we have his promise that he won't lay a finger on her.

224
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:43,105
Well done.

225
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:47,414
Did everything go well on your end?

226
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,985
The wedding will take place in two weeks as planned.

227
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:54,514
I'll become a member of the Deo family...

228
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,424
and get my hands on their sources of funds.

229
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:01,254
I want you to be happy.

230
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,825
But marrying into that family is...

231
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,294
Sun Woo.

232
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:08,294
I'm...

233
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:13,435
happier than I've ever been in my entire life.

234
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:34,024
I heard the gukbap here is very good.

235
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,865
Apparently, everyone at the City Hall knows about this place.

236
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,694
What brings you here?

237
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,305
I invited you over for a meal, but you never responded,

238
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,535
so I came unannounced.

239
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,745
If this is regarding the international city project,

240
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,374
I've told you I have nothing to say to you.

241
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:54,944
Jenny Jang must've earned your complete trust.

242
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:57,914
Why don't we eat together since I'm already here anyway?

243
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,585
You keep declining my invitation,

244
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,224
so I brought my family's personal chef with me today.

245
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,505
I'll bring out the food, sir.

246
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,065
This is how I earn people's trust.

247
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,835
I'm sure Jenny Jang can offer you this much as well.

248
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,434
However, she couldn't have...

249
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,474
come into possession of that kind of money without Deo Group.

250
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:58,845
My family took her in as my live-in maid when she was 18.

251
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,515
I understand that times have changed,

252
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,414
but a maid coveting the master bedroom?

253
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:05,714
That's mutiny.

254
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:07,654
She'll be dragged out and stoned to death.

255
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,484
Jenny Jang is a paper card,

256
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,654
which will be ripped to pieces and discarded once she is used up.

257
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:18,694
I am your platinum gold card, Mr. Mayor.

258
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:26,474
All right.

259
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,575
This looks great,

260
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:32,115
but I find it too repulsive to be eaten.

261
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:34,214
I should get going.

262
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,845
This isn't...

263
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,115
the only thing I can do to earn your trust.

264
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:41,714
I'd like to invite you to a birthday party tomorrow.

265
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,355
It's your birthday.

266
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,835
How about a birthday meal on the ocean overlooking the site,

267
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,664
where the international city will be built?

268
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:26,234
That mudflat over there will be turned into land,

269
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,495
where a new city will be built.

270
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:33,474
I, Do Jun Sub, will make sure it happens.

271
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:34,775
In Yungcheon...

272
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,944
No, I will be sure to leave my mark...

273
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:42,184
in the history of urban development in Korea.

274
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:45,454
- Yes, of course! - Nice!

275
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:48,315
Hey, Ju Ho.

276
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:53,894
You punk, what's with that reaction?

277
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:57,424
You're a member of the Urban Planning Committee.

278
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:00,295
Don't you see that land? Are you not impressed at all?

279
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,964
We don't have enough time to carry out a full assessment.

280
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:08,005
If you push ahead with it, the hasty execution...

281
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,785
Let go. Let go, please.

282
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:19,154
Hey, don't act like you're the only one with integrity, okay?

283
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:21,484
Take him inside.

284
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,255
Hey, let go. I said, let go.

285
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,055
That jerk can say such a thing because he has no family to support.

286
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,724
When you have a whole family to support,

287
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,734
you have no choice but to dirty your hands.

288
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:36,765
Become a mayor and see if you can still make such a snobby remark.

289
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:39,605
Let go! Let go. Darn it.

290
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:51,015
(Amateur Go Championship, Finals)

291
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:17,345
In my head, I'm going through the countless matches I've had.

292
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:22,174
Let him benefit from this move and hope for a better chance?

293
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,045
But he's a tiger.

294
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:28,414
If I turn around, he'll eat me alive.

295
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,305
I'm cornered.

296
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:47,075
Then...

297
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,704
I must challenge him head-on.

298
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,154
When you can't run away from a tiger,

299
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:06,055
you have to jump on its back.

300
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:28,275
- Okay, 1, 2. - Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4!

301
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,914
- Drink up - Drink up

302
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:32,184
- Keep on drinking - Keep on drinking

303
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:34,815
- Drink up - Drink up

304
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,224
- Have another glass. - Have another glass!

305
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:38,755
- Drink up - Drink up

306
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:43,724
We all came out at this late hour...

307
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,495
- because of you. - Because of you.

308
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:48,194
- Why didn't you end it earlier? - That's what I'm saying!

309
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,105
Let's drink. Drink up, girls. Order whatever you want.

310
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:54,005
The cook here can't go home today.

311
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,904
- Nice! - I'll order.

312
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,245
- Excuse me! - I'll order everything on the menu.

313
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,414
- Be quiet. I'll order. - I want tangsuyuk.

314
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:23,535
You're beautiful.

315
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,934
Lee Hyun Ji.

316
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,275
You're the winner.

317
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:34,474
You won.

318
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:43,285
Girls, how much did you earn in cash prizes this year alone?

319
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,355
I'm sure Hyun Ji has earned a lot more than you girls have.

320
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,595
She's still an amateur though.

321
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:52,124
I know she won, but she can't be that excited about it.

322
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:55,835
Had I not been able to debut as a pro, I would've quit a long ago.

323
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:59,174
Me too. She'll be an amateur go player...

324
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,974
for the rest of her life.

325
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:03,245
She'll never get into the pro league. Never, ever.

326
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,775
Gosh, the four of us...

327
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:08,045
Ever since she was seven, Hyun Ji...

328
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,745
was the best go player, and when she was 19,

329
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:14,384
she lost once in the professional test.

330
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:17,855
Have you forgotten the days when she shined so bright?

331
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,255
Why are you talking about the past?

332
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,025
They turned professional not long ago...

333
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:25,194
and they're showing off already.

334
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:26,464
Let it go.

335
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:28,765
Your voice is the loudest. You're the showoff now.

336
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:32,505
Do you two want to play against Hyun Ji?

337
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,835
An amateur versus the professionals.

338
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:37,474
Stop it. That's enough. Stop.

339
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,714
Look at your faces.

340
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,245
What is it?

341
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:47,755
Do you think an amateur can't enter a competition with pros?

342
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,055
That's why I quit playing go.

343
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:53,525
- So I didn't have to see this. - I have to go.

344
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:55,624
You have fun without me.

345
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,865
- Hey. Where are you going? - Lee Hyun Ji!

346
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:00,434
- Lee Hyun Ji. - Hey! Hyun Ji!

347
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,634
You said you'd pay.

348
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,505
(Nam's Noodles)

349
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,565
You can't just leave.

350
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,075
Hey.

351
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,845
If it upsets you that much,

352
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,575
play go again.

353
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:17,944
- What? - The snake that can't be a dragon.

354
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:20,984
You're using me as an excuse to vent.

355
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,585
Am I wrong?

356
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,394
If you don't want to waste the 12 years you trained,

357
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,124
go back to playing.

358
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,124
Whether you're an amateur or not,

359
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,124
keep playing and extending your record.

360
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:37,305
It's not fair. They aren't that much better than us.

361
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,704
Lee Hyun Ji!

362
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:53,785
The snake that can't be a dragon.

363
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:56,724
An amateur go player.

364
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,595
That's me.

365
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,295
But...

366
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,894
I haven't lost yet.

367
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,904
My battle...

368
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:14,275
isn't over yet.

369
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,545
(Soy milk)

370
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,075
I thought you got something.

371
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,845
I told you not to drink my soy milk!

372
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,884
- Get out. Get lost. - My gosh.

373
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,214
What's wrong with her?

374
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,755
Darn it.

375
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:04,555
We're leaving.

376
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,595
- Darn her. - What's her problem?

377
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:11,224
Why do you keep coming like you live here?

378
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:12,394
I told you not to come.

379
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:15,035
Let's be honest. It's your mom's home.

380
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:17,434
And she said we can come whenever we want.

381
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,105
This is my home.

382
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:22,575
I earned the money and I paid the deposit.

383
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,075
Don't you dare come here again.

384
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:25,144
My gosh.

385
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:27,974
Hyun Ji, I saved one for you.

386
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,785
I save food for my woman.

387
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,454
Are you stupid?

388
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:36,855
Hey.

389
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:39,855
Why are you all out here?

390
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:42,154
We got kicked out.

391
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:49,035
Take turns in visiting. Don't come in huge groups.

392
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:50,934
We're off to work.

393
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:53,505
Come whenever you want.

394
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:55,704
Even better if you quit first.

395
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:56,944
See you.

396
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:00,914
You didn't tell us not to come anymore.

397
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,345
You're the best.

398
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:08,154
Come in. He needs to sleep.

399
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,555
Wait.

400
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:15,224
- Let's wait until after the fight. - Okay.

401
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:20,734
My gosh.

402
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,835
Is this a haven for prostitutes?

403
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:29,174
Why do you care so much?

404
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:32,745
They want to do something else but can't work during the day.

405
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:35,515
They can't look people in the eye in the daylight...

406
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,285
in case people find out their identities.

407
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:40,684
It's nice to cheer them up and help them find work.

408
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:42,414
I know but...

409
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,924
are you the only officer?

410
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,894
Do you think they'll quit because of what you do for them?

411
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,624
You play go.

412
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,194
You say you fight on your own.

413
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,765
To me, this is my own fight.

414
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,634
You never give in.

415
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,124
Did you see Hye Ra?

416
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:19,954
She said she'd see me today before she went home.

417
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:20,995
Hye Ra?

418
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,894
Oh, that young girl?

419
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:25,724
The one who wouldn't say her name or age?

420
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,765
My gosh.

421
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,934
As if you go by your real name.

422
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:32,805
Don't ask.

423
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:34,775
Do you believe that she's going home?

424
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,845
She left with a group saying she had a part-time job.

425
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,245
Where to?

426
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:45,085
What did she say? Something about taking a yacht.

427
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,555
It must be a day job.

428
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,484
She doesn't belong to a bar.

429
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:50,325
What's this?

430
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:54,255
Hey. Hyun Ji won today. Did you know?

431
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:58,164
I knew.

432
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,495
What kind of a mom are you?

433
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,734
If my son comes fifth in a jump rope contest,

434
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:06,275
my heart beats fast and I go into a frenzy.

435
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:10,745
What do you think she thought while playing in an amateur tournament?

436
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:15,714
I'd rather she did something else.

437
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:20,085
It's not that easy. It's what she did all her life.

438
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,855
That's why I can't quit what I do.

439
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,095
You said you're so old no one asks for you.

440
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:27,954
Shall I find you a job?

441
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,394
Ms. Park. How can I do such a thing?

442
00:31:31,394 --> 00:31:33,865
I can't grill ham in a supermarket.

443
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:37,005
My gosh. Think of Ye Jun.

444
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:39,634
Whatever. Go and see your daughter.

445
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,835
What if she's crying out of frustration?

446
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:55,515
(Award, Lee Hyun Ji)

447
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:57,825
(Center Cutback Skill)

448
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:09,365
Yes. The 145th stone.

449
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:12,765
This was the crucial point.

450
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:46,904
Darn it.

451
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:51,144
Hey. Hey, is anyone there?

452
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:58,484
How old is she?

453
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:02,184
She's too young. Are you trying to ruin me?

454
00:33:02,184 --> 00:33:03,624
I apologize.

455
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,055
Come on out.

456
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,255
Wait.
