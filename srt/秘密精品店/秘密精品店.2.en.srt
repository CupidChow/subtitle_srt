1
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:20,622
Hey. Wake up and leave.

2
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,833
Hey.

3
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,093
Darn it.

4
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:51,362
Goodness.

5
00:00:57,862 --> 00:00:58,862
Mayor Do.

6
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:03,472
Is something wrong?

7
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:04,942
Ju Ho.

8
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,672
No... Never mind.

9
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,683
I was just getting some fresh air.

10
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,953
You can go. Go get some rest.

11
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,052
Get some rest.

12
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:47,642
- Yes, Mayor Do. - Yes, Jenny Jang. I...

13
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:54,082
What is it, Mayor Do?

14
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:58,323
No... Never mind. I'll call back later.

15
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,912
Did you enjoy your party?

16
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,113
Someone has died.

17
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:20,042
The girl you sent has died from a drug overdose.

18
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,352
Hello?

19
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,722
The girl lying in my bed is dead!

20
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:28,292
Do something!

21
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,553
Mayor Do.

22
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,722
Did you call Jenny Jang?

23
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,363
Why is that...

24
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,762
Why is that important right now?

25
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,132
Listen to me carefully.

26
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,132
You must not call Jenny Jang.

27
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:47,042
She rose to that position using people's weaknesses.

28
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,072
If Jenny Jang finds out,

29
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,643
you won't be able to escape from her for your entire life.

30
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,782
Even if the international city project is successful...

31
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,813
and you become the president,

32
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:00,583
you'll always be a puppet in Jenny Jang's hands.

33
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,222
I'll take care of the dead girl.

34
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,192
Trust me, and just wait right there.

35
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:19,403
Darn it.

36
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,322
Hey.

37
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:41,063
I'm sorry. An unexpected accident...

38
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:42,093
Mr. Hwang.

39
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:43,893
This is my chance.

40
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,132
I've finally received a chance.

41
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,942
I can put Mayor Do under my control now.

42
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,743
Instead of Jenny Jang and Deo Hotel,

43
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:58,412
this is the perfect chance for Deo Cosmetics to become...

44
00:03:58,412 --> 00:03:59,843
the developer of the international city project.

45
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,982
Call him and tell him to take care of it.

46
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,623
It's okay.

47
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:07,952
Tell him that I'll bring him in...

48
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,653
if he takes care of it without any trouble.

49
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:11,623
Then he'll do it.

50
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,433
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,322
I came to repair the boat.

52
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,923
I heard you have a leak.

53
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,022
Did Director Wi send you?

54
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:57,632
This won't take long.

55
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,043
General Kim eventually...

56
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,313
broke his promise and hit her again.

57
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,923
(Sun Woo)

58
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:00,822
What do you think you're doing?

59
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:03,163
Let me go now!

60
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:05,332
Do you know who I am, you punks?

61
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,262
How dare you do this to me?

62
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,632
Have you gone mad?

63
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,733
General Kim.

64
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:14,303
Who told you to break your promise?

65
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,813
Look here, Jenny Jang.

66
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,842
Your wife is in critical condition.

67
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:20,113
You must be mistaken.

68
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,353
I'm the one who requested your service.

69
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,752
I'm the one who asked you to take care of our problem secretly!

70
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:30,522
There's something important I forgot to tell you.

71
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:33,022
I choose my clients.

72
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,822
Both of you came to me,

73
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,363
and I chose your wife.

74
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:38,603
What?

75
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,303
I am indebted to your wife.

76
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,702
As you know,

77
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,973
until you got promoted to lieutenant general,

78
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,613
I didn't let your wife find out about your affair.

79
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,272
Look here.

80
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,142
Don't worry about any other secrets besides that.

81
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,642
I'll take them with me to the grave.

82
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:56,212
Hey!

83
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:57,983
What shall I do with him?

84
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,223
I'm afraid he's not understanding us.

85
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:01,683
What do you think?

86
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:03,793
Let him enjoy a nice view.

87
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:07,962
Let me go.

88
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,692
Let me go, you punks!

89
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,262
I said, let me go! Hey!

90
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,433
How could you do this to a general of this country?

91
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:28,683
What are you doing?

92
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,783
Take me down, you punks!

93
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,092
What do you think you're doing?

94
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,962
Take me down now!

95
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:42,763
Take me down!

96
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,403
If Jenny Jang finds out,

97
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,442
you won't be able to escape from her for your entire life.

98
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,242
Even if the international city project...

99
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:58,413
is successful and you become the president,

100
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:02,112
you'll always be a puppet in Jenny Jang's hands.

101
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,722
Mayor Do. Jenny Jang is here to see you.

102
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:12,622
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:14,893
Mayor Do has a prior appointment.

104
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,332
Yes, Chairwoman Kim.

105
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,972
I called to share some precious tea with you.

106
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:31,112
The first leaves were always picked and roasted in April.

107
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,712
But the monk who grew these tea leaves...

108
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,753
turned 100 this year.

109
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,383
I'm afraid...

110
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,423
he won't be able to make it past this winter.

111
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:43,592
Then...

112
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:46,893
these tea leaves will be the last.

113
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,862
So...

114
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:53,533
I was pondering whom I'd drink this precious tea with,

115
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,403
and I thought of you first.

116
00:09:58,173 --> 00:09:59,503
Have a sip.

117
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:13,082
I'm afraid we weren't meant to become family.

118
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:18,622
Thanks to you, Ye Nam has been able to live a proper life,

119
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:20,822
and you've already done more than enough...

120
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,893
for Deo Group.

121
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,033
Those pathetic fools.

122
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,643
Accepting a wench like you whose past isn't even known...

123
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,313
as Deo Group's daughter-in-law...

124
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:39,612
is something I'll regret deeply even after I die.

125
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,313
But still,

126
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,813
Deo's bloodline was on the verge of being broken,

127
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:46,683
but I was the one who carried it on.

128
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,653
That idiot.

129
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:52,663
I can't believe he married that wicked woman.

130
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:56,462
Do you know how terrified Chang Soo was...

131
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,602
on his way to meet you?

132
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,403
That is why that accident happened.

133
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:04,633
You...

134
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:09,572
killed Chang Soo.

135
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,643
He should've survived that accident, not you.

136
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:16,383
You should've died instead of Chang Soo!

137
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:20,222
Had he never gotten himself involved with a woman like you,

138
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:23,293
he would've never died such a tragic death!

139
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:24,692
Get out!

140
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,563
Take all your children, who take after you,

141
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,893
and get out of my house!

142
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:51,513
You wench!

143
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:55,183
How dare you lock me up?

144
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,293
Open this! Let me out!

145
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,492
Open this door!

146
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,102
Open up! Let me out!

147
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:15,043
- Open this door! - You're the errand girl...

148
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:16,942
from the bathhouse.

149
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:21,543
I'm the one who picked you and brought you to this house.

150
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:25,923
Don't help him.

151
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,122
Do you want to go back...

152
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,263
to the bathhouse?

153
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,962
Go back to eating and sleeping in that damp place,

154
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:42,273
running mindless errands for those ladies?

155
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,903
Do you really want to return to that life?

156
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:48,872
And why did you lock the door?

157
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,643
Were you that annoyed by that old man's scolding?

158
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:02,122
You just got here,

159
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,553
and I am the lady of the house.

160
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:09,263
Which one of us do you think people will believe more?

161
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,242
Don't let anything tie you down now.

162
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:21,742
Be free.

163
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:27,183
Letting you go was not an easy decision.

164
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:34,553
You'll regret it.

165
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:36,653
I've...

166
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,962
never lost to anyone in my entire life, ma'am.

167
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:44,362
Jenny.

168
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,462
Excuse me, you can run another article about me, right?

169
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:25,102
Please announce to everyone that...

170
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:28,503
we're holding a five-day funeral for Mr. Chairman.

171
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:37,753
Mom.

172
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:39,523
Is she the girl?

173
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,053
She's a smart girl.

174
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:46,822
She'll be your hands and feet from now on.

175
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,492
What's your name?

176
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,633
I'm Wi Ye Nam.

177
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:57,803
Mom, is she mute?

178
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,742
I'm Jang Do Young.

179
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,163
Do Young!

180
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:33,942
I liked you much better when you were Do Young, not Jenny Jang.

181
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:44,952
You shouldn't underestimate Mayor Do.

182
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,183
He's greedy and fickle-minded.

183
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:50,322
You'll have a hard time handling him.

184
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,092
I know, right?

185
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:56,092
I would've loved to have you handle him for me and under me.

186
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,663
There was a time when you and I got along fine.

187
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,133
Why did you change?

188
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,972
One morning, I woke up and found out...

189
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:06,503
that you're no longer the Do Young I once knew.

190
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:08,702
Ye Nam.

191
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:14,313
People call that "maturing".

192
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:18,482
Or maybe you had the wrong idea about me to begin with.

193
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,153
Do Young.

194
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:23,293
That little...

195
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,893
Find out what Mayor Do was up to last week.

196
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,102
Especially Tuesday evening. Find out everything he did.

197
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:54,322
This isn't a crackdown. I'm just here to ask you something.

198
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,393
Open up. Hurry.

199
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,563
You know Hye Ra, right? She used to live with you girls.

200
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:06,662
Have you heard from her at all?

201
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:09,102
Hey, do you know where Hye Ra is?

202
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,773
We haven't seen her for a few days.

203
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,872
I heard she left for some part-time gig.

204
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,773
She said she was going to the beach to go sailing on a yacht.

205
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,513
Do you know where she went?

206
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:20,112
Yungcheon.

207
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,892
Gosh, stop! Eat it later.

208
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:40,463
Your mother told me to make sure that you leave the house...

209
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:41,803
with this untouched.

210
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:43,832
What's in the container?

211
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:46,402
Whether I eat it now or later, it's all the same once it's in the belly.

212
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,842
What are you doing?

213
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,072
(Victory)

214
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,842
I thought you were a foundling, but I guess...

215
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,553
she actually gave birth to you after all.

216
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,352
She's so cute.

217
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:02,152
I'll eat this later.

218
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,953
No. You already opened it, so just eat it now.

219
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,122
What is it?

220
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,362
- What are you talking about? - Ye Jun.

221
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:12,733
Are you going to be dressed like that?

222
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,533
You spend all this time getting dolled up...

223
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,443
and not even care about your own son.

224
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,142
Go on in. I'll help you get changed.

225
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,142
You didn't even wash up, did you?

226
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,582
Oh, my! I see the ocean. Hurry!

227
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,612
- My gosh! - Look at the ocean.

228
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:33,122
Look at that. It's the ocean! Oh, my goodness.

229
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,892
Hey! Walk slowly, Mi Jin.

230
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,622
- Watch your legs. - Hurry!

231
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,023
Ye Jun, you'll trip and fall. Slow down.

232
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:45,662
It's so cool.

233
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,733
It's flying so high.

234
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,872
- My gosh, he's good. - He is.

235
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,342
Hey!

236
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,412
I told you to pull the string.

237
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:02,283
- I did! - My gosh.

238
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:10,122
There. It's done.

239
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,122
Have fun and head home without me.

240
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,392
I have to stop by somewhere.

241
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:18,533
I knew it. You came here to take care of something.

242
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,563
- What do you have to do? - I have to look into something.

243
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,733
Bye. I'll pick up ingredients for bulgogi on my way home.

244
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,172
- Bye! - Have fun!

245
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:39,953
We've received reports for 3 drunk fights and 1 pickpocketing incident.

246
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,382
There was an incident where a couple fought but canceled the report.

247
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,723
That's all I remember.

248
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:45,822
Nothing related to prostitution.

249
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:06,513
She said she was going to the beach to go sailing on a yacht.

250
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:20,263
I heard you're looking for the yacht that left the dock last Tuesday.

251
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:22,592
Oh, hello.

252
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,432
I'm Lieutenant Park Ju Hyeon from Seonneung Patrol Division in Seoul.

253
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,703
I heard it was a big yacht.

254
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:32,572
It was this one, right?

255
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:34,543
May I take a look inside?

256
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,973
I'll bring a search warrant later.

257
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:44,713
Sure.

258
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:17,783
I'll have a look inside.

259
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:26,953
Fentanyl.

260
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,053
It's a drug.

261
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,642
Were you surprised?

262
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:28,912
I fixed the yacht and am testing it.

263
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,553
It won't take long.

264
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:38,753
Hyun Ji.

265
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:42,023
When will we go and eat clams?

266
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:45,132
You got bored already and want to eat?

267
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,533
Who do you take after?

268
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:51,572
Hey, Hyun Ji. We didn't take a family portrait.

269
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:52,743
Let's take one at the lighthouse.

270
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,572
I'll take one of you two. Stay there.

271
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,372
You're always drawing the line.

272
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,013
Stop and look this way.

273
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,922
My phone isn't working.

274
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:11,892
The signal blocker will be on.

275
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,822
We must...

276
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:16,862
test everything simultaneously.

277
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:23,973
Look at me. A bit to the left.

278
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:25,072
Move a bit.

279
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,473
Ready?

280
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,043
You look nice.

281
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:43,152
1, 2, 3.

282
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,263
One more.

283
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,332
1, 2, 3.

284
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:35,773
Mom.

285
00:25:50,993 --> 00:25:52,922
(Secret Boutique)

286
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:54,763
The officer's daughter went to a prosecutor.

287
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,063
There's a video.

288
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,563
Someone's blackmailing me with the dead girl's video.

289
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,432
How did it get that bad?

290
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:03,473
I must move forward before Jenny Jang does something.

291
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,072
I must find it.

292
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:08,273
The mayor won't have turned against us just for money.

293
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:10,872
All that depends on my wedding.

294
00:26:10,872 --> 00:26:13,342
We can let her go once her use is done.

295
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,842
A person can leave a home in many ways.

296
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,582
They leave for hatred of the family,

297
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:20,223
and when their life comes to an end.
