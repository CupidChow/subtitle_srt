1
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:06,406
Once Oh Tae Seok's eliminated,

2
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:08,775
I'll be next.

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,515
But that's not the battlefield.

4
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:16,785
Oh Tae Seok.

5
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:21,156
He's actually just an outer wall.

6
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:25,765
The real battlefield is deep inside.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,795
(No phones allowed)

8
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,335
Ms. Lee.

9
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:33,465
You must choose wisely.

10
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:35,505
Even if I topple the wall,

11
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,806
you will get the money to build it back up.

12
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:40,246
If the core, the axis inside doesn't fall,

13
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,615
this fight is never over.

14
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,855
One moment of bravado can ruin the rest of your life.

15
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,825
Make the right choice.

16
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:02,236
Your offer isn't profitable.

17
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,395
I refuse.

18
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,615
What shall I do?

19
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,686
I have the officer who's looking for the girl.

20
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:24,956
If you let her go,

21
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,555
she'll do anything to find the dead girl.

22
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,695
That will lead to Mayor Do and me.

23
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:35,165
Kill her.

24
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,406
Get rid of her, Tae Seok. Only then can I survive.

25
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,796
Lee Hyun Ji refused the offer.

26
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:11,835
If there's another opportunity,

27
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,405
I won't return then.

28
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:30,286
Get rid of her, Tae Seok. Only then can I survive.

29
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:18,965
(Park Ju Hyeon)

30
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,036
What happened?

31
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,106
What do you mean, Lee Hyun Ji refused?

32
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,405
She won't be persuaded easily.

33
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,305
I don't know what Jenny Jang has done,

34
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:01,706
but no matter how much we try to coax her with Oh Tae Seok,

35
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,375
if Lee Hyun Ji doesn't cooperate,

36
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:06,446
both of them will claim innocence and we'll gain nothing.

37
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:11,155
People are already saying Deo is caught in a family dispute.

38
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,286
I'm even embarrassed to go work these days.

39
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,125
Let's ask Chairwoman Kim for help.

40
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,195
No.

41
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,325
We must not tell Mom.

42
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:22,836
If we do that, the problem may be solved,

43
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,736
but we won't be able to return from the US.

44
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,236
We'll be banned from the Deo family for good.

45
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,935
Now is not the situation to choose.

46
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,976
Jenny Jang has been chosen as a witness for the trial.

47
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:34,245
She'll reveal everything in court.

48
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,875
The girl who died from drugs and Lee Hyun Ji's mom...

49
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,115
will be brought to the surface.

50
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,286
We can use our connections and stop her.

51
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:44,885
Ye Nam, don't you understand?

52
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,286
This will eventually be dragged to the end...

53
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,426
if you or Jenny Jang don't give up.

54
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,865
There's no way Do Young will let Mayor Do go down.

55
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,896
Then she'll just be dragged down with him.

56
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,505
She's just threatening me right now for fun.

57
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,406
Ye Nam, you're the one who started it first.

58
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,036
Jenny Jang will never stop.

59
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,476
Then what do you want me to do?

60
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,676
Are you telling me to give in to Jenny Jang?

61
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,346
Once the trial begins, Jenny Jang will testify.

62
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,315
It'll be too late then.

63
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:23,325
I told you to listen to me and go to the US.

64
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,865
How can you stop someone who is as desperate as her?

65
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,796
It's like you've put your wrist inside the handcuffs...

66
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,365
that have been put on Jenny Jang's wrist.

67
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:36,505
If you try to take down Jenny Jang, you'll go down too,

68
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,036
and if you try to live,

69
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,245
she will live as well.

70
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,916
Do you want me to give in to Do Young as well?

71
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,815
She's messing with Mayor Do.

72
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,786
The one gambling with the international city project...

73
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:52,015
is not me, but Jenny Jang.

74
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:55,156
She's using the Deo family's future to make fools out of us.

75
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:57,325
Will you just sit back and watch?

76
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,365
That golden egg you wished for so much...

77
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,796
is about to be taken from us!

78
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,765
Inviting a ticking bomb inside our home...

79
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:08,065
and expecting it to be peaceful does not make sense.

80
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:11,106
She came from cleaning a bathhouse...

81
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,875
all the way up to this position.

82
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,476
All I did was...

83
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,976
take her in and step all over her.

84
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,216
When stepped on,

85
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,015
most people fall down and just disappear.

86
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,926
But Jenny Jang became tougher...

87
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,955
and survived more powerfully.

88
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,125
How on earth can you handle someone like that?

89
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,226
Mom.

90
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,426
Still, you should've been on my side.

91
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:37,666
The international city project is not the problem.

92
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,365
Your daughter is about to go to prison.

93
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,106
The only thing that can save you...

94
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,606
is the person wearing those handcuffs with you.

95
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,805
Does it hurt your pride that much...

96
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,216
to ask Jenny Jang for help?

97
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,716
If you can't give in,

98
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,856
you will never beat her from now on.

99
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,885
Director Wi,

100
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,555
you must give in for now...

101
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,565
to think about what you can do after.

102
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:15,865
Chairwoman Kim.

103
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,406
I know how influential Ms. Jang is,

104
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,245
but Ye Nam is still your daughter.

105
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,815
She's a girl who acts on confidence and certainty.

106
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,385
I'd have to make several calls to stop Jenny Jang.

107
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,216
Why go through all that trouble?

108
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,055
Ye Nam giving in...

109
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,086
is the simple solution.

110
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,356
Both of them are running...

111
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:41,166
towards the end of a cliff right now.

112
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,065
One of them has to fall down in order for this to stop.

113
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,906
It's a fight of guts.

114
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:50,476
The one who gets afraid will lose.

115
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,476
But when it comes to guts,

116
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,745
she won't be able to win Jenny Jang.

117
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,356
(Wi Ye Nam)

118
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,065
- The receiver cannot be reached. - Darn it.

119
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:22,805
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail...

120
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,705
Did you say she didn't come home last night?

121
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,776
Yes.

122
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:38,656
(Do Jun Sub)

123
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,786
Yes. Hello, Ju Ho.

124
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,026
It's the first time you've called for me.

125
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,065
How did the meeting go?

126
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,866
Today was the seventh meeting of the Urban Planning Committee.

127
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,406
If you want to know about the international city project,

128
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,776
I'm afraid I won't be able to tell you much.

129
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,136
I know.

130
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,975
That you're leading the members who are opposed to the project.

131
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,345
You can keep opposing.

132
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,646
Since this isn't just about Yungcheon,

133
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,485
but the foundation of this country,

134
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,815
you should be cautious.

135
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,756
Mayor Do?

136
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:15,355
Ju Ho.

137
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:19,565
Out of all the congressmen working for Yungcheon,

138
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,835
you know that you and I are the original members, right?

139
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,435
I won't let go of this hand until my career in politics end...

140
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:29,205
No, until my life ends.

141
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,205
So...

142
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:32,705
you and I should go together.

143
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,345
Mayor Do, is something wrong?

144
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:44,055
My pride isn't important now, so I'll tell you everything.

145
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:48,926
Two women from the Deo family are toying with my life.

146
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,095
How could I just stay still?

147
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,666
I should at least show them I'm not their puppet.

148
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,396
What is this about?

149
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,396
Ju Ho.

150
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,636
You should stick to your beliefs.

151
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:03,276
I'll back you up and become a reliable partner.

152
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:07,705
Let's make this a win-win situation.

153
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,386
I have to visit the welfare center in Eunju-dong at 3pm, right?

154
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:17,756
Okay.

155
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,585
Ju Ho.

156
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:21,685
Let's go out together.

157
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,126
Okay?

158
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,685
What is it?

159
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,325
It's nothing.

160
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,256
He seemed familiar.

161
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,965
He's the intelligence bureau chief from the National Police Agency.

162
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:21,516
Ju Ho.

163
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:25,386
Let's make time soon and have a drink.

164
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,666
What are you doing?

165
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,506
How dare you block me? Move!

166
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,876
I'm sorry, Director Wi.

167
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,906
You must make plans with Ms. Jang first.

168
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:48,906
What?

169
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,555
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,195
So let's stop this.

171
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,065
I give up.

172
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,205
Once you back off,

173
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:18,506
no matter what Lee Hyun Ji claims, no one will listen.

174
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,475
She'll take the blame for everything,

175
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,205
- and things will... - No.

176
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,876
Lee Hyun Ji won't become the killer.

177
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,845
Then how will you take care of it?

178
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,445
Take Lee Hyun Ji out.

179
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:33,256
I'll tell her and Sun Woo to cooperate.

180
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,955
So come up with a way to take her out.

181
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,026
What?

182
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,595
And after she comes out,

183
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:41,965
she'll be with me.

184
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:43,595
That means...

185
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:48,205
I want you to leave her alone and never bother her again.

186
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:49,906
But it's my weakness,

187
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:53,176
one that's alive. Are you saying you'll threaten me...

188
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:55,276
for the rest of my life using her?

189
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,016
If you don't want to do it,

190
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:00,886
we can end everything here and now.

191
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,016
You'll desert Mayor Do...

192
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,786
and tell the truth with Lee Hyun Ji?

193
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,026
This isn't a simple case.

194
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,555
This is a scandal involving the international city project.

195
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:19,195
Even if Mayor Do gets ousted and a new mayor takes office,

196
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,866
the project will fall through.

197
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:24,435
Knock the table over and set it again all you want,

198
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,205
but you won't be able to fix the broken table!

199
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:28,506
Right, the project will go down the drain.

200
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,886
And Chairwoman Kim will abandon us.

201
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:36,886
She'll never forgive us.

202
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:39,886
You'll end up in jail,

203
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,955
and I'll hit rock bottom again.

204
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:48,325
Chairwoman Kim will lose both her daughter and her daughter-in-law.

205
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,335
She'll spend the rest of her life, lamenting that Deo,

206
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,636
which matters a lot more to her than her own children,

207
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,575
lost the golden opportunity to take a leap.

208
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,146
What a tragic ending...

209
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,516
for all of the three women involved in this.

210
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:08,116
Jang Do Young.

211
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,386
I've told you, Ye Nam.

212
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,256
The choice is yours.

213
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:23,565
She's been under a lot of stress because her family members...

214
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,595
got separated for personal reasons.

215
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:29,266
That, combined with genetic factors, led to delusional disorder.

216
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:33,445
She did go to the reed field and had contact with the doctor.

217
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,906
But I'm sure there was a misunderstanding.

218
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,546
I request that you start...

219
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,786
from scratch and collect statements and evidence again.

220
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,715
- Look, Mr. Yoon. - Just accept his request.

221
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,996
This is a psychiatrist's diagnosis on Ms. Lee Hyun Ji.

222
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,036
(Yungcheon Prosecutors' Office)

223
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,406
He's another suspect in the reed field murder.

224
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:12,376
Part of the reed field is used as a firing range.

225
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,945
Rumors about him shooting someone outside the authorized area...

226
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,616
spread through the bars in the vicinity,

227
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,355
and someone reported it to us.

228
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:21,886
If all goes well,

229
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,656
you'll just serve a few years for bodily injury by negligence.

230
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,565
- Take him to the room. - Yes, sir.

231
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,916
It seems like Ye Nam has finally backed off.

232
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,656
Using Lee Hyun Ji to threaten Director Wi...

233
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,126
was just too risky.

234
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,866
We won anyway.

235
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,996
What kind of deal did you strike with Lee Hyun Ji?

236
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,376
In an hour from now, you'll become a murder suspect.

237
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:18,376
And of course, I will get you out at all costs.

238
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,746
But it can only be done if you trust me.

239
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,055
Can you do it?

240
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,396
If you can, tell me what you want.

241
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,195
I don't want to be chased or have to hide anymore.

242
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:44,636
The woman in her 30s and the 10-year-old boy too.

243
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,006
And please find a good elementary school for Ye Jun.

244
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,575
Please protect...

245
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:54,046
the three of us.

246
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,685
Then I'll work for you and repay you for everything step by step.

247
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:04,225
(Ministry of Justice)

248
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,775
I'm impressed that you really trusted me.

249
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,685
Weren't you afraid that I might not get you out?

250
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:31,816
Weren't you worried that I might be tempted...

251
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,485
by the prosecutors' offer?

252
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,525
Had you not trusted me,

253
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,465
you would've tracked down the woman and her son...

254
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,066
to use them to threaten me.

255
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:47,666
I hid them just in case.

256
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,205
I made arrangements so that I'd be informed...

257
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,205
if you ever visited or took them.

258
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,945
You're really interesting.

259
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,245
But you didn't even look for them.

260
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,556
That's why I wasn't afraid at all.

261
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,556
I knew you trust me.

262
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,666
You'll definitely earn your keep.

263
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,596
Let's go.

264
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,576
(Share Transfer Agreement)

265
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,846
By signing this, you agree that 70 percent of your shares...

266
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,945
will be transferred to the foundation.

267
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,656
Chairwoman Kim wants it back by the end of the week,

268
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,086
with your signature.

269
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,816
She'll make me give this back?

270
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:43,556
She also told me to bring the flight tickets to the US.

271
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,396
What if I refuse to sign this?

272
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,935
If you don't sign it, your name will be removed...

273
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:55,106
from the board of directors for Deo Cosmetics and the foundation...

274
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:56,975
as well as for our eight subsidiaries.

275
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,676
She also said...

276
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,146
she will no longer consider you her daughter.

277
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:17,955
I have to say,

278
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,166
your mother is really something.

279
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,076
Still nothing from Do Young's house? Find something, please!

280
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,176
I heard Master Jung Hyuk doesn't come home...

281
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,235
every time there's a seminar...

282
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,646
at the hotel.

283
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:37,676
It started before they got married, and he still does it.

284
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:42,386
I'm sure he has a mistress.

285
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,955
He'll be at the hotel the whole weekend, starting this Friday.

286
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:51,525
This lists all the attendees, from the executives to shareholders.

287
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:55,096
After the seminar, three people including Master Jung Hyuk...

288
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:56,795
always stay over at the hotel.

289
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,695
So one of them is his mistress.

290
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,735
Ask Mr. Hwang...

291
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,535
and find a tabloid reporter.

292
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:09,176
I'll catch them in the act and show the whole world.

293
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,515
Don't tell Mr. Hwang anything else.

294
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,685
What did you buy?

295
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,886
You never hear my footsteps...

296
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,856
but always hear the sound of this plastic bag with food inside.

297
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,695
Awesome.

298
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,995
I was craving plums earlier. How did you know?

299
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,795
Mothers and their children are connected.

300
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,336
My instincts told me.

301
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,906
Let's try it again tomorrow, then. I'll send you a telepathic message.

302
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:47,076
Sure, why not? Hang on. I'll go get changed first.

303
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:48,445
Okay. Hurry!

304
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:55,985
Mom...

305
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,015
Can we really live here?

306
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,156
Yes.

307
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:08,965
Do we no longer have to wander around...

308
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:12,535
and wake up in the middle of the night to run away?

309
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,566
Yes.

310
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,906
Is CEO Jang that powerful?

311
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:21,475
Then let's ask CEO Jang to find your mom.

312
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,045
And we should also ask CEO Jang to catch all those jerks for us.

313
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:27,215
CEO Jang won't do that for us.

314
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:30,015
This is all CEO Jang can do for us now.

315
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,985
We'll need some time to catch all those jerks who were...

316
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,255
involved in what happened to Mom.

317
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:41,465
Hyun Ji, all the seeds I planted have sprouted.

318
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,195
Come out and look!

319
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,975
What's meant to live survives just fine on its own.

320
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:58,346
Shall I give you a tip on how to deal with that CEO Jang?

321
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:00,846
Do you know what the last thing is...

322
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,685
a man with money and power wants?

323
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:05,586
A woman.

324
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,525
He wants a woman of his own.

325
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,626
If you get on that CEO's good side,

326
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,896
finding your mom won't be a problem.

327
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:15,596
The harmony of yin and yang leaves no room for rationality.

328
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:16,935
- Wait. - Listen.

329
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,195
Going to work only to work is third-grade.

330
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:22,606
Going to work to land you a man is first-grade.

331
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:25,106
The CEO's a woman.

332
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:27,705
A woman?

333
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,705
There's no difference.

334
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:32,616
If you bring her a truly magnificent guy...

335
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,586
She's so frustrating.

336
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,265
In the game of Go,

337
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,566
first, you must survive.

338
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,535
If you can't take down your opponent in one go,

339
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,376
first, you'd better learn...

340
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,975
to hide your identity and lie in wait.

341
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,245
When black is at a disadvantage,

342
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,116
it must use the white stones as a shield...

343
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,985
to survive in the enemy camp.

344
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,886
Until I find Mom,

345
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:16,955
I must use that woman as a shield to survive.

346
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:22,366
It's time to start over.

347
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:17,156
(Deo Hotel's 27th Regular Seminar)

348
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,626
It's a master card.

349

After the seminar, three people including Master Jung Hyuk...

350
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,916
always stay over at the hotel.

351
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:46,646
Suite 1701 that Master Jung Hyuk books...

352
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,785
is always empty and never used.

353
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,816
Suite 1703 is always occupied by...

354
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,316
a woman in her 30s.

355
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:54,856
Who are you people?

356
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:58,156
I apologize. We seem to have the wrong room.

357
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,356
I'm very sorry.

358
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,166

359
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,166
always stay over at the hotel.

360
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,356
They have your favorite, darling.

361
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,056
(Secret Boutique)

362
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:41,366
Those photos could spin so many stories.

363
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,025
How dare you attempt blackmail?

364
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:46,096
Will the spirits want to meet such a person?

365
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:48,235
You were struck by misfortune.

366
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:50,336
If we own this property in a borrowed name,

367
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,636
we can use it to negotiate.

368
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,076
Someone already made contact.

369
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:54,475
If it's a guest, welcome them.

370
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:55,906
If not, burn them too.

371
00:27:55,906 --> 00:28:00,076
I saw flames erupt behind you, Chairwoman.

372
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,616
A young deer ran away from the fire,

373
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:05,455
jumped over the high wall of a mansion,

374
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:08,156
and made itself at home there.
