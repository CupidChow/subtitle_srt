(Untitled)

2
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:37,746
Sir! He took the bait.

3
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,886
I'll find his location right away.

4
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,426
If we were fed the wrong information,

5
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,996
you won't be able to meet that woman from earlier.

6
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:59,867
(Room 201, Azalea)

7
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:10,477
Hey! Come over here!

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:11,546
Catch him!

9
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:14,246
You're dead meat now. Hey!

10
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,087
- Catch him! - Hurry!

11
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,727
- Come over here! - Hey!

12
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,126
Stop right there!

13
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:22,457
- Stop! Hey, you punk! - Hurry!

14
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,867
- Chase him! - He's running away.

15
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,026
He's running away! Go chase him!

16
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,766
Hey! Stop!

17
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,236
Stop right there!

18
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:37,876
Catch him!

19
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:39,977
Hey!

20
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:42,546
- This way. - Catch him!

21
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,186
- Hurry! - Catch him!

22
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,507
Hey!

23
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,937
Stop right there! Come over here, you punk!

24
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,877
He's over there!

25
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,417
Darn.

26
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,717
Hey!

27
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:18,516
Keep chasing him!

28
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:21,886
This way!

29
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,856
Come over here, you punk!

30
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,296
Hey!

31
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:52,616
Hey!

32
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:55,486
Here he is. You little punk.

33
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:00,627
Hey, Doctor.

34
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:07,027
You should've just laid low and received treatment.

35
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,766
Why did you get involved with my business?

36
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,366
Where is the video?

37
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,467
Tell me!

38
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:22,447
Don't hurt me.

39
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,486
All that trouble over this little thing.

40
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,426
Lee Hyun Ji. Where is she?

41
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:41,236
I don't know.

42
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,766
I really don't know.

43
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:47,306
Please let me live.

44
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,836
Just for a few months.

45
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,046
A few more months!

46
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,447
Please let me live for a few more months!

47
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,886
Promise me you won't make any trouble from now on.

48
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:04,757
Okay.

49
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,037
You lunatic.

50
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,147
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

51
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,866
Mr. Lee.

52
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,936
I'm at a reed field near Hwapyeong Residence.

53
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,806
Someone's been shot.

54
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,917
Mr. Lee.

55
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:37,477
Mr. Lee.

56
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,486
Mr. Lee.

57
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:45,787
Mr. Lee...

58
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,056
I won't grant you your favor.

59
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,027
So stay in there.

60
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:56,037
Stay in there so you can give money to your parents...

61
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,736
and live like before...

62
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,537
No. No.

63
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,347
I take that back, I'll do anything you want.

64
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:08,946
So please, please just hang in there.

65
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:18,457
You should leave.

66
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,486
I'll take care of things here.

67
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,296
I can't go.

68
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:25,827
I can't.

69
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,267
No.

70
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,967
Get a hold of yourself.

71
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,876
Disappear for good now and stay in hiding.

72
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:43,546
If you go to this address, you'll meet that woman from earlier.

73
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:51,356
(Huam-dong, Yongsan-gu)

74
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,897
You should go when I'm letting you.

75
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:00,967
And I hope I never see you again.

76
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,496
If we meet again,

77
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,936
I can't guarantee what will happen.

78
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:41,506
I heard he's unconscious.

79
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,277
So that's been taken care of.

80
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:47,106
I heard that doctor had a chronic disease as well.

81
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,116
Well, it seems...

82
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:50,816
the skies are on my side...

83
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,517
and helping me in order to make...

84
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,287
this country great again.

85
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:58,657
I had to get my hands dirty trying to clean up your mess.

86
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:02,126
You will surely have to pay the price...

87
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,897
for all the trouble you caused.

88
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,167
Come on, did you forget...

89
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,537
why this mess happened in the first place?

90
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:15,806
If it weren't for that yacht accident,

91
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,676
none of this would've happened.

92
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:20,306
Are you blaming me for murder right now?

93
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,347
Murder...

94
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,517
It wasn't murder, but an accident.

95
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,816
When they built the Great Wall of China,

96
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,686
there were dead bodies stacked on top of one another,

97
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,887
and the nearby farms were soaked with blood.

98
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,397
Hence, in order to build an international city,

99
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,897
a few sacrifices are inevitable.

100
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,667
Didn't I tell you before, Ye Nam?

101
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,466
That he's a pure thug...

102
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,936
and it'd be hard for you to handle him.

103
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,407
What are you doing here?

104
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,507
I was just about to talk about business with Mayor Do.

105
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,046
Why don't you come back later?

106
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,946
That's why I called her, Director Wi.

107
00:08:57,946 --> 00:09:00,086
For Yungcheon's international city,

108
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,987
you and Jenny Jang will work together.

109
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,086
Simply put,

110
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,556
Deo will be my first partner.

111
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:11,127
What are you talking about? Work together?

112
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:14,296
I'm the one who took care of your problem.

113
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,397
How did you threaten him this time?

114
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:20,066
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,436
Jenny Jang made the offer first.

116
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,237
That she wanted to work with you.

117
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,117
Even before the video issue was taken care of.

118
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:32,987
I won't do it.

119
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:35,216
I refuse your offer.

120
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:42,226
Goodness, this puts me in quite a pickle.

121
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:45,296
Jenny Jang is involved too deeply already.

122
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,137
I'll just be frank with you.

123
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,206
With my ability, I cannot get rid of Jenny Jang.

124
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:55,107
So you should think of that as final and leave.

125
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,076
Let's go.

126
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:08,017
You suggested being co-developers? What are you thinking?

127
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,757
Why is that important? You still got what you wanted.

128
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:15,696
You can thank me later.

129
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:28,777
How many people do you intend to ruin trying to sort things out?

130
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,336
Even if I'm given another chance,

131
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,476
I'll do the same.

132
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:37,446
I made up my mind when I heard from you again.

133
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,147
This time,

134
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,316
I will protect you at all costs.

135
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:54,596
Jenny suggested that we both participate as co-developers.

136
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,867
And Mayor Do is thrilled.

137
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:03,107
He probably feels that the headache has been taken care of.

138
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,407
Jenny Jang would never allow you such an opportunity for no reason.

139
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,647
I'm sure she needs to use you as a shield before she deserts you.

140
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:12,586
I will desert her before she can do that.

141
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,617
I must provoke her first.

142
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:18,686
I'll prove that Jung Hyuk isn't actually part of the Deo family,

143
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:22,796
which means Jenny will get kicked out with him.

144
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,306
Please do me a favor.

145
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,637
If something happens to me before this is all over,

146
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:38,877
please give the money I've saved up...

147
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,877
to my family members.

148
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:02,066
(Scissor and Knife Sharpening)

149
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,066
(Someone will come and answer the phone for us shortly.)

150
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,277
The phone! The phone.

151
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,176
The phone.

152
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,796
Hello? This is Hanguk Hospital.

153
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,066
Is this where Mr. Lee Sang Hoon lives?

154
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:37,037
He passed away earlier today.

155
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,086
(Mr. Lee Sang Hoon is at Hanguk Hospital.)

156
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,926
(Sang Hoon is at the hospital.)

157
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,657
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,757
I'm so sorry...

159
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:53,576
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:12,267
There are 361 crossroads on the Go board.

161
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:17,537
At each moment, you must make a choice in order to survive.

162
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:23,176
Which path...

163
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,046
should I take now?

164
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:39,757
Hello.

165
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,826
May I ask you a question?

166
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,336
I heard Monk Un San is here.

167
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,436
He's a monk from Gangwon Province.

168
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,167
I'm Un San.

169
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:56,107
Hello.

170
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,377
My wife told me so much about you.

171
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,417
I heard you moved to this area, so I came to this temple just in case.

172
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,377
I'm so glad I ran into you like this.

173
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,787
Please make yourself at home.

174
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:07,846
Thank you.

175
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,517
Oh, Venerable Sir.

176
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:16,556
May I sleep here tonight?

177
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,267
I'll be there tomorrow.

178
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:24,737
I've already given Dr. Kim a heads-up,

179
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,706
so he'll do a DNA test secretly for us.

180
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:31,476
Prepare everything we need for the DNA test...

181
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,147
and keep him safe until tomorrow.

182
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,357
- Where is he? - He's in his room.

183
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,367
Granduncle.

184
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,137
It's me, Ye Nam.

185
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,556
You must've missed your granduncle very much.

186
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,757
Look at you coming here to see that deceased man.

187
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,507
Why are you acting like you don't get it?

188
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,216
Ye Nam is acting up as if there's no tomorrow.

189
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,716
You need to step in and sort things out...

190
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:48,446
because you're Jung Hyuk's wife now.

191
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:50,556
May I take that...

192
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,226
as you now approve of me as a member of the Deo family?

193
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,936
You lied to me to make that wedding happen.

194
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:05,506
And now, look at you only caring about what you'll get out of this.

195
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:10,137
Right, that makes you a member of the Deo family.

196
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,476
This time, I won't make any promises before things get done.

197
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:17,347
We shall discuss again after you get everything done.

198
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,617
Find my father-in-law's brother.

199
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,657
He's lived long enough,

200
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:28,657
so he won't be too sad about crossing the bar.

201
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:32,167
Anyone would resent an unwanted death.

202
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,996
You don't need any other reason to be resentful.

203
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,506
In other words, he will resent this death.

204
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,006
Mom...

205
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:47,476
Mom.

206
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,147
Mom. I'm sorry, Mom.

207
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,847
"Let a fool hold his tongue, and he will pass for a sage."

208
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:57,216
That saying is perfect for you.

209
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:01,026
You can just not do anything and enjoy your comfortable life,

210
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:04,297
yet you have to ruin everything yourself and suffer.

211
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:10,466
Mom... Mom, wait. Mom!

212
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,607
Mom, Mom.

213
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,807
Mom, Mom...

214
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:18,776
Mom...

215
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:34,357
Why must I live as if I don't exist in this world?

216
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:37,256
I left the secular world...

217
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:40,897
way before my brother became successful.

218
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:46,167
You'll be able to live in peace soon.

219
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:50,877
When will that day come?

220
00:18:57,077 --> 00:19:00,016
If you must commit sin for that day to come,

221
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:02,387
just forget it.

222
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,226
All of this will end when we die anyway.

223
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:12,196
But everyone thinks they can hold onto things forever.

224
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,867
I heard you like these.

225
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:26,746
My deceased nephew...

226
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:31,347
used to visit me from time to time with these.

227
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,026
I will visit you often.

228
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:19,266
Deo Cultural Foundation has managed to acquire 5.3 percent...

229
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,897
of the subsidiaries' shares,

230
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,536
and the spare fund...

231
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,006
has gone up by 23 percent compared to last year.

232
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,236
As per the chairwoman's instructions,

233
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,877
we are in the process of moving the group's internal reserves...

234
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,847
to Deo Cultural Foundation.

235
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:37,276
It should all be finalized by the end of the year.

236
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,847
To secure extra funds,

237
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:43,016
we asked the shareholders for the dividends of Deo Corporation,

238
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,456
the holding company.

239
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,986
The second largest shareholder...

240
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,557
I looked around in person...

241
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:52,466
and saw that a lot of things need taking care of.

242
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,996
As of today, vacate Director Wi's office.

243
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,067
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,407
Director Wi's shares in Deo Cosmetics.

245
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,637
Transfer them to the foundation.

246
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,236
- Chairwoman Kim. - You don't do anything.

247
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,206
Your title and shares have no meaning.

248
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:11,917
You'll have no trouble getting three meals a day.

249
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:14,847
You.

250
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,956
Did you wag your tail?

251
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,827
Why don't you...

252
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:21,387
go to the US where Su Bin is...

253
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:23,026
and be a mom for a few years?

254
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:26,797
Send your own child to school for a change.

255
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:48,857
Sit.

256
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:56,696
I was a businesswoman before I joined the Deo family.

257
00:21:57,956 --> 00:22:01,167
There was a time when I wasn't too different from you.

258
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:06,107
The time when all I had was a body that worked hard...

259
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,807
and strong business acumen.

260
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,407
The truth is,

261
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,147
you're the person who would understand me the most.

262
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:19,647
They say the same people loathe each other.

263
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,057
If you had anything against me,

264
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,686
let it all go now.

265
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:28,226
I don't have anything against you.

266
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,766
Trust is your only criteria,

267
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,966
so you were easier to work for.

268
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:41,837
I got into the business when I was 15.

269
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,976
I was so very poor.

270
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,817
That's when I decided.

271
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,547
I was born an animal,

272
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,246
but I said I'd die a human.

273
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:58,117
When I die,

274
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:01,486
I will do so as a human being.

275
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,996
I had such a hard life.

276
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,667
In the end,

277
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:16,137
I was right.

278
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:37,157
Keep it safe, Chairwoman Kim.

279
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:46,337
Until I take this ring...

280
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,236
from your finger.

281
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:54,047
Until you return...

282
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:56,176
to your original place.

283
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:37,657
When I was young,

284
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:39,657
you got disgusted...

285
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:41,486
when I put ice in my juice.

286
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:44,357
Did you say it was because it harmed the purity?

287
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,867
The melting ice dilutes the juice.

288
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,496
It becomes untrue.

289
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:51,667
Just like you, Do Young.

290
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,236
Don't you think that...

291
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:58,377
you sent me to the US and replaced me.

292
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,307
The chairwoman's trust?

293
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:03,617
You know better than anyone it can flip at any moment.

294
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,016
Just ask for a favor.

295
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:09,657
That I talk her into letting you stay.

296
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:13,127
You'll have to pay the price.

297
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,627
What you fear the most.

298
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:20,226
I know what that is.

299
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,347
Do you have anything?

300
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,617
Master Jung Hyuk and Ms. Jang...

301
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:41,746
don't seem to share a bed.

302
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,756
Only one person seems to use the bed,

303
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,297
there's a blanket on the couch, and nowhere in the suite...

304
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:55,026
is there evidence that they're a couple.

305
00:25:57,496 --> 00:26:00,107
Only half of her is true to Jung Hyuk.

306
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:04,577
The other half belongs to Mr. Yoon.

307
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:08,746
It's for the best.

308
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:12,216
I didn't like the idea of a joint investment with Director Wi.

309
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,617
We're from Yungcheon Prosecutors' Office.

310
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,357
Yoon Sun Woo?

311
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:22,557
You're under arrest for murder in the reed field.

312
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:28,867
(Wi Ye Nam)

313
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,436
You can remain silent...

314
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:32,196
and hire a lawyer.

315
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,337
The doctor died.

316
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,976
If you want to get Mr. Yoon out,

317
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,077
you'd better leave Deo.

318
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:45,746
Of course, you'd better drop the deal with Mayor Do too.

319
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,557
The owner of J Boutique.

320
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:52,016
The savior of all the rich wives in Gangnam.

321
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,157
That's the highest you'll ever go.

322
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,196
Don't forget that humility is...

323
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:02,367
the virtue of any secret influencer.

324
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,536
Come with us.

325
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:33,167
Hyun Ji! Hyun Ji!

326
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:34,667
Hyun Ji!

327
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,466
Hyun Ji!

328
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:38,966
Hyun Ji!

329
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,276
The first to call it in.

330
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:47,206
The prints on the gun found in the reed field.

331
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:50,176
CCTV footage from the residence.

332
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,686
There's a mountain of evidence.

333
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,486
Everything points to you.

334
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,786
You missed the heart.

335
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,526
Was that because you're not used to shooting?

336
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:02,286
Or was it to make it look as such?

337
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:06,196
I refuse to comment.

338
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,837
I guess Jenny Jang hasn't made up her mind yet.

339
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,607
- Take him to lock-up. - Yes, sir.

340
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,036
Wi Ye Nam wants me...

341
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:51,776
to leave Deo, but that won't happen.

342
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:55,547
And I won't back down from the international city project.

343
00:28:58,246 --> 00:28:59,516
You will...

344
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,047
get out of here.

345
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:05,917
Lee Hyun Ji.

346
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,226
That girl.

347
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,026
Where is she?

348
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:18,436
Lee Hyun Ji...

349
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,607
will replace you as the killer.

350
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,206
(Secret Boutique)

351
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,036
Is it Jung Hyuk or Yoon Sun Woo?

352
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,637
Who will you pick?

353
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:00,946
You can never touch Sun Woo.

354
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:04,446
I clearly saw what you did in the reed field.

355
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,186
Your life depends on what I say.

356
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,716
Tell me what you want.

357
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:09,587
Oh Tae Seok, you, Mayor Do, and me.

358
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:11,857
We're all about to go down in one go!

359
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:12,926
You want us all to die?

360
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:15,256
Why would you take Lee Hyun Ji to court?

361
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,196
That ring isn't yours.

362
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:19,057
The ring and Deo Group.

363
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:20,926
I'll get it back.
