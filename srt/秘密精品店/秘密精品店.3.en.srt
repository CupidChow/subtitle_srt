(Episode 2)

2
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,234
Bye. Come this way.

3
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,199
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

4
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,500
Did you see a woman in her mid-50s with a blue scarf?

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,209
They were all that there were.

6
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,139
Are you sure you saw her?

7
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,680
We called the police. They'll find something.

8
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,790
Did you see a woman in her mid-50s with a blue scarf?

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,930
Hey!

10
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,299
Did you see a middle-aged woman?

11
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,509
She has short hair and wore a blue scarf.

12
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,710
I don't think so. I'm fixing a boat.

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,879
I'm alone too, as you see.

14
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,760
(Yungcheon Seobu Patrol Division)

15
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:54,700
Look at this.

16
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,640
Your mother last made a call on the road to Seoul.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,470
That was 20 minutes ago.

18
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:02,140
Call her again.

19
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,120
(Gwanak, Anyang)

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
In those four beats

21
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,890
There is love, breakup

22
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,459
And tears

23
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:20,830
The receiver cannot be reached.

24
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm sure she'll come home.

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,629
Yes, Hyun Ji. You must've been mistaken.

26
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,870
What if she's on a stakeout and can't answer her phone?

27
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,409
I saw it clearly.

28
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,539
A man in black swung a stick.

29
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,320
What's the intelligence bureau chief doing here?

30
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,119
You must be busy with work.

31
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,029
Mom.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,239
Come inside.

33
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,369
Come this way.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,610
We have her on camera at the pier,

35
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,850
but not boarding a boat.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,350
I have to look into something.

37
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,719
I'm alone too, as you see.

38
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,459
If you want a missing person's team...

39
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,790
or a detective on the case,

40
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,989
what we have now just isn't enough.

41
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,499
- Let's wait... - The man that just came in.

42
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,200
Does he work here?

(Seobu Patrol Division)

44
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:40,570
What got into you now? You've been really weird today.

45
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,580
- We can't find her here. - What?

46
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,679
We'll send you all the cases from the other patrol divisions too.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,049
All the missing person's cases that come in after today,

48
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,420
- send them directly to me. - I got one just now.

49
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,059
Who's missing?

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,360
A female in her 50s, a lieutenant from Seonneung Patrol Division.

51
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,730
Her daughter was just here.

52
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,899
Yungcheon Prosecutors' Office.

53
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,190
Like you said, Oh Tae Seok's cleaning up.

54
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:29,019
Director Wi Ye Nam took Mayor Do on a yacht.

55
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,219
I think something happened on board.

56
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,959
We must find out what.

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,499
Mayor Do wouldn't have turned against us over money.

58
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,130
- Hi. - The cop's daughter...

59
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,700
went to a prosecutor.

60
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:45,040
Stop her. You must stop her.

61
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,469
Why did things get so messed up?

62
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,839
You couldn't even clean up the death of a girl?

63
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,180
A prosecutor's involved.

64
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,620
Don't you see it's beyond my reach now?

65
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,890
There's no time.

66
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,820
Make the call.

67
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,589
What shall I say?

68
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,800
Okay, I understand. Sure.

69
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,969
File a document at the Public Service Center,

70
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,200
and they'll check the case.

71
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,039
No, I must see someone now.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,940
I must talk to a prosecutor, not a police officer.

73
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,609
Sorry, but could you call someone else?

74
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,479
What's the matter?

75
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,440
(Prosecutor)

76
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,190
Here.

77
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,289
Thank you.

78
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,789
Your mother who is an officer disappeared and somehow...

79
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,830
you think the police is involved?

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,029
- Yes. - You saw what happened...

81
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:47,430
on a boat out at sea? That's a long way off.

82
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,440
No, I saw it clearly.

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,669
I wish I were wrong but...

84
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,180
- Here you go. - Thanks.

(Personnel File)

86
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,019
The person you mentioned is an officer.

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,589
Can I have a look?

88
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,459
The police said there's no CCTV footage.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,529
If we're to gather evidence, we need time as well.

90
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,300
Sorry but right now,

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
all I can say is that you wait.

92
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,539
I hope your mother calls you in the meantime.

93
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,779
What a rare sight.

94
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,680
You are waiting for me instead of sleeping.

95
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,789
I'm surprised.

96
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,159
I thought you'd come running, asking me what it was about.

97
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,099
You seem like the anxious one, not me.

98
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,500
So Oh Tae Seok has killed someone.

99
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,599
On top of that, it's a cop.

100
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,339
But why?

101
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,940
Something probably went down before that.

102
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,109
You should've discussed it with me first, since I'm your husband.

103
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,219
Laugh at me all you want.

104
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,289
And don't say anything.

105
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,260
Don't try to find out more either.

106
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,930
You can decide the price, and add it to the alimony.

107
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,729
Why would I receive money from you?

108
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,200
Don't you think, Ye Nam?

109
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,370
I thought we reached an agreement.

110
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,200
No, I can't go away like this.

111
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,339
Everything I'm enjoying right now...

112
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,909
will become useless once we get divorced.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,779
The son-in-law of Deo Group.

114
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,209
That's the last title I can rely on.

115
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,849
Don't try to meddle with it.

116
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,219
Cha Seung Jae!

117
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,320
Besides, I still love you.

118
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,159
Let's sleep in the same bed tonight, Ye Nam.

119
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,330
You jerk!

120
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,070
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

121
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,099
I'll call you a taxi, so take it.

122
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,499
Call her a taxi, she's headed to Hyeonam-dong.

123

(Lee Hyun Ji, Seonneung-dong)

124
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,119
It says on my ID that my address is Seonneung-dong.

125
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,249
How did he know?

126
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,859
- Mi Jin, you have to get up now. - What is it?

127
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:35,259
Did your mom call?

128
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,459
Wake Ye Jun up and get him dressed. We have to leave.

129
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,969
Hyun Ji, what's the matter this time?

130
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:42,800
Hurry up and get dressed! We have to get out of here.

131
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,009
Mom, where are we going?

132
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,810
Ye Jun.

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,650
Don't say anything, and just run with me, okay?

134
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,310
Do you understand?

135
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,619
Are the people who hurt your mom after us too?

136
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:57,650
Oh, no.

137
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:40,889
I'm so out of breath.

138
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,030
Come here. Hurry.

139
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
What do you want us to do in here?

140
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,709
I'll lose him and come back. Don't go anywhere and wait, okay?

141
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,709
Don't come out.

142
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,670
Get in.

143
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,810
Thank you.

144
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,009
But how did you know?

145
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,440
Are you okay?

146
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,349
Wait, hold on. We have to go back.

147
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,820
Hurry, please.

148
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,530
Where are they?

149
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,739
Let me see that.

150
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,989
Where's the girl?

151
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,200
Did Jenny Jang take her?

152
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,430
I'm afraid so.

153
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,739
She'll use that cop's daughter as a hostage and threaten me.

154
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,239
That brat Jenny Jang will try to take away everything from me.

155
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,410
I've gotten rid of everything that can be used as evidence.

156
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,209
Even if this case comes up to the surface,

157
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,450
it won't be connected to Mayor Do...

158
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,950
or you in any way.

159
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,290
You will...

160
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,190
take the blame for everything?

161
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,259
If it becomes a problem,

162
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,489
I will.

163
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,369
To me, you are...

164
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,070
someone I cannot live without.

165
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,680
20 years ago, and now as well.

166
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,089
I must meet Mayor Do.

167
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,259
I have to make a move...

168
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,459
before Jenny Jang does something.

169
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,499
I've confirmed a woman in her 30s and a little boy...

170
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,139
have not been taken by Oh Tae Seok's men.

171
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,109
Thank you.

172
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,849
Don't be mistaken.

173
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,650
We're not trying to save you.

174
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,790
We're just people trying to use you.

175
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,820
Still, you're on the other side.

176
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,259
The people who hurt my mom...

177
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,629
And the people who want to hurt me.

178
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,800
At least you're not on the same side as them.

179
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:49,999
That's good enough.

180
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,869
That's enough for me, so thank you.

181
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,950
Chairwoman Kim, I found this while cleaning the house.

(Letter of Resignation, Wi Jung Hyuk)

184
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,839
His belongings are still in here.

185
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,009
There's no need to clean. Throw away everything!

186
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,810
What do you mean, write up a written agreement?

187
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,119
It hasn't been passed by the Urban Planning Committee yet,

188
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,950
and it's too early for this.

189
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,920
Then I guess this will have to do instead.

190
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,160
What is this?

191
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,430
Write up a will for me.

192
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,270
(Looking for a Kitchen Helper)

193
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,639
Gosh, no. I can't do it.

194
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,940
Mom, where are we going to sleep tonight?

195
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,550
Where is Hyun Ji?

196
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,379
I don't know either!

197
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,400
My gosh! Oh, no.

198
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,900
- Goodness, it's all wet. - Mom.

199
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,469
Put it back in. Not now.

200
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,080
My gosh, it's soaked.

201
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,109
Here you go.

202
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,409
Sorry? Why are you giving me this?

203
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,119
Well, so that you can wipe yourself.

204
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,949
My gosh! What are you looking at? And you're standing way too close!

205
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,119
Sorry?

206
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:52,330
- Well, I was just... - See? You're doing it again!

207
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:55,189
Mister, you were staring at my chest just now.

208
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,830
How could you sexually harass me like this in broad daylight?

209
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,699
Help! This molester is trying to run away!

210
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,070
- My gosh! - Goodness, look!

211
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,439
Mom.

212
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:09,909
Mom!

213
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,310
Mom...

214
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:16,480
Give me some settlement money and get lost.

215
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,119
Here.

216
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,389
Thank you.

217
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,460
Good job, my sweet pumpkin!

218
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,570
(Last Will and Testament)

219
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,280
Promise me that you will never...

220
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,580
desert me and Deo Cosmetics no matter what happens.

221
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:49,480
That is what I need.

222
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,980
(I, Do Jun Sub...)

223
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,889
(Did you have a good time on the yacht?)

224
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
(Did you have a good time on the yacht?)

225
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll trade the original file with you for 20 big bills.

226
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,820
I'll give you three days.

227
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,859
- Hello? - This is so messed up.

228
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,760
I can't believe you threatened me after ruining everything.

229
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,470
- What happened? - The video clip...

230
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,939
There is a video clip.

231
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,869
Someone's threatening me using a video that shows the dead girl!

232
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,409
Find out who's doing this at once.

233
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,210
If you can't stop this, I won't go down alone.

234
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:56,750
Both you and I will be doomed.

235
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,899
Who could it be?

236
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,800
Who recorded a video of it?

237
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,839
I'll track down everyone who was at the party.

238
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,169
It's only a matter of time. We'll be able to find who did it.

239
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,480
Darn it!

240
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,089
Why won't you share any information with me?

241
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,419
Because I'm a member of the Deo family?

242
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:38,189
I just think it'll be better for your sake as well.

243
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,530
I guess you don't know me well.

244
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,230
I've known Jenny Jang since I was nine.

245
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,730
I grew up confiding in her a lot more...

246
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,099
than in my own sister, who is greedy and spoiled.

247
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,470
I'm on Jenny's side.

248
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,109
Why?

249
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,780
Because she'll fight the war against Director Wi on your behalf?

250
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,510
What matters is that we're comrades at the moment.

251
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,149
I mean, who knows...

252
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,320
when you'll turn your coat?

253
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,689
I know you're keeping a girl with you.

254
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:10,520
Why aren't you reporting it to your boss?

255
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,389
Do you not like the idea of Jenny winning against Ye Nam...

256
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,000
and marrying my brother?

257
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,399
For now, I'll pretend not to know about it.

258
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,470
Because we're on the same side.

259
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,589
You're evil. How could you stab your teacher?

260
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,159
They say you should never take in someone else's child.

261
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,730
Even brutes won't do such a thing.

262
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,399
She didn't do it. I stabbed him.

263
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,939
- Sun Woo. - That teacher started it.

264
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,540
She clearly told him not to do it,

265
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,510
but he came by every night and bothered her.

266
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:03,339
How dare you glare at me like that, you brat!

267
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,540
Do Young.

268
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,820
The police have confirmed that Sun Woo was the one who stabbed him.

269
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,990
He's very young, so he'll be on probation.

270
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,199
Thankfully, his stab wound isn't too deep.

271
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:28,099
He called and said he'll return to work next week.

272
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,240
But one of you has to leave because of what happened.

273
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:41,449
We're offering a bit of money to help you stand on your own feet.

274
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,949
If you decide to leave,

275
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,119
I'll find a place for you to stay until you turn 18.

276
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:53,560
Do Young!

277
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:57,159
Do Young!

278
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,530
Let go! Let go of me.

279
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:02,939
Let go!

280
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,939
Do Young!

281
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,649
Do Young!

282
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,300
We found the girl Oh Tae Seok was after.

283
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:40,839
Her mom is a cop.

284
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,080
I think she has something to do with the incident on the yacht.

285
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,109
(President Wi Jung Hyuk)

286
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,849
We need something more concrete.

287
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,419
Even if the cop and Oh Tae Seok are exposed,

288
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,460
Ye Nam and Mayor Do won't be affected.

289
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,490
Why are you calling nonstop when you can't even keep your woman safe?

290
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,300
- Let me talk to Do Young. - I'm her lawyer.

291
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,470
You can talk to me if you got something to say.

292
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:11,800
Tell her I've submitted my letter of resignation.

293
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:18,580
Mr. Wi...

294
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,909
has resigned.

295
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,250
Running away for love?

296
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,929
Nice excuse.

297
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,760
Hello, Ms. Jang.

298
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,109
Tell everyone to leave the room so that we can talk in private.

299
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,780
Sun Woo.

300
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,119
Ms. Jang.

301
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,030
Some jerks are threatening me using this video clip.

302
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:23,010
You know how those jerks are.

303
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,179
Offering money won't silence them.

304
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:29,179
This will eventually bog me down.

305
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,879
I'll call back later.

306
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,859
I took care of the girl.

307
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,929
Now, nothing...

308
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,159
can hinder your bright future.

309
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,869
But I want...

310
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,399
my company, Deo Cosmetics,

311
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:52,970
to be your partner in the international city project...

312
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,369
instead of Deo Hotel.

313
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:01,010
Ms. Jang, it must've been very stressful for you.

314
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:04,720
I was distracted for a short while...

315
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,849
because Director Wi kept pestering me,

316
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,790
but she obviously can't outshine you.

317
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:13,060
Let's find the person who recorded the video and take care of it.

318
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,030
After that, we can build the international city together.

319
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,169
What's with that reaction?

320
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:28,770
I'm giving you another chance.

321
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,909
Why must I build the international city with you?

322
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:36,750
What are you talking about?

323
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,919
We've worked together toward the same goal for the past seven years.

324
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,030
I know you want to build the international city...

325
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,300
so that you can run for President after that.

326
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,699
I gave you...

327
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,330
that dream.

328
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,899
You were...

329
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:00,470
a politician wannabe from the country.

330
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,010
I clothed you, fed you,

331
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:05,710
and taught you how to talk and walk.

332
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,750
From your candidate nomination to the election,

333
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,250
I paved the way with my money.

334
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,919
After all that,

335
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
you stabbed me in the back.

336
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,929
Why do you think I didn't say a word so far?

337
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,599
Because I considered changing horses...

338
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,270
to work with a new mayor instead.

339
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,099
Why?

340
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,810
Now you are worried?

341
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,869
You didn't think much of me.

342
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,780
Leave.

343
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,710
Whether I release the video, make you a killer, and ruin you,

344
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,419
or block the video's release and give you another chance,

345
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,520
I need to think about it.

346
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,889
Oh, one more thing.

347
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,960
Show some remorse.

348
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,159
Why don't you value me and mess things up yourself?

349
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,060
Sun Woo, let's track a video.

350
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,369
A son of a witch...

351
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,500
killed a girl with drugs.

352
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:15,879
You still play go.

353
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,780
Is it because you like it or just out of spite?

354
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,889
I like it.

355
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,659
I'm happy when I win,

356
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,159
and when I lose...

357
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:29,129
I'm happy to find out why I lost.

358
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:32,830
Is that humanly possible?

359
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,599
Are you okay with not being a pro?

360
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,040
Yes.

361
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,339
My goodness.

362
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,540
I'd love it if I could be a crime-busting officer,

363
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,649
but if I had to be on patrol forever, I'd hate it.

364
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:49,780
There are still matches to win.

365
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,990
Whether I'm a pro or an amateur.

366
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,960
Hey, kid.

367
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
Stop it.

368
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,159
My goodness, you.

369
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,030
There's no stopping you, is there?

370
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:20,349
How did it get into such a mess?

371
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,619
Ms. Wi did her best.

372
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:25,449
Mayor Do got into trouble...

373
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:26,649
Either way.

374
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,490
You couldn't clean it up.

375
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,889
That sly mayor fool...

376
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,230
changed sides again and went back to Jenny.

377
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,399
It's not over yet, Mom.

378
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,730
There's still a way to clean it up.

379
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:45,139
Mayor Do can't ignore the cards up my sleeve.

380
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:56,820
Hello, Chairwoman Kim.

381
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,550
Mom.

382
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,619
You called her?

383
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:01,790
Sit.

384
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:05,659
Mom, I haven't lost yet.

385
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,960
I can head the international city project.

386
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,929
I see you heard the story.

387
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,429
I came here to ask you for an urgent favor.

388
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:14,500
Okay.

389
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,669
As you know, Deo's future depends on...

390
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:19,639
the international city project.

391
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,240
It will decide...

392
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,939
whether in the next 10 years Deo will become...

393
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,310
one of the top 10 groups.

394
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,710
You can't just be the developer,

395
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,419
but for the next decade or century after the project's completed,

396
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:32,849
Deo must be in management.

397
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:34,949
What about that?

398
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,359
All that depends on my wedding...

399
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,560
that will happen at noon tomorrow.

400
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:41,960
Wedding?

401
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,929
Noon tomorrow?

402
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,530
It's the time you were going to marry my Jung Hyuk.

403
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,369
I will get married as planned.

404
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:57,980
Then Deo Group will be named developer.

405
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,879
How are you so sure?

406
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:02,580
Don't fall for it, Mom.

407
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,520
She's bluffing and even blackmailing you.

408
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:08,990
I'll deal with Mayor Do.

409
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll sort it out...

410
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,060
and get him to sign the contract as if nothing happened.

411
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,089
Okay?

412
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,500
Mom.

413
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,830
You won't give in, will you?

414
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,169
It's a marriage.

415
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:25,040
Will you really make her part of the family?

416
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,710
What if I don't permit that?

417
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,369
What'll you do then?

418
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,310
Will you elope with Jung Hyuk...

419
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,409
and marry like immature kids?

420
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,080
I'll find another company.

421
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,260
Jogwang Group would work.

422
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,199
It's their opportunity to beat Deo, their 30-year rival.

423
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,099
They'd take the plunge.

424
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,230
No businessman...

425
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,070
hands over the goods before checking if they have money to pay.

426
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,280
If you win the developer deal,

427
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:07,550
then you can marry and join the family.

428
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:10,550
A smart businessman makes an investment...

429
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,750
based on the chances.

430
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,020
If you only make safe investments,

431
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,359
you waste your time counting chump change.

432
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:19,389
That's what you taught me.

433
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,060
I wonder if you still have the wise eye of investment.

434
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:27,869
I'd like to...

435
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,270
have a simple wedding...

436
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,540
in the front garden of this mansion.

437
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,240
If you'll excuse me.

438
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm getting married tomorrow.

439
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,050
I should put on a mask pack.

440
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:52,460
Mom.
