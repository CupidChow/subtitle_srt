"February, 2015"

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,610
John Kim.

4
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:23,501
Oh, my.

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,442
Oh, my gosh.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,494
I got you!

7
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,516
It's called a corset.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,966
A corset.

9
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,049
Where are you?

10
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:40,695
Are you looking for me?

11
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:42,177
You startled me.

12
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:46,429
I'll wear a ribbon and wait for you.

13
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,615
I'll be looking sexy and lovely.

14
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,317
Are you in pain?

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,842
I'll come to you.

16
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:12,577
How many times did I wake up
looking at the same ceiling?

17
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,646
My heart aches more than
my body because I miss her.

18
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,985
Each day feels like a year.

19
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,831
But still...

20
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,885
...I would hate to see her cry
because of me, even more.

21
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,285
Are you okay?

22
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:50,053
You caught me.

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,945
That must not have been sexy.

24
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:06,011
Every day I go outside
of Earth, to where she is...

25
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,597
...and return back countless times.

26
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:43,702
Hello, Mr. Min.

27
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,372
Where's Mom?

28
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:50,504
She's on her way back from a seminar.

29
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,342
Is that for your mom?

30
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:54,442
Yes, it is.

31
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,545
She'll be home soon, right?

32
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
Yes, she will.

33
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:08,493
I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:13,602
It was raining.

35
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,730
We rushed them to the hospital, but...

36
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,106
I'm sorry, sir.

37
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,147
Are you being discharged?

38
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,577
I wanted to see how Youngho's doing.

39
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,010
I'm going home now.

40
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,413
He still needs to rest.

41
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,310
I see.

42
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,193
I couldn't just leave.

43
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,813
Even if it is from afar...

44
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,220
...I wanted to apologize once again.

45
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,398
I will relay the message.

46
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:51,327
Please tell Mother that I'm sorry
for leaving without saying goodbye.

47
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,796
And please tell Youngho that I'm sorry...

48
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,840
...for not taking care of
his father and grandmother...

49
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,813
...like I promised I would.

50
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,790
Please let him know that.

51
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,180
Goodbye, then.

"Relationship Store"

53
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,312
Youngho already has the beautiful
and intelligent Venus of Daegu.

54
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,738
So, just keep learning
about relationships.

55
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,081
"Relationship Store"?

56
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,914
It was so you.

57
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,651
Why not give me "Relationship Restaurant"
or "Relationship Buffet" instead?

58
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,044
Gosh.
What is this sad situation?

59
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,891
We rarely see each other.

60
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,771
You should go.

61
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,657

I no longer pass time. I endure it."

64
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,589
I'm going to tell my mom on you.

65
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,131
You jerk. You big fat jerk!

66
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,188
It's okay.

67
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,824
You'll be okay soon.

68
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,831
It'll get better soon.

69
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,171
It's okay.

70
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,835
You'll be okay soon.

71
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,808
It'll get better soon.

00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,115
"May, 2015"

73
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,049
Just a minute.

74
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,596
Youngho.

75
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:37,296
Coach.

76
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,328
It's me.

77
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:42,775
Come back to me...

78
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,941
...beautifully and sexily.

79
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,503
You have to come back.

80
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,745
Just remember this.

81
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,826
If you're hanging in there...

82
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,096
...you haven't reached your limit yet.

83
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,367
If you believe it, you can do it.

84
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,853
I thought it would bring you good luck.

85
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,063
So I didn't let anyone remove it.

86
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:58,980
You can even read my mind now.

87
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:05,815
Let's go.

88
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,841
Maybe it's because your
son was in good shape.

89
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:26,739
His bones healed well
over the past six months.

90
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,598
But his muscles have degenerated...

91
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,486
...and his lower body
was injured severely.

92
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,898
I'm not sure if he will
be able to walk again.

93
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,899
Are you saying it's impossible?

94
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,942
The chances are very slim.

95
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,112
So I can't give you a definite answer.

96
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:46,719
He fully recovered from osteosarcoma.

97
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,022
You said it was a miracle.

98
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:55,221
Then we should pray for another miracle.

99
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:06,894
Oh, you have another chemotherapy.

100
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,467
I'll arrange it.

101
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:29,900
When you spend a lot of
time at the hospital...

102
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:34,256
...you realize that there are so many
people suffering in this world.

103
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,589
In the end...

104
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:42,540
...all of us are in pain.

105
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,500
Whether it's just a little or a lot.

106
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,597
So don't cry.

107
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,979
Everybody endures it and
goes on with their lives.

108
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,174
Come back to me...

109
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,814
...beautifully and sexily.

110
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:04,541
Let's try this leg.

111
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:10,974
Nice.

112
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,359
Nice. Good.

113
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:18,962
Remember, this is just the beginning.

114
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:31,879
He's made significant improvements
in every single category you can imagine.

115
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:47,982
Okay.

116
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,472
"Relationship Store"

117
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,893
If I see you, I will want to run to you.

118
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:47,397
But I can't do that yet.

119
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm going to straighten your leg.

120
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,744
I'll move it little by little.
A little more.

121
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:13,908
Keep going. A little more.
Use your back.

122
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,666
A little more. Go.

123
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:43,883
Youngho!

124
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,179
-Jiwoong.
-Youngho.

125
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:50,942
Junseong.

126
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,277
You did a good job.

127
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:15,238
Good job.

128
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,622
- Thank you.
- Good work.

129
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:21,527
Youngho.

130
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:26,177
You can do it!

131
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:35,237
One more time.

132
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:37,450
Go!

133
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,725
"December 24, 2015"

134
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,781
Isn't that a little too pink?

135
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,054
You're right.

136
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,054
It is.

137
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,364
It's an honor to serve
you like this again.

138
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:54,220
You're exaggerating again.

139
00:20:56,393 --> 00:21:00,777
You can just say "Good job"
or "You did it."

140
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:02,986
That would've been enough.

141
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:06,413
Good job.

142
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:10,528
You did it.

143
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,072
Okay.

144
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:16,784
You, too.

145
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,293
"Oh My Venus"

tracking people down."

"If you don't reply, I will find you.
And when I do, you're dead!"

148
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:00,452
Coach.

149
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,883
This is the 60th video.

150
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,833
Holding a plank for a minute is
a piece of cake now.

151
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,128
Don't worry about me.

152
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,142
Good luck today.

153
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,536
Gosh.

154
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,949
Do you think I'll stop sending you videos
just because you don't check them?

155
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,182
No.

156
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:26,612
I can do anything because I'm Kang Jooeun.

157
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,994
You don't need to rush too much.

158
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:38,490
Don't be sick and don't worry about me.

159
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:43,980
Other than missing you, I'm totally fine.

160
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,031
Good luck!

161
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:06,953
It's been a while.

162
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:08,659
Kang Jooeun.

163
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:25,122
You must be real.

164
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,365
I should've saved up.

165
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:25,547
I've never been so grateful
before in my life.

166
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:30,053
So I want to treat a piece of cake
to everyone in the world.

167
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:36,318
I haven't seen you in ages and
the first thing you mention is food.

168
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,956
Hi, Hyunjeong.

169
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:46,933
Yes, I'll be right in.

170
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:53,097
I need to submit a document today
since tomorrow is Christmas.

171
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,401
I'll wait here. Go ahead.

172
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,267
I'll be back.

173
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:01,758
I won't take long.

174
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,572
Do you want to wait inside?
It's cold out.

175
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:09,753
I will wait right here.

176
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,067
Come with me.

177
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:28,457
Stay in my sight.

178
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:48,845
We should get off.

179
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:51,861
Right.

180
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,169
Oh, Miss Kang!

181
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:18,199
Oh!

182
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,906
It's been a while, Hyunjeong.

183
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:25,261
Oh yeah, how was she holding up?

184
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,239
Goodness.

185
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,328
For the past year, she would
randomly burst into tears.

186
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,365
You don't know how
worried I was about her.

187
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,636
Hyunjeong.

188
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:36,648
Did you go away somewhere?

189
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,553
Yes, sort of.

190
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:51,404
Hyunjeong.

191
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,390
What time is the rebuttal document
for Jung Hyeongin's case due?

192
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:58,130
We need to send it in the next two hours
since it's Christmas tomorrow.

193
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,231
I'll go home and send it right away.

194
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:03,342
Thank you.

195
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,687
Hyunjeong.

196
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:06,851
Merry Christmas.

197
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,230
Merry Christmas to you, too.

198
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,920
Sit here.

199
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:22,132
Wait right here. I'll be quick.

200
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,358
"Attorney, Kang Jooeun"

201
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,459
Let's go.

202
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:49,569
Take it slow.

203
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,249
We have plenty of time.

204
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,662
I don't have time.

205
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,897
I need to send the rebuttal document.

206
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:42,307
I'll be as quick as possible.

207
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,725
So make yourself comfortable.

208
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,630
Stop staring.

209
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:12,704
You'll wear me out.

210
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,429
Finish up quickly...

211
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:21,747
...so that I can kiss you to show
you that I'm happy to see you.

212
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,041
I don't know whether
you know this or not.

213
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,479
But people say that the time
I spent and the process it took...

214
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:41,346
...for me to come back
to you was a miracle.

215
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:47,441
But to me, a miracle is....

216
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:51,891
...you looking at me,
as lovely as ever

217
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:41,993
I can't say how sorry I am...

218
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:46,023
...because I made you wait so long.

219
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,880
You must have cried for me every day.

220
00:32:50,393 --> 00:32:51,920
You gave me the strength to get back up.

221
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,191
You're my life's greatest cure.

222
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,709
You healed me.

223
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,500
You were my miracle.

224
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,109
Do you know that?

225
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,013
Thank you.

226
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,524
Thank you.

227
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,254
You don't know how relieved I am.

228
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,068
I can finally breathe again.

229
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:38,111
Oh.

230
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,386
It's probably Mr. Min.

231
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:46,332
He's very good at interrupting
our restful and erotic evening.

232
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:51,197
You should go see your family.

233
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:04,142
I haven't seen a woman like this before.

234
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:09,147
Get back safely.

235
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,875
I'll see you tomorrow.

236
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:19,520
Tomorrow?

237
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,263
We'll see each other every day.

238
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,076
Hi, Jooeun.

239
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:05,418
Hyunwoo.

240
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,066
What do I do?

241
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:14,276
What now?

242
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:16,131
Are you crying again?

243
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:21,209
Let's go to the hospital.
You'll die at this rate.

244
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,296
He...

245
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:28,773
The guy you miss to death.
What about him?

246
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:31,122
He's back.

247
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:33,505
Really?

248
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:34,633
Yes.

249
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:39,416
I saw him and touched him.

250
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,039
It's really him.

251
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:44,736
Jooeun.

252
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,507
That's great, Jooeun..

253
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:50,769
Yeah.

254
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,801
Santa Claus must be a liar.

255
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:57,282
Why did he give you such a huge present
when you cried all year long?

256
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,193
Stop crying.

257
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:02,420
Stop acting weak.

258
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,125
Okay.

259
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:09,382
Of course. It calls for a bigger
celebration than Christmas.

260
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:11,656
Yes.

261
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,141
Okay.

262
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:18,840
Mom!

263
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,542
My baby, you're back.

264
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:24,007
Oh, dear.

265
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:26,536
What did you do with Dad?

266
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:28,281
-We went to an amusement park.
-Wow.

267
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:30,387
-Did you have fun?
-Yes, totally.

268
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:32,489
Dad even carried me on his shoulders.

269
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:33,930
It was only for a second.

270
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,272
What?

271
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,762
I thought my neck was going to snap.

272
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:41,261
Because my baby is
eating well and growing well.

273
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,947
Goodness. You really are his dad.

274
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,825
Even the strongest wrestlers can't
carry him like that.

275
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:48,951
You should go to bed now.

276
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:51,805
Okay. Bye, Dad.

277
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,532
Let's go look at some sharks
at the aquarium next time.

278
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:57,911
Okay, Dad. Merry Christmas.

279
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:59,412
Merry Christmas.

280
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,270
Take this with you.

281
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:03,915
Oh, dear.

282
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:06,538
Aren't you leaving?

283
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:11,959
Child support.

284
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,897
Forget it. You don't have
to give it to me anymore.

285
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,410
I don't want to raise my son using
money made by digging up dirt on others.

286
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,655
You failed at being a good husband,
but I hope you can be a good father.

287
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:29,305
Do you think I like what I do?

288
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:35,625
I'm doing this to pay for
Minjun's college and wedding.

289
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,953
I should just laugh it off.

290
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:41,567
Anyway...

291
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,250
Merry Christmas, ex-wife.

292
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,585
Same to you, ex-husband.

293
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:49,690
I'm leaving.

294
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,489
Okay, bye.

295
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,640
Oh, my Soojin. Are you home?

296
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:05,392
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

297
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:23,107
You must be hungry.

298
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:24,571
Come here.

299
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,442
Give me a minute.
Let me get changed first.

300
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:28,455
Okay.

301
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,234
Here.

302
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:02,550
Cheers.

303
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,973
What are we toasting to?

304
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,331
Christmas Eve?

305
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,134
And...

306
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,551
...to our...

307
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,540
...bright future.

308
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,848
I don't know what to say.

309
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:54,619
It took me a while to get to you.

310
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:56,969
But I will...

311
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,739
...fix my eyes on you from now on.

312
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:05,779
Cheers.

313
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,152
Oh, my goodness.

314
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,573
Thank goodness.

315
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,569
Welcome home.

316
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:47,198
I'm home.

317
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:50,255
Grandma. Father.

318
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,484
I missed you, my baby.

319
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:55,800
I missed you.

320
00:41:56,036 --> 00:41:57,513
Come here.

321
00:41:59,593 --> 00:42:01,152
My baby.

322
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,139
My baby.

323
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,717
Shall we have dinner, Mother?

324
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:09,200
Sure. My baby.

325
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,215
Let's have dinner together, okay? My baby.

326
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:21,410
Please eat.

327
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:25,345
I will. You should help yourself, too.

328
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,914
The halibut dish
doesn't taste as good as before.

329
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:40,388
We can't seem to make it
like Mrs. Choi did.

330
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,354
Try this.

331
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:55,801
You should try this too, Grandma.

332
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,162
How is it?

333
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:08,019
It's fine.

334
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,122
I mean the neurosis.

335
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,093
Did you know about that?

336
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:18,893
Of course, I'm your father.

337
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,662
Your grandmother doesn't know.

338
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,216
I see.

339
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,432
I haven't had...

340
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,532
...any symptoms of neurosis
after the accident, yet.

341
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:37,515
That's a good thing.

342
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:39,951
That's really good.

343
00:43:44,237 --> 00:43:45,070
And...

344
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:49,371
...the hospital director
temporarily filled your position.

345
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,359
Get back to work as soon as possible.

346
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,458
I will.

347
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,873
Why don't you sleep at the outhouse?

348
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:07,858
Yes, Father.

349
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:12,057
Grandma.

350
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:13,472
Are you asleep?

351
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,285
How am I going to...

352
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,530
...reply to all 192 messages
that you sent me?

353
00:45:10,957 --> 00:45:11,790
Oh.

354
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:12,971
My.

355
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:14,409
Venus.

356
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:16,601
Kang.

357
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:17,862
Joo.

358
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,483
Eun.

359
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:27,687
Kang.

360
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,626
Jooeun.

361
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:32,564
Kang Jooeun.

362
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:36,201
The girl...

363
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:38,058
...I'm dating.

364
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:39,988
...Kang Jooeun.

365
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:47,635
My goodness.

366
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,959
He's not saying anything new.

367
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,422
Something must be wrong with me.

368
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:54,549
Don't cry.

369
00:45:55,935 --> 00:45:57,789
Goodness. I shouldn't cry.

370
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:06,588
See you later.

371
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:08,118
Don't be late.

372
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,603
Ma'am!

373
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,044
Open sesame.

374
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:35,829
It's so good to see you, Jiwoong.

375
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,595
Oh, my!

376
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,433
I missed you very much.

377
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:42,827
We called and texted each other.

378
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,648
But it's been a while since
we met face-to-face.

379
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:47,063
You're right.

380
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,304
Where's Junseong?

381
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,447
He went to offer his mom... No, I mean...

382
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:56,496
He went to give his mom a gift.

383
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,298
Wow, your Korean has improved.

384
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:02,191
I'm a Harvard graduate. I'm smart.

385
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:03,683
Are you sure?

386
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:05,788
You were rejected by
the marines six times.

387
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:07,653
But I never give up.

388
00:47:07,787 --> 00:47:09,560
I'll try again.

389
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:13,765
We don't have much time.
Let's prepare quickly.

390
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:15,128
Junseong will be back soon.

391
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:23,014
Oh, your wounds have healed.

392
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:27,407
I couldn't bring myself
to watch your game.

393
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:29,263
I understand.

394
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:30,936
This is for you. It's a coat.

395
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:33,606
You already bought me one last year.

396
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:36,620
Take it. You wear that coat all the time.

397
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:39,745
Of course. It's from my son.

398
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:42,820
-Mom.
-Yes?

399
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:44,389
Mom.

400
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:46,996
What is it?

401
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,679
It might be too late at night...

402
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:51,826
...but would you like to go see a movie?

403
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:55,222
Youngho has returned, hasn't he?

404
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:56,462
Yes.

405
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:58,861
See? I told you.

406
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:01,726
Good things happen to those who do good.

407
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:05,604
I feel relieved. I'm grateful, too.

408
00:48:06,693 --> 00:48:07,762
Mother.

409
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:11,407
Oh.

410
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:13,350
-You're here.
-I'm here.

411
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:17,595
What's on your face?

412
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,294
Your son likes donating
and volunteering...

413
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:24,500
...so I volunteered
to deliver coal briquettes.

414
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:25,728
And what did he say?

415
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,178
"What's on your face?"

416
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,521
You've never ridden a van before, right?

417
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:36,599
Let's take my van and
go get something to eat. Just us.

418
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:37,782
Shall we?

419
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:40,651
Let's go.

420
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:42,727
-What?
-See you later, Junseong.

421
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:44,530
Mom.

422
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:48,570
Step this way.

423
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,403

Oh, that.

00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,696

00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:49,390
I'm taking care of my precious grandson.

00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:52,289
Why are you taking care of a baby
you didn't even give birth to?

493
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,118
He has his mom and dad to do that.

494
00:54:54,202 --> 00:54:56,542
They are cooking for me.

495

496
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,670
It's okay, my dear.

497
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:04,524
What's wrong?

498
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:08,879

even when I'm asleep.

499
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:12,458
Goodness. Your love is incredible.

500
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:14,638

00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:18,836
Happy New Year.

503
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:26,246
A year ago...

504
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:29,310
there was a person who acted fine
even though she was lonely.

505
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:32,125
Good boy. That's it.

506
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:37,114
But she isn't lonely anymore,
thanks to a new person in her life.

507
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:38,992
Look at how sweet you are.

508
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:44,003
I'm sorry, I'm late.

509
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:46,945
Junseong. What took you so long?

510
00:55:47,246 --> 00:55:48,079
Go away.

511
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:50,703
What? What was that look for? Wait.

512
00:55:50,787 --> 00:55:52,323
Me, too!

513
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,940
And someone got to meet
the one they'd been longing to see.

514
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,682
And someone...

515
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:16,330
...is with the one
they've been waiting for.

516
00:56:17,924 --> 00:56:20,062
It may be very simple and natural...

517
00:56:31,047 --> 00:56:34,180
...but I think the miracle of Christmas...

518
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:39,453
...may be you, whom I need by my side.

519
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:03,451
I don't think I can let you go tonight.

520
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:07,769
I never said I was leaving.

521
00:57:37,697 --> 00:57:38,530
This.

522
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:42,153
You saw it.

523
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:45,295
Of course.

524
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:47,998
This is what kept me going.

525
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:51,401
I'm sorry for making you wait.

526
00:57:51,925 --> 00:57:52,776
Jooeun.

527
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:58,922
Thank you for coming
sooner than I expected, Coach.

528
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:02,725
What did you wish for?

529
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,058
Not to be sick?

530
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,813
Not me.

531
00:58:12,886 --> 00:58:15,830
For you not to be sick.

532
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:30,329
I hope tonight will be...

533
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,458
...a restful and warm night.

534
00:58:40,132 --> 00:58:40,965
Okay.

535
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:11,929
A warm night.
