1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,532
I want to put this ring on you.

2
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:01,106
Could you come over here?

3
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:28,998
Goodness.

4
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,082
Jooeun.

5
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:43,448
I may hurt you at times.

6
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:48,928
It may also be difficult at times.

7
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:55,120
But I want to live with Kang Jooeun.

8
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,492
Forever.

9
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,311
Kang Jooeun is now...

10
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,682
...mine.

11
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,375
"Kang Jooeun's wish:
Youngho, Coach"

12
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,863
"Kim Youngho's wish:
Oh My Venus, Kang Jooeun"

13
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,499
"The Last Episode"

14
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:58,893
Stop looking at it.

15
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,468
You'll wear it out.

16
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:05,318
You called me wicked, but you're worse.

17
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,525
How did you think of
putting a scarf on a ring?

18
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,443
What?

19
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,874
You mean I put a ring in a scarf.

20
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,934
Wrong.

21
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,486
The scarf is the main gift.

22
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,286
You can buy the ring with money.

23
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:22,260
But this scarf was knitted
by you, stitch by stitch.

24
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:26,908
The ring is just an add-on to the scarf.

25
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,289
Bye.

26
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:34,732
Don't get out.

27
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:40,550
I told you not to get out.

28
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,327
Since you're so meticulous.

29
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,367
Oh.

30
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:53,333
Tell the sexy and cute things
in here that I'll see them soon.

31
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:56,627
But...

32
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,522
..why come to Minjun's house?

33
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,488
I want to show off my ring.

34
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,024
If you're going to be late,
then just sleep over.

35
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:09,437
And...

36
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:12,668
...as for my grandmother
and father, I will...

37
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,065
You are so impatient.

38
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,694
Let's take it step by step.

39
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,667
One step at a time.

40
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,713
I will live with you forever,
no matter what anyone says.

41
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:30,912
So let's make sure nobody gets hurt.

42
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:32,858
Okay?

43
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:45,002
The man dating Kang Jooeun
must be so happy.

44
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,078
He's so happy that he sees
me every night in his dreams.

45
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,026
He says that he is
filled with love for me.

46
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,366
Good night.

47
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:13,580
What's up?

48
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,055
-Hyunwoo.
-What?

49
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,767
-Oh, my head.
-What's wrong?

50
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,953
Oh, my head. It hurts.

51
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,257
Oh, my gosh.

52
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,791
I got...

53
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,486
...a ring from Mr. Sexy.

54
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:34,297
Are you here to brag about
your ring to your divorced friend?

55
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:35,262
Oh, my gosh.

56
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,398
But... the chairwoman of
Gahong wants to see me.

57
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:41,412
It's his grandmother.

58
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:43,452
Oh, no.

59
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:45,210
What if...

60
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,593
...she buries you?

61
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,200
Hey!

62
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:55,004
Break up with my grandson at once!

63
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,226
You impudent...

64
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,225
You scared me.

65
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,426
Hey.

66
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,144
Let's not assume that it'll come to that.

67
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:04,426
Was that too much?

68
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:10,527
Try doing it like when you met
your mother-in-law for the first time.

69
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,315
If my mother-in-law were
the chairman of Gahong...

70
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,157
...I wouldn't have gotten a divorce.

71
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,611
Seriously.

72
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,379
I'm really scared. What do I do?

73
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,614
Fine, I'll help you.

74
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,500
How old are you?

75
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,365
I am 33 years old.

76
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,814
What do you do for a living?

77
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,404
What does your father do?

78
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,116
I am an attorney.

79
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,810
My father...

80
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,130
...passed away.

81
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:54,097
I don't want to do this.

82
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:55,432
Why not?

83
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:57,410
It's making me sad.

84
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:01,180
What am I going to do?

85
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:04,197
Just give her some money.

86
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,609
Come to think of it,
my mother-in-law was happiest...

87
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,079
...when I gave her pocket money.

88
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,858
Are you ill?

89
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,678
She's the chairwoman of Gahong.

90
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,439
My entire life's savings
wouldn't be enough.

91
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,371
You're right.

92
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,986
The chairwoman is lucky.

93
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,160
That's it!

94
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:31,961
What?

95
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,335
That's perfect.

96
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,072
Humiliation is momentary.

97
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,298
What does wearing this change?

98
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,151
Your impression changes.

99
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:48,618
First impressions are critical.

100
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,751
My mother-in-law loved this outfit.

101
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,138
I'm glad I kept it.

102
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:55,989
But isn't it too old-fashioned?

103
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,458
The chairman is old-fashioned.

104
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,195
She's at an age where
she thinks this is modest.

105
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:05,819
I guess you're right.

106
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,210
I still don't think this is it.

107
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:10,230
Why not?

108
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,312
Give me another anti-anxiety pill.

109
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,701
You're taking too many of those.

110
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,747
You forgot to report before sleeping.

111
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:34,030
My bad. Good night.

112
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,139
I won't be sleeping well.

113
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:53,650
Someone named Jae Sunja is
here to see you.

114
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,749
Show her in, please.

115
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:08,787
I wanted to get you something
to show my appreciation.

116
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,255
Oh, you shouldn't have.

117
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,070
But thank you, Mrs. Jae.

118
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,787
I mean, Junseong's mom.

119
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:22,829
And how is your husband doing?

120
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:26,636
I went to visit him recently.

121
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,304
He seems much better.

122
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,129
He apologized.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,960
That's good. I'm so glad.

124
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:42,182
Rather than getting a restraining order,
filing for divorce and pressing charges..

125
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:45,600
...I thought it would be
better if he got treated first.

126
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,088
You were right.

127
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:53,134
I should've thought about
getting him treatment sooner.

128
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,149
Junseong seems very happy.

129
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,208
And I am, too.

130
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,885
I have my son.

131
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,942
And I like his cute girlfriend, too.

132
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,657
I wonder if I deserve all this.

133
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,284
You are more than deserving.

134
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,247
Thank you for this.

135
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:48,558
Come in.

136
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:55,729
What brings you here, sir?

137
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,557
I was in the area.

138
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,432
May I sit down?

139
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:00,611
Yes, please.

140
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:14,426
I thought you wouldn't be
back until next month.

141
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:18,046
I wanted to look over some
documents and the business plans.

142
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,817
I'm here through nepotism.
I don't want to be lazy, too.

143
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,354
I heard you were injured
a lot when you competed.

144
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,764
Yes, that's why I retired.

145
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,773
Where did you undergo rehabilitation?

146
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:40,167
Mainly in Japan and the US.

147
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:41,534
In France, too.

148
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,355
Why do you ask?

149
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:44,710
I'm glad.

150
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:46,057
Pardon me?

151
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,856
This is a business proposal for...

152
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,427
...a rehabilitation center
to be built next year.

153
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:59,875
The profit margin is low.
The other directors will not agree.

154
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,135
That's why I came to ask you.

155
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,304
To back me up.

156
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,204
Do you...

157
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,329
...trust me?

158
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,566
It's not you that I trust,
it's your experience.

159
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:18,697
A person who was stretched
and torn apart would know...

160
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:25,144
...that wounds don't heal that easily.

161
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:29,278
Just like cancer or other diseases...

162
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,426
...it is a long and tiring fight.

163
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:42,529
Oh, how is Mr. Choi doing?

164
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:58,181
Just a moment.

165
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,974
I heard you lost track of reality
while playing chess.

166
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,135
Let's meet at the office.

167
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:08,463
This is Kim Youngho.

168
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:16,697
It's your turn.

169
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:19,937
Check!

170
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:24,830
You got me. I have no other moves.

171
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,094
I've learned a lot from you.

172
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,486
I'm Kang Jooeun.

173
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,443
Wait a minute.

174
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,053
Miss Kang Jooeun has arrived.

175
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:57,504
Send her in.

176
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:27,113
If you're going to give me an envelope...

177
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,540
I want to give you one first.

178
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,451
It isn't money.

179
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:39,547
It's my blood test results.

180
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:47,186
I had hypothyroidism until a month ago.

181
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,902
But as of last month,
I've been completely cured.

182
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,253
I wanted to let you know.

183
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:01,033
You can give me enough money
to live on for the rest of my life...

184
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,537
...or insult and degrade me.

185
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,340
Even if you try to keep us apart...

186
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:09,651
...I...

187
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,824
...cannot leave Youngho.

188
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:19,068
No matter what you do...

189
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:20,827
...I'm going to...

190
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:26,218
...stick right beside him.

191
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,772
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,281
When you get old, you become stubborn.

193
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:45,029
Also, when you get old...

194
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:55,038
...you need to wipe
your mouth often.

195
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,171
Ma'am.

196
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:04,063
Miss Kang Jooeun.

197
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,512
Yes, Ma'am.

198
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,849
Other than that outfit, I have
nothing to object against.

199
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:16,409
Thank you.

200
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,130
I wanted to seem modest.

201
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,005
I'm sorry.

202
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,384
However.

203
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,539
I have a condition.

204
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,974
A condition?

205
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:36,510
I'd like to receive an extravagant dowry.

206
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,214
It's okay to be sick.

207
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,495
Just please come back to me.

208
00:16:58,906 --> 00:16:59,961
Just remember this.

209
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,072
If you're hanging in there...

210
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:05,348
...you haven't reached your limit yet.

211
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,538
If you believe it, you can do it.

212
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,124
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,477
I didn't tell you sooner...

214
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:20,806
...just how much I love you.

215
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:40,532
Yijin! Yijin won an award.

216
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,252
The Most Popular Celebrity Award. Look!

217
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,241
I see.

218
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:50,395
During her speech,
she said, "I love you, JJS."

219
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,125
It's clearly Jang Junseong. It's you!

220
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:02,002
I'm sorry. You're dating
a popular celebrity.

221
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,357
That's ridiculous.
Let's go to the gym.

222
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,625
Hold on.

223
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:10,194
"I'm your fan, you idiot!"

224
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:11,558
Stop doing that.

225
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:13,548
"You're an idiot."

226
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,652
Hi.

227
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,924
What is this?

228
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:51,385
Handcuffs.

229
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,249
Because you're my prisoner.

230
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,793
There may be others in here,
so don't barge in like that.

231
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,178
Did you hear my acceptance speech?

232
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,184
I heard from Jiwoong.

233
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,303
How long must I follow you around?

234
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:14,104
I like you more than you like me...

235
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,464
...so I followed you around
like a lunatic for a year.

236
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:20,107
Is it wrong to like someone?

237
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:22,144
You're starting to hurt my feelings.

238
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,402
Yijin.

239
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:30,846
What?

240
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,732
I don't speak comfortably to people.

241
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,674
I hardly call people by their first names.

242
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,741
What are you trying to say?

243
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,567
If a man does something
that he usually doesn't do...

244
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,537
...it means he likes you and...

245
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:42,454
Stop.

246
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:44,790
Oh, my.

247
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:47,687
Gosh.

248
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,390
If you continue, I might faint
because of happiness.

249
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,612
If you're not too busy,
come to my house after work.

250
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,545
You don't have to rush.

251
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:24,546
Jooeun.

252
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:41,228
I met your grandmother today.

253
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,048
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,497
Are you okay?

255
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,621
Your grandmother...

256
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:55,850
I'll take care of this.

257
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,153
My goodness.

258
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,626
You can't take care of this alone.

259
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:05,096
Your grandmother wants
an extravagant dowry.

260
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,333
What?

261
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:11,389
She didn't disapprove of you?

262
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,903
What did she mean by a dowry?

263
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,995
Daddy!

264
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,870
She... wants... a great-grandson.

265
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,514
What?

266
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,963
I've learned jujitsu for six months.

267
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:57,928
I have three stripes.

268
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,824
Your dimples drive me crazy.

269
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,352
You have three stripes?

270
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:12,412
You need one more stripe
to get a blue belt.

271
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:14,556
So what?

272
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,222
When you get the fourth stripe,
I'll consider it.

273
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:18,140
What?

274
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,904
For now...

275
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,723
...let's get physical in a different way.

276
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,950
You just tapped me. Okay.

277
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,420
You just wait until
I get my fourth stripe.

278
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,303
What do you think they are doing?

279
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,193
I'm coming in.

280
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,595
It looks like a love scene.

281
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,665
Or it might be an action scene.

282
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,896
Whatever.

283
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,542
You need four stripes.

284
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:29,169
Rascal!

285
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,287
Where's your dad? Tell me!

286
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:44,946
You surprised me.

287
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,517
Jooeun, please.

288
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,198
I have four stripes now.

289
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,832
Let me change my clothes first.

290
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:59,363
Why? You're going to
take them off anyway.

291
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:03,084
Did you really get this from an official?

292
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,040
I'll have to check.

293
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:04,957
Gosh.

294
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:07,187
We're visiting your family tomorrow.

295
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,425
What do I do about my dowry?

296
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:13,349
For now...

297
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:17,036
...let's just have a restful
and erotic night. Okay?

298
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:20,716
Okay.

299
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,039
Welcome.

300
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,080
Let us bow to you.

301
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:38,738
Ma'am.

302
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:40,487
Sir.

303
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:45,052
We celebrate the new year
according to the lunar calendar.

304
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,287
Let's just eat.

305
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,093
Bring her in.

306
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:04,596
Are you shooting a historical drama?

307
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,513
What?

308
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:08,074
Goodness.

309
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:11,940
Mr. Min?

310
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,172
Was that too much?

311
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,064
A little bit.

312
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:18,140
Let's eat.

313
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:32,023
Would you like anything else?

314
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,482
No, thank you.

315
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,020
We're okay. You can take a break.

316
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:38,938
Yes sir.

317
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,106
I think I have indigestion.

318
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,413
Really?

319
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:51,440
Do you need medicine?

320
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,041
It just hurts a little.

321
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:55,074
Give me your hand.

322
00:25:58,176 --> 00:25:59,009
Ouch.

323
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,095
I'm treating her. Don't get me wrong.

324
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,579
I didn't say anything.

325
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:08,776
Are you okay?

326
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:10,035
It hurts.

327
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,580
By the way...

328
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,475
...is your house always this quiet?

329
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,359
Yes, it is.

330
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:22,206
Since we have an important guest,
it's noisier than usual today.

331
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,782
Is this noisier than usual?

332
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,307
Where is Youngho's grandmother?

333
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:30,896
She's in her room.

334
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:33,660
Where's your father?

335
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:35,139
He's in his room.

336
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,730
Well, this won't do.

337
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:42,054
They approved of me as your wife, right?

338
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,676
I guess so.

339
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:48,519
What are you going to do?

340
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:07,281
Ma'am, Sir and Mr. Min.

341
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,861
I wish you all...

342
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,041
...a happy new year.

343
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,474
I'll take this opportunity
to sing a song for you.

344
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,272
Jooeun, please think about
what you're doing.

345
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,044
Mr. Min, cue!

346
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,255
-What's wrong?
-I think that's enough.

347
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:25,840
Grandmother, Father.

348
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:27,231
She is...

349
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:38,118
"If they come for me, tell them
that it's not my time"?

350
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,735
I couldn't finish the song
because you cut me off.

351
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:50,503
Are you telling me to live a long life?

352
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,355
Yes, Ma'am.

353
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,237
This song goes on until
when one is 150 years old.

354
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:05,477
"Let's live a healthy
and happy life together."

355
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,042
That's how the song ends.

356
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,547
But someone had to interrupt me.

357
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:25,364
Sing it again.

358
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:28,576
Let's take a picture to
commemorate the New Year.

359
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:31,274
Let's let Youngho's grandmother
stand out in this picture.

360
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:35,788
Sir, could you please
smile for the camera?

361
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,977
-Mr. Min, it's not a passport photo.
-It isn't.

362
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,541
What do I do?

363
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:41,313
You just need to smile and look pretty.

364
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,654
In one, two, three...

365
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,251
...cheese!

366
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:57,729
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

367
00:29:57,814 --> 00:29:59,842
You did a good job today.

368
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,095
I hope...

369
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:06,093
...they don't think I'm weird.

370
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,452
You were very weird.

371
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,411
But you did make them laugh.

372
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:18,431
I've rarely seen
my grandmother and father...

373
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,974
...laugh like that.

374
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,909
I'm still a bit worried.

375
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:32,564
The more I know you,
the more I find you amazing.

376
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,095
Listen, Jooeun.

377
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,753
It's because of the osteosarcoma?

378
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:54,953
That is why you are
reluctant to have a baby.

379
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,209
When I was young,
I always blamed my father.

380
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:13,985
He made me get surgeries
since I was really small.

381
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:19,189
I cried every day
because it hurt so much.

382
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,414
But he never let me skip
my physical therapy.

383
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:30,663
I swore to myself every night
that I wouldn't live like my father.

384
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:33,993
Now that I think about it...

385
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:37,076
...it's not because I don't want
to live like my father.

386
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:40,385
It's because...

387
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:43,335
...I don't think I can live like he did.

388
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,048
I looked it up.

389
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,151
And it's not likely to be passed on.

390
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:05,201
Even the fact that
there is a possibility...

391
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:06,640
...scares me.

392
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:10,495
Being sick isn't easy.

393
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,780
It's not just the children that suffer.

394
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:16,869
Their parents suffer as well.

395
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,806
I don't want you to suffer.

396
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:26,798
And yet, we take chances.

397
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,670
And yet, we keep our faith.

398
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:32,784
And we try our best.

399
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:36,333
Isn't that what life is all about?

400
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,896
There's nothing certain in this world.

401
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:48,895
You might trip over a stone when you walk.

402
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:52,524
We can't just give up...

403
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:55,496
...out of fear of being unhappy.

404
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,933
Right?

405
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,916
You drive me crazy, Jooeun.

406
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,742
A beautiful daughter that takes after you.

407
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,094
A son with a strong build
that takes after me.

408
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,343
I want to have children like that.

409
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,614
I want to watch them grow up...

410
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:24,484
...and talk about you to them.

411
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:27,268
I want to make fun of you with them.

412
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,027
I want to...

413
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:34,064
...make you into a daddy.

414
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:45,648
You know what?

415
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,627
You're incredible, Jooeun.

416
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:52,817
What do you say?

417
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,613
Do you want a son?

418
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:57,220
A daughter?

419
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,799
-Twins?
-What?

420
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:04,111
Goodness.

421
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:10,660
How about we have enough
to form a football team?

422
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:13,975
I can do that.

423
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:17,789
We've got to get busy then.

424
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,126
To our...

425
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,173
...bright future.

426
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:11,843
It took me a while to get to you.

427
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,245
But I'm going to fix my eyes...

428
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,015
...on you from now on.

429
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,638
It could be hard...

430
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:23,517
...for you to get pregnant.

431
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,668
Miss Oh Soojin...

432
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:11,729
...is not pregnant.

433
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,995
It could be hard for her to get pregnant.

434
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,709
I'm not pregnant.

435
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:36,441
There's no way I would be pregnant.

436
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:39,789
And I don't want to be, either.

437
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:51,734
Come in.

438
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:19,282
How did you know?

439
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,095
I should know.

440
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:25,317
I'm your son.

441
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,287
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

442
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:03,583
I'll be on my way now, Father.

443
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:04,984
Okay.

444
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:11,422
Thank you.

445
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:17,917
Come in.

446
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:35,413
Please...

447
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,784
...take care of my father.

448
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:40,718
Thank you.

449
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:46,057
Hello, Mr. Executive Director.

450
00:38:47,431 --> 00:38:48,927
I'm not that to you.

451
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:52,997
I'm your brother.

452
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,669
You need to work out.

453
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:18,829
Youngjun.

454
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:21,264
Yes, Father.

455
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:27,392
Go to medical school.

456
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,571
If both my sons treat me...

457
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,837
I will feel reassured.

458
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:39,693
Yes, Father.

459
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:01,093
What are you doing here?

460
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:02,844
Jooeun isn't here.

461
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:08,306
When I saw you last time, it looked
like you had carpal tunnel syndrome.

462
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:09,832
Oh, my gosh.

463
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:12,286
You came for me?

464
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:17,031
You need to go to the hospital
and take care of it at home, too.

465
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,393
Fine, I will.

466
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:21,795
I don't listen to my daughter,
but I'll listen to my son-in-law.

467
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:27,315
If it starts to hurt,
wrap it tightly like this.

468
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:29,129
It'll lessen the pain.

469
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,331
I heard you were very sick as a child.

470
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:42,507
A couple can share the pain.

471
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:47,290
And if you're together, it'll hurt less.

472
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:54,423
Thank you for giving birth to Jooeun.

473
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:58,593
And for giving us your blessing, Ma'am.

474
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:03,181
Please take good care of
Jooeun, my son-in-law.

475
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:05,594
I will.

476
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,686
You need to take good care of your wrist.

477
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,787
I will.

478
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:23,481
Hi, Soojin.

479
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:25,595
Congratulations on your exam.

480
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,285
You punk!

481
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:30,295
Let's go.

482
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:38,645
It hasn't been an hour since we parted...

483
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:41,146
...but I miss this woman so badly.

484
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,427
I miss her...

485
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:45,586
...and I can't hold it in.

486
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,376
I feel like...

487
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:50,787
...I'm the evil jerk now.

488
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,425
To you, I mean.

489
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,963
You knew what a jerk I was...

490
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,183
...but you waited for me and protected me.

491
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,033
Soojin.

492
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:11,424
You're still the same...

493
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,156
...as before.

494
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:23,696
"I'm sorry."

495
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,424
Women hate hearing that from their man.

496
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,388
So?

497
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,317
You're probably sorry again.

498
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,001
Soojin.

499
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:39,896
If you're going to apologize...

500
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:41,354
...do it over the phone.

501
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:44,474
I'm Woosik's attorney, Oh Soojin.

502
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:50,011
We just hugged and kissed a few times.

503
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:52,474
-Soojin.
-Even a 15-year relationship...

504
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:54,831
...can end overnight.

505
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,897
Did you think that we were
going to be together forever?

506
00:43:03,986 --> 00:43:04,863
Do you...

507
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:10,555
...want to come in?

508
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,399
Hi, Woosik.

509
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,203
Woosik!

510
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:17,499
You're hurt.

511
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:11,081
Why are you walking alone
when you have me?

512
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:15,684
Are you okay?

513
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:18,841
I'm okay.

514
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:20,351
Are you okay?

515
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:29,642
Let me say that I'm sorry...

516
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,796
...one last time.

517
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:34,513
Because...

518
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:37,543
..I'm a jerk who only thinks of myself.

519
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:41,583
Woosik.

520
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:45,286
I love you, Soojin.

521
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,522
Let's get married.

522
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:07,139
Don't cry.

523
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:14,960
Don't cry.

524
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:15,475
You said I need to lose water
weight for tomorrow's photo shoot.

525
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:18,284
Why am I doing this?

526
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:22,462
Running is the best way
to lose water weight.

527
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:24,357
What about my face?

528
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:25,783
What about my skin?

529
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,469
Sweating and cold air helps with detox...

530
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,242
...and it also lifts your face.

531
00:46:30,876 --> 00:46:34,267
You're abusing me way too much
just because you get to keep me.

532
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:35,993
Don't be rude.

533
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,742
And I'm not sure about keeping you.

534
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:40,726
Hey, you!

535
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:47,372
Go, go, go!

536
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:49,691
You're not going to keep me?

537
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,109
I don't know about that.

538
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,462
We'll pose like this. Okay?

539
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,735
Wow. Ma'am!

540
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:00,564
Wow.

541
00:47:18,438 --> 00:47:21,408
The chaste, pure and modest Kang Jooeun.

542
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,577
Doesn't the bride usually...

543
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:25,264
...wear white?

544
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,419
Is there a law that says
a bride must wear white?

545
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,350
Shall we begin?

546
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:32,453
Mr. Min, too.

547
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:34,075
Let's go.

548
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,405
Come on, let's go. Relax.

549
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:42,682
Here we go.

550
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,444
Hold on. Hold on.

551
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:50,657
Whiff! Whiff!

552
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,415
That's good.

553
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:58,329
-Okay.
-Look cool.

554
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:23,811
Hit him harder.

555
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,731
-Kiss. Kiss.
-Kiss. Kiss.

556
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:37,194
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

557
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:41,580
Hey!

558
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:48,554
This is Kim Youngho.

559
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:51,548
Don't look.

560
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:55,815
I'll have the Greek salad.

561
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:57,245
Without the dressing.

562
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,961
It won't taste good without the dressing.

563
00:49:01,045 --> 00:49:02,873
You don't eat food for flavor.

564
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:10,321
Do you want to eat with me
or do you want to kiss me?

565
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,239
What?

566
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:22,493
I'm starving, Minjun.

567
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:36,045
Oh, my.

568
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:39,596
My nephew is...

569
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:41,598
...all grown up now.

570
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,585
I'm Im Woosik.

571
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:45,228
Nice to meet you.

572
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,492
Did you just lick my hand?

573
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:53,892
-I was talking, but you...
-Hush.

574
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,902
Excuse me.

575
00:50:04,589 --> 00:50:07,390
Well... I'll lose weight soon.

576
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:14,251
-Hey.
-Go, go.

577
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,866
I feel bad for Ma'am.

578
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,906
She's the same as before.
She isn't losing weight.

579
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,664
Miss Kang.

580
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,681
I'm not okay.

581
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,626
Could you all face forward?

582
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:41,952
Come in.

583
00:50:48,664 --> 00:50:51,315
"Snack Restaurant"

584
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,260
"Summer of 2016"

585
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,516
Hello, Grandma.

586
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:11,026
I just got to the airport.

587
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:14,243
I'll be right over. Okay.

588
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:16,484
Salute!

589
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:21,250
Private Kim Jiwoong.
I have been granted leave.

590
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,597
-Jiwoong!
-Ma'am!

591
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:24,667
You got so much prettier.

592
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,292
-Did I?
-Wow!

593
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:31,033
Youngho, a man who is weak toward
sick people and those in danger.

594
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:34,759
My one and only coach
in the entire world.

595
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:36,751
With three months left
before our wedding...

596
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,896
...he went to a foreign land that suffered
from a flood to provide medical relief.

597
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,078
Why isn't he coming out?

598
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:43,701
I don't know.

599
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:45,870
-Jooeun.
-Jiwoong.

600
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:47,613
Junseong.

601
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,915
And today, he returns home.

602
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:01,023
Surprise!

603
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,175
I'm 3 months pregnant.

604
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:09,933
Congratulations.

605
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:12,332
We're going to be uncles!

606
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:18,292
Really?

607
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:25,848
How far along are you?

608
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:28,146
-Three months.
-Three months?

609
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:33,861
How much weight did you put on?

610
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:35,762
I've gained 26 kilograms.

611
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,479
I need to eat well and rest well.

612
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:42,246
For our strong babies.

613
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,065
Babies?

614
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,645
We have twins.

615
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:54,347
-Twins.
-They have twins.

616
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:56,455
Two.

617
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:00,659
I'm happy, but...

618
00:53:01,922 --> 00:53:03,275
I'm so happy, but...

619
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,417
Let's go exercise.

620
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,407
I didn't eat for myself.

621
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,505
Our strong babies were so hungry.

622
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,309
Our strong baby... I mean...

623
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:16,790
Our babies don't even weigh
100 grams in total.

624
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:18,967
How will you fit into your wedding dress?

625
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:20,164
I won't delay the wedding.

626
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:22,921
-I never asked you to.
-Then what?

627
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,027
You'll wear one looking like that?

628
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:27,029
It's very Venus-like.

629
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:29,215
Don't you know that
Venus is the goddess of...

630
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:31,627
...beauty and abundance?

631
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:33,534
How could this happen....

632
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:35,512
...in just one month?

633
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:39,396
Because I'm Kang Jooeun,
and I can do anything.

634
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,529
You never let me put my guard down.

635
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:44,585
-Get my bags.
-Okay.

636
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:45,534
Yes, Sir.

637
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:46,525
Let's go.

638
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:48,829
Darling.

639
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:50,613
It'll be a disaster when
you reach full-term.

640
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:51,951
Honey.

641
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:53,503
It'll be difficult when you give birth.

642
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:54,448
Jeez!

643
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:56,834
What about my kiss?

644
00:53:59,138 --> 00:53:59,971
Goodness.

645
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:03,097
You really are cute.

646
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:07,610
Where did my dimples go?

647
00:54:08,192 --> 00:54:10,602
Oh, that. It'll be back soon.

648
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:12,937
Since you're back, Coach.

649
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:18,825
Let's go work out.

650
00:54:19,698 --> 00:54:21,525
Darling.

651
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,494
-Are the babies strong?
-Yeah.

652
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:27,703
There are about 500,000 men
with the last name Kim.

653
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:30,171
The most common first name is Youngho.

654
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:34,800
To all the coaches,
who may seem average...

655
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,177
...but are special and by your side

656
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:39,496
To all the Venus out there...

657
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,094
...who are wicked and bewitching.

658
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:45,100
Step outside of your world.

659
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,164
-Boarding.
-Boarding.

660
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,153
-Take off.
-Take off.

661
00:55:06,956 --> 00:55:07,905
Does that hurt?

662
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:27,294
It won't hurt any more. Trust me.

663
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:31,214
How do you know that?

664
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:34,442
Because if you believe it, you can do it.

665
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,991
"Thank You for Watching 'Oh My Venus'"

666
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:54,511
Please make sounds that
are appropriate in hotels.

667
00:56:58,739 --> 00:56:59,572
Cut.

668
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:05,552
I held the phone upside down.

669
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:08,868
-Cut.
-Okay.

670
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:12,729
Sis, if you take this... No, not Sis.

671
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,466
Let's fix that mask.

672
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,738
Cut!

673
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:24,196
Take them all down.

674
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:25,228
I'll go get the car.

675
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:26,747
When the tea comes out,
bring it to the car.

676
00:57:27,605 --> 00:57:28,568
Gosh.

677
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,949
-What?
-Cut.

678
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,873
Wait a minute.

679
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,523
Cut.

680
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:42,167
Buy her a nice dinner.

681
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:49,097
It's your fault for coming back
looking so beautiful and sexy.

00:57:54,312 --> 00:57:55,951
-Thank you!
