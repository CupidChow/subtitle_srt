00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,306
"Episode 12"

2
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:24,725
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,426
Coach?

4
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,609
What is the star of
the ceremony doing here?

5
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,012
What should I do?

6
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,214
I think...

7
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,952
I'm going to be very late.

8
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,624
People are waiting.

9
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:35,362
Your father and grandmother.
Junseong, Jiwoong and everyone.

10
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,470
Get up.

11
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,672
Kang Jooeun.

12
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,876
You're still hanging in there,

13
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,979
so you haven't reached your limit yet.

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,680
What?

15
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,483
I can still do it.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,885
That means I haven't reached my limit yet.

17
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,162
Look at me.

18
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,567
If you believe it, you can do it.

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,769
Because you believe that you can.

20
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,704
If I believe it, I can do it.

21
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,007
I believe that I can.

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,681
Where is he?

23
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,284
What's happening?

24
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,827
Executive director, Kim Youngho...

25
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,429
...has just arrived.

26
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,127
Please welcome the new executive
director, Kim Youngho.

27
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,508
Hello, everyone.

28
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,511
I am Kim Youngho,
the new executive director...

29
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,912
...of Gahong Medical Group.

30
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,379
Oh! Yijin!

31
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,781
Hi.

32
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,582
What brings you here?

33
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,386
No, no. It wasn't me this time.

34
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:52,659
You didn't look me up. I'm the commercial
queen and my parents own Jang Foods.

35
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,261
Really?

36
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,063
If there's anything we want to eat,
we should ask her.

37
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,867
We're all friends now, aren't we?

38
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,275
Are you upset because I'm rich?

39
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,977
You dislike so many things.

40
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,779
But whatever.

41
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,482
We've slept together already.

42
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,484
What?

43
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,785
What? Junseong.

44
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,587
You are a man.

45
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,591
Please keep your distance.
People will stare.

46
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,694
Does that bother you?

47
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,297
Isn't that how your job is?

48
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,569
Oh, my. You're so cool.

49
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,583
Hi, Namcheol.

50
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,384
Is it over?

51
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:56,089
No one told you not to come.
Why are you at home?

52
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,859
Why do you keep doing that?

53
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,263
Where's Youngjun?
He should have come.

54
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,866
The States isn't that far.

55
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,269
It's not like this is a place
where he can't set his foot in.

56
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,173
Forget it.

57
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,575
Kim Youngho...

58
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,078
...was inaugurated as
the executive director.

59
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,767
I am fine, Youngjun.

60
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,369
It's okay.

61
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,571
It's okay.

62
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,182
-He's coming.
-He's coming!

63
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,286
-Are you now the executive director?
-Do you admit to being John Kim?

64
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,264
-Is it true about Anna Sue?
-Is it true?

65
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,365
-Please give us a statement.
-Mr. Kim!

66
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,870
If you submit your questions to
the secretary's office in Gahong,

67
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,670
we will answer all your questions.

68
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,539
-Good work.
-Thank you.

69
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,524
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yes, Ma'am.

70
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,327
-Good work today. Bye.
-Thank you.

71
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,428
Good night.

72
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,041
I thought you left.

73
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,845
There was something I forgot to tell you.

74
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:09,649
Today,

75
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,018
you looked very pretty.

76
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,855
Enough for me to dream of you every night.

77
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,657
Was that it?

78
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,799
It doesn't look like you're
going to be Cinderella,

79
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,901
if you take your shoes off
instead of putting them on.

80
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:37,077
It doesn't look like you'll
be the prince, either.

81
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:41,047
The valiant prince is supposed to
help the princess put on her shoes.

82
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,351
Are you okay?

83
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,554
Look who's talking.

84
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,956
Why are your feet so big?

85
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,358
It's because I'm tall.

86
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,760
My shoulders are wide, too.

87
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,662
My hips, as well.

88
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,597
Exactly.

89
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,468
Why is this woman so big?

90
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,541
You'll need an X-ray to be sure,

91
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,311
but I think you pulled a ligament.

92
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,514
Go home and get some rest.

93
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,517
I'm going to the hospital
in my pumpkin carriage.

94
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,488
Thank you for bringing me home.

95
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,790
You should go.

96
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,461
You didn't drink a drop of water
the entire night.

97
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,965
That's why you're like this.

98
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,303
I heard from Producer Ko...

99
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,707
That you made sure I
didn't get in trouble...

100
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,776
...for disclosing the information
about Kim Youngho.

101
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,880
I didn't want things to get out of hand.

102
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,483
That was why.

103
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,954
Thank you.

104
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,956
First, you say you're sorry.

105
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,458
Now, you say thank you?

106
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,430
Don't look at me like that.

107
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,333
I'm not a nice person.

108
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,153
I'm cruel and heartless.

109
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,738
I'm an evil witch who
steals her friends' boyfriend.

110
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,640
No, you're not.

111
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,942
You're nice.

112
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,644
No, I'm not.

113
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,048
I'm not nice.
I'm not nice. I'm not nice!

114
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,650
So...

115
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,454
Don't look at me like that.

116
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,763
Do you remember that day?

117
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,167
You passed your exams
and went on that blind date.

118
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,972
Your pride was hurt and you were crying,

119
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,076
but when you saw my wounded hand,
you said something.

120
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,248
Let's go.

121
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,555
Woosik, you're hurt.

122
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,461
Do I look like the same person now?

123
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,363
Don't you see me now?

124
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,574
I'm sure you hated me because of
the stalker incident,

125
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,577
but you were the first
one there to help me.

126
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,682
You knew what a jerk I was,

127
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,383
but you waited for me,

128
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,785
and protected me.

129
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,188
Oh Soojin.

130
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,615
You are the same...

131
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,327
...as before.

132
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,307
What to do?

133
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,170
The only thing I can say to you...

134
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,079
...are sorry and thank you.

135
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,880
That's all I can do.

136
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,403
Mind your head.

137
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,940
-Wait, it hurts.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

138
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,007
There you go.

139
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,078
Are you okay?

140
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,081
They said it'll get better
after a few days.

141
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,984
My shoulders and arms hurt more
than my ankle.

142
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,253
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

143
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,757
Thank you for being overprotective of me.

144
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,860
Who's here?

145
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,663
Mom.

146
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,665
Jooeun.

147
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,369
These are the guys that I work out with.

148
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,670
I sprained my ankle.

149
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,672
-What?
-They brought me home.

150
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,574
-Hello.
-Hello.

151
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,977
That means, she's ma'am's mommy.

152
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:15,982
-I love you. Come here.
-Goodness. Welcome to Korea.

153
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,884
Nice to meet you.

154
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,287
We'll see you again.

155
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:25,291
Where are you going? I can't let
guests leave that way. Wait a moment.

156
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,000
Ma'am, is she wearing Youngho's clothes?

157
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,702
Mom, why are you wearing that?

158
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,905
It's so comfortable.

159
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,707
Is this what you wore when you were fat?

160
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,111
-What are you going to make?
-Just wait.

161
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,613
The guests need to eat something.

162
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,915
Nice.

163
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,784
-Here it is.
-Wow.

164
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,085
Mom.

165
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,388
They need to watch their diet.
They work out.

166
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,891
That's good.
They need to eat well, then.

167
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,696
It's not like that.
We'll eat the lean part of the meat.

168
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,832
Thank you.

169
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,100
-Which part is...
-This part.

170
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,102
My goodness.

171
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,506
It tastes better when you eat
it like this. Here you go.

172
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,509
-Here you go.
-Yes.

173
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,710
Thank you.

174
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:26,385
My goodness. Look at the two of you.
You are both so adorable.

175
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,455
-This is delicious.
-Yes.

176
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,757
Why don't you eat?

177
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,359
No.

178
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,763
You look fine. All the girls on
TV look like they're starving.

179
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,233
That's not true.

180
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,733
You should eat a little.

181
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,331
My goodness.

182
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:44,937
Then...

183
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,406
Should I eat just a little bit?

184
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,509
I'll eat the lean part, too.

185
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,310
You can dip it in salt.

186
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,412
-Junseong.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

187
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,413
We have some gatkimchi.

188
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,016
Did she just say "god kimchi"?

189
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,286
No, that's not what she said.

190
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,124
I should be thankful that I didn't
gain more weight. Look at all this.

191
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,301
The kimchi is just right to eat.

192
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,035
-Let's eat.
-Wow.

193
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,638
Try it, Jiwoong.

194
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:19,907
Is it spicy?

195
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:37,523
My leg is okay. How is your leg?

196
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,228
I heard you ate chicken.
Bad girl.

197
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,668
There's an exception
when I'm with my mom.

198
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,770
If I don't eat what she gives me,
she bugs me all day.

199
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,475
I'm officially starting work tomorrow.

200
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,244
Tell Minjun's mother,

201
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,446
that I'm no longer unemployed.

202
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,550
Now you get to earn your keep.

203
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,654
As someone who has been working
longer than you, here's some advice.

204
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,156
It's not easy to make money.

205
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,560
I hope your leg won't bother you.

206
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,362
I'm going to beat that...

207
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,564
...neurosis thing that you have.

208
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,971
It's not something you can cure.

209
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,975
So I can't be concerned about you?

210
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,545
Even when he's in pain,
he's still so consistent.

211
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,215
That's what the doctor said.

212
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,553
He might have been wrong.

213
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,157
Put a pillow under your sprained ankle
when you sleep.

214
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,459
Not too high, though.

215
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,366
Yes, Coach.

216
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,668
Good night.

217
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,265
Today,

218
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,644
you looked pretty.

219
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,246
Enough for me to dream of you every night.

220
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:12,218
I have to sleep, but I can't help it.

221
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,325
I can't stop envisioning you.

222
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,727
I guess I don't need
to text Woosik anymore.

223
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:33,305
You stay up to text him
and he makes you smile.

224
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,909
That's enough.

225
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,423
I'll cook some ox knee soup
before I leave.

226
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:42,648
Make sure to eat it to the last drop.

227
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,451
Oh my goodness.

228
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,220
I'm so exhausted.

229
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,525
You should take care of your knees.

230
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,827
Have your wrist treated, too.

231
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,333
Come to my office tomorrow.

232
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,835
-I'll accompany you to the hospital.
-They have hospitals in Daegu too.

233
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,439
Let's just go to sleep now.

234
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:24,757
What's that?

235
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,760
Ma'am's mom gave it to us yesterday.

236
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,762
It tastes incredible.

237
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,798
"Here you go. Eat up."

238
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,201
Lawyer Kang looks exactly like her mom.

239
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,202
Really?

240
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:44,777
Well.

241
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,179
It's a bit salty.
You need to reduce your salt intake.

242
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,419
That's right.

243
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,622
Students who get bad grades
always cram the night before their exam.

244
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,923
Don't overwork yourself before the game.

245
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,026
I won't.

246
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,628
-Keep monitoring his condition.
-Yes, Sir.

247
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,881
I'll only be available on weekends
from now on.

248
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,399
Youngho, we are not babies.

249
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,701
Don't worry.

250
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,170
You don't have to worry about us so much.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,672
Are you saying you don't need me?

252
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,080
Since I'm eating the dish that Ma'am's
mom cooked, I'm starting to miss Ma'am.

253
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,182
Oh my Venus.

254
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:25,985
She's mine.

255
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:27,988
I'm leaving.

256
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,395
He's changed.

257
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,607
I'm sorry about your ankle.

258
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,609
Is it serious?

259
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
No.

260
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,413
They said it would get better
in a few days.

261
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,517
The morning meeting has been canceled.

262
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,420
-Why?
-Miss Oh is absent.

263
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,423
What's wrong with her?

264
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:08,627
She didn't mention anything yesterday,
but she isn't answering her phone.

265
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,098
I see. She must have her reasons.

266
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,101
-I'll get you coffee.
-Thank you.

267
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,306
What happened to her?

268
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,309
I'm not in a position to worry about her.

269
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:31,317
Congratulations!
It's officially your first day.

270
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,786
Goodness.

271
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,287
That's too sweet of you.

272
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,541
The public relations team
and the legal team...

273
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:43,963
...are working on paper work
to deal with the scandal.

274
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:49,668
The legal team is also dealing with
exaggerated and speculative reports.

275
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,971
We've controlled...

276
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,672
...what's being said
outside the company...

277
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,275
What's being said inside Gahong
depends on how I do.

278
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,278
I was born with a silver spoon in my
mouth and that's how I got this position.

279
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,982
This is the business plan for next year.

280
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,116
Also,

281
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,411
the chairman...

282
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,621
...seems to know about Jooeun.

283
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,796
The board members are here for
the morning meeting.

284
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,198
Please let them in.

285
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,943
-So we are now...
-I'll see you tomorrow.

286
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,045
Mr Choi, listen to me.

287
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,147
I wasn't done talking.

288
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:51,697
You look like you've been
working out for quite some time.

289
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,170
I looked like that
about 10 years ago.

290
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,273
Oh! Do you play golf?

291
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,776
We should hit some balls.

292
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:05,377
I prefer...

293
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,380
...contact sports.

294
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,917
And I prefer to lift rather than hit.

295
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,821
Well, then.

296
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:28,028
Did you eat?

297
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,438
I just finished.

298
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,139
How did you know?

299
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,080
Was it too obvious that
I was waiting for his text?

300
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,351
I should video call you.

301
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,655
I can just screen your call.

302
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,064
How's your ankle?

303
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:05,170
It's better.
I'm working now sitting decently.

304
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:06,872
I'm fine.

305
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,576
Yes, Hyunjeong?

306
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,551
You must be redefining
the word "decently".

307
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,657
I thought you finished eating. Liar.

308
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,463
Lunch time isn't over yet,

309
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:32,965
so get up.

310
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:48,380
What is this?

311
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,349
Is he really here?

312
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,890
-Lawyer Kang, are you all right?
-Yes.

313
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,461
It isn't my ankle that is
making me uncomfortable.

314
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,963
Jooeun feeling uncomfortable is
my business.

315
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,399
Jooeun's ankle is also my business.

316
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,468
I'm going to be busy.

317
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,172
Hi, Hyunjeong.

318
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:15,750
Lawyer Kang.

319
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,044
This is Jo Hyunjeong.
She works with me.

320
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,514
Hello. Please take good care of her.

321
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,017
I will.

322
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:25,417
You may go.

323
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,518
Okay.

324
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,622
Are you running for office?

325
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,225
Where are we going, anyway?

326
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,828
Since we started it,

327
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,930
we should see an end to it.

328
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,034
Let's have our restful
and erotic night another time.

329
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,537
It's still daytime.

330
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,740
Lift your arm higher.

331
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,343
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.

332
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,685
But...

333
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,929
Please, don't speak.

334
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,060
In accordance with Article 12 of
the constitution...

335
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:24,478
What else could I do?

336
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,714
Do you want me to measure you? I told you
that I wouldn't take no for an answer.

337
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,717
Your body belongs to me.
It belongs to me.

338
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,519
It belongs to me.
It's up to me now.

339
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,698
-Let's move to the next station.
-There's more?

340
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,201
What is it?

341
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:50,871
I need to see some blood.

342
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,073
Let's go.

343
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,278
I have a lot of consultations
scheduled today. I need to go.

344
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,647
Hyunjeong said you don't have any
until the afternoon.

345
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,250
You can work late tonight.

346
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,951
I don't want to.

347
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,154
You can't avoid this.
You have to go. Okay?

348
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,058
Darling.

349
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,166
No.

350
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,367
Let's go.

351
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,071
-I hate blood.
-It's okay.

352
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,540
-I'll buy you sweets after this.
-Darling.

353
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,950
Tell me when you're going to
stick the needle in.

354
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,151
Okay, I will.

355
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,653
I'm going through all this
because of you.

356
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,357
Hang in there.

357
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:48,994
You're doing great. Hang in there.
Breathe.

358
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,364
Slap her hard, so that it hurts
more than the needle.

359
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,143
Wow.

360
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,846
What's gotten into you?

361
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,349
You saw blood, so I want you
to taste some sweetness.

362
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:14,119
It's like candy after
a dentist appointment.

363
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,590
"Body Fat Percentage"

364
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:32,271
I lost all the weight that I had to lose.

365
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,273
You said I was pretty.

366
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,875
You should be pretty on the inside, too.

367
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,079
"Body Fat Percentage"

368
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,450
Goodness.

369
00:29:43,836 --> 00:29:45,250
You didn't throw that out?

370
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:48,387
I told you, your body belongs to me.

371
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,156
Why would I throw out what belongs to me?

372
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,460
Name, Kang Jooeun.

373
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,430
-Age, 34. Height 172 centimeters.
-Don't...

374
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,365
-Weight...
-Hey!

375
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:02,445
Come on.

376
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,638
You have the perfect build.

377
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,873
Build?

378
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,244
Your build is perfect for sports.

379
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,046
How did you end up studying?

380
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,152
Your body fat percentage is
normal. That's good.

381
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,555
It's good that you have more muscles now.

382
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,391
That best news is...

383
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,261
that you don't have

384
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,598
abdominal obesity anymore.

385
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,365
Really?

386
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,167
Good job.

387
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,071
What did I say?

388
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,675
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

389
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,076
May I say something?

390
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,144
The most important things are,

391
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,682
your hypothyroidism and cholesterol.

392
00:30:58,027 --> 00:31:00,125
If you work a little harder,

393
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,829
you won't need to take your pills.

394
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:06,131
Would you like to say something?

395
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:12,738
All the glory goes to Coach John Kim.

396
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,742
Don't be too happy.

397
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:22,615
Your hypothyroidism and
cholesterol must return to normal.

398
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:24,916
What's on the inside matters more
than what's on the outside. Okay?

399
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,318
Yes, Coach.

400
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,021
-May I eat this now?
-Just a little bit.

401
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:51,443
I made that halibut rice drink that
you enjoy.

402
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,447
It'll take some time for it to set.

403
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:00,721
Whenever your stomach isn't well, just ask
for the plum tea. They'll bring it you.

404
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,924
Thank you for everything.

405
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,227
Once I find a place to live,

406
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,830
I'll leave.

407
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,234
You can't lose the executive director too,
because of me.

408
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:19,638
It seems...

409
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,844
...fortune has turned its back on you.

410
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,748
Mother.

411
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,485
Although you didn't let me
into your heart,

412
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,592
I know you looked after my family...

413
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,993
...and my brother.

414
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,466
I owe you a lot.

415
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,971
It would have been nice...

416
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:57,342
...if your brother wasn't so greedy.

417
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,046
I apologize.

418
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,451
I'm a wicked old woman...

419
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:10,757
...who outlived her own child.

420
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,659
I'm a cruel old lady...

421
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,165
...who is trying to protect
her own blood line.

422
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,568
Think of me that way.

423
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,277
This is...

424
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:35,046
...to compensate...

425
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,749
...for your hard work.

426
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,523
-It's okay, Mother.
-Please, take it.

427
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:47,826
I couldn't give you my love,

428
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,130
but you took care of me
for the past 20 years.

429
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,832
Please, take it.

430
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,137
If I can't do this much for you,

431
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,940
I am...

432
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:04,142
...not even human.

433
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:18,857
Minjun went to Yoona's
and Sunja is in the kitchen.

434
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,559
What about your restaurant?

435
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,360
Does that matter right now?

436
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,065
I've been thinking it over,
and I think we should tell her.

437
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,515
-Stay here.
-Okay.

438
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:45,054
What happened?

439
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:46,952
Well...

440
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,753
It's okay.

441
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,635
Here.

442
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:10,395
You know...

443
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,578
...Jang Junseong,

444
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,082
don't you?

445
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,584
I was shocked, too.

446
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,686
I know...

447
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,090
...Junseong.

448
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,257
And what happened in the past,

449
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,248
Hyunwoo...

450
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,737
...knows about them too.

451
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,740
You don't need to worry about that.

452
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,742
This is why...

453
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,646
...you shouldn't sin.

454
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:49,948
Sunja.

455
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,151
A few years ago,

456
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:57,824
I heard a young man...

457
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,127
...came looking for me.

458
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,463
I thought...

459
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:13,938
...it was the person
taking care of my son.

460
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,210
I was so grateful.

461
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:23,483
I had...

462
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:25,986
...no right.

463
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,595
A mother with the worst luck.

464
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,692
It would do him no good to meet me.

465
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,600
It's not that I won't see him.

466
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,702
I can't see him.

467
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,705
Just...

468
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,209
Please pretend you don't know anything.

469
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,912
Junseong...

470
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,882
...grew up to be the
strongest man in the world,

471
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,985
and he's also a champion.

472
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,628
Why don't you...

473
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,740
...make up for it...

474
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,999
...by loving him more?

475
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,234
When you're ready.

476
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:18,737
And...

477
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,043
...it isn't all your fault.

478
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,848
Anyone in that situation,

479
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,751
could've done the same.

480
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,235
A few years ago,

481
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,569
I heard a young man...

482
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,671
...came looking for me.

483
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:55,673
I thought...

484
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,278
...it was the person
taking care of my son.

485
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,590
I met Junseong's mother
because he asked me to.

486
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:15,863
But I guess you already knew about her.

487
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:23,971
I'm very happy that
you are the man,

488
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:26,573
that I am dating.

489
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,148
Aren't you busy?

490
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,653
-If you're busy...
-I'm busy, so stop talking.

491
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,854
Be fast and precise.
How happy are you to be dating me?

492
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:45,690
Hang up.

493
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:47,892
I'll tell you in person.

494
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:50,697
Okay.

495
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:20,959
You could've just sent word
through Mr. Min.

496
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,561
If there is a next time,

497
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:27,434
I'll make an appointment.

498
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,339
What is it?

499
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,844
I can't sign off on the
VVIP medical exam center.

500
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:44,115
The location and subcontractors
seem problematic,

501
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:45,614
so I need to take a further look.

502
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:49,888
Too much is being invested, I can't
decide purely based on the documents.

503
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,857
It's in your discretion.

504
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,859
There's no need to ask.

505
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:56,928
Okay, then.

506
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,365
Your birthday is in two days.

507
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,471
The chairman wants to have dinner.

508
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,875
I'll meet you at home.

509
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:14,779
Yes, Sir.

510
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:58,890
You are invited to Youngho's
birthday and our Christmas party.

511
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,226
Youngho's birthday is on Christmas?

512
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,828
See you tomorrow.

513
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,731
-Okay.
-Me too?

514
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,932
Thank you.

515
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,033
I don't know.

516
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,835
I'll attend if I'm not working.

517
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:15,740
Christmas is busy for hot celebrities.
I have a shoot to go to.

518
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,310
Where are you guys?

519
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:41,766
Where did Ma'am say she is?

520
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:04,389
Hyunwoo.

521
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,193
-Where are you?
-I'm feeling a little pressured.

522
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:14,766
What should we do? It's Christmas Eve.
Should I bring some cards and games?

523
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,868
Minjun, pick something.

524
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:20,238
Let's just play Yut. It'll be exciting.

525
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,250
It isn't New Year.

526
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,477
It will be fun.

527
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:26,644
I'll head over after I buy the cake. Bye.

528
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,613
Mom, I want this.

529
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,314
That?

530
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:31,949
I'll take that.

531
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,856
-Mom, I want that too.
-What?

532
00:42:36,957 --> 00:42:38,156
Not if it's expensive.

533
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,024
How much is that?

534
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,227
You always ask for new toys
but you lose interest in a day.

535
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,531
That's it for your
Christmas present, okay?

536
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:47,532
Get over here.

537
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,736
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

538
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,840
Hello!

539
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:55,540
When will I get to live
in a place like this?

540
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,579
Minjun, let's eat until
our stomachs burst.

541
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,149
Are you looking for me?

542
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,551
You startled me.

543
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:08,853
-Hello.
-Hello.

544
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,854
Minjun.

545
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,568
Hyunwoo.
What is that?

546
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:18,763
I couldn't come empty-handed.
It's not much. It's just a cake.

547
00:43:19,075 --> 00:43:21,766
Wow. I forgot. Thank you.

548
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,672
Okay then, please come in.

549
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,805
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where's Mr Min?

550
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:29,707
He's a very private person.

551
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,909
He also has to go to my
grandmother's house later on.

552
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:41,085
It seems the reporters
have gone to Christmas Eve parties also.

553
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,957
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Wait a minute.

554
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,359
Come here.

555
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,663
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

556
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,067
Merry Christmas. Goodbye.

557
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,766
Bye.

558
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:56,968
Okay, everybody.

559
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,970
Let's go party!

560
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,872
Let's go, come on.

561
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:02,373
-Go, go!
-Cheers.

562
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:03,877
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

563
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,946
What's with the juice?

564
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,046
Instead of turkey,

565
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:11,349
we went Korean style. It's samgyetang.

566
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:13,251
-Wow.
-How's that? You like that?

567
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,354
Who made all this?

568
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,856
Really?

569
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:21,259
You both are really...

570
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,361
Your girlfriends must be so lucky.

571
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,366
-Wow, that looks good!
-Good choice.

572
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,172
My kid's right there.

573
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,574
It's Christmas.

574
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,047
Thank you.

575
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,926
-Try it.
-It's okay.

576
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,225
No!

577
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:59,130
We need to capture this moment.
Hold on.

578
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,733
-Get together. Minjun.
-Come here.

579
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,635
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

580
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:08,206
-Happy.
-Happy.

581
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,009
One, two, three, four.

582
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,912
♪ The shoulder carrying the bag.

583
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,118
♪ The shoulder, the shoulder.
The shoulder is beautiful.

584
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,517
Nice!

585
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:22,620
♪ I walk without a thought...

586
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,465
-The horses...
-The horses piggyback.

587
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:36,670
-Piggyback. Go!
-No.

588
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,869
-Gosh.
-Don't do that. Come down.

589
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,544
Yes!

590
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,543
-Yut!
-You did it?

591
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,247
Yes! Champion!

592
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,385
-It's Do!
-Do!

593
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,683
-Give me a Do!
-Do!

594
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:59,284
Oh, yes!

595
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:02,720
-Okay, that's enough.
-Ouch.

596
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:04,655
You can hit Minjun, too.

597
00:46:06,257 --> 00:46:09,236
What is my mom doing on Christmas Eve?

598
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:10,935
I'm cooking.

599
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:12,563
What about the others?

600
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,839
They're working.
It's a major holiday.

601
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,408
Is something wrong?

602
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:20,011
If something were wrong,
I'd be too crazed to call.

603
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:24,115
And if something is wrong,
will you fix it for me?

604
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,716
Are you an attorney?

605
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,318
Are you kidding me?

606
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:29,120
I'm the mother of an attorney.

607
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,424
I'll go to Daegu in the new year.

608
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,541
I'm sorry you have to spend it alone.

609
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:41,632
My goodness. I'm busier than you
on Christmas Eve.

610
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:45,936
Have as much fun as you can
while you're still young.

611
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,838
Bye.

612
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:22,273
-Don't feel pressured.
-No, no.

613
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,569
Why can't you do something...

614
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:29,480
Just because it's a day
when everyone should be happy,

615
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,582
doesn't mean everyone is happy.

616
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,884
Because everyone else is having fun,

617
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:36,454
someone feels lonelier.

618
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:49,667
Some people feel lonely,
but act like they are fine.

619
00:47:57,152 --> 00:47:58,843
This is Junseong's number.

620
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,444
Just in case.

621
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:02,747
Have a Merry Christmas.

622
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,817
For some reason,

623
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,113
some people can't meet
the one they want to.

624
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:21,265
Some people
can't go because of some reason.

625
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:25,503
The person you have called is
unavailable right now.

626
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:27,405
Please try again later.

627
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,904
And some people...

628
00:48:33,237 --> 00:48:35,713
...wait for somebody, regardless.
That's what this day is.

629
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,317
We all act happy and fine,

630
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,646
but...

631
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,523
...Christmas may be a day when
we miss somebody the most.

632
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:57,134
I should go.

633
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,337
It's my birthday tomorrow.

634
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,634
I saved you and helped you.

635
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:06,571
Didn't you max out on owing me?

636
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:08,746
You are an ingrate.

637
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:13,551
If nothing happens when you go
to your grandma's house today,

638
00:49:14,078 --> 00:49:15,553
come straight home.

639
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:18,722
To continue...

640
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:21,125
...our restful and erotic evening?

641
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:25,329
I'll wear a ribbon and wait for you.
I'll be looking sexy and lovely.

642
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:30,034
What am I going to do with
this bewitching woman?

643
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:38,008
What's wrong?

644
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:39,710
My mom...

645
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:43,013
My mom wants to meet me.

646
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,556
Hold on.

647
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,758
Take my car.

648
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,062
And...

649
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:02,760
...buy her a nice dinner.
The best possible.

650
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,171
I will.

651
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:09,440
Thank you.

652
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,941
Go on.

653
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,230
"My son, Youngjun"

654
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:39,370
-Youngjun, why couldn't I reach...
-Are you Kim Youngjun's legal guardian?

655
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:43,841
-Yes.
-This is the emergency room.

656
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,402
Excuse me, are you his legal guardian?

657
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,406
Yes. What happened?

658
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,341
Well,

659
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,144
he was brought here
because of an overdose.

660
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:23,247
It was critical.

661
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,451
We pumped his stomach,
so we'll see how he is once he wakes up.

662
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,732
Youngjun.

663
00:51:43,127 --> 00:51:44,935
Why did you do it?

664
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,238
How am I supposed to live?

665
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,335
Youngjun.

666
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:56,007
Youngjun.

667
00:51:58,176 --> 00:51:59,750
Youngjun.

668
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:29,747
What is this?

669
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,150
What...

670
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:34,852
What is this?

671
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:38,155
I'll call the hospital director...

672
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,184
...and have him check on him.

673
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:41,392
My sister...

674
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,794
...went into that rat hole...

675
00:52:45,383 --> 00:52:47,197
...and worked as
a housekeeper, like an idiot,

676
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,800
and raised her son.

677
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:50,901
But...

678
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:55,066
But what is this now?

679
00:52:59,403 --> 00:53:00,872
Once Youngjun wakes up,

680
00:53:01,405 --> 00:53:03,814
I'll get the whole story
and take care of it.

681
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:13,991
Namcheol.

682
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,004
Do you know why Kim Sungcheol married you?

683
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:31,308
If he hadn't married you,

684
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,512
he would have gotten half of
the shares for Gahong.

685
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,217
He married you so he could
hand down the whole company to Youngho.

686
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:43,821
Unless something happens to Youngho,

687
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,225
nothing will go to Youngjun.

688
00:54:00,502 --> 00:54:01,703
Where is Kim Youngho?

689
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:04,908
Find him right now!

690
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:12,616
Where are you now?

691
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,218
I'm home.

692
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:17,221
I was about to get dressed and leave.

693
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:19,650
What?

694
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,029
My mom...

695
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:28,632
My mom wants to meet me.

696
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:31,735
Hold on.

697
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,935
Take my car.

698
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,368
Junseong.

699
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,227
"Youngho"

700
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,940
"Junseong"

701
00:55:31,556 --> 00:55:32,329
Hello.

702
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:36,661
I got it.

703
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:42,339
Youngho, darling.

704
00:58:16,654 --> 00:58:17,959
Youngho!

705
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:23,800
Youngho!

706
00:58:25,396 --> 00:58:26,303
Youngho.

707
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:29,973
Youngho! Youngho!

708
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:33,310
Youngho!
