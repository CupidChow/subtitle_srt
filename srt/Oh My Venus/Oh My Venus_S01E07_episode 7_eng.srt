1
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,930
Because your body is mine, Kang Joo Eun,

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,200
you can't say no.

3
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,780
♬   It's me, even if I don't know how to express it, it's me,  ♬

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,000
♬  My eyes are only looking at you,  
For me, For me, For me  ♬

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,430
♬   Without even realising it, I...  ♬

6
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,790
♬  I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

7
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,000
♬   I get the feeling  ♬

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,550
♬   I get the feeling  ♬

9
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,340
Please take off your clothes.

10
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,370
What?

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,470
Here?

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,450
You should take them off when I'm asking politely.

13
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,010
You're not going to act all noble and pure?

14
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,100
Hurry!

15
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,850
♬  My heart trembles, my thoughts waver,  ♬

16
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,260
♬  I've got the feeling I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Take that off now! 
 ♬  It's you. Even if I try to be indifferent, It's you. ♬

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,220
♬  Drawing me without a choice, Oh my,   ♬

19
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,520
♬   Without realizing it, you, you, you  ♬ 
   Episode 7  

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,680
Sleep well.

21
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:10,180
♬   Love is you. Falling you  ♬

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,700
♬ I've got the feeling I'm thrilled somehow today,  ♬

23
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,970
♬   I get the feeling  ♬

24
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,500
♬   If you look at me, if you call my name  ♬

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,390
Good night.

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,430
♬ I get the feeling I'm not confident I won't laugh,  ♬

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,830
♬  Love is coming,  ♬

28
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,180
♬   You are coming closer  ♬

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,450
♬    If you look at me, if you call my name  ♬

30
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,700
♬   I get the feeling that I'm falling in love  ♬

31
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't get ahead of yourself, heart.

32
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,050
Ah, it's hot.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,040
  Symptoms of hypothyroidism 

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,200
  Weight gain, lack of energy. 

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,260
  Tiredness. 
 Constipation, cramps and stiffness. 

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,470
  Husky voice. 

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,400
  Heart rate decrease. 

38
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,050
Heart rate... decrease?

39
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,140
Ah...

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,020
Abdominal fat. Do 50 upper body raises now.

41
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,550
Up!

42
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,350
Yes, Mr. Coach!

43
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,220
49!

44
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,110
You lump of desire.

45
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,370
Your Ma'am hasn't gotten up yet.

46
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,010
Ma'am, wake up!

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,850
Good morning.

48
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,850
To Hyungnim Yeong Ho also.

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,930
Thank you for yesterday's gift.

50
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,260
Today's my turn.

51
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,500
 A gift? Something sweet? Or a kiss? 

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,850
 What is it? What is it? 

53
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,070
Ah, seriously, from the morning ...

54
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,360
What's with the perfume "from the morning"?

55
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800
I know, right. Why would I put perfume on in the morning?

56
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,180
I'll go take my medicine.

57
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,150
Or should I weigh myself on an empty stomach?

58
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,180
No, I'll take my medicine first.

59
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,800
On an empty stomach.

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,450
Ah, wait. Oh!

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,770
How can someone...

62
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,900
have no mercy at all?

63
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,120
"Mr. Coach"

64
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,890
Mr. Coach.

65
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,290
How can someone gain 1.8 kilos in one day?

66
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,830
I drank way too much water yesterday.

67
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,180
People have been telling me that if I lose more weight, I'll die.

68
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,130
You won't die.

69
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,010
It's not that. Every day--

70
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,520
Is your body only single use? Are you going to use it only one day and throw it away?

71
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,600
Since it's something you'll use for a lifetime, wouldn't it be better if it was healthy and fine?

72
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,260
I mean... It's not like you're even going to take me with you for a lifetime and live with me.

73
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,650
You're acting like you're taking such good care of me.

74
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,100
That's something we don't know about, and you're using casual speech again.

75
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,410
I know you have a soft spot for sick people but...

76
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,860
Do I still look sick to you?

77
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,100
Then... Do I look like I'm soft?

78
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,350
You're right. You're right, Mr. Coach.

79
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,100
Go.

80
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,320
Is that what people call a back hug?

81
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,990
Lawyer!

82
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,760
There is a commotion in the Vice CEO's office.

83
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,450
Why?

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,810
You want to solve this with money?

85
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,890
Do people with money think it's okay to hit other people and solve it with money?!

86
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,560
We wanted an apology, did we want money?

87
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,010
That woman, who is the daughter of Myeong Woon Electronics, didn't offer a single word of apology

88
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,700
to our blameless daughter who was insulted and assaulted.

89
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,270
But, "A wise decision?"

90
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,890
Since the media's got hold of it, and the word has spread, now?!

91
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,470
Who are you?!

92
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,920
I am Lawyer Kang Joo Eun.

93
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,100
If you do this here, it becomes more disadvantageous for you.

94
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,060
For now, let's get out of here.

95
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,180
Drink it when it's cooled down a bit. It's still very hot.

96
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,100
She was dragged around by her hair.

97
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,500
My child's face swelled up this much!

98
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,210
My daughter isn't even married yet. They say she threw a shoe at her, that woman.

99
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,900
It's a luxury goods store that only wealthy people frequent

100
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,350
and I know that my child is in the service industry.

101
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,570
Abusive language, disregard, that kind of thing is piled on by the boat load every day, but...

102
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,260
Please be calm, Mother.

103
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,900
This case, no, this matter, I know it well also.

104
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:49,600
But  then she sent, through that lawyer, a measly box of herbal tonic with ten million won ($10,000).

105
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,760
It's big money.

106
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,850
Even if we live frugally and save for over a year, it's hard to save that money.

107
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,350
Even so, she should apologize.

108
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,000
It's something a person did to another person.

109
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,560
If it's something a wealthy person did to a poor person,

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,880
it's wrong. That is wrong.

111
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,390
Please agree to a settlement.

112
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,730
As slowly as possible, and please ask for as much as you can.

113
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,800
Look here.

114
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,080
If you take your time, you will get an apology even if it's forced,

115
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,780
and the settlement fee will go up.

116
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,510
Those people won't change.

117
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,090
Even if it's small, even if you have to force it to happen, please get yourself some comfort.

118
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,410
Will that be possible?

119
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,220
That it's okay, that it will be okay...

120
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,530
Have the belief that you can do anything if you set your mind to it.

121
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,970
If you don't, you'll feel so wronged.

122
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,960
I'm sorry that someone who's a lawyer is saying all this to you.

123
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm even sorrier that this is the best that I can do.

124
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,530
For apologizing,

125
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,340
thank you, Lawyer.

126
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,880
 Aigoo! Why did you die? 

127
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,130
 Hey. Don't be that way. First, take this. 

128
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,690
 What kind of manners is this? 

129
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,440
 I don't care how much you give me! Bring back my husband! 

130
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,380
 That is... He lost his way and  

131
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,190
 he fell without taking proper safety precautions. 

132
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,690
 He was at fault more than anything. 

133
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,850
 What did you say? What is this person saying? 

134
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,180
 To be honest, the company really isn't to blame. 

135
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,670
 This money is the company's thoughtfulness. 

136
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,110
 What are you! 

137
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,640
 Are you a human being? 

138
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,100
 I am sorry for what happened 

139
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,270
 but take this while we're offering it. 

140
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,000
 Aigoo, my heart! 

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,090
 Aigoo, my Joo Eun's dad. What do we do? 

142
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,120
 If I don't have strength or powerful backing, am I not even a human being?! 

143
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,160
 Aigoo... 

144
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,770
 Aigoo! 

145
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,570
Yes. Mom, it's me.

146
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm really busy because of the opening! What is it now?

147
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,580
Why are you angry? Where do you think the money for the store opening came from?

148
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,150
What is it?

149
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,870
Is something going on?

150
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,990
No. I'll be there for the opening, that's all. When is it?

151
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,170
Well, let's do it this weekend.

152
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,250
Ah! Take that from her.

153
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,600
Oh, I will do it.

154
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,170
You're pregnant so watch yourself!

155
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,690
I'm sorry, Mother.

156
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,780
Oh. We're doing a ceremony so she brought the pig's head.

157
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,120
No, but why do we always have to use the pig's head?

158
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,920
Are you the pig? What's the matter?

159
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,890
But... You're a deaconess (at a church).

160
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,710
So if I am, can I not do a ceremony? Gosh.

161
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,260
 Why are you laughing? Am I a comedienne? 

162
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,970
You really are.

163
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,930
 Oh, be quiet and hang up. I'm busy. 

164
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,360
Really, she's the one saying funny things.

165
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,320
The opening, let's push it back to this weekend.

166
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,730
What are you talking about? Why are we pushing it back?

167
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,380
Your sister is only free on weekends!

168
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,910
Stop with the nagging and just know that.

169
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,830
What was it we used to say?

170
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,340
We said that we'll become great lawyers, didn't we?

171
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,230
Do you remember?

172
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,370
Vice CEO.

173
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,780
Do you remember,   Vice CEO ?

174
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,790
Don't you remember? I told you, if you want to go back in time to do it alone.

175
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,920
I also told you that it's something one of us has to do. Covering your eyes and getting upset

176
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,490
doesn't change anything.

177
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,700
I guess you had tea with the victim's mother.

178
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,110
It's good then. Make sure to get her to settle.

179
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,770
What did you say?

180
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,790
We'll give a formal apology publicly,

181
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,500
and this should be more than enough for compensation.

182
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,960
You really...

183
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,120
Aren't you going to apologize?

184
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,120
About taking Woo Sik away from me...

185
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,690
Okay, I will understand you, even if I have to be possessed by an angel.

186
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,700
- But— 
 - Since it's a personal matter.

187
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,300
Even if we exchanged places, although I'm speechless, let's be honest here.

188
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,170
I never took him away. He did it voluntarily.

189
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,660
Why? Do you feel wronged because he got taken away?

190
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,740
Does it feel horrible not to receive any love?

191
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,720
Another person is allowed to have what you used to have.

192
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,900
This is when you use the term, 'Blessing in disguise'!

193
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,700
You should have only changed on the outside.

194
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,250
Why did you flip your inside too?

195
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,380
You weren't this petty and immature.

196
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,650
Isn't the world immature to begin with— No,

197
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,150
I should say, simple.

198
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,970
Either you receive love or you don't.

199
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,130
You should be saying, either you love someone or you don't.

200
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,870
You said you don't want to ride the time machine.

201
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,160
So why are you on it?

202
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,330


203
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,670
 Seo Ji Yeon 

204
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,240
Are you still upset, Grandmother?

205
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,460
This kid. My heart was sick with worry.

206
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,100
Grandmother.

207
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,730
I... don't like hospitals.

208
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,590
I know.

209
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,150
Of course, I know.

210
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,850
You lost your mother when you needed her the most.

211
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,910
Grandmother...

212
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:56,230
Surgeries and rehabilitation... You spent half your life in a hospital.

213
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,450
But what can we do?

214
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:10,030
Your mother isn't here, and your grandmother's  death is approaching.

215
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,860
Baby. It's my last wish.

216
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,580
I will probably build a rare cancer center and work on building a rehabilitation center too.

217
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,500
Gahong, the company you and Mom worked so hard to build, I could end up losing it.

218
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,990
Yeong Ho.

219
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,590
Don't come here so often anymore.

220
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,060
It's not good for your joints.

221
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,310
I'm sorry, my baby.

222
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,020
Thank you, my baby.

223
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,820
Yeah, let's go.

224
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,620
- One, two, three! 
- Nice!

225
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,560
Ah! Good!

226
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,800
Stop, stop, stop. Let's rest for a bit.

227
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,050
Ah, I don't know what to say.

228
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,140
You mustn't overdo it. Your shoulder isn't perfect yet.

229
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,800
You saw. I'm doing well.

230
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,430
But Hyung Yeong Ho will—

231
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,410
Mr. Snake!

232
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,840
- Oh, it's Jang Yi Jin! 
- Jang Yi Jin!!

233
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,060
You can't take pictures of her here, I'm sorry.

234
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,430
Hey, Yi Jin. He's training right now!

235
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,950
You have to attend to your schedule as well—

236
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,330
I'm blinded by rage right now.

237
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,580
That man rejected me twice!

238
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,420
Oh! No way!

239
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,230
What is this for?

240
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,950
Aren't you cold?

241
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,820
Do you not know that? Fashion is all about wearing skimpier clothes when it's cold.

242
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,040
Tell me. Why did you reject me again?

243
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,060
- I didn't reject you— 
 - I'm Jang Yi Jin. I'm the most sought after for advertisements.

244
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,710
Does it sound like a lie because I'm telling you that myself?

245
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,080
I don't have the time to do advertisements right now.

246
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,190
Other people are dying to shoot an ad with me!

247
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,270
Why? Is something wrong?

248
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,370
I don't think we're that close.

249
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,570
I changed the agreement to do at least the print ads.

250
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,190
If I made you feel bad, I'm sorry.

251
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,990
What more can I do?

252
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,320
What's the use of being a champion when you're so slow at catching on things?

253
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:20,240
Miss Jang Yi Jin? Is... something the matter?

254
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,990
My pride is hurt.

255
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,130
What do I have to do for us to become close?

256
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,870
I am your fan, you stupid fool!

257
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,080
Uhh, excuse me--

258
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,440
Hyung, is something wrong?

259
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,380
What do you mean...

260
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,170
Hey!! Why are you like this?!

261
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:21,190
"I am your fan, you stupid fool!"

262
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,180
Don't  do  that!

263
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,740
 "Don't  do  that!" 

264
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,720
- "I am you fan, you stupid—" 
- Ji Woong!

265
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,520
Hyung. He's exaggerating.

266
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,590
Move aside! Move!

267
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,430
- Oh my!
- Oh the smell!  
- Oh my.

268
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,170
I'm sorry guys, I'll be done quickly!

269
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,180
How is it? Terrible?

270
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,630
Ma'am, did your bag poop?

271
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,970
What is that smell...?

272
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,490
This is the smell of hell. Hell.

273
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,400
Well, the tangerine got crushed and leaked.

274
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,850
Tangerine?

275
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,170
Last year.

276
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,100
Oh sorry. Oh Ma'am.

277
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,750
Oh, me... Me too!

278
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:25,160
What's the reason you're using a leather bag after washing it in water? Is it a name brand?

279
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,860
It's not that. It's the bag I carried when I won my first case.

280
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,960
I use it whenever I have an important trial.

281
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,250
It wasn't that bad even up till last month.

282
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,580
♬   Baby only you   ♬

283
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,870
♬   You are the only one, you   ♬

284
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,010
♬   You are my darling, you  ♬

285
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:02,460
An early congratulations on your win. With this kind of stench, it's going to be an all-kill! (win everything).

286
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,270
Burned to the ground. Reduced to ashes!

287
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,790
Aren't you going to have a Christmas tree this year? I'll hang this right up there.

288
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:18,390
♬   I was also unaware, falling you, falling you. I am falling.    ♬

289
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,150
♬   I love you I love you I love you  ♬

290
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,990
 Guys want to do other things with the girl they want to fool around with. 

291
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,990
♬   Hug me even if the pain is hidden, you are mine   ♬

292
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,270
I mean, if someone takes an action, there should be a reaction.

293
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,110
If this and that happened, even something little should happen.

294
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,910
Did he lose his memory? Am I the only one that did it?

295
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,570
♬   You will be my love forever  ♬

296
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,990
  Ma'am! Hurry and come! 
 ♬   My love which will last forever, darling you~  ♬

297
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,510
For our Ma'am, I found this.

298
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,390
It makes your belly fat melt down.

299
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,460
I don't have that much belly fat left anymore.

300
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,230


301
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,250
Ma'am, do you like to dance?

302
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,630
I do dance some.

303
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,870
That, that. It's like the Macarena from back then!

304
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,690
What? Macarena?

305
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,090
It exists. Only people from back then remember it.

306
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,230
Aren't you a young boy?  A young boy.

307
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,490
I need to go get some fresh air because of the smell.

308
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,830
Ah! Stress! My hypothyroidism!

309
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,610
Ji Woong, go!

310
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,370
♬    One two three, 1 2 3, I want you baby, come with me! ♬ 

311
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,190
♬    I gotta really really, gotta really really keep it comin'♬ 

312
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,050
♬    I gotta really really, gotta keep it comin' ♬     

313
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,910
♬    I gotta keep it comin', comin' my way ♬     

314
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,870
 You don't know the sweet taste of life to this extent.  

315
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:37,570
 For one day, I wish I could rest under a yellow light which is neither red nor green. 

316
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,890
 But, what do I do? 

317
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:11,730
 Your mother isn't here, and your grandmother's  death is approaching.  

318
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,490
  Child, it's my wish. 

319
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,250
 Chief Secretary Min 

320
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,730
 Where are you? 

321
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,510
On a hill in a neighborhood somewhere.

322
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,750
 Did you decide to accept the position? 

323
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:43,790
Since I'm going to get it anyway, I'm going to go all-in.

324
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,090
 I will handle it seamlessly. 

325
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,550
Legs shoulder-width apart.

326
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,160
I feel like I'm going to die, Mr. Coach.

327
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,950
You're fine, what about your legs?

328
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,790
Not my shoulders, but the width of your shoulders.

329
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,170
Even though it's not that wide.

330
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,690
 Was I dreaming last night? 

331
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,670
 He kissed me, so what's with this hard training situation? 

332
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,090
You're not having racy thoughts just because I have you against the wall, right?

333
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,030
Well, I'm sure you have your own reasons

334
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,050
world-famous coach, John Kim.

335
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:35,110
In this position, pretend someone's pressing on your forehead and without lifting your chin up,

336
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,130
for five seconds each,

337
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,830
and rest five seconds.

338
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,950
Another five.

339
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,610
Keep a proper position, since it's good for forward head posture. Remember the feeling of that position and do it often.

340
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,410
Something simple that you can do often is the best exercise. Since you have gained strength from aerobic exercise,

341
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:07,090
starting next time, we're going to work on your core. It's good for the spinal discs

342
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,590
and for abdominal fat, too.

343
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,190
Yes... Yes, Mr. Coach.

344
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,630
End it with some stretching.

345
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:55,330
Oh! You startled me. I thought your were a burglar.

346
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,490
Would a burglar give you something?

347
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,210
What is that?

348
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,730
Bag.

349
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,750
Why?

350
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,450
Because I don't like your smelly bag being in the house.

351
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,170
Even if I become a hippopotamus, I will eat up everything—

352
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,170
Because of the smell.

353
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:31,110
I mean... That is... What is this?

354
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,180
Asking to be saved is your buzzword, so asking me when you already know, is that your hobby?

355
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,390
This is a bag, and what we did last night was a kiss.

356
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,290
Ah, it's not like I'm asking because I don't know.

357
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,750
In America, people do greet each other that way.

358
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,050
Like that? No way.

359
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,650
Wow, seriously. This morning, you acted as if...

360
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,690
That's right. There is Anna Sue too.

361
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,270
Since you're noble and pure, you want me to be devoted to one woman?

362
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,970
Anna Sue and I are friends.

363
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,590
Of course you are.

364
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,690
"Chin" (near) and "goo", mouth. 
 ("Chingoo" = friend, but the syllables can also mean "near mouths" 

365
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,930
Last night, I thought I made at least that very clear.

366
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,650
What do you think, should I do it again?

367
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,690
You must be really crazy!

368
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,370
Why did you come out? It's not time for you to eat yet.

369
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,190
This jerk! To get him.

370
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,310
Why? Are you lonely at night?

371
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,170
Deng! I might get cold at night.

372
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:55,710
This jerk hates being cold the most.

373
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,850
♬   I'm getting a feeling somehow today I'm excited. ♬

374
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,010
Is something... wrong?

375
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,330
♬   I'm getting a feeling  ♬

376
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,050
I have something to say but it's not coming out so easily.

377
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,250
Are you going to throw your body away after today? Rest up and tell me tomorrow.

378
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,130
♬   Come to me. Look at my eyes   ♬

379
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,890
Sleep well, Daegu Venus.

380
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:31,140
♬    My heart shakes when you call my name  ♬

381
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,900
 I don't like to lose. 

382
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,020
Thank yo--

383
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,890
Thank you.

384
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:54,190
- Oh no! Air-raid siren! Three, two, one! Come on!
 - No.

385
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,390
It's not that one. It's a totally different one.

386
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,950
Smell this. Everyone. Calm down.

387
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,290
Ji Woong? Calm down.

388
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,570
Joon Seong, you really lost a lot of weight.

389
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,810
Isn't it hard?

390
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,790
What can I do even if it's hard? It's how I make a living.

391
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,810
Fighting!

392
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,730
Fighting!

393
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,350
What about Yeong Ho?

394
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,650
He's eating a little later.

395
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,030
Ma'am, it's because your bag pooped yesterday.

396
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,170
Ji Woong!

397
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,700
Is he... hurt somewhere?

398
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,200
Don't worry.

399
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,610
Let's head out! Fight! Win! Hey! Fighting! I'll be back!

400
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,070
 The Story of My Grandfather Who Escaped 

401
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,850
 Courthouse 

402
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:22,430
 Koong, koong. Use the stairs only when you're going up. 

403
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,030
 It's not good  for your joints, coming down, because of your weight. 

404
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,550
The nagging.

405
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,350
♬   Even if he's not here  ♬

406
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:38,790
Yes, Hyun Jung. I don't know when I surpassed three wins out of five, 50% winning average.

407
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,360
Oh, Thank you!

408
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,510
Oh, Hyeon Woo.

409
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,230
What?

410
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,230
Ah, Min Joon's grandmother is hospitalized in the ER.

411
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,450
No matter what she says, I won't stand by and say nothing.

412
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,810
That's why I'm calling you, but could you help Min Joon at the kindergarten?

413
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:05,970
Ah, whenever I call my ex-husband to get some help, I can never reach him!

414
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,050
It's not that. I understand your situation,

415
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,550
but what do you mean, experience your parents' work?

416
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,190
How do I explain what a lawyer is? To kindergartners at that?

417
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,620
I'm confused myself.

418
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,490
You have to bring the dad, too?

419
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:26,030
Both of the parents have to be there. Ah!

420
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,030
That PD Go, seriously. Isn't anyone selling a dad somewhere?

421
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,390
Oh, I got it. First,

422
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,910
I'll take the afternoon off, so you go to Min Joon's grandmother. Okay.

423
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,490
Drive safely.

424
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,920
Joon Seong! I'm very sorry...

425
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,250
What?

426
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,590
To the sprouting children, the dreams and hopes...

427
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,230
Ah, well. It's a good thing to do.

428
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,210
Kindergarten?

429
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,770
Friends!  What is today?

430
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,050
Today is the day you get to experience your parents' work. 
 - Min Joon! I'm here!

431
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:28,110
Earlier, we experienced Bong Gyeong's parent's work as a PD at the broadcasting station. Wasn't it fun?

432
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,890
In the developing child, I see your face.

433
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,980
Now that I see them, I miss the old days.

434
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,100
Is everyone ready?

435
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,910
It's because we got the prenatal education together.

436
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,610
In the morning, I heard you were worried about me.

437
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:49,870
That is... If you're sick, it affects what happens to my body.

438
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,230
Your bag is pretty.

439
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,110
The one carrying the bag is even prettier.

440
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,510
Did you win?

441
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,470
Of course.

442
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:07,370
Now, now. We're going to speak to our friend, Go Min Joon's...

443
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:12,190
Uncle! They're his uncles.

444
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,450
Min Joon's uncles will explain and show you amazing skills.

445
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,700
Now, applause!

446
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,130
You're good at lying, Ms Lawyer.

447
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,040
Ah, what do you mean? If they're my friends, they're Min Joon's uncles.

448
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,100
"Chin" near, and "goo" mouth?

449
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,750
Omo! Did you just stick your tongue out in my hand?

450
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,120
You did it too.

451
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,170
Hello kids. I'm a martial artist.

452
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,860
He's a world champion, soon to be Grand Slam!

453
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,090
Martial arts is something you do without any weapons and with the fewest of rules.

454
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,060
The time was 648—

455
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,600
Ah, no, no. Let's just show them. The children will fall asleep.

456
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,280
Okay, let's do that.

457
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,710
Okay, kids, watch closely.

458
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,200
We will show you, let's go.

459
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,480
I think you're going to spill that.

460
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,510
We can just wipe it.

461
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,400
They're precious seats.

462
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,870
How much more precious can they be than a developing child?

463
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,220
Auntie, who is this uncle?

464
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,770
Oh. He might talk that way, but he's not a bad uncle.

465
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,880
Where are we going?

466
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,830
The place where the developing child has been singing at for a month.

467
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,330
Why would I go to that place?

468
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,630
My mom said that men never mature until the day they die.

469
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,030
In that sense, come along with us.

470
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,600
Where is it?

471
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,630
♬    That's right, why don't you 
 come over here right now girl,♬     

472
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,790
It's Iron Man!

473
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,840
Auntie, Iron Man!

474
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,760
Superman, Batman, and Iron Man. Which one do you like?

475
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,200
Living as well as Iron Man, as secretive as Batman,

476
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,000
and... I think I'm better looking than Superman.

477
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,710
Min Joon, should we go look somewhere else?

478
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,440
Where are all the princesses?

479
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,390
♬    She is my beautiful, beautiful lady. ♬     

480
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,830
♬  Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

481
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,060
♬    You're my beautiful, beautiful lady. ♬     

482
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,090
♬  Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

483
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,420
Where are you going?

484
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,100
One, two, three!

485
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,460
♬  so beautiful, You know know know yeah~   ♬

486
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,150
♬  ​so beautiful, so beautiful, to me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

487
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:50,380


488
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,550
Mm, Hyeon Woo.

489
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,980
How is Min Joon's grandma doing?

490
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,890
Aigoo, who cares if I cause a commotion?

491
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,100
She's not willing to report it to the police.

492
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,130
I'm going crazy. She doesn't have a guardian.

493
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,080
That's why I'm saying...

494
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,480
I'll stay with Min Joon.

495
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,620
Come early in the morning. I have to go to work.

496
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,390
Thank you!

497
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,660
Please wash Min Joon well and also apply that cream.

498
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,810
Okay.

499
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,380
I have a cramp!

500
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,550
Where?

501
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,920
I think it'll be better if I give him a piggyback.

502
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,700
If not, wake up the sprout. It's not good for your joints—

503
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,460
Our Min Joon is more sensitive than you might think.

504
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,510
I'll do it just this once.

505
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,510
I'm really, really thankful.

506
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:41,030
Since that will be enough of a strength exercise, sleep well.

507
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,310
Auntie, I have to pee!

508
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,920
You're up, Min Joon? Should we walk?

509
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,390
Come on. We'll be going then.

510
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,540
Now that I think about it, this woman is spending the night away from home  today.

511
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,030
 It should be, either loving someone or not. 

512
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,260
 You said you didn't want to go back in time, so why are you?  

513
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,480
You're a substitute driver, right?

514
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,590
I'm sorry.

515
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,000
I don't have time. I have to get back after driving you.

516
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,360
 Sleep well. 

517
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,050
 I said, 'Sleep well'. Why aren't you replying? 

518
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,370
 I was taking my clothes off so the reply was delayed. 

519
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,140
 Again again, teasing me! 

520
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,120
 Shall we do a video chat?  

521
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,970
 Did you hear about the promise I made with Ji Woong? 

522
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,920
 Stop conspiring. You're not dieting for my sake! 

523
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,870
 Health, health, health. One to ten, it's all for your own good. 

524
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,880
Ah! The nagging!

525
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,100
 If I lose 5 kg before the first snow, we're going camping! 

526
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,490
 If you want. 

527
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,130
Sleep well...

528
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,490
 From the time we met until now, I've always been very grateful. 

529
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,960
 Muscular angel, John Kim. 

530
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,130
 Hyungnim Yeong Ho,  Mr. Yeong-Ho, Mr. Coach. 

531
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:26,610
Hey! Unlike how I feel today, the ball is cooperating and being hit really well today.

532
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,010
Good shot! Good shot!

533
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,100
Hey, the netting will rip.

534
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,300
I practiced a bit. Give me lots of opportunities.

535
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,030
CEO, it's because you're putting too much strength into your grip.

536
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:49,010
You have to go with the flow. Naturally. Go up and—

537
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,720
Like this.

538
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,260
There's a saying like this.

539
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,010
Even carrying a sheet A4 paper,  doing it together is better.

540
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,010
Even if straws are bundled together they don't break easily.

541
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:07,070
That's why we're all here together like this, CEO.

542
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,070
Well, I only trust in you, Director Choi.

543
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:18,680
I feel such a sense of responsibility now that you say that you trust me.

544
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,010
If we gather all the shares of the shareholders to our side we can protect the CEO Director position.

545
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,200
Don't be too discouraged.

546
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,220
I'm finding out about the new nominee Director Kim Yeong Ho.

547
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,710
I think I'll be sending you a report soon.

548
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:39,100
Where did you learn your work Star Im?

549
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,350
Then I'll trust in you and endure it.

550
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,350
Oh, yes.

551
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,390
Then.

552
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,100
Oh, well.

553
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,680
Whether the madam will be all right...

554
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,700
Well, as to the madam, she's never all right.

555
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,930
Get some rest.

556
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,860
I'm okay.

557
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,030
Yeong Joon? It's Mom.

558
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,050
I'm coming back from somewhere with Father.

559
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,470
Hold on.

560
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,600
President Kim.

561
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:45,760
You're not uncomfortable anywhere? Be careful in your actions at all times, okay?

562
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,970
Okay. I'll call you later again in the afternoon.

563
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:08,800
Our Yeong Joon is fine and healthy.

564
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,650
I heard.

565
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,040
Kang Joo Eun, you're awesome!

566
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,930
Aiyoo, I'm so tired.

567
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,310
 Lawyer Kang, come to the Pantheon Convention Room. 

568
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,640
 This situation is a direct delivery from the CEO, so if you'd like to refuse, do it to the CEO. 

569
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,880
 Vice CEO, Oh Soo Jin.   

570
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,800
She's making an offer I can't refuse.

571
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,890
 Where are you? 

572
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,900
 I'm going to be a little late tonight so make sure to exercise even if it's alone. 

573
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,390
Nagging.

574
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,080
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Coach.

575
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,180
It's Kang Joo Eun.

576
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,050
Come in.

577
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,040
Okay.

578
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,470
Oh, you're here, Lawyer Kang.

579
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,550
Yes. You came, Team Leader?

580
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,760
We're on the same side.

581
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,760
Oh. That's right, Vice CEO.

582
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,300
Today will just be a simple meeting.

583
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,140
I didn't know that I received such acknowledgement at the company.

584
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:36,050
This case requires someone with tight lips.

585
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,890
I am quite a loyal person.

586
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:53,050
Hello, I am the Gahong Group's Chief Secretary Min Byeong Wook.

587
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,180
This is the Gahong Medical Group's Executive Director.

588
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,130
I... Hold on.

589
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,350
I'm sorry.

590
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,250
 Living as well as Iron Man, as secretive as Batman, 

591
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:24,100
 It's because I am the son of a wealthy household who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 

592
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:29,350
 That's why I will get told off by my grandmother and father for bringing dishonor to the family name. 

593
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:35,100
 To you, being in a suite room alone with a man like me is probably out of this world. 

594
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:45,100


595
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,760
Where are you going?

596
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,720
You know, right?

597
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,030
I'm sorry.

598
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,150
I...

599
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,470
I... I thought that ...

600
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:12,050
Calm down and take deep breaths.

601
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,190
Don't be upset and take deep, deep breaths.

602
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,950
You...

603
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:35,100
really were outside of my world.

604
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:45,000
♬  I will be next to you,  ♬
