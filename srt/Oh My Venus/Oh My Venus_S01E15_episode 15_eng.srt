00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,430
 Episode 15 

2
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,150
I don't think I can let Kang Joo Eun leave today.

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,420
I didn't say I was going.

4
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,830
This...

5
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,450
You saw it.

6
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,590
Of course. I lasted because of this.

7
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,440
 Sorry for making you wait, Kang Joo Eun. 

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,430
 Thank you for coming back sooner than I thought, Mr. Coach. 

9
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,030
What was your wish?

10
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,570
Not to be hurt again?

11
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Not me,

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,370
but for you to not be hurt.

13
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,920
I hope tonight is a comfortable and a warm night.

14
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,630
Okay.

15
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,740
A warm night.

16
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,210
I didn't say anything different.

17
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,290
It's warm.

18
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,030
Isn't it a little too much for just a warm night?

19
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,050
I have a habit of hugging  this jerk  to sleep.

20
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,540
This wicked woman, seriously.

21
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,440
That's why,

22
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,070
you shouldn't have come back looking this pretty and sexy.

23
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,920
Seriously...

24
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,300
I give up on having a warm night.

25
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,570
Racy night, okay?

26
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,910
Okay.

27
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,950
Kang Joo Eun has seduced me first again.

28
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,420
♬   It's me,  ♬

29
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,050
♬   even if I don't know how to express it, it's me,  ♬

30
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,050
It wasn't mutual?

31
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,740
♬   Without even realizing it, you, you, you,   ♬

32
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,210
♬  Love Is You.  ♬

33
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,880
I want to see.

34
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,450
I can't concentrate when there's light.

35
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,040
♬   I'm thrilled somehow today    ♬

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,690
♬  I'm getting this feeling  ♬

37
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,910
♬  I'm getting this feeling.  ♬

38
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,780
♬   When you look at me, when you call my name   ♬

39
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,190
♬   I don't know if I can contain my laughter   ♬

40
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,860
♬  Come to me  ♬

41
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,960
♬  Look into my eyes  ♬

42
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,920
♬   My heart flutters, I've got the jitters just thinking about you   ♬

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,030
♬  I've got the feeling I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

44
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,640
I should get up.

45
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,700
Joon Seung and Ji Woong should be back soon.

46
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,330
Sleep some more.

47
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,020
They're coming back after dinner at Joon Seong's mom's house.

48
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,090
What does this mean?

49
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,650
I guess this isn't a dream.

50
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,570
I'm relieved.

51
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,730
Exactly what kind of dream have you been having?

52
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,050
By the way.

53
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,430
Aside from doing company work or housework, always stay where I can see you.

54
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,700
If not, you'll get it.

55
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,690
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
You told me to stay where you can see me,

57
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,970
but you turned your back.

58
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,690
I'm hungry.

59
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,670
Oppa. I'm hungry.

60
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,250
If you want to eat,

61
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,570
you should put something on first

62
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,800
or it might become a comfortable and racy morning.

63
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,430
When did you get this ready?

64
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,800
In case you ask me to save you again

65
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,190
and I might have to rip your clothes off, in preparation of then.

66
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,140
It looks good on you.

67
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, I forgot!

68
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,450
I made this last night,

69
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,510
but I thought you might throw a fit if I asked you eat something so late.

70
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,600
I would like you to be careful.

71
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,930
What about the hypothyrodism medicine?

72
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,000
Aigoo, you told me not to think about eating and to think about how not to eat.

73
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,650
It's not like it's something great.

74
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,390
I was told I didn't have to take it since last month.

75
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,300
My cholesterol level and thyroid levels are normal now.

76
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,330
You've become prettier and sexier.

77
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,100
You did well.

78
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,970
I told you.

79
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,390
If I set my mind to it, I can do anything.

80
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,370
Can I make a speech?

81
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,160
They say that missing someone can also be stressful.

82
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,540
While enduring such stress

83
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,890
and overcoming hypothyroidism,

84
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,760
with the former Daegu Venus and now Mr. Kim Yeong Ho's Venus,

85
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,730
Kang Joo Eun, I'd like to share this honor.

86
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,070
Self-honor. I will acknowledge it.

87
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,600
What about the Venus? Hearts should be pouring out.

88
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,090
I also acknowledge that hearts are pouring out.

89
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,550
Yay! You acknowledge it!

90
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,820
I seasoned it very lightly,

91
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,120
so even if you're on a low-salt, no-salt diet,

92
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,780
please think of me and just have a spoonful.

93
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,210
I'll eat well.

94
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,720
What should we do today?

95
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,260
I have to go to a meeting in the evening,

96
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,280
so until then...

97
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,390
Let's stick together, and...

98
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Stick together, and?

99
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,590
Just stay stuck together. Okay?

100
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,270
Sometimes you're such an easy woman.

101
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,720
- Call (deal).
 - Call?

102
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,050
Call.

103
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,350
Call?

104
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,640
Seriously.

105
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,140
What is that?

106
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,180
It's cold.

107
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,050
What does this mean?

108
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,860
I don't have enough hands.

109
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,390
Now that I think about it, there's something I need to check.

110
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Aigoo, what is it now?

111
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:23,500
Fifty four, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

112
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,820
What? You needed to check whether or not I can do the plank for a minute?

113
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,300
You told me you could on the video clip. You're a lot better at it now.

114
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,640
Great job. Once more!

115
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,710
How many times do you have to confirm it?

116
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,430
I've done five sets already.

117
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Five sets. It's just enough.

118
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,010
Let's end it with a 30 minute run.

119
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,470
What kind of hard training situation is this in the middle of kissing from missing each other?

120
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,320
Where is  this jerk ?

121
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,300
You wanted us to stick together.

122
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,430
Yes, Mr. Coach.

123
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,140
Is it okay?

124
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,450
Aren't you pushing it?

125
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,120
Once the bone heals after being broken, the attachment is stronger.

126
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,100
As long as it attaches properly.

127
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,680
Has it attached properly?

128
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,010
Like Kang Joo Eun, completely.

129
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,250
Aren't you going to run?

130
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
Ah. Yes, Mr. Coach.

131
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,790
♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

132
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,640
♬   To me the too perfect Girl  ♬

133
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,640
Look at you. You just poked me on my side first.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,850
♬    A flower with an aroma, even without a breeze  ♬

135
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,470
It's Mom!

136
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,780
Aigoo, I'm sorry, Mother.

137
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,530
Oh, Mom. In Seoul?

138
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm nearby. I'll be right there.

139
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,160
Okay.

140
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,970
It's time for us to split up for today.

141
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,660
Well, mom is exempt from causing an interruption.

142
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,980
Let's see each other the next day.

143
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,180
After going to a wedding, she's staying overnight.

144
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,760
Mom must be happy. She gets to sleep with Kang Joo Eun.

145
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,720
I'll go get changed.

146
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,270
I think I have to tell you where your clothes are.

147
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,260
Aigoo, I know.

148
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:01,470
From now on, all the dates we missed out on for the past year, let's do them all, Miss Kang Joo Eun.

149
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,650
Without forgetting anything, I will be doubly happy.

150
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,080
- To your mom— 
 - Later.

151
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,180
You can see her in time. There's no rush.

152
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,140
Go on in.

153
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,110
I'll call you.

154
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,550
Wait.

155
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,650
Haven't you forgetten something?

156
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,680
Really...

157
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,960
Go in.

158
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,890
I'll go in.

159
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,520
Mom. I'm back.

160
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,680
Hi.

161
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,410
Why did you bring all this heavy stuff again?

162
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,140
I took the tourist bus up.

163
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,220
If this is too heavy, I should stop living.

164
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,800
But were you at a wedding?

165
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,930
What?

166
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,370
You're my daughter but you have a great personality.

167
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,810
What is it now?

168
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,740
Do you know how old you are to be going to other people's weddings and giving money?

169
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,430
What about that person you were laughing on the phone with?

170
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,550
A season turns into a year and

171
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,100
all the good days will pass you by, my daughter.

172
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,470
I have to go back out after I get changed.

173
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,400
Where? Are you going to eat first?

174
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,110
Yeong Gi's mom has three grandchildren.

175
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,430
After both her son and daughter got married,

176
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,180
she has no worries in her life.

177
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,070
You have a grandchild, too.

178
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,640
You even have a 22 year-old daughter-in-law.

179
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,250
That's right. She's 22 with a baby, and how old are you now?

180
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,420
Are you even thinking about it?

181
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,430
I will figure it out myself.

182
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,750
Tell me the truth.

183
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,050
That man you were laughing with, why aren't you introducing him to me?

184
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,100
Later.

185
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,640
Later will be too late.

186
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,470
Why? Is he a scammer on the run?

187
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,390
Is he someone who has problems is what I'm asking.

188
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,310
It's nothing like that. I will handle it.

189
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,410
If it's something that great, why don't you get married instead?

190
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,810
You're the one who needs to get married soon.

191
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,080
You're not saying you won't.

192
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,730
I'll be back. I won't be late.

193
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,370
They make you work even on weekends. How could you have time to get married?

194
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,230
A scammer? Seriously, mom's imagination is...

195
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,810
Oh, Vice CEO, I'm here.

196
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,870
 Did you contact the other victim? Is she going to give a statement? 

197
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,070
You know how persuasive I am. I will be right there.

198
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,470
The lawsuit is about date violence,

199
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,750
and that this situation has occurred several times before is just her one-sided opinion.

200
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,940
Even though my client is a public official,

201
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,570
and there are things he feels very wronged about, he wishes to come to a settlement.

202
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,440
Yes. About physical violence,

203
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,430
there isn't any evidence that the court will acknowledge,

204
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,690
and there are no health records prior to the incident.

205
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,070
Also, any case with an injury that heals within two weeks is usually settled out of court.

206
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,940
But...

207
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,080
 You're really pretty. 

208
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,330
 Don't do this. I said, no. Don't do this. 

209
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,250
 All right, all right. Just ten seconds. 

210
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,270
 - I don't want to.
- Just a minute. 

211
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,330
Yeong Joon seems to be getting ready to enlist in the army while taking time off from school.

212
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,850
And his mom seems to be doing community service.

213
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,090
I guess it's not in the cards for her to live a comfortable life.

214
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,210
Also, about that—

215
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,000
 Geondoo 

216
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,500
It's Lawyer Kang Joo Eun's business card.

217
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,970
She works for Geondoo, a middle-grade law firm.

218
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,850
Her father died from an accident and she has a mother and younger brother who is married.

219
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,900
Their financial status is—

220
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,390
I understand. You've worked hard.

221
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,370
 Geondoo 

222
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
You're familiar with it, right?

223
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,390
What is this? It's offensive.

224
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:34,090
It seems like your client has committed these offensive acts often.

225
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,950
Do you have proof?

226
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,850
Lawyer!

227
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,200
You don't have proof that the woman on this video is your client,

228
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,030
and there won't be any proof that the person who uploaded the video was my client.

229
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,390
To be honest, how can you tell who these people are?

230
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,300
It's been pixelated.

231
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,670
Your and our client can tell.

232
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,330
Our client has even received psychological treatment over this incident.

233
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,290
While looking through the video files, there were some audio recording files with our client and

234
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,100
your client, so we're analyzing them right now.

235
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,640
Then... A settlement—

236
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,810
There won't be one.

237
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,130
You've done this to your ex-girlfriend as well.

238
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,410
The same way, with a similar video clip.

239
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,000
We've received her statement, of course.

240
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,550
According to Article 307 of the Criminal Act, for defamation

241
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,870
and the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection,

242
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,760
and also, under Article 14 of the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment of Sexual Crimes,

243
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,010
your life as a public official will become a bit messy.

244
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,620
Since this isn't your first time, you'll recieve additional punishment.

245
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,830
Don't go anywhere far away from here.

246
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:08,340


247
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,280
Your ring is pretty!

248
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,160
Are you hurt somewhere?

249
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,590
It's just a stomach ache.

250
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,690
That's right, I saw that you got back together with Kim Yeong Ho.  Congratulations.

251
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,980
You saw?

252
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,790
I know you won't like it when I say things like this, but since I can't just pretend I didn't see it.

253
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,940
Why?

254
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,840
Eat something!  What are you doing that you don't have any color in your face.

255
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,700
You're plenty thin enough, and plenty pretty enough.

256
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,720
I got it.  Who said I'm starving?

257
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,530
I'm leaving.

258
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,990
You should go to the hospital and get examined before I just drag you over there.

259
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,310
I got it!

260
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,850
Happy New Year!

261
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,600
With that face?  Happy New Year, my butt.

262
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,570
 Woo Sik 

263
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,570
 The customer is not answering their phone.  After the beep— 

264
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,320
What would you like to eat for dinner? I'll buy, you haven't been able to eat lately...

265
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,390
 Chicken and ginseng stew?  Chicken porridge? 

266
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,740
Is she busy?

267
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,110
 Abalone porridge? 

268
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,910
What do I do?

269
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,170
This is Oh Soo Jin,

270
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,050
I already got the tests, so I just need to see the results.

271
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,740
Could I change next week's appointment to today?

272
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,420
 I thought it might disturb your meeting.  Office?  Or the parking lot? 

273
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,690
 Or are you driving?  If you're driving, then later. 

274
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,400
 Mr. Coach 

275
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
  Oh My Venus 

276
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
Are you done now?

277
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,650
I'm about to go home now.

278
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,760
You should rest.  You're probably jet-lagged and tired.

279
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,980
I don't think the reason I'm tired is because of jet-lag.

280
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,140
Oh my, Joon Seong and Ji Woong aren't there, right?

281
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,740
Joon Seong and Ji Woong are at your house.

282
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,040
What?

283
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,230
Since they weren't busy, I sent them there with fruit

284
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,160
 in case your Mother was lonely. 

285
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,450
Ji Woong even texts her.

286
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,520
The thing is, Mom really adores Ji Woong.

287
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,130
 And she likes Joon Seong also. 

288
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,480
My elevator is here.  Let's chat again before bedtime.

289
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,830
Go safely!

290
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,390
Yes, Mr. Coach!

291
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,020
Mom, I'm home, I'm home.

292
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,510
Yey! He blooped!

293
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,730
Oh, why! I'm professional at this!

294
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,430
I blocked his win!

295
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,920
I'll change my clothes first.

296
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,460
Okay. Wait. I'm Godori ( 3 bird cards= 5 points ) and...

297
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,380
Oh, Woo Sik.

298
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,600
 How come you didn't answer the phone earlier?  

299
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,750
I had a meeting.  What do you mean? I'm fine.

300
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,640
Are you going to be very late?

301
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,050
 Oh, a little bit.  I have another meeting left. 

302
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,750
Have you eaten yet?

303
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,340
Of course!

304
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,180
You always say you ate, but you probably only ate like a bird.

305
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,070
I'll buy some porridge on my way home, so finish up early, and I'll see you later.

306
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,480
Soo Jin,

307
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,190
What?

308
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,710
Where are you?

309
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,650
In the office.

310
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,720
There's nothing wrong?

311
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,110
What do you mean?  I'll see you later.

312
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,130
I just need to see the test results for Oh Soo Jin.
 Obstetrics and Neonatal Care 

313
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,030
For Oh Soo Jin?  Please go to consultation room 5.

314
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,590
Yes, thank you.

315
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,080
Daughter, do you have a gwang ( Bright cards worth points ) to sell?

316
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,250
- See your gwang.
- Daughter, sell your gwang.

317
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,250
- One, two , three!
- Oh my!

318
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,170
Thank you.

319
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,590
I'm going.  There!

320
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,310
Aigoo, I have a gwang!

321
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,570
You guys should avoid gwang bak ( double penalty points ).

322
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,770
I should give this out.

323
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,050
It seems like you're pi bak. It's all mine. Now Ji Woong!

324
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,550
- Bam!  Ok Boon, hurry up and give me the ssang pi ( double junk cards ).
- Aigoo.

325
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,710
They say those who learn late can't be predicted, you even did a bomb and took ssang pi.

326
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,090
Ji Woong, but still, isn't it a bit much to call Joo Eun's Mother, Ok Boon?

327
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,090
It's okay.  I heard there are no honorifics used in America.

328
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,370
Ok Boon, your turn.  Ma'am's mommy, go.

329
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,190
What did you just say?

330
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,190
Ah, your Mother ordered pork hocks and pork wraps earlier.

331
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,310
Sheesh, I told you not to eat at night.

332
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,390
- I'll go.
- No, no, no.  The person who sold the gwang should go.

333
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,830
Pork hock and pork wrap sets are called "bo juk" (Korean word for dimple) sets.

334
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,290
How much is it?

335
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,480
- I don't know, since I didn't get any change back.
- Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,680
- How did you come here?
- Joo Eun, come here quickly.

337
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,390
I thought I should at least give my greetings, even if it's for just a moment.

338
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,730
Okay, I'm coming.  Come in.

339
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:39,050
Oh, that's right.  Mom is wearing the clothes you left behind, so don't burst into laughter.

340
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,500
- I'm not in the frame of mind to burst into laughter right now.
- Sheesh.

341
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,010
Why are you being like this?  She's just Mom.

342
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,880
She's not "just Mom".  She's Kang Joo Eun's mom.

343
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,780
This is my first time experiencing this.

344
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,120
Do I look handsome?

345
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,110
You're handsome, you're handsome.

346
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,630
Joo Eun!

347
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,400
Let's go.

348
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,930
Hyung!

349
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,190
Then we'll be going now, since it's late.

350
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,640
No, no, no, no. I'm Two-Go ( opponents give 2 extra chips ) and you're pi bak ( double penalty )!

351
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,120
- Aigoo, Ji Woong.
- Huh?

352
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,130
- Then, we'll see you next time.
- Aigoo, okay.

353
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,250
No, please stay seated.

354
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,970
Please look kindly on our hyungnim.

355
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,800
Ok Boon, Hyung is my hero.  So don't give him a hard time.

356
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,330
And I'll see you next time.  I'm a professional Go-Stop'er.

357
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,990
What is he saying? I'm not going to go out far.

358
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,610
Ah, yes.

359
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,930
It's a good thing I changed clothes.  I might have greeted your mother wearing a couples look.

360
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,190
Joo Eun, who is this?  Is this the delivery man?

361
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,180
Asking even if one already knows the answer must be hereditary in our family.

362
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,110
Tell him to sit.

363
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,290
Hello, my name is Kim Yeong Ho.

364
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,250
Are you going to keep chatting and giggling with my Joo Eun?

365
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,670
Excuse me?

366
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,510
Ah, yes.

367
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,090
Then that's enough.

368
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,470
Mom, aren't you being too cool as the parent of a daughter?

369
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,990
I saw his face, and he says he's going to keep chatting and giggling with you.

370
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,200
Then that's enough. Is there anything else?

371
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,240
Mother, please take this.

372
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,140
Wow, the flowers are pretty.

373
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,570
Mother, I'm a good Go-Stop player.

374
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Should we play a game?

375
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,950
It's late.  Don't come out.

376
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,630
- (Kakao) Talk.
- Okay.

377
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,510
Wait a minute.

378
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,400
I'm going.

379
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,960


380
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,100
Soo Jin!  Where are you?

381
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,350
It's porridge.  You haven't eaten yet, right?

382
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm sorry.  I don't have much of an appetite.

383
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,460
Even if you don't have an appetite, you should eat.

384
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,730
What is this?

385
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,570
Earlier, I saw you at the hospital.

386
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,710
Since you went to the Ob/Gyn department.

387
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,850
I'm not pregnant.

388
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,690
There's no reason why I would be, and I don't want to be either.

389
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,180
Thinking about it, I don't think I'm ready yet.

390
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,610
I also want to work more.

391
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,720
Getting married, and having a child...

392
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,220
Wouldn't those get in the way?

393
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,800
Why would you say that?

394
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,260
What is it?  What happened?

395
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,410
Are you sick?

396
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,660
If I'm not pregnant, does that mean I'm sick?

397
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,420
Oh Soo Jin!

398
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,240
Please leave.

399
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm tired, and I have things piled up that need to be done over the weekend.

400
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,430
- Why are you doing this?
- I said, leave!

401
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,720
Just because I got a ring from you, it doesn't mean anything's been set!

402
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,600
What's going on?

403
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,770
Just leave!

404
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,540
Get some rest.  I think you need to do that first.

405
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,190
I'm leaving.

406
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,370
 Your case is polycystic ovary syndrome. 

407
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:30,630
 Your uterine walls are thin and weak, so normal ovulation and conception are difficult. 

408
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,830
 When I look at your blood test, it looks like you're malnourished and have a mineral deficiency.  Perhaps... 

409
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,350
 I was on a pretty strict diet until just recently. 

410
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,350
 Ah, that's why. 

411
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:49,260
 You also had menstrual irregularity for a long time and have anemia as well. 

412
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,660
 How long have you been taking the antidepressant medication?   

413
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,760
 Perhaps, did that drug have an effect? 

414
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,550
 Of course it has an effect. It's medication. 

415
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,970
 It's been two months since I've stopped taking it. 

416
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,290
 Right now, I'm just taking the medication for anemia. 

417
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:20,030
 It may be difficult for you to get pregnant. 

418
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,220
Are you expecting to be married by any chance?

419
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,550
After treatments and healing,

420
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,010
it's not impossible to have a baby.

421
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,490
How long would it take?

422
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,890
Is it even possible?

423
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,600
That is... According to how you manage your body and your status we never know how long it will take

424
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,140
or it might even be impossible.

425
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,200
But still, have hope and—

426
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,060
Hope?

427
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,720
For everyone else it's easy,

428
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,220
but for me, I need hope, right?

429
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,680
 I'm not pregnant. 

430
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,390
 It's not that. 

431
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,510
 I don't want to be either. 

432
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,510
 Now that I think about it, 

433
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,400
 I don't think I'm ready yet. 

434
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,640
 I also want to work more. 

435
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,640
 Getting married, having kids... 

436
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,970
 Then, wouldn't it be a stumbling block? 

437
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,550
 How can you say it like that? 

438
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,290
 What is it? What's wrong? 

439
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,450
 Is something wrong? 

440
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,460
 If I'm not pregnant, is something wrong? 

441
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,300
 Oh Soo Jin! 

442
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,240
 Please leave. 

443
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,350
 I'm tired, and I have things piled up that need to be done over the weekend. 

444
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,160
 Why are you like this? 

445
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,430
 I told you to go! 

446
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,720
 Just because I got a ring from you, it doesn't mean anything's been set. 

447
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,510
 After seeing your mother's face, 

448
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,550
 I feel like I need to be careful of what to say. 

449
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,810
 It's night time. Ahem! 

450
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,760
 Did you get home safely? 

451
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,220
 I'm going to sleep now. 

452
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,890
♬    It's me,  ♬

453
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,650
 Kang Joo Eun, you look a lot like your mom.  
-♬  even if I don't know how to express it, it's me,  ♬

454
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,100
♬   My eyes are only looking at you   ♬

455
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,890
 Yeah, people say that.  
-♬  For me, for me, for me.   ♬

456
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,990
 Good job today and thank you.  
-♬   Without even realizing it, you, you, you,   ♬

457
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,260
 I felt very supported. 

458
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,410
♬    Love is you  ♬

459
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,720
♬   I'm thrilled somehow today    ♬

460
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,260
♬    I'm getting this feeling,   ♬

461
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,800
 My house will be difficult for you, Kang Joo Eun.  
-♬    I'm getting this feeling.   ♬

462
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,050
♬    when you look at me, when you call my name   ♬

463
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,640
 I'm not that easy a woman.  
 ♬    I'm not confident that I won't laugh  ♬

464
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,010
♬    Come to me   ♬

465
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,600
 It's all better to me than being apart from you and  
-♬   I get the feeling you're looking at my eyes  ♬

466
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,350
 not being able to see you. 
 ♬  My thinking is fuzzy  ♬

467
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,800
 Sleep well, Mr. Coach.  
 ♬  I've got the jitters thinking of you  ♬

468
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,460
 We're going to see each other tomorrow, everyday, right?  
-♬  I've got the feeling I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

469
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,260
♬    Thinking of you.   ♬

470
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,620
♬    It's you.   ♬

471
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,650
 Let's go somewhere  tomorrow, Kang Joo Eun!  
 ♬    Even if I try to be indiferant, it's you.   ♬

472
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,680
♬    Drawing me without a choice    ♬

473
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,220
 Where?  
♬    Oh I...  ♬

474
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,500
 Outdoors?  
-♬   Without my even noticing  ♬

475
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,310
 Yes, Yes Mr. Coach! Get some sleep!  
 ♬    Love is you  ♬

476
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,240
 Have a comfortable and warm night.  
 ♬    Falling you   ♬

477
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,430
 Because of the Kang Joo Eun who is going to come out in my dreams, a comfortable and warm night is already ruined.  
♬  I've got the feeling   ♬

478
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,700
Aigoo, it's good to be young. 
-♬   I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

479
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,010
Keep giggling. 
-♬   When you look at me, when you call my name  ♬

480
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,760
♬   I'm not confident that I won't laugh  ♬

481
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,220
Mom.

482
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,460
What? 
 ♬   I get that feeling   ♬

483
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,310
Nothing, sleep well. 
♬    I get that feeling.   ♬

484
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,010
This girl... 
-♬  My thinking is fuzzy  ♬

485
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,430
♬  I've got the jitters thinking of you  ♬

486
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,550
Mom is going to sleep. 
-♬  I get the feeling it's likely I will fall in love.  ♬

487
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,250
♬    I get this feeling.  ♬

488
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,150
Let's go!

489
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,390
Are you going overseas?

490
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,850
You said we're going to the outdoors.

491
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,260
Just a second, let me check this.

492
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,720
What? Oh my.

493
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,570
What are you doing right—

494
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,760
Ah, really.

495
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,530
Wow,

496
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,470
You want to do cutie plus lovely and sexy plus lovely?

497
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,640
The more I look at you, you're wicked.

498
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,140
I thought we were sleeping over,

499
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,680
since I'm very meticulous.

500
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,800
I'm sorry to ruin your dreams, but today is a one day trip.

501
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,100
I will keep this for now.

502
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,470
By chance... Your mom?

503
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Is it too pink?

504
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,390
Do I look okay?

505
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,250
You're very fine.

506
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,220
 Seo Ji Yeon 

507
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,160
Then, you did this by yourself?

508
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,530
Say hello to my mom.

509
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,490
Mother, I'm Kang Joo Eun.

510
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:58,720
I will stay by your son's side

511
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,450
so he can live well, happily and sexily.

512
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,550
Please take care of me, Mother.

513
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,850
Please look upon me favorably.

514
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,560
Thank you for giving birth to such a handsome man.

515
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,800
Thank you very much.

516
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,320
 Lawyer Kang Joo Eun, I am Yeong Ho's Grandmother, Lee Hong Im. 

517
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:24,890
 If it's okay with you, I'd like to see you for a moment tomorrow evening. 

518
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,010
Did you greet your mom well?

519
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,680
What were you doing?

520
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,640
Ah, a stone tower?

521
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,370
But is that how you build a stone tower?

522
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,140
Well, there's no rule that says I have to build them only tall and big.

523
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,450
Why would I do that? What if it falls?

524
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,470
Just the two, for certainty!

525
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,580
Mr. Coach's heart,

526
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,470
And my heart.

527
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,600
It seems, my heart is a little much bigger?

528
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,390
Do you feel wronged?

529
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,570
No way.

530
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,110
Let's go

531
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,850
Where are we going?

532
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,100
What everybody calls a date.

533
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,220
I hate being cold the most,

534
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:33,090
but if we must, walk outside for a long time while holding hands?

535
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,760
This romantic guy...

536
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,630
Ah, it's cold. Let's change into something warm.

537
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,640
♬  Baby Only you Whoo  ♬

538
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:56,630
♬   You are the only one, whoo   ♬

539
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:04,260
♬   You're my darling, you. Darling you, my love mine  ♬

540
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,260
♬   I didn't know love.   ♬

541
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,720
♬   I was more comfortable with that.   ♬

542
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,530
♬   Without my knowing, falling you  ♬

543
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,750
- Oppa!  Do you like it?
- Yeah.

544
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,180
It's so much fun!

545
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:29,120
♬   I love you, I love you, I love you. The words are clumsy to me.  ♬

546
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,140
♬   Hug me even if the pain is hidden   ♬

547
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,340
♬   My baby only you, whoo  ♬

548
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,730
♬   You are the only one, whoo   ♬

549
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:52,260
♬   You will be my love forever.  My love which will last forever.  Darling you, whoo  ♬

550
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,050
The thing about dates is that you're supposed to be a little embarrassed and look like you have a screw loose.

551
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,640
I'm so happy that I'm going crazy.  Does it make sense that it's normal?

552
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,890
It's hard, dates are.

553
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,350
But wait, you said you're going crazy?

554
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,430
What do you mean?

555
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,050
I thought you just said that you were so happy that you're going crazy.

556
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,050
Sheesh, let's hurry.

557
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,930
How crazy are you?

558
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,510
Sheesh, seriously.  Why are you doing this?

559
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:24,560
I'm going crazy too.

560
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,830
Should we write them too?

561
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,900
- Why not?
- Uh uh.

562
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,260
Ah, you're so funny.

563
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,700
You even said why do people do this.

564
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,870
Why are you thinking so hard?

565
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,220
I'm just going to write something big in one shot.

566
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,550
Sheesh, be quiet.  We should be careful.

567
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,760
We're only writing down one thought.

568
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,450
The first one... No, that's not it.  The second one?

569
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,010
Are they the same thing?

570
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:50,470
 Attorney Kang Joo Eun.  I'm Yeong Ho's Grandmother, Lee Hong Im. 

571
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:57,010
 If it's okay with you, I'd like to see you for a moment tomorrow evening. 

572
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,760
Was your wish an essay type?

573
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,080
Was yours short answer?

574
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,970
What is there to think about?  That's it.

575
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,050
My fingers are cold.

576
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,030
I mean, you could at least put on the metal ring from a soju bottle.

577
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,760
If I even met your Mother?

578
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,850
Ah, never mind.  People with means are the worst.

579
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,790
I mean, it's not like I'm materialistic.

580
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,220
You already received it, and now you're acting like you didn't.

581
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,890
Excuse me?

582
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,080
I want to put the ring on you,

583
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,930
so you should come from there to here.

584
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:57,610


585
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,730
Ah, seriously.

586
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:26,800
Kang Joo Eun, it's possible that you might get hurt a little bit.

587
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:32,600
It's possible that I might make things bit difficult for you.

588
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:40,220
But still... I want to live with Kang Joo Eun... forever.

589
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,600
♬   That's how love is   ♬

590
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,260
♬   With the wind silently,  ♬

591
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,930
♬   You are approaching   ♬

592
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,640
Kang Joo Eun is now mine.
♬   To love someone   ♬

593
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,270
♬   And to become like that person   ♬

594
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:12,600
♬   It may cause me to lose myself   ♬

595
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,170
♬   That's how love is   ♬

596
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,310
♬   Making you cry and laugh   ♬

597

 Kang Joo Eun's Wish: Yeong Ho Hyung-nim. Mr. Coach
Kim Yeong Ho's Wish: Oh My Venus, Kang Joo Eun 

598

♬   I think I'm in love   ♬

599
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:35,850
♬   I think I like you   ♬

600
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,080
♬   From the love which found me again   ♬

00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:50,700
♬   I can't escape   ♬
