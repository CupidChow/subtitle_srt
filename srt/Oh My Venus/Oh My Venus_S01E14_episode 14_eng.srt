 Episode 14 

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,900
 February 2015 

3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,900
 Mr. John Kim! 
♬  Maybe such a woman doesn't exist anywhere ♬

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,220
 Omo!  

5
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,600
 Omo! Omo! Omo! 

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
 There. 

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,810
 I told you it was a corset, didn't I? A corset. Corset! 

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,930
♬   I'm searching for her.  ♬

9
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,970
 Where are you? 

10
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,210
 Are you looking for me? 

11
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,270
 You surprised me. 

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,190
 I will wait for you while looking sexy and lovely, with a ribbon around me.  

13
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,200
 Are you in a lot of pain? 

14
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,830
 I'll come to you. 

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,670
♬   The sort of  woman who only has faith in me  ♬

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,860
♬     Is that something that's hard for a woman? ♬

17
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,000
 How many days have gone by while I stared at the same ceiling? 

18
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,270
♬    Where can I find her?  ♬

19
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,730
 Those days when I missed her and the pain in my heart was worse than that of my body, 

20
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,110
 passed by as though they were like a year. 

21
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,210
♬    a woman who loves only one man  ♬

22
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,390
♬    I am looking for a woman like her  ♬

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:12,820
 But, again, I don't want to see her cry because of me even more. 

24
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,190
 Are you okay? 

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,420
 You caught me, not looking sexy. 

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,730
♬  Are you the one who will stay with me?  ♬

27
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,840
♬ I can wait forever  ♬

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,660
 Many times a day, I leave for the outside of this world 
♬  I can wait forever  ♬

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,300
 where she is and come back. 
♬   If you are coming to me with that kind of love  ♬

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,400
♬  Could you be that kind of love  ♬

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,160
 Hello, Ahjussi. Where's Mom? 

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,900
 She went to a seminar and is on her way back. 

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,690
 Is that a present for your mom? 

34
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,280
 Yes. I only have to wait for her just a little while, right? 

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,110
 Yes, Young Master. 

36
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,520
 I'm sorry, Director. 

37
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,630
 In the rain, she... We moved her to a hospital quickly but... 

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,190
 I'm sorry, Director. 

39
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,100
Are you being discharged now?

40
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,470
I was wondering how the Executive Director was doing.

41
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,990
I am leaving now.

42
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,560
He still needs complete calm.

43
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,280
Yes.

44
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,040
I just couldn't bring myself to leave...

45
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,790
Even from afar,

46
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,300
I wanted to give him my apology again.

47
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,260
I will let him know.

48
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,430
Please tell Mother that I am leaving without being able to say goodbye.

49
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,740
Also, the Director asked me to take care of the Chairwoman and the Executive Director.

50
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,940
Please tell him I'm sorry for not being able

51
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,160
to keep that promise.

52
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,230
Then.

53
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,710
 Romance Cafeteria 

54
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,050
 Well, Hyungnim Yeong Ho has already met the beautiful and intelligent Daegu Venus, 

55
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,050
 so you should study romance some more. 

56
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,390
 Romance Cafeteria? That was so like you. 

57
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,550
 Why didn't you just give me Romance Restaurant or Romance Buffet while you were at it? 

58
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,000
 What kind of Gyun Woo and Jik Nyeo situation is this that has become my fate? 

59
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,890
 Gyun Woo and Jik Nyeo were legendary lovers who were separated by a vast distance and could only meet on July 7. 

60
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,820
 Now, go. 

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,100
 When that person's absence overwhelms you. 

62
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,340
 Since we said goodbye, time has become something I have to withstand, not something that flows. 

63
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,730
 I'm telling my mom everything. Jerk.  

64
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,270
 This freesia-like person! (the aroma is said to lower blood pressure) 

65
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,950
♬  I didn't know that it would be so painful   ♬

66
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:34,330
♬  I didn't know I would want to see you so much  ♬

67
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,830
♬  Slowly my heart   ♬

68
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,670
 It's okay. You'll be better soon. 

69
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,920
 You'll be okay soon. 

70
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:56,350
♬  I enjoyed the time I had with you  ♬

71
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:03,430
♬  I was happy if you smiled looking at me  ♬

72
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,730
♬  Just like that, time stood still  ♬

73
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,230
♬  I want to stay with you  ♬

74
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,020
♬  I will stay with you  ♬

75
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,910
♬  I will love you   ♬

76
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,180
♬  Because you are everything to me  ♬

77
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,630
♬  Because I only see you  ♬

78
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,280
♬  I'm saying I don't have a choice  ♬

79
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,540
♬  Why it is now that I happened to meet you  ♬

80
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,850
♬  The person who would make  ♬

81
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,880
 It's okay, you'll be better soon.
 ♬    wounded me happy.  ♬

82
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,790
 You'll be okay soon. 

83
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,530
 May 2015 

84
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,000
♬  I will keep you with me always  ♬

85
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,140
♬  I won't waver and will embrace you  ♬

86
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,900
Wait.

87
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,600
♬  Because you are everything to me  ♬

88
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,700
♬  I am saying you are my love  ♬

89
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,320
♬  and I am never letting you go  ♬

90
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,890
 Hyungnim Yeong Ho. Coachnim, it's me. 

91
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:17,290
 You have to return pretty and sexy. 

92
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,820
 You have to return. 

93
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:33,250
 Remember that if you're bearing it, then you haven't reached your limit yet. 

94
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,680
 If you believe that you can do it, then you can do it. 

95
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,720
It looked like a talisman you needed,

96
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
so I didn't let them take it off.

97
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,100
You're even a mind-reader now.

98
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,890
Let's go.

99
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,860
Maybe due to the fact that your son has been taking care of himself so well,

100
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,770
in the last six months, all the bones have healed well,

101
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,190
but he lost a lot of muscle mass, and

102
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,210
since so much damage was done to his legs,

103
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,310
I'm not sure about him walking as he did before...

104
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,300
Are you saying that it's impossible?

105
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,920
It's as extremely difficult a task as

106
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,270
it is for me to give you a definite answer.

107
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,900
You also said in the past that

108
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,080
the healing of his bones and flesh were a miracle.

109
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,230
We'll just have to hope for a second miracle.

110
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,930
By the way, the remainder of Executive Director's (your) cancer treatment,

111
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,720
I will get that ready as well.

112
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,670
 After staying in the hospital for a long time, you know 

113
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,160
 how many sick people there are in the world.   

114
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,700
 Whether a little or a lot, 

115
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,500
 we are all hurting in the end. 

116
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,650
 So don't cry.   

117
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,940
 Everyone lives while enduring and bearing.   

118
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,890
 You have to return pretty and sexy.   

119
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,490
Straighten this leg.

120
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,180
Good.

121
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,640
Nice.

122
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,720
Good.

123
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,100
Remember this is just the beginning.

124
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,770
He's made significant improvements in every single category you can imagine.

125
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay.

126
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,840
 Dating Cafeteria 

127
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,720
 Dating Cafeteria 

128
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,700
 I will want to run to her if I look at her. 

129
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,430
 I still can't do that. 

130
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,450
Let's straighten your leg. A little more. More.

131
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,860
More! More! More! Your waist.

132
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,680
More! More! More!

133
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,340
- Ji Woong. 
 - Hyung.

134
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,230
Joon Seong.

135
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,490
You did well. You were good. You did well.

136
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,530
Hyung!

137
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,210
Stay strong.

138
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,710
One more time.

139
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,490
Pull.

140
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,820
 December 24, 2015    

141
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,820
Isn't it too pink?

142
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,210
I know, right. I went too far with the color.

143
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,600
It's an honor to escort you again like this.

144
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,410
Ah, why are you overreacting again?

145
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:33,180
It's enough to just say, "You did well, you worked hard," with these two things.

146
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,500
You did well.

147
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,570
You've worked hard.

148
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,170
Okay.

149
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,580
You too.

150
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,470
 Oh My Venus 

151
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,740
 Coachnim, this is the 60th video. 

152
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,990
 Now, I can hold a plank for even a minute easily. 

153
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,220
 Don't worry about me. Fighting again today! 

154
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,810
Just because you don't check the videos you think I won't send them? No!

155
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,720
 When you know that I am Kang Joo Eun that can do anything that I put my effort into. 

156
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,060
 Don't rush too much and don't hurt too much. 

157
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,500
 Don't worry about me. 

158
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,000
 Other than missing you, I'm just fine. 

159
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,170
 Fighting! 

160
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:29,150


161
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,810
It's been a long time, Kang Joo Eun.

162
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,190
♬   That's how love is  ♬

163
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,210
It must be real, this person.

164
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:00,190
♬   You left me only with pain  ♬

165
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,950
♬   That's how love is  ♬

166
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:14,870
♬   It makes you come to me  ♬

167
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,940
♬   I think I'm in love  ♬

168
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,890
♬   I think I like only you  ♬

169
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,160
♬   From the love which found me again  ♬

170
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,150
♬   Although I'm even a little afraid  ♬

171
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:40,570
♬   Please stay at my side.  ♬

172
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,800
♬   That's how love is dazzling.  ♬

173
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,490
I should have earned a lot of money.

174
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,050
Since I was born, this is the day I feel most grateful for,

175
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,210
so I want to share some rice cakes with everyone in the world.

176
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,450
This woman. You talk about food as soon as you see me.

177
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,140
Yes, Hyeon Jeong.

178
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,090
Okay, I'll be back soon.

179
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,280
Christmas is tomorrow and there is a document that I need to send.

180
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,540
I'll stay here. Go and come back.

181
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,930
Just a moment. It just needs to be a moment.

182
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,630
Do you want to go somewhere inside? It's cold.

183
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,830
I'll stay  right  here.

184
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,130
Let's go together.

185
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,380
Stay where I can see you.

186
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,080
♬   It's me, even if I don't know how to express it, it's me,  ♬

187
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,440
♬  My eyes are only looking at you,   For me, for me, for me.     ♬

188
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,000
♬   Without even realizing it, you, you, you,   ♬

189
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,210
You need to get off. 
♬   Love Is You     ♬  

190
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,260
Ah. 
 ♬   I'm thrilled somehow today    ♬

191
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:32,650
♬   I'm getting this feeling I'm getting this feeling      ♬  

192
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:38,010
♬   When you look at me  ♬
 ♬   When you call my name  ♬

193
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,580
♬   I'm not confident that I won't laugh  ♬

194
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh, Lawyer.

195
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,170
It's been a while, Hyeon Jeong.

196
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,620
Ah, was Lawyer Kang staying well?

197
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,410
She kept crying at the drop of a hat all year, so I was really worried that something was wrong with her.

198
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,770
Hyeon Jeong.

199
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,520
However, did you go somewhere?

200
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,410
Yes, for a little.

201
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:19,710
♬  Drawing me without a choice.    Oh.      Without my even noticing.     You You You  ♬

202
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,730
Hyeon Jeong, when does Ms. Jung Yeong Hee's rebuttal in writing have to go out by?

203
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,800
You have to send it out within the next two hours since it's Christmas tomorrow.

204
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,610
I will send it from home as soon as I can.

205
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,700
Yes.

206
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,480
Hyeon Jeong, Merry Christmas!

207
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,360
Merry Christmas to the both of you also!

208
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,150
♬   When you look at me.   When you call my name  ♬

209
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,470
Stay here for a little bit. I'll be done soon.

210
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,550
 Kang Joo Eun   

211
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,540
Let's go.

212
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,400
Slowly. We have a lot of time.

213
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,860
I don't have a lot of time. I have to send out a rebuttal.

214
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,650
I'll finish it quickly, so make yourself as comfortable as you can and rest.

215
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,700
Stop looking at me. You'll wear me out.

216
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,690
The sooner you get it done, we'll be able to kiss from being so happy to see each other. (referring to a children's show)

217
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,570
 I don't know if you know.  

218
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:07,600
 The process and the time it took for me to get to you, 

219
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,390
 people call it a miracle. 

220
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,470
 But to me, the woman in front of me,  

221
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,720
 you, who are looking at me, are the miracle. 

222
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,100
 I can't tell you in words how sorry I am  

223
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,030
 that I made you wait for so long. That's the guilt I have to live with. 

224
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,500
 You, who must have cried for me everyday,  

225
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,150
 you were the strength that pulled me back up, 

226
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:28,320
 and you're the best cure in my life, my reason for healing, and my miracle. 

227
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,100
 Would you know that? 

228
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,950
Thank you.

229
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,480
Thank you.

230
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,260
You don't know how fortunate I feel.

231
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,330
I feel like I can finally breathe now.

232
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,050
It's probably Secretary Min.

233
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,150
A comfortable and a racy night. He's always interfering.

234
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,070
You have to go and say hello to your elders.

235
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,030
What kind of a woman are you?

236
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,030
Go and come back safely.

237
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,880
See you tomorrow.

238
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,520
Tomorrow?

239
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,530
Because I'm going to see you  every day.

240
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,040
♬   That's how love is.  ♬

241
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,580
♬   Something that only left me with pain  ♬

242
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,910
♬   And that's how love is   ♬

243
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:19,400
♬   It approaches with the wind silently  ♬

244
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,680
♬   To love someone  ♬

245
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,650
♬   You become more like that person   ♬

246
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,770
♬   It may even cause me to lose myself  ♬

247
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,280
♬   But that's how love is  ♬

248
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,490
♬   Crying and making you laugh  ♬

249
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,150
♬   I think I'm in love  ♬

250
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,310
♬   I think I love you  ♬

251
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,360
♬   From the love which found me once again,  ♬

252
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,500
♬   Although I am even a little scared   ♬

253
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,910
♬   I can't escape  ♬

254
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,370
♬   So what if it hurts  a little?   ♬

255
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,760
♬   I am going to love you.  ♬

256
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,100
♬    Both on those days I miss you  ♬

257
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,120
♬   and those days I want to cry sometimes  ♬

258
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,310
♬   Stay with me  ♬

259
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,690
Yes, Joo Eun.

260
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,840
Hyeon Woo, what do I do?

261
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,780
♬   That's how love is  ♬

262
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:46,080
What's wrong? Do you feel like crying again?

263
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,180
Let's go to a hospital. You'll die at this rate.

264
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,880
This man—

265
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,010
I know. The one whose name you'll be calling while  dying, what now?

266
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,040
He came back.

267
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,880
Really?

268
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,750
Yes.

269
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,740
I saw his face and I've touched him.

270
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,990
It really is him.

271
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,830
Oh, Joo Eun...

272
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,120
Joo Eun, that's so great!

273
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,500
Yes...

274
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,990
 Santa Claus is a total liar!  

275
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,300
 You cried so much all year and he gave you such a huge present. 

276
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,350
Stop crying. Stop pretending to be so innocent.

277
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,370
Yes. Of course we should.

278
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,270
It's something to be celebrated more than Christmas.

279
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,020
Okay. I got it.

280
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,630
 Mom! 

281
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,350
Aigoo, my child! You're home? Aigoo.

282
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,920
Do Min Joon, what did you do with dad?

283
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,520
We went to an amusement park.

284
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,600
- Was it fun? 
 - Yes, totally.

285
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,320
Dad gave me a ride on his shoulders for just a minute.

286
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,140
What?

287
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,460
I thought my neck was going to get pulled out since he eats so well and grew up so big.

288
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,260
Aigoo. You're a dad after all.

289
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,890
It's not easy to give someone with the weight of our Min Joon a ride on your shoulders.

290
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,870
Go in now.

291
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,970
Okay. Bye, Dad.

292
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,830
Son, next time, let's go see the shark at the aquarium.

293
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay, Dad. Merry Christmas!

294
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,950
Merry Christmas!

295
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,330
Take this with you.

296
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,600
Aren't you leaving?

297
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,060
Here's child support.

298
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,280
It's okay, don't give it to me anymore.

299
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,720
I don't want to raise our son with the money you make by plundering other people.

300
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,870
Even though it's too late for you to be a good husband, I'd like for you to be a good dad.

301
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,110
Do you think I like living this way and being criticized?

302
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:05,390
This is all for our Min Joon, so he can go to college and get married.

303
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,630
Aigo, we'll just have to laugh it off.

304
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,470
No matter what, Merry Christmas, Ex-Wife.

305
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,970
Me too, Ex-Husband.

306
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm going now.

307
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,410
Okay, bye.

308
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,770
Oh my Soo Jin. You're here?

309
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,410
You haven't eaten yet, right?

310
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,120
You must be hungry. Come here.

311
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,800
Just a second. Let me change.

312
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Okay.

313
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,120
Here.

314
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,510
Cheers.

315
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,100
Cheers for what?

316
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,450
For Christmas eve?

317
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,250
And to add,

318
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,780
for our

319
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,850
bright future.

320
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,710
I feel strange.

321
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,990
It took a little time but from now on, for Oh Soo Jin,

322
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,890
I will stay put.

323
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,930
Here.

324
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,800
How in the world...

325
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,670
Oh my God!

326
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,620
You've worked hard to come.

327
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:20,010
I am back, Grandma and Father.

328
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,660
Yeah, my child.

329
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,590
Yeah, my child. My child.

330
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,050
Aigo, my child.

331
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,950
My child.

332
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,670
Let's eat, Chairwoman.

333
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,480
Yeah. My child.

334
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,280
Let's eat. Let's eat. My child.

335
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
Please eat, Grandma.

336
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,400
Okay. Eat a lot.

337
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:06,060
The halibut sikhye isn't as good as before.

338
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,320
I guess we couldn't replicate Madam's cooking skills.

339
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,710
Here. Eat.

340
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,840
Grandma, please eat.

341
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,270
How are you feeling now?

342
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,960
I am okay.

343
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,090
I meant the neuropathy.

344
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,950
It seems like you knew.

345
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,820
Of course, I'm your dad.

346
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,680
Chairwoman doesn't know.

347
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,040
I see.

348
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,590
As for the neuropathy, I still haven't felt it after the accident.

349
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,390
It is a relief.

350
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,030
You did well.

351
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,000
Also, we told everyone that the president of the hospital was our interim director,

352
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,390
so get back to work as soon as possible.

353
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,370
Yes.

354
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,920
Sleep over in your room.

355
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,960
Yes, Father.

356
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,530
 Grandma, are you sleeping?  

357
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,040
 How can I reply to all of your 192 text messages? 

358
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:49,420
  Oh my Venus, Kang Joo Eun 

359
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,790
  Kang 

360
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,680
  Joo Eun 

361
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,860
 Kang Joo Eun.  

362
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,060
 Kang Joo Eun who has a relationship with me.  

363
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,840
Seriously. It's not like I don't know it.

364
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,630
I must be really crazy. Seriously.

365
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,110
Don't cry.

366
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,280
I can't cry.

367
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,510
 See you in a bit. Don't be late.  

368
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,760
- Ma'am! 
 - Open sesame!

369
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,600
Ji Woong, long time no see.

370
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,230
Really!

371
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,210
I really missed you.

372
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,130
We talked on the phone and on Kakaotalk.

373
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,270
Even then, it has been a long time since seeing each other  face-to-face.

374
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,090
I know, huh?

375
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,430
Where is Joon Seong?

376
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:25,810
He went to give a gift— (informally)
 To give a gift to his mom. (formally).

377
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,570
I guess you learned the polite speech.

378
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,610
I went to Harvard. I am smart.

379
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,020
What do you mean? I heard you failed to get into the marines six times.

380
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,650
But I never give up. I will try again.

381
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,020
We don't have much time, so let's hurry up and get things ready.

382
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,210
Hyung Joon Seong said he would come home soon.

383
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,070
Your wound is all better.

384
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,150
I couldn't bring myself to watch the matches.

385
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,810
It is normal in the beginning. Here is the coat.

386
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,910
You bought me one last year.

387
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,750
Even then. You just wear that every day.

388
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,390
Of course. Since my son bought it.

389
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,760
- Mom. 
 - Yeah.

390
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,070
Mom.

391
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,310
What?

392
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,410
I think it will be a late night tonight.

393
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,000
Do you want to watch a movie later?

394
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,760
By the way, I heard your hyungnim came back.

395
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,810
Yes.

396
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,440
Look at that. What did I say?

397
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,830
The heavens help good people.

398
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,840
It is a relief. I am grateful.

399
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,010
Mother-in-law!

400
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,520
- You came? 
 - Yes.

401
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,440
What's on your face?

402
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:53,710
Your son likes to volunteer and make donations so I just got back from volunteering to deliver coal.

403
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,590
But look at this. "What's on your face?"

404
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,790
Mother, you haven't ridden in a van yet, right?

405
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,790
Please ride in my car today and let's go eat something delicious on our own.

406
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,560
Oh yeah?

407
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,630
Let's go.

408
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,690
See you later, my son.

409
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,930
Mom.

410
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,210
Let's go.

411
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,820
Happy birthday!

412
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,920
Happy birthday.

413
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,540
Wooh! Congratulations.

Now close your eyes and make a wish.

425
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,340
Happy birthday, Mr. Kim Yeong Ho.

426

Hyungnim Yeong Ho and Mr. Coach.

427
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,930
Please blow the candle.

428
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,350
Uncle, I can get off the toilet by myself now.

429
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,970
Oh, you've grown a lot.

430
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,960
Since I haven't met you in a long time, your sexiness became more dripping.

431
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,930
You were born very well. You have 4 of the same digits (1-2-2-5) as Jesus.

432
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,200
Thank you.

433
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,280
Hyung, happy birthday.

434
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,660
That looks like Kang Joo Eun's doing.

435
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,250
Because there were half threats.

436
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,510
Ah, it was a legitimate request with a little bit of force added.

437
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,490
Since we have a celebratory performance, let's take our VIP over and everyone to their places!

438
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,070
Go!

439

♬ It's okay, don't worry about those things

461
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,460
♬ I don't have a boyfriend anyway

462
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,090
♬ But why aren't you saying anything?

463
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,190
♬ Do you know that you need me?

464
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,670
Is that the song you know?

465
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,450
In my heyday boys used to request this song on the radio a lot in Daegu.

466
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,920
They asked for it to be played in the bus I rode in.

467
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,140
♬ It's the same for me

468
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,050
♬ Like this

469
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:58,090
It's your solo, Hyung!

470
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,630
Come on.

471
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,830
So nice.

472
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,220
Yes, Mom. I am sorry for not being able to go there this year either.

473
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,740
Mom, where are you?

474
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,670
Add some more sesame oil.

475
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:15,570
Did you think I'd be sitting around in some corner of the house when you're not here?

476
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,680
I am taking care of my beautiful grandson.

477
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,540
Why are you taking care of him when he's not your baby?

478
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,350
The ones who had him are both there.

479
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,200
They're cooking for me.

480
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,330
What is the matter?

481
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,840
Aigoo, aigoo, my baby.

482
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Aigoo, where are you feeling uncomfortable?

483
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,130
Aigoo, he's so cute, even when I'm half asleep.

484
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,500
Aigoo, you're a devoted grandmother.

485
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,750
I got it, Mom.

486
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,430
Merry Christmas.

487
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,830
 Happy New Year. 

488
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,740
 A year ago, someone who used to pretend she was okay even though she was lonely,  

489
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,410
Aigoo.

490
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:07,360
 a year later, through a new relationship, everything has become a little better. 

491
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,560
I am late, right?

492
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,170
Oppa, why are you so late?

493
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,680
Here. Oh? What's that expression?

494
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,840
Omo! Let me get in there.

495
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,910
  As for someone, he met someone he longed for.  

496
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:46,200
 As for someone else, she is together with someone she had been waiting for.  

497
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,990
 It might be not be very surprising and maybe even obvious, 

498
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,830
 but the real miracle of Christmas,  

499
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:09,400
  isn't it you who must be by my side?  

500
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,260
I don't think I can let Kang Joo Eun leave today.

501
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,780
I didn't say I would leave.

502
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,630
This.

503
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,080
You saw.

504
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,090
Of course. I endured because of it.

505
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,780
  I am sorry for making you wait, Kang Joo Eun.  

506
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,950
  Thank you for coming earlier than I thought, Mr. Coach.  

507
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,640
What wish did you make?

508
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,020
Did you ask them not to make you hurt?

509
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,890
Not me.

510
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:45,750
Kang Joo Eun, don't be hurt.

511
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:03,360
I would like today to be a comfortable and warm night.

512
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,440
♬   You left me only with pain   ♬

513
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,710
Okay.

514
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,690
♬   Love is like that,  ♬

515
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:23,900
♬  It approaches with the wind silently  ♬

516
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,890
♬  To  love someone  ♬

517
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,040
♬  makes you become more like them  ♬

518
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,900
♬   it may even cause me to lose myself  ♬

519
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,010
♬  But that's how love is  ♬

520
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,030
Warm night.

521
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,860
♬  Crying and making you laugh  ♬

522
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:53,000
♬  I think I am in love.  ♬
