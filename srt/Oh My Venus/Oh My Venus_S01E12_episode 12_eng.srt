 Episode 12 

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,590
♬  I didn't know it would hurt this much   ♬

4
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,850
I am sorry. Mr. Coach.
 ♬  I didn't know  ♬

5
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,530
♬  I would want to see you this much  ♬

6
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,870
♬  Slowly my heart would be influenced  ♬

7
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:15,460
♬  Before I knew it only you filled it completely  ♬

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,460
♬  I enjoyed the time I had with you  ♬

9
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,620
♬  I was happy if you smiled looking at me  ♬

10
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,530
♬  Just like that  ♬

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,940
♬  Time stood still  ♬

12
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,530
♬  I want to stay with you  ♬

13
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,710
You are the main guest today. Why are you like this?

14
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,840
What should I do?
 ♬  I will stay by your side  ♬

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,800
I think I will be very late.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,930
♬  I will say I will love you   ♬

17
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,970
People are waiting for you.

18
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,280
Your grandma, your father, Joon Seong, Ji Woong, everyone.

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
♬  Because I only see you  ♬

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,490
♬  I'm saying I don't have a choice  ♬

21
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,230
Get up.

22
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,470
Kang Joo Eun.

23
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,390
Since you are enduring the pain like this, it isn't the limit yet.

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,930
 I can still do it so 

25
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,310
 it is not the limit yet.  

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,700
♬  I will keep you with me always  ♬

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,970
♬  I won't waver and will embrace you  ♬

28
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,650
Look at me.
♬  I will embrace you  ♬

29
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,930
If you believe it, you can do it.
♬  Because you are  ♬

30
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,870
Because you believe that you can do it.
♬  everything to me  ♬

31
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,260
  If you believe it, you can do it.  

32
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,120
  Because you believe that you can do it.  

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
♬  And I am never letting you go  ♬

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,130
What is this?

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,310
Will he come or not?

36
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,050
Director Kim Yeong Ho has just arrived.

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,550
Then we will welcome Director Kim Yeong Ho with much admiration and praise.

38
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,560
  The 61st anniversary of Gahong 

39
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Hello. I am Gahong Medical Group's new Executive Director, Kim Yeong Ho.

40
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,910
Oh, Yi Jin.

41
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,290
Hi.

42
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,240
How did you come here?

43
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,920
No, no, no. It isn't me this time.

44
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,440
You didn't look me up online, huh?

45
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,710
I am the CF Queen who is also the only child of Jang Shin Foods.

46
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,540
Oh for real?

47
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,050
Now let's tell her whatever we want to eat.

48
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,840
After all, we're all 'friends'.

49
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,780
What? Are you not okay with me being rich?

50
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,670
You really have a lot of things that you're not okay with.

51
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,520
In any case, since we've slept together...

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,160
Oh, Hyung, you are the man.

53
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,830
Please get away. People are watching.

54
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,050
You care about other people's attention?

55
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,060
Isn't that the kind of profession you're in?

56
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,200
What is this? So cool.

57
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,980
Yes, Oppa. Did it end well?

58
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,120
It's not like they forbade you from coming, so why are you staying home of your own will?

59
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,430
It's because you keep being like this because you keep patiently suffering.

60
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,640
And Yeong Joon also, he should have been here as well.

61
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,320
It isn't that the US is that far.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,930
It's not like the 61st anniversary celebration is something he isn't expected to attend.

63
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,350
I'm going to hang up now.

64
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,620
Kim Yeong Ho became the executive director.

65
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,140
It is okay, Yeong Joon. It is okay.

66
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,570
It is okay.

67
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,270
He's coming out. He's coming out.  Has he become the executive director?

68
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,240
Are you really John Kim?

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,200
If you submit your questions in writing to the secretary's office at Gahong we will give you a sincere response.

70
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,390
- You've worked hard. 
 - Yes.

71
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,790
- See you tomorrow. 
 - You've worked hard.

72
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,490
- You've worked hard today. 
 - Yes. Please go back.

73
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,960
♬   You left and left me only with pain  ♬

74
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,240
♬   That's how love is  ♬

75
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:33,350
♬   You are approaching with the wind silently  ♬

76
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,420
♬   To love someone  ♬

77
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,560
♬   To be going to resemble that again  ♬

78
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,460
♬   It may even cause me to lose but  ♬

79
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,010
♬   That's how love is.  ♬

80
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,150
♬   Crying and making you laugh  ♬

81
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,900
♬   I think I'm in love  ♬

82
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,890
♬   I think I like only you  ♬

83
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,040
♬   From the one who found me again  ♬

84
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,150
♬   Although I'm even a little afraid  ♬

85
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,590
♬   I can't escape.  ♬

86
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,580
♬   So what if it hurts a little?  ♬

87
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,660
You didn't go?
 ♬   I'm going to love you.  ♬

88
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,450
There was something I forgot and hadn't been able to tell you...

89
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,670
♬   Both when you want to see me  ♬

90
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,730
You were pretty today.

91
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,340
Pretty enough to be in my dreams every night.

92
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,510
Oh, what is this?

93
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,520
♬   That's how love is.  ♬

94
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,660
It will be hard for you to become Cinderella,

95
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,850
because you have your shoe off instead of on.

96
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,540
It will be hard for you to become a prince.

97
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,420
By just your nature you should  put everyone's shoe on.

98
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,980
♬   To me who sat down to cry  ♬

99
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,960
Are you okay?

100
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,520
You should worry about yourself.
♬   That's how love is.  ♬

101
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,960
Why is your foot this big?

102
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,310
Am I short? How about my shoulders? Or pelvis?

103
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,710
So...

104
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,080
What kind of woman gets bigger the more I look at her?

105
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,180
♬   I think I like only you  ♬

106
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,810
An x-ray needs to be taken in order to know.

107
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,990
I think your tendon is slightly sprained.

108
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,670
Go quickly and rest.

109
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,320
Because I am going to ride the pumpkin carriage to go to hospital.

110
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,060
♬   I can't escape.  ♬

111
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,290
♬   So what if it hurts a little?  ♬

112
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,170
♬   I'm going to love you.  ♬

113
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,260
♬   Both when you want to see me  ♬

114
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,310
♬   and when you sometimes want to understand me  ♬

115
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,690
♬   Please stay by my side.  ♬

116
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:24,290
♬   That's how love is dazzling.  ♬

117
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,300
Thanks to you, I got home safely.

118
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,610
Now, just leave.

119
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,930
You didn't drink even a drop of water the whole time there.

120
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,700
That's why you're like this.

121
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,880
I heard from PD Go

122
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,490
that you prevented my revealing Kim Yeong Ho's identity from becoming an issue.

123
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,430
Because I didn't want it to become noisier.

124
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,100
That's all it was.

125
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,550
Thank you.

126
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,020
"I am sorry." And next is, "Thank you"?

127
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,030
Don't look at me like that.

128
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,110
I am not kind.

129
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,220
I am heartless and vicious. I am a cruel bitch that stole my friend's boyfriend.

130
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,990
No, you are kind.

131
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,240
No, I am not kind.

132
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,380
I am not kind. I am not kind! I said I am not kind.

133
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,340
So...

134
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,030
Don't look at me like that.

135
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,430
Do you remember?

136
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,760
The day you passed the bar and went on a blind date.

137
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,650
While crying because of your pride shattering,

138
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,870
you saw my injured hand and said that.

139
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,130
  Let's go.  

140
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,800
  Woo Sik, you got hurt.  

141
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,910
Do you think I am the same as back then?

142
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,400
Don't you see me right now?

143
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,540
I thought you would hate me because of the matter with Joo Eun's stalker.

144
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,340
But you were the first to come running.

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,460
While knowing that I am a bad jerk, you waited for me and protected me.

146
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,840
Oh Soo Jin.

147
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,040
You are the same as the you at that time.

148
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,960
What should I do?

149
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,460
I don't have anything else to say, other than I am sorry and I am grateful.

150
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,270
Watch your head.

151
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,950
Wait a minute. It hurts a lot.

152
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,680
Here.

153
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,170
Are you okay?

154
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,900
You will be okay after being careful for a few days.

155
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,300
My shoulders and arms hurt more than my leg, seriously.

156
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,710
Sorry, Ma'am.

157
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,500
Thank you for your excessive care.

158
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,340
What's going on here?

159
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,290
Mom.

160
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,620
Joo Eun.

161
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,870
They are my friends with  whom I work out.

162
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,150
- It's because I sprained my ankle a bit. 
 - Really?

163
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,680
They brought me home.

164
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,450
Hello.I

165
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,030
Then you are Ma'am's mom.

166
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,680
I love you.

167
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,860
Aigo. Welcome (to) Korea.

168
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,140
Nice to meet you.

169
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,230
Then we will just leave.

170
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,860
How can I just let the guests leave like that?

171
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,900
Just wait a bit.

172
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,640
Ma'am, isn't that Hyung Yeong Ho's clothes?

173
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,650
Why are you wearing that?

174
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:12,250
It's really so comfortable. Are these the clothes you wore when you were fat?

175
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,030
- What are you going to do? 
 - Stay still.

176
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,280
I have to feed the guests before they leave.

177
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,950
Here.

178
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,310
Mom, they have to watch what they eat because they are athletes.

179
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,480
Then it turned out well. You need to eat well to gain strength.

180
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,270
- It isn't...
 - Then I will just eat the meat portion well.

181
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,400
I will enjoy the food.

182
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,060
You have to rip it like this. Then it will taste good.

183
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Here.

184
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,330
Thank you.

185
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,570
Whose sons are you that you are so handsome?

186
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,320
It is good.

187
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,360
Why? You should also eat a bit.

188
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,370
No.

189
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,950
If you've lost this much it looks like all the daughters on TV might starve to death.

190
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,540
Eat.

191
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,150
If that is the case, should I eat a little? From the meat part.

192
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,210
Eat it with salt.

193
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,020
That's right. I think I have Gak (mustard leaf) kimchi.

194
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,710
God kimchi?

195
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,170
No. It isn't that.

196
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,850
It is a relief that I only gained that much weight back then. Look at this.

197
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,100
Aigo, it looks like it ripened deliciously. Try it.

198
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,680
Wow.

199
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,840
Try it, Ji Woong.

200
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,240
Isn't it spicy?

201
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,230


202
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,190
  My leg is okay but I was wondering how your leg is doing.  

203
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,030
 I heard you tore into some chicken legs? You little... 

204
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,520
  My mom is exempt from the rules. If I don't eat, she will nag me all day.  

205
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,970
 I will work officially starting from tomorrow.  

206
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,100
 Tell Growing Sprout's mother that I've escaped from unemployment.  

207
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,110
 Now you can make enough to pay for food. 

208
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,750
  I will tell you in advance, as your senior who is already working. It isn't a joke to get someone else's money.  

209
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,980
 I would like it if your leg could hold up throughout all this. 

210
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,540
  Neuropathy! 

211
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,370
  I will beat that rascal.  

212
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,640
  It isn't something that someone can make better.  

213
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,340
So you don't want me to help next time?

214
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,290
Even when you are sick, your consistency is awesome.

215
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,130
  It's what the doctor said.  

216
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,310
 I guess the doctor was wrong.  

217
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,330
  Elevate the sprained leg on a pillow.   Not too high. 

218
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,390
  Yes, yes, Mr. Coach. Good night.  

219
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,400
  You were pretty today.  

220
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
  Pretty enough to be in my dream every night. 

221
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,040
 I need to sleep but what should I do? ㅠㅠ   (sad emoticon)  

222
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,320
 The hearts kept coming out from my eyes. 

223
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,380
I guess I can stop texting Woo Sik.

224
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,100
If it's to the point that you don't even sleep and laugh and carry on like this...

225
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,280
it's fine then.

226
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,260
I'll boil you some ox knee cartilage soup for a good long time so don't throw it away and eat all of it.

227
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,320
Aigo, Father from Heaven and Joo Eun's father.

228
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,850
You take care of your own knee cartilage.

229
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,200
Get the treatment for your wrist.

230
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,630
Come to my office tomorrow so we can go to the hospital together.

231
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,160
It's not like there aren't any hospitals in Daegu.

232
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,840
Stop being noisy and go to sleep.

233
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,050
What are you doing?

234
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,710
Ah, Ma'am's mom gave me this yesterday. It tastes amazing.

235
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,820
Son, eat a lot.

236
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,680
She resembled Lawyer Kang a lot.

237
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,660
Really?

238
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,640
It's a little salty. You should eat something more bland.

239
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,070
Ah, you know that a kid who isn't good at studying usually overdoes it right?

240
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,090
Don't overdo it before the test.

241
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,120
Okay, Hyung.

242
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,570
And you check his body well.

243
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,230
Yes, sir.

244
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,910
Since from now on I won't have much time except for the weekends—

245
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,690
Hyung, we are not babies. Don't worry.

246
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,350
Hyung, don't worry so much about us.

247
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,310
I guess this is your way of saying you're all grown up.

248
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,270
After eating Ma'am's mom's food, I feel like seeing Ma'am. Oh my Venus.

249
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,570
She's mine. I'm leaving.

250
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,450
How can a person change so much?

251
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,010
How did that happen to your leg?

252
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,320
Does it hurt a lot?

253
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,280
No. They told me I just have to be careful with it for a couple of days.

254
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,610
Ah, that morning meeting is not happening.

255
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,640
Why?

256
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,910
Because the Vice CEO didn't come in today.

257
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,930
What's the reason?

258
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,910
She didn't say anything about it yesterday, but it appears she's not answering her phone today.

259
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,480
I understand. I guess she must have reason.

260
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,970
I'll bring you some coffee.

261
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,660
Thank you.

262
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,120
What could it be?

263
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,800
Why should the mouse be concerned for the cat?

264
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,630
Congratulations on officially starting work.

265
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,000
Ah, making me waver this early in the day.

266
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,990
As to the scandal, the PR team and the legal team are handling it as a written statement.

267
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,910
As to any excessive unreasonable speculation, the legal team is prepared to respond to it forcefully.

268
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,680
The exterior noise has been mostly handled...

269
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,740
I suppose the interior work is my job now,

270
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,600
since it's the truth that I am a gold spoon nakhasan ( nepotism  beneficiary ).

271
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:39,080
This is the business plan for next year. Also, it appears the Chairwoman is aware of Kang Joo Eun.

272
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,290
The directors are coming in for the afternoon meeting.

273
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,980
Let them in.

274
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,100
- Then we—
- Then, let's meet again tomorrow.

275
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,430
But Deputy Section Chief...

276
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,860
We... Hey, I'm talking...

277
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:22,230
I can see that our executive director's body has been formed over more than a couple of days of exercise.

278
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,460
You look very similar to how I looked ten years ago...

279
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,480
Ah, do you play golf?

280
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,300
We should go to hit the ball together sometime.

281
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,290
I'm more a fan of sports with direct contact.

282
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,420
Rather than hitting I like lifting more.

283
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,470
Ah, well then.

284
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,110
 Did you eat? 

285
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,870
 I just finished eating! You ghost! 

286
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,640
Was I too obvious that I've been waiting for his text?

287
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,970
 Then we should do a video call. 

288
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,490
If I don't answer, I guess that's the end of it.

289
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,730
 How's your leg? 

290
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,190
 It's all better now and I am modestly sitting and doing work. 

291
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,690
 I'm doing fine. 

292
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,330
Yes Hyeon Jeong.

293
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,970
You seem to be creating a new meaning for the word modesty, lawyer Kang.

294
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,340
You told me you finished your food, what a lie.

295
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,320
Since your lunch time is not over, get up.

296
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,950
What is this? I guess he must be real.

297
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,790
Oh, lawyer Kang, are you okay?

298
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,450
Yes.

299
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,530
My mind is more uncomfortable than my leg is right now.

300
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,030
Kang Joo Eun's mind is my business, and

301
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,930
Kang Joon's leg is also my business.

302
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,370
I'm going to be quite busy.

303
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,450
Hyeon Jeong.

304
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,310
Lawyer.

305
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,370
This is Jo Hyeon Jeong who works with me.

306
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,990
Hello. Please take good care of Lawyer Kang.

307
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,390
Yes.

308
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,660
You can leave.

309
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay.

310
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,670
Are you campaigning for election?

311
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,340
Where are we going?

312
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,660
If you start something, you should finish it.

313
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,810
 The rest of the racy and comfortable night will have to happen soon. 

314
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,930
But it's daytime.

315
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,530
Please raise your arms up a little bit more.

316
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,050
What was I thinking?

317
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,630
♬  Nobody get in my way  ♬

318
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,590
Please don't speak.

319
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,060
♬   I’m feeling so good   ♬

320
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,890
♬   Everything is so fine  ♬

321
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,380
♬   It's like flying  ♬

322
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,730
♬   When I think of you I am again  ♬

323
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,350
♬   unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

324
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,610
♬   Thinking of her every morning, I  ♬

325
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,580
♬   even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo.  ♬

326
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,980
 According to Article 12 Section 1 of the Constitution, a citizen cannot be subjected to an illegal— 

327
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,190
 How else? Should I... measure you with a tape measure? 

328
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,720
 I told you that you can't say, "No, I can't. I won't", didn't I? 

329
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,730
 Your body is now mine. Mine. 

330
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,110
 Mine. It's up to me what I choose to do with it. 

331
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,970
​♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

332
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,780
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eye off  ♬

333
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,280
♬   so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

334
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,910
Okay, on to the next event.

335
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,490
More? What is it?

336
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,490
We need to see your blood.

337
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,830
♬   To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

338
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,850
Let's go.

339
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,160
Today I have lots of consultations. I have to get back to the office.

340
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,960
Jo Hyeon Jeong told me that you don't have any consultations till the afternoon. Why don't you stay late to finish your work?

341
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,210
I don't want to. It's not blood that you can avoid so let's both not try to dodge it. Okay?

342
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,560
♬   In my dreams too with you by my side  ♬

343
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,940
Oppa.
♬   Time, move slowly Ah Ah  ♬

344
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,430
♬   All day every day she lingers  ♬

345
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,120
♬   Laughing like a fool, hoo hoo hoo  ♬

346
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,530
No, let's go.

347
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't like blood!

348
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,390
It's okay. It's okay. I'll show you a sweet taste afterwards.

349
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,810
Oppa.

350
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,070
​♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

351
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,040
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off.  ♬

352
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,870
Please tell me when the needle is going in.

353
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,310
Ah, okay.

354
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,590
What am I doing because of you?

355
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,270
Bear it for just a little bit.

356
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,620
You're doing well. Just bear it for a little bit. Breathe.

357
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,270
Hit her strongly so it will hurt less (when you stick).

358
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,660
♬   So baby I've got to hug you in my arms  ♬

359
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,200
Omo! What's the occasion?

360
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,410
You saw blood so it's for you to taste the sweetness.

361
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,890
It's like a mom who gives her child a sweet after they go to the dentist.

362
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,830
 Degree of Obesity Measurement Results Report 

363
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,530
I've lost almost all the weight I needed to lose. You were just thinking I was so pretty.

364
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,520
It's not the outsides that need to be pretty but rather the insides.

365
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,290
 Degree of Obesity Measurement Results Report 

366
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,970
You didn't throw this away.

367
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,480
Didn't I say that your body is mine?

368
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,770
Are there people who go around throwing away their hearts?

369
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,990
Okay name is Kang Joo Eun. Age 34 years.

370
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,350
Height 172 cm. Weight 99 kg.

371
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,880
Ah, really!

372
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,650
This is a really desirable physique.

373
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,100
Physique?

374
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,290
Your physique is exactly that of an athlete,

375
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,540
I don't know why you studied when you're not even suited for it.

376
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,060
Your body fat being normal is a welcome sight

377
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,160
and I'm glad your muscle percentage has increased.

378
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Amongst these, the thing I'm happiest about is

379
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,170
the escape of Ms. Kang Joo Eun's abdominal fat.

380
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,190
Really?

381
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,950
Good job.

382
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,230
Ah, what did I tell you?

383
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,400
I told you I could do anything that I put my mind to.

384
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,490
Can I say a word on my thoughts?

385
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,670
The most important thing...

386
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,310
Thyroid and cholesterol levels.

387
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,700
If you work just a little harder, it looks like you won't have to keep taking your medicine.

388
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,550
Omo.

389
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,840
Say what you are thinking.

390
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,400
I will give all the glory to Mr. Coach John Kim.

391
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,530
But don't forget.

392
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,650
You must bring your thyroid and cholesterol levels back to normal,

393
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,930
because the inside is more important than the outside, okay?

394
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,290
Yes, Mr. Coach.

395
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,910
May I eat?

396
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,080
Just a little.

397
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,140
I made the halibut sikhae that you like.

398
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,100
It will take a little time for it to reach the desired taste.

399
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,410
They will bring you the preserved plum also, if you ask for it, when your stomach is uncomfortable.

400
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,170
Thank you for everything during all this time.

401
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,910
As soon as the residence is prepared, I'll move out by myself.

402
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,040
You can't lose President Kim as well, because of me.

403
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,410
You really...

404
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,320
What a heartless fate we have.

405
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,040
Mother, even if you didn't give me the spot by your side,

406
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,070
my family's livelihood, my brother;

407
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,490
I know that you looked after them from time to time.

408
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,090
I've been indebted to you throughout this time.

409
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:27,920
It would have been better if only your brother, Director Choi, was a bit less ambitious.

410
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,550
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,180
Holding onto my child in my heart,

412
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,850
this heartless old woman that's lived till this age,

413
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,190
who's trying to protect her last remaining blood relation.

414
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,630
This spiteful old woman who's behaving so heartlessly,

415
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,430
please see it that way.

416
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:08,230
I should repay you for all your hard work.

417
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,090
Not at all, Mother.

418
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,950
Please accept it.

419
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,560
I could not give you my heart,

420
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,470
but you fed me for the past 20 years.

421
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,630
Please accept it.

422
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:34,710
If I can't even do this much, am I human?

423
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,420
Min Joon went to Yoona's house and Min Joon's grandmother is in the kitchen.

424
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,630
How about your restaurant?

425
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,620
Is the restaurant the matter right now?

426
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,570
No matter how I think about it, I think we should tell.

427
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,170
You stay here.

428
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,900
How...?

429
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,260
It's okay.

430
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,380
Uh, this.

431
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,830
Um, you know of Jang Joon Seong, right?

432
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,330
I was very surprised, too,

433
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:55,470
because Joon Seong is someone I know.

434
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:09,310
What happened in the past, Hyeon Woo, Min Joon's mom, we all know it well.

435
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,510
You don't have to worry about that.

436
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,410
This is why you can't live after you've sinned.

437
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,610
Min Joon's grandmother...

438
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,910
A few years ago,

439
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,480
a skinny, young man

440
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,790
came to visit.

441
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,390
Perhaps,

442
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,470
he seemed to be a person who was taking care of my son.

443
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,030
I was so thankful.

444
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,540
With what right could I...

445
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,230
It's not like there's anything good about having a mother with such a ferocious fate.

446
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,360
It's not that I'm not meeting him,

447
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,380
but it's that I can't meet him.

448
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,740
Please act like you don't know.

449
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:31,300
Joon Seong grew up as the world's strongest man, as a champion.

450
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:42,540
I was thinking what if you could hug him from now on for all that you're sorry for from the past,

451
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,730
whenever your heart is ready.

452
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,410
And because

453
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,730
it's not only your fault, Min Joon's Grandmother.

454
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,380
Anyone in that situation could do that.

455
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:24,690
 A few years ago, a skinny, young man came to visit me. 

456
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,040
 He seemed to be a person who was taking care of my son. 

457
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,670
 I met Joon Seong's mother as he requested, 

458
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,450
 but you already knew. 

459
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,170
 The fact that the guy I'm dating is you, 

460
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,030
  I like it very much.  

461
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,240
Aren't you busy? If you're busy, we can talk—

462
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm busy, just for a moment, quickly and clearly, tell me how much you like it that you're dating me.

463
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,400
Hang up. I'll tell you when we meet.

464
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,400
Yes.

465
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,420
 It would have been good if we could have communicated through Chief Min. 

466
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,330
 If there is a next time, 

467
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,070
 I'll decline. 

468
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,780
Why are you here?

469
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,350
I can't sign the approval for the VVIP examination center.

470
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,240
There seems to appear to be a problem with the site selection and the subcontractor, so

471
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,300
we'll have to wait further and see. But to just proceed based on the results on paper, the investments are excessive.

472
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,480
It's the Executive Director's business. You don't have to ask.

473
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,590
Okay, then...

474
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,000
Your birthday is the day after tomorrow.

475
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,940
The chairwoman wants to have dinner.

476
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,550
Come home that day.

477
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,660
Yes.

478
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,860
♬  Santa Claus is coming  ♬

479
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,270
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

480
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,820
♬  Santa Claus is coming  ♬

481
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,220
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

482
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,830
♬  You better watch out  ♬

483
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,470
♬  You better not cry  ♬

484
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,820
♬  You better not pout  ♬

485
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,400
♬  I'm telling you why  ♬

486
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,990
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

487
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,510
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

488
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,630
 In celebration of Hyungnim Yeong Ho's birthday and Christmas 

489
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,890
 You are all invited to a party. 

490
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,530
 It looks like Yeong Ho Hyungnim shares a birthday with Jesus. 

491
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,220
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Okay. 

492
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,960
 Omo, me too? Thank you thank you! 

493
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,770
 Maybe, if I don't have any work. 

494
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,300
 For a popular celebrity Christmas is peak season. I have a recording. (sad eyes) 

495
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,060
Where is everyone?

496
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,870
♬  He sees you when you're sleeping  ♬

497
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:59,370
♬  He knows when you're awake  ♬

498
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,510
♬  He knows if you've been bad or good  ♬

499
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,890
♬  So be good for goodness sake  ♬

500
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,030
♬  Oh, you better watch out  ♬

501
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,780
♬  You better not cry  ♬

502
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,740
Hyung, where does ma'am say she is?

503
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,150
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

504
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,180
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

505
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,520
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

506
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,010
♬  Santa Claus is coming  ♬

507
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,450
♬  Santa Claus is coming to town  ♬

508
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,160
♬  Santa Claus is coming  ♬

509
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,940
Oh, Hyeon Woo, where are you?

510
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,980
I shouldn't have taken on this Memory Conductor role; it's burdensome.

511
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,660
Anyway, what do we do on Christmas Eve?

512
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,520
Should I at least buy some hwatu cards or a Yut game to bring over?

513
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,090
Min Joon, choose quickly.

514
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,020
Fine, let's just play Yut so we can all, together as a group, have the "fighting" spirit overflowing.

515
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,130
Is it lunar new year?

516
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,570
Try it, it's fun.

517
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,590
In any case, I'm going to buy a cake and head right over. I'm hanging up.

518
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,430
Mom, I want this one.

519
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,460
That one? Please wrap that one up.

520
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,770
Mom, I want that too.

521
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,990
If it's expensive I'm not getting it. How much is that?

522
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,760
Tomorrow you're not even going to pay attention to it but you're always asking to buy new things.

523
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,320
This is the last Christmas present, okay. Come here!

524
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,960
-  Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

525
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,240
When am I ever going to make enough money to live in a place like this?

526
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,290
Son, today let's eat until our bellies explode.

527
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,270
Were you looking for me?

528
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,230
Ah you gave me a fright.

529
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

530
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,470
Min Joon.

531
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,600
Memory Conductor, what is that?

532
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,060
I couldn't come empty-handed. It's just a small thing, a cake.

533
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,220
Wow. I forgot to get one. Thank you.

534
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,430
Okay, now everyone come in further. Let's go, come on!

535
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,390
What about Manager Min?

536
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:02,480
He tends to be on the mysterious side, and he has to go to the main house soon.

537
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,220
 The reporters seem to have all gone to their "Eve" parties also. 

538
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,990
Have a good time.

539
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,650
Wait just a second. Gather quickly.

540
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,350
Merry Christmas!

541
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,540
Merry Christmas. Then.

542
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,590
Bye. Okay, everybody, let's go party!

543
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,330
- C'mon, let's go. C'mon.
- Go! Go!

544
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,270
- Cheers!
 - CHEERS!

545
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,800
How long has this been?

546
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,250
Turkey, Korean style instead. Samgyetang.

547
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,710
How's that? You like that?

548
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,480
Who made all of this?

549
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,650
Ah really.

550
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,720
These "Dripping" brothers really. Your girlfriends must love you so much. ♬   I didn't know love  ♬

551
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,070

♬   Baby Only you  Whoo  ♬

559
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,660
Let's make some memories.

560
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,720
Everyone gather together.

561
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,400
One, two, three, fighting!

562
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,820
♬   I didn't know love  ♬

♬   The words are clumsy to me  ♬

569
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,340
Piggy-back, piggy-back, give me a piggy-back ride.

570
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,450
That's not it. That's not what she meant. Come down.

571
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,320
Come on out 'Mo'.

572
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,830
Yut!

573
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,310
Is it a good one?

574
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,800
Yay! Yeah, Champion, Champion!

575
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,680
Do!

576
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,980
Yeah! Geol!

577
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,220
Assa! Assa! Assa!

578
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,110
All right, all right.

579
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,310
Do Min Joon too.

580
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,280
It's Christmas Eve. What's our deaconess doing?

581
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,590
 I'm making japchae. 

582
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,560
- And the kids?
- They're working; it's their busy season.

583
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,490
Why? Is something wrong?

584
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,400
If something was wrong how would I have the presence of mind to call you.

585
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,410
And also, if something was wrong, would you take care of it for me?

586
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,800
Are you a lawyer?

587
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,770
You're talking nonsense. I'm the mother of a lawyer.

588
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,890
I'll make sure to go down at the beginning of the year.

589
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,590
I'm sorry for letting you spend this day alone.

590
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,770
For Christmas Eve, I'm far busier than you are.

591
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,360
You should live playing a day longer while you're young.

592
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,340
I'm hanging up the phone.

593
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,380

♬  A warm December our hearts will seek  ♬

596
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,150
 On a day when everyone's supposed be joyful, not everyone is happy.
♬  A world where men were weak  ♬ 

597
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,210
 Because everyone is joyful, someone is even more lonely. 

598
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,310
♬  Someday for Christmas there will be no wars  ♬

599

♬  When we have learned what Christmas is for  ♬

600
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:20,920
 Even though someone is lonely, they are pretending to be okay in front of someone else.  

601
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,190
 This is Joon Seong's phone number. 

602
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,390
 Just in case. Have a Merry Christmas. 

603
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:39,720
 For whatever reason someone can't go to someone.
 ♬  Maybe now it's time for you and me  ♬

604
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,850

♬  Someday at Christmas  ♬

606
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,930
 Someone can't go for whatever reason. 

607
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,550
 The person you have called is unavailable right now. 

608
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,820
 Please try again later. 

609
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,560
♬ One happy morning people will share ♬

610
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,170
 And it's a day when someone waits for someone  

611
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,630
 without being deterred. 

612
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:12,220
 We may all only pretend to act happy and okay. 

613
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,260
 Perhaps Christmas is a day that is more filled with yearning for someone. 

614
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,720
♬  One shining moment, one prayer away  ♬

615
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,630
I'll leave now.
 ♬  from our world today  ♬

616
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,870
Tomorrow is my birthday.

617
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,160
Saving you all the time, hasn't the mileage for debts come close to being full to capacity?

618
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,510
She doesn't know how she's benefitted.

619
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:46,460
After you go to the main house, if nothing comes up, come right over to my place.

620
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,570
Ah, the as of yet incomplete comfortable and racy night?

621
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,800
I'll be wearing a bow all sexy and lovely and be waiting for you.

622
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,720
Oh, what to do with such a wicked woman?

623
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,390
What's wrong.

624
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:13,760
Mom... My Mom asked to see me.

625
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,990
Ah wait.

626
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,430
Take my car.

627
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:33,270
Also, buy her the most delicious and very best food.

628
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,730
Yes Hyung. Thank you, Lawyer.

629
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,710
Hurry and go.

630
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,440
 My son Yeong Joon 

631
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,690
Yeong Joon, why can't I contact ...

632
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,120
  Are you Kim Yeong Joon's guardian? 

633
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,630
- Y-Yes. 
-   This is the ER. 

634
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,440
Excuse me, are you the guardian?

635
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,150
Yes, what happened?

636
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:51,050
He was brought in for overdosing on drugs.

637
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,410
He was in a bit of a dangerous situation.

638
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,110
Since we've finished pumping his stomach, we'll see how he is when he wakes up.

639
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:15,760
Yeong Joon... Why did you do that?

640
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,820
What is Mom supposed to do?

641
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,190
Yeong Joon.

642
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,770
Yeong Joon.

643
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,240
Yeong Joon.

644
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,410
What is this?

645
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,680
I'm asking you, what this is?

646
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,190
I'll contact the Hospital Director and ask him to watch his status...

647
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,500
My little sister went into that Gahong house

648
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,930
and lived like a housekeeper and bore a son and raised him.

649
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,660
But I'm asking, what is this plight we're in?

650
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,420
When Yeong Joon wakes up we have to find the group leader for the place where he lives abroad and take care of him.

651
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,220
Oppa...

652
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,530
Why do you think Kim Seong Cheol remarried you?

653
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,060
If Kim Seong Cheol hadn't remarried you,

654
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,840
half of Gahong would have gone to him.

655
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,810
He remarried with you in order to give it all to Kim Yeong Ho.

656
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,450
If something doesn't happen to Kim Yeong Ho,

657
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,810
Yeong Joon is finished.

658
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,370
Where is Kim Yeong Ho?

659
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,610
Find him right away!

660
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,820
Where are you right now?

661
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,600
At home. I'm going to change and go out.

662
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,220
What?

663
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:59,330
 Mom... my Mom asked to see me. 

664
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,720
 Ah wait. 

665
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,770
 Take my car and go. 

666
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,920
Joon Seong.

667
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,160
 My Hyung Yeong Ho 

668
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,140
 Joon Seong 

669
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,080
Yes.

670
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,450
I got it.

671
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,020
Present. Oppa Yeong Ho.

672
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:31,210


673
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,790
HYUNG!!!

674
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,650
HYUNG!

675
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,990
Hyung.

676
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,250
Hyung, hyung, hyung!

677
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,930
HYUNG!

678
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,000
♬  I will stay by your side  ♬
