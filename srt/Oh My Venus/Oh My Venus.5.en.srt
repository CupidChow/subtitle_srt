1
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,331
I...

2
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,029
...brought you...

3
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,123
...the plant that you like.

4
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,298
Help me.

5
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:39,704
Do you know him?

6
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,411
Are you okay?

7
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,413
Let go of me!

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,949
Let go!

9
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,228
Why didn't you answer your phone?

10
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,978
-I'm sorry.
-Let go!

11
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,740
Call the police.

12
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,776
"Episode 5"

13
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,651
Do you live in Unit 101?

14
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,678
Yes.

15
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,590
And you live in Unit 201?

16
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,908
Yes.

17
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,908
I'm from downstairs.

18
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,495
I'll leave your package here.

19
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,232
-Hyunwoo.
-What?

20
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,602
You really didn't put that plant there?

21
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,968
Jooeun, it's me.

22
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:07,840
Look, guys.

23
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:11,598
There must have been a misunderstanding
between you two neighbors.

24
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,629
A misunderstanding?

25
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,564
You call this a misunderstanding?

26
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,912
You weren't attacked.

27
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:20,358
There were no
threatening texts or letters.

28
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,088
You say he stalked you repeatedly
but without evidence.

29
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,460
Let's be honest.

30
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:30,282
Why would he stalk you?

31
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:31,786
Don't you agree?

32
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,379
Excuse me.

33
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,650
Shouldn't the police
try to verify what happened...

34
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,178
...from the victim's perspective?

35
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,876
I understand that you're in shock,

36
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,608
but the law isn't that easy.

37
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:45,846
What about the victim?

38
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,338
Do we look easy to you?

39
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,155
That's not what he means.

40
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,568
Don't be so sensitive.

41
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:53,980
Are you happy?

42
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:01,751
That's what the poster says.

43
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,750
"Our city in which women are happy."

44
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,810
Are you her legal guardian?

45
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,913
Had I known I'd be her guardian so often,

46
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:14,428
I might as well have been.

47
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:18,907
Don't you remember me?

48
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:21,934
I remember you.

49
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:28,744
Excuse me.

50
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,157
Excuse me.

51
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:34,017
Please don't hurt me.

52
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,709
So...

53
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,475
He was assaulted, too.

54
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,977
If he gets himself a lawyer,

55
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:59,681
you may be the ones arrested
for assault and battery.

56
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,582
It'll be difficult to lock him up.

57
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,986
The law is...

58
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,484
Is bullshit.

59
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,560
You should be sincere when you
console somebody,

60
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,908
and you can at least try
to understand them.

61
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,708
"Are you okay? I understand."

62
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,921
"The law is crummy,
so it will be hard to get him,"

63
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,762
"but we'll try our best."

64
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,712
Please say that to other victims.

65
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:32,144
I'll be leaving now.

66
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,384
Miss Kang.

67
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,022
Stop right there.

68
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,198
Thank you for everything.

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,383
I'm so glad that you remembered
what he looked like.

70
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,471
Good night.

71
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,247
Jooeun.

72
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,442
Why didn't you tell them that
you're an attorney?

73
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,545
Was it because of me?

74
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,952
That was self-defense.

75
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:08,016
Did you get hurt?

76
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,005
Thank goodness.

77
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:18,647
Why did you become a lawyer
if you can't even protect yourself?

78
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,332
-I know.
-Do you want me to beat him up?

79
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:25,834
You can represent me.

80
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,755
Wait.

81
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,560
I don't want to get hurt or die
just to get him arrested for stalking.

82
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,210
Even if I had evidence that
he was stalking me,

83
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,813
he'd only be detained for 24 hours.

84
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,605
He would have to pay
a fine of less than 100,000 won.

85
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,418
That money doesn't even go to the victim.

86
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,234
It's because I'm an attorney...

87
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,626
Because I'm an attorney,

88
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,324
I know this. That's why I don't get
my hopes up.

89
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,345
It really is crummy.

90
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,059
For somebody, it feels like
the end of the world.

91
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:57,842
But for others,

92
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,749
it's trivial.

93
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,142
I guess that's how the law is.

94
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,000
You must have owed me something
in the past life.

95
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,071
You saved me again.

96
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,210
I'll return your coat next time.

97
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:25,811
Good night.

98
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:26,945
Where are you going?

99
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,573
My friend lives nearby.

100
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,409
Don't worry about me and go home.

101
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,000
Reincarnation definitely exists.

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,254
I must have owed you big...

103
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:44,680
...in past life.

104
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:34,228
Hyunwoo.

105
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:35,551
It's me.

106
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,557
Is it urgent?

107
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,847
Is something wrong?

108
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,603
No.

109
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,088
My mom has a black eye again.

110
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,002
Again?

111
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,160
She says it was another accident,

112
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,535
but I'm positive it's domestic violence.

113
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,312
Minjun.

114
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:56,760
Go to bed.

115
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,988
Yes, I'll be right there.

116
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:01,293
Okay.

117
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,802
She's going to stay up for me.

118
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,811
It's just up ahead.

119
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:16,564
I keep...

120
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,223
...owing you more and more.

121
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,284
Over there.

122
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,317
My friend lives right down there.

123
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,370
"Tiro Hotel"

124
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,707
How much is it?

125
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,791
You need to rent a room for
the whole night.

126
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,013
It'll be 50 dollars.

127
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:09,338
Do you...

128
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,413
...accept bank transfers?

129
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,326
It's better than a credit card.

130
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,691
Will you be staying alone?

131
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:18,096
Yes.

132
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,088
How...

133
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,800
Your friend's house has many rooms.

134
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:31,309
A woman shouldn't come to
a place like this...

135
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:33,100
...without a man.

136
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,015
Just leave me alone.

137
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,796
You may have seen me at my lowest,

138
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:51,679
but I still get really humiliated
and embarrassed.

139
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,069
I know you're weak in front of
those who are sick,

140
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:00,618
and I know you are weaker
to those who are in danger.

141
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,625
I know you're more gentle
and nicer than you look.

142
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,907
I know you can't sleep if you
leave someone like me,

143
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,542
-alone out on the streets, but...
-But what?

144
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,235
I...

145
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:14,714
...don't want to go home.

146
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,207
I'm scared.

147
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,757
I have nowhere else to go.

148
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,974
Do you think I wanted to come here?

149
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:26,945
Then, let's go.

150
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,255
Let's go...

151
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,177
...somewhere outside of your earth.

152
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,983
This is my suite.

153
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,491
You wanted me to take you
somewhere out of this earth.

154
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,655
I'm sure I'll regret it tomorrow.

155
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,324
Wait, so you mean...

156
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:50,791
...you want to stay...

157
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,908
...in a hotel suite with me?

158
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:00,002
Do you want to stay in a suite?

159
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:02,707
If that's you want, we can go there.

160
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,540
No, that's not it.

161
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:08,156
Then what is "outside of my earth"?

162
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,880
It's sleeping...

163
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,782
...under the same roof...

164
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,009
...with a man like me.

165
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:17,916
What?

166
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,324
I think it'd be better to be
safe tonight than erotic.

167
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,585
What?

168
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,329
Erotic?

169
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,866
He really doesn't give me
a chance to thank him.

170
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,551
I don't have anything new...

171
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,292
...since I wasn't expecting a guest.

172
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:41,228
Just use mine.

173
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:43,846
What about you, Youngho...

174
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,843
I mean, Coach?

175
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:50,576
Do you think I'd give you
my own pillow and blanket?

176
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:54,189
Get some rest.
I'll tell the others tomorrow.

177
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,427
I know I say this all the time,
but thank...

178
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,662
"Thank you", "I'm sorry"
and "It's humiliating".

179
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,248
Those are your catchphrases.

180
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,287
I already know so let's
just skip that part.

181
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:06,535
I'm still thankful.

182
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,232
Just don't say "help me."

183
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:12,508
I'm too tired to save you tonight.

184
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,013
"Do you think I'd give you,"

185
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,512
"my own pillow and blanket?"

186
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:29,858
Of course not!

187
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,439
Is anyone there?

188
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,344
Help!

189
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,669
My legs. My legs are cramping up.

190
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,449
Hold on.

191
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:32,988
Are you doing this...

192
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,152
...because you're too embarrassed
to just come out?

193
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,229
No.

194
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:39,159
They're really cramping up. Help.

195
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,584
Then say, "Coach, you're cool".

196
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,298
Coach, you're cool. You're awesome.

197
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:47,336
Please hurry. I'm going crazy.

198
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,574
Let's help her.

199
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:56,879
It's ridiculous.

200
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,847
Why would someone even do that?

201
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,375
Thank goodness.

202
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,098
You need to catch stalkers like that.

203
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:06,096
Slice them!

204
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,223
You must have been scared.

205
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,866
Yes, a little.

206
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,223
It would've been horrible
if I hadn't shown up.

207
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,525
I was about to say that.

208
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,668
You ruined it by praising yourself.

209
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:22,759
Gosh.

210
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:25,725
We are a bit...

211
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,184
Try this, Ma'am.

212
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm sorry, but...

213
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,349
...is there any sauce?

214
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,063
We're not at a restaurant right now.

215
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,499
Take this first.

216
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,563
How did you...

217
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:48,995
Since you're so meticulous.

218
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:51,079
Thank you.

219
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:02,292
I'm craving some soup.

220
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:07,701
No.

221
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:11,082
I want something spicy
and with a little bit of color.

222
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,635
That's what I want.

223
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,999
It has color now.

224
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,325
Wow. Fantastic.

225
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,864
Don't go overboard with the compliments.

226
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:29,805
Is she a celebrity?

227
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:31,639
That's not completely off base.

228
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,984
She looks familiar.

229
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:38,770
Why are you pretending that
you don't know who it is?

230
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,278
I know.

231
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,011
There was this...

232
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:47,104
...Chinese actress named Shu Qi.

233
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,033
She's old now. You guys wouldn't know her.

234
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,935
Shu Qi? I found it.

235
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,885
It's Shu Qi.

236
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,922
What's wrong with all of you?

237
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,381
It's me. Kang Jooeun.

238
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,307
The attorney with wisdom and beau...

239
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,858
A beautiful smile. The Venus of Daegu.

240
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:11,995
Let's see.

241
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,465
I see a resemblance,

242
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:18,465
but do you have proof?

243
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,637
I'm saying it's me.
Is that insufficient evidence?

244
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,552
Goodness.

245
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,208
Just wait until I lose weight.

246
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:27,830
You'll all fall for me.

247
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,668
Let's just eat.

248
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,680
You don't believe me?

249
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,136
Just you wait.

250
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:39,494
You'll be shooting hearts
from your eyes soon.

251
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,362
Why are they laughing?

252
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,297
It's nothing.

253
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,766
Thanks for the blouse.

254
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,168
Let's walk as quickly as possible.

255
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,663
My nickname used to be Venus of Daegu.

256
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:22,536
There wasn't a guy there for whom
I wasn't their first love.

257
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,451
Are you a pathological liar?

258
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,422
It's me. Kang Jooeun.

259
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,785
Just you wait.

260
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,099
You'll be shooting hearts
from your eyes soon.

261
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:32,549
Was she serious?

262
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,433
-Hello?
-You scared me.

263
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:51,210
Are you always waiting for my call?

264
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,509
I'm always at your service.

265
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:53,914
How may I help you?

266
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:56,815
I need to go...

267
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,859
...to Daegu, but I need a guardian.

268
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:05,694
Is something wrong with your leg?

269
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:07,508
Where are you now?

270
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,171
I need to go and...

271
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,601
...find out whether or not
something is wrong with it.

272
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:19,131
I'll set it up with the hospital
and call you right back.

273
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:22,568
Okay.

274
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,618
I left the store for too long.

275
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,255
Thank you.

276
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,203
Thank goodness you already
decided to move out,

277
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:37,710
but call the landlord.

278
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,328
Ask him to take care of it quickly.

279
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:40,772
I already did.

280
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:46,398
Here's Minjun's cream and some things
you asked for from Duty Free.

281
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,349
Why are you the one avoiding him?

282
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:50,200
Have Mom come up and stay with you.

283
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:53,208
What will Mom think
if she finds out that I was being stalked?

284
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:55,169
That's true.

285
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,856
Mom may end up stalking the stalker.

286
00:18:58,614 --> 00:18:59,341
He's right.

287
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,682
Don't run away. Let's call your mother.

288
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:04,150
I'm not running away.

289
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,799
It makes me sick, knowing that
he lives downstairs.

290
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,866
I don't think I can sleep there.

291
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,474
Fine, I was wrong.

292
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,361
Jaehyeok, bring her things to my place.

293
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:16,512
No.

294
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,700
Your place is small.

295
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,259
Minjun and your mom are also there.

296
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,839
I'll take care of it, so you can go.

297
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,864
How will you take care of it?

298
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,435
I'll take care of it. Go.

299
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:33,849
Anyway.

300
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,422
Thank you for this.

301
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:39,087
Call me if anything happens. Okay?

302
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,091
Don't get married.

303
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:44,602
It's not worth it.

304
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:48,638
And stop draining your sister dry.

305
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,532
She has nothing left to give!

306
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:51,763
Just go!

307
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,447
Fine, I'm leaving.

308
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:55,387
Thank you.

309
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,076
Hey.

310
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,354
What is this?

311
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:07,369
You can't get married without money.

312
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,019
You need to put food on the table.

313
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,376
What will you do about your baby?

314
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:14,623
Jooeun...

315
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:17,409
Have a simple wedding and open up a store.

316
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,128
You need to make ends meet somehow.

317
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,801
I'll send you more as soon as
I receive my deposit.

318
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:27,803
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,691
I'll make a lot of money
and pay you back double.

320
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:35,121
Attorneys don't make a fortune.

321
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,593
It's not a lot.

322
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:40,705
Spend it wisely.

323
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,919
We decided to have the wedding later.

324
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,677
I'll open a store first.

325
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:49,263
-Woosik and you are...
-Hey.

326
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,863
We broke up. Stop asking about him.

327
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:53,275
Leave now.

328
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,032
Thank you for your time.

329
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,952
Is that you, Im Woosik?

330
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,463
It's so nice to meet you.

331
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,777
The guy who said that
he's like her guardian,

332
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:20,306
requested this surveillance footage
and we found this.

333
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,481
What's your relationship with her?

334
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:34,479
I know her well.

335
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:35,980
We've known each other for a while.

336
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:52,187
If you show up in front of Jooeun again,

337
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:53,791
I'll kill you.

338
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,860
What right do you have to say that?

339
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,561
I saw you two break up.

340
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:06,869
If you have been watching,
you must know what I'm capable of.

341
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,120
Don't go near Jooeun again.

342
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,540
This isn't a warning. It's an order.

343
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:19,982
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,965
See you tomorrow.
I have an important meeting today.

345
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:29,267
Please tell Lawyer Kang
to come to my office.

346
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:30,600
Yes, Ma'am.

347
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,632
Why did you tell me to dress up?

348
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:48,925
You passed the bar exam.

349
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,158
You're only in the second semester of
your junior year.

350
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:56,129
I've prepared something for you.

351
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:02,834
Hi, Soojin.

352
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:05,928
Hi, Woosik.

353
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:07,629
Why are you here so early?

354
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,728
What do you think?

355
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:12,331
Here you go.

356
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:16,499
Where's Soojin's?

357
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:17,523
Here.

358
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,777
These are handmade chocolates.

359
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,210
Congratulations on your exam.

360
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,480
Jooeun is only a freshman.

361
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,171
When will she pass the bar exam?

362
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:30,532
I'll pass it soon.

363
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:33,124
Soojin doesn't like chocolates.

364
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:34,223
I do.

365
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,332
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

366
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,568
Do I look like a nun?

367
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,552
It reveals nothing.

368
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:45,585
What?

369
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,574
What will you reveal to whom?

370
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,863
Here he comes.

371
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:51,376
He is here.

372
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,205
I heard that he has...

373
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,102
...the highest grades in
the engineering department.

374
00:23:58,218 --> 00:24:00,804
He is very nice and sincere.

375
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,316
-Jooeun.
-You came.

376
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,087
What's going on?

377
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,571
This is Soojin, who I told you about.

378
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:10,579
Her name is Oh Soojin.

379
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,295
You two have a good time.

380
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,950
Tell Jooeun...

381
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,736
...that I understood.

382
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,934
What?

383
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,726
What are you talking about?

384
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,194
Jooeun just rejected me.

385
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,673
This situation that we are in, shows that.

386
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:51,106
What?

387
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:53,597
I see that...

388
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,529
...Jooeun feels bad for you.
That's why she set this up.

389
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,466
But she shouldn't have done this to me.

390
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,137
And your dress...

391
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:04,765
You look like you're going to a funeral.

392
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,327
Did Jooeun...

393
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:10,902
...say that?

394
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:14,311
Did she say that she felt bad for me?

395
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,459
Do I need to spell it out for you?

396
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,230
If you look the way you do,
you need to at least...

397
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:23,681
...pick up on things quickly.

398
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,986
Don't come to places like this.

399
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,102
Go home right now!

400
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,127
How...

401
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:38,563
...could Jooeun do this to me?

402
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:42,047
What?

403
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:46,755
I refuse to accept that case.

404
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:51,479
I made it clear
when I started working here.

405
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,533
I'm okay with working overtime
and overnight,

406
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:57,255
but I don't defend sex offenders.

407
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,211
I don't want to visit
convicted CEOs in hospitals...

408
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:01,946
...when they feign illness.

409
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,732
Good for you.

410
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:05,896
This client is not a CEO.

411
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:07,645
She is a daughter of a CEO.

412
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:12,681
She must be the woman who beat up
an employee at a department store.

413
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,003
I still refuse to take on this case.

414
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:19,488
Myeongeun Electronics and Geontu...

415
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,654
...have a close connection.

416
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:25,066
You provided legal advice to
that company before.

417
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,729
I'm officially telling you.

418
00:26:28,057 --> 00:26:29,072
Vice President Oh.

419
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:30,810
I refuse to take that case.

420
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,825
If your superior orders you to
do something, you do it.

421
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,183
I'm officially giving you an order.

422
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,729
Lawyer Kang, you will take this case.

423
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,196
Somebody has to do the job.

424
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,484
If you don't, someone else has to.

425
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:50,971
Just because you turn a blind eye,

426
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,196
you can't make it go away.

427
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,791
The president said...

428
00:26:57,103 --> 00:27:00,398
...that you should obtain your hopes
and dreams on your own time.

429
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,022
That's all I have to say. You may leave.

430
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:37,409
Hey.

431
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,636
If you eat all that sugar,
it won't be good for you.

432
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,037
Close the lid.

433
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:47,659
Am I hallucinating?

434
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:52,681
I'm stressed and hungry.

435
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:55,958
My poor thyroid.

436
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:00,967
Give me some fresh air.

437
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,396
Fresh air.

438
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,533
He is strong enough.

439
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,624
He could easily win the championship.

440
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:27,132
We have no welterweight champion for now.

441
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,513
If he wins the RFC title this time,

442
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:31,304
he will make a grand slam.

443
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:34,962
But that idiot will move
to a lower weight division.

444
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,399
What? Why?

445
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:38,227
He doesn't want an easy title.

446
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,695
He wants to fight his rival
who went to the lower weight division.

447
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:45,396
He never takes the easy way out.

448
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:48,975
Go! That's right!

449
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:57,713
-He's really good.
-He's amazing.

450
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,029
It's the smell of healthy organic grass.

451
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,217
I'm sick of it.

452
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,123
Abdominal obesity
and an increased risk of disease.

453
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:28,970
Dangerous, warning,
consultation recommended.

454
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,099
Don't you have something better to do?

455
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,616
What a risky woman!

456
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:36,822
Eat this.

457
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:44,758
Is this a side effect of going on a diet?

458
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,150
Eat.

459
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:50,723
Did you eat...

460
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,526
...stir-fried spicy meat for lunch?

461
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,451
Do I smell?

462
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,027
Did you eat spicy noodles?

463
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,622
I just ate.

464
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:17,339
I ate expensive grass
and high-protein, low-fat food.

465
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:20,847
I'm starving.

466
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,456
Is this really necessary?

467
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,340
I see a resemblance,

468
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,297
but do you have proof?

469
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:34,551
I'm saying it's me.
Is that insufficient evidence?

470
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,049
I won't eat.

471
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:45,796
Hey.

472
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,390
I need to talk to the Korean Snake.

473
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:50,557
Can you leave us alone for a while?

474
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,438
Are you Jang Yijin?

475
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,196
What's up?

476
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:57,299
I'm not Jang Yijin.

477
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:04,076
You are her.

478
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:06,996
Even if I am,

479
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:09,512
don't post things about me on your SNS.

480
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:13,884
Do you want me to leave?

481
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:16,844
Okay.

482
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:18,453
See you later.

483
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:25,281
I told them that I would do
the commercial.

484
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,855
Why are you donating
the money that you get?

485
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:32,277
If you take the lead
and donate all your money,

486
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,569
what will people think of me?

487
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,681
They'll think that I'm blinded by money.

488
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,874
If you wanted to make a donation,

489
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:42,572
we could've done it together.

490
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:44,818
Or you could have tipped me off.

491
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:47,974
Do I personally know you?

492
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,914
I can't believe this.

493
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,581
Don't you know who I am?

494
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:55,469
I saw you on TV from time to time.

495
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:58,203
From time to time? I'm on TV all the time!

496
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:00,100
Anyway.

497
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,663
Let's make...

498
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,540
...a joint donation.

499
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,463
Don't tell the reporters otherwise.

500
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:17,678
I'm just curious.

501
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,713
You're an orphan.
Why are you helping single mothers?

502
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:22,374
Why didn't you donate to an orphanage?

503
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,857
Are you interested in me?

504
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,595
Of course you are. You're a man.

505
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:34,759
I'm not.

506
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,768
Are you gay?

507
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,227
Hey, lassie.

508
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,863
Why are you getting thinner?

509
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:53,252
Namcheol.

510
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:55,989
You shouldn't call me that
in front of my kid.

511
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,822
Should I call you Ma'am...

512
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,744
...just because you married into
a rich family?

513
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:04,016
Where is his father?

514
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,361
I'm not sure.

515
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,807
He said he would come.

516
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,146
That's fine.

517
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,836
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to the restroom.

518
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,518
Okay.

519
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:25,965
He's too polite for his age.

520
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:29,023
I'm really upset.

521
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:34,732
At the 61st anniversary of the company,

522
00:33:35,757 --> 00:33:37,508
the chairwoman might make
Youngho the Executive Director.

523
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:40,252
What did I tell you?

524
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:45,590
Youngjun is nobody in the Gahong family.

525
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,132
Don't say that.

526
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:49,648
What an idiot you are!

527
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:52,335
He has no blood relation.

528
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:55,338
Your husband is only
the son-in-law of the chairwoman.

529
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:57,477
After her only daughter died,

530
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:58,580
there was nobody to run the company...

531
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,397
No matter what you say,
Youngjun is still...

532
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,212
...the son of my husband...

533
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,122
...and the grandson of the chairwoman.

534
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,425
Hyeran.

535
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,346
Come to your senses.

536
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:13,367
I won't take responsibility if things...

537
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,255
...don't pan out your way.

538
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:27,539
Eat some more.

539
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:29,252
You're getting thinner.

540
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,005
Miss Cha Seonyoung of
Deokseong Pharmaceuticals...

541
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:43,591
...will be a little late.

542
00:34:44,803 --> 00:34:46,121
Are you sure she is late?

543
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,308
Is she even coming?

544
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,374
Enjoy your meal alone.

545
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:56,223
I'm upset that I'm stood up.

546
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:06,745
I'm sorry.

547
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:11,018
Amazing, this is heaven.

548
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,216
Did I come here too early?

549
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:23,699
May I take your order?

550
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:26,059
I'd like a caramel macchiato.

551
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,903
No, no. White chocolate?

552
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:31,423
Caramel mocha, please.

553
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,157
With extra whipped cream.

554
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:34,560
Peppermint tea, please.

555
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:37,925
I'd like it hot.

556
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,287
What are you doing?

557
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,791
You're real.

558
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:49,758
Are you immigrating somewhere?

559
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:53,583
Yes, I'm going somewhere
outside the earth.

560
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:55,251
Did I give you permission?

561
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,048
Jiwoong already told me.

562
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,934
You said I could stay with you
until I get a place.

563
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,370
You said that you have
a big house and spare rooms.

564
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,595
You are shrewd, contrary to
your appearance.

565
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:05,923
I'll pull up my car.

566
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,331
When the tea comes out, bring it out.

567
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,528
What?

568
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:13,553
Why do you...

569
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,579
...want me to hold this?

570
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:18,654
It will fall over if I put it
in the backseat.

571
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,255
It's from someone special.

572
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:22,571
-Shall I turn on the seat warmer?
-No.

573
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,178
I'm already steamed up.

574
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,990
Is that the plant from the stalker?

575
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:37,510
You must be happy that you got
a bouquet from someone special.

576
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:40,516
I got a plant from a stalker.

577
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,222
When did the symptoms begin?

578
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:49,313
The symptom of speaking directly
from your heart.

579
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,678
The stalker wronged me
but the plant didn't.

580
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:53,965
That's why I brought it.

581
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:55,692
That's nice of you.

582
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:01,309
Why did you buy the blanket and pillows?

583
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:05,989
Did you give me yours?

584
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:08,208
I bought them in case I bring girls home.

585
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,481
What's wrong?

586
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,337
Can't I bring girls over?

587
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,627
Why not?

588
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,205
I know about your scandal with Anna Sue.

589
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:20,139
That's right.

590
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,265
Congratulations, John Kim.

591
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,466
Rumors about your scandal with Anna Sue...

592
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,744
...are dying down on the Internet.

593
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:30,431
Maybe people forgot about it,
just a little bit.

594
00:37:35,097 --> 00:37:35,939
By the way,

595
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:38,049
where are we going?

596
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,091
We are going to meet my ideal type.

597
00:37:44,673 --> 00:37:45,987
Your ideal type?

598
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:49,191
Jujitsu?

599
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,598
Why are we here?

600
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,116
I'll introduce you to my ideal type.

601
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:59,188
Why should I meet your ideal type?

602
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,824
Because you need to learn.

603
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:02,813
What?

604
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:04,513
What do I need to learn?

605
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:06,586
This is called closed guard.

606
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:09,198
This position seems
disadvantageous for women,

607
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,590
but that's not true.

608
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:19,843
My goodness.

609
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:26,866
That's my ideal type.

610
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,744
My ideal type's husband.

611
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,405
Where is everyone?

612
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:53,397
Home.

613
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,860
Come closer.

614
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:11,546
What?

615
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,394
You could encounter
a stalker or a pervert again.

616
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:30,587
When the law can't protect you,
you need to protect yourself.

617
00:39:33,786 --> 00:39:35,004
That's why you brought me here.

618
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:41,021
Jujitsu is almost the only sport
where women can beat men.

619
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,201
You can break joints using certain skills.

620
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,354
Climb on top of me.

621
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:51,370
What?

622
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,769
Did you see the position they were in?

623
00:39:54,363 --> 00:39:58,171
Let's pretend that I'm you
and you're the offender.

624
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,788
I am?

625
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,581
Attack me as much as you want.

626
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,197
You said as much as I want, right?

627
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,407
I'm going to start.

628
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,021
Why you evil stalker!

629
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:28,894
Did you see that?

630
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:30,812
Try it again.

631
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:34,994
Try it again.

632
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,404
You evil stalker.

633
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:02,864
Excessive physical contact.

634
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:04,715
That's your first warning.

635
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,936
That wasn't...

636
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:14,388
Wait.

637
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,056
Closed guard.

638
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:18,149
Enclose the opponent
with your legs and flex.

639
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:23,327
Flex.

640
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:28,077
Don't look away. Make eye contact.

641
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,567
Flex.

642
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,935
Do it.

643
00:41:45,996 --> 00:41:46,999
Tap tap.

644
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:52,404
What?

645
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,312
You don't want to let go?

646
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,873
What?

647
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,066
When a person taps,
you're supposed to let go.

648
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,207
Breathe.

649
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,503
Excuse me.

650
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:32,197
Is your ideal woman really...

651
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,112
...a martial artist?

652
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,225
A strong woman is very sexy.

653
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,535
I don't have to worry about her
when I'm not with her.

654
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:42,173
I see.

655
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:44,951
I thought you liked women like Anna Sue.

656
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:47,379
Are you interested in my preferences?

657
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:48,865
I see.

658
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,588
This question stems
from that kiss earlier.

659
00:42:54,478 --> 00:42:55,707
What kiss?

660
00:42:57,595 --> 00:42:58,793
I...

661
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:01,091
I lost 4.2 kilograms.

662
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,098
I feel a little thinner.

663
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:07,312
From what I felt earlier...

664
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:08,623
Forget it.

665
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,923
I'll take care of my body.

666
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,614
Did you forget?

667
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,865
Your body...

668
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:17,132
...belongs to me.

669
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,328
Thinner?

670
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,910
My score would be...

671
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:27,670
I don't know.

672
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,257
Anyway.

673
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,560
Congratulations. The first digit
of your weight has changed.

674
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,565
Venus of Daegu.

675
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,838
The first digit changed a long time ago.

676
00:44:47,138 --> 00:44:49,400
Food is ready!

677
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,248
Hold on.

678
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:00,759
If we have to eat
unseasoned meat and roots,

679
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,428
we might as well eat a lot of them.

680
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,064
Ma'am, why are you whispering?

681
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:08,305
I don't want Youngho
to freak out about this.

682
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:12,297
"Don't you know that
elephants also live off..."

683
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:13,912
"...grass?"

684
00:45:14,134 --> 00:45:15,369
He's not here.

685
00:45:15,995 --> 00:45:16,939
Where did he go?

686
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:17,897
Well...

687
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,600
He had business to tend to,
so he went somewhere far away.

688
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,344
He'll be gone for a while.

689
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:24,625
That's good.

690
00:45:24,746 --> 00:45:26,154
We should eat a lot.

691
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,573
Okay.

692
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,234
Hypothyroidism.

693
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,633
Since you're so meticulous.

694
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,022
Excuse me for a minute.

695
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:42,330
What's with him?

696
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:43,656
He didn't even say anything.

697
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:53,927
"Daegu"

698
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,788
The backseat is safer.

699
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,498
I'm not the executive director yet.

700
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:09,164
You're also not my driver.

701
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:14,004
You should reconsider Miss Cha Seonyoung
of Deokseong Pharmaceuticals.

702
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,959
The two of you are a good match.

703
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:19,688
Think about it.

704
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:21,996
You and I are a better match.

705
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:23,574
But,

706
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:26,077
why didn't you bring flowers today?

707
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,394
It'll be tiring starting tomorrow.

708
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:33,031
You should take a nap.

709
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:46,387
Hey.

710
00:46:46,796 --> 00:46:48,495
Does this sound tasty to you?

711
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:53,051
I did lose weight.

712
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:56,253
My pants got looser
and my shirts aren't as tight.

713
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,593
Producer Ko went to the States?

714
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:02,658
He went to find John Kim?

715
00:47:04,516 --> 00:47:06,040
When does he get back?

716
00:47:07,644 --> 00:47:10,655
You're his ex-wife.
How could you not know?

717
00:47:11,548 --> 00:47:12,470
Forget it.

718
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:13,750
I need to go.

719
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,354
What do I do?

720
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,924
Where did he go?

721
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:24,232
Did he go to the States?

722
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:27,645
Fourteen.

723
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:31,949
Fifteen.

724
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,022
"Coach"

725
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:06,561
Hello? Who is this?

726
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:09,907
My number should have been
saved as "Coach".

727
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,770
It's you, Coach.

728
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:15,594
I heard you went somewhere.

729
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:18,515
I was having a glass of wine.

730
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,395
Hang up.

731
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:23,285
What the...

732
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:27,539
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:38,684
Your inability to lie
is one of your strengths.

734
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:40,765
How long did you exercise?

735
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:42,068
It's been...

736
00:48:42,855 --> 00:48:44,474
...about 30 to 40 minutes.

737
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:47,140
Did you stretch well?

738
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:49,774
What's it to you?

739
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,950
Remember the one to ten
that I taught you before?

740
00:48:54,085 --> 00:48:55,870
Do one, four, five...

741
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:57,790
You and your nagging.

742
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,008
Why did we have to do a video call?

743
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,159
It's not like I wanted to see your face.

744
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:05,189
Stop getting so upset
because you missed me.

745
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:08,223
You should be nicer from now on.

746
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,385
What was that?

747
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:12,199
I'm talking directly from my heart.

748
00:49:12,497 --> 00:49:14,901
How could you just leave me?

749
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:19,904
You should film yourself doing
exercise one, four and five.

750
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,238
Send me the video afterwards.

751
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,857
I'll critique you from here.

752
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,651
Videos?

753
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,646
I'm not talking about adult videos.

754
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:30,333
It's for proof.

755
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:33,342
I can't trust you since I can't
see it for myself.

756
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:35,230
And...

757
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:39,389
...move your cheeks. I can't see.

758
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:46,071
Are you...

759
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,056
...in the States?

760
00:49:55,984 --> 00:49:56,888
What if I am?

761
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,515
Are you there to see Anna Sue?

762
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:01,580
What if I am?

763
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:03,735
Be careful.

764
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:07,394
My friend's ex-husband, Producer Ko
went to the States to look for you.

765
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:09,747
I see. He did?

766
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:13,643
Shall we hang up now?

767
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,032
I don't care.

768
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:21,768
I think Anna Sue is here.

769
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,915
Have a restful and erotic evening.

770
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,148
This is the questionnaire.

771
00:50:40,685 --> 00:50:42,749
I thought you might like
to fill it out in advance.

772
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:46,856
The hospital director
will be in tomorrow morning.

773
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:48,934
I'll let you rest.

774
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,094
Mr. Min.

775
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,034
Nothing.

776
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,802
Have a restful and erotic evening.

777
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:29,649
"Hyunwoo's ex-husband, Producer Ko"

778
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:35,146
Producer Ko, did you find John Kim?

779
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:43,236
"Producer Ko, did you find John Kim?"

780
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:59,747
One, two, three. Stop.

781
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:15,982
November 22nd.

782
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,038
The last exercise for today.

783
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:21,014
I'm doing exercise number 10.

784
00:52:21,994 --> 00:52:23,294
Gosh, I'm so tired.

785
00:52:39,777 --> 00:52:41,288
What am I doing?

786
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:54,109
It is such a rare disease...

787
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:57,461
...and you are such a unique case...

788
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:59,168
...so I can't be so sure.

789
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,739
But in my opinion,

790
00:53:02,141 --> 00:53:05,135
you are 99.9 percent healed.

791
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,459
Congratulations.

792
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:13,538
Also...

793
00:53:14,146 --> 00:53:16,162
...I heard that you have sporadic pain.

794
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:17,705
How painful is it?

795
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:21,662
It's probably just in my head,

796
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:23,736
but sometimes,

797
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,136
it is unbearable.

798
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:30,979
It probably has
a psychological element to it.

799
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:33,155
It's like fear.

800
00:53:33,765 --> 00:53:35,569
They were major operations.

801
00:53:36,064 --> 00:53:38,867
It must've been difficult
for a small child to endure.

802
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:41,562
Father! Please make them stop!

803
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:45,480
Father, please help me!

804
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:49,698
Father, I'm so scared.

805
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:53,092
Mom! Mom!

806
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:57,246
It hurts so much.

807
00:53:57,925 --> 00:53:59,960
Please help me.

808
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:02,944
Can we do it later...

809
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:05,832
...when I'm older?

810
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:08,617
Please, Father.

811
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:20,805
There's no cure for psychological trauma.

812
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:25,175
It'll probably continue...

813
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,191
...until it disappears one day.

814
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:29,051
Or until the day I die.

815
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:33,675
Call me whenever you need my help.

816
00:54:34,343 --> 00:54:36,178
I will. Thank you.

817
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,088
Rehabilitation must have been torture.

818
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:41,493
You did incredibly well.

819
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:44,287
You are also physically fit.

820
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:48,747
I had to do it in order to survive.

821
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:50,453
You did well.

822
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:55,171
It wouldn't be an exaggeration
to call it a miracle.

823
00:54:57,849 --> 00:54:59,107
It is, thanks to you.

824
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:01,048
Thank you.

825
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,521
Where shall I take you?

826
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,053
Mr. Min.

827
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,844
I...

828
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:28,045
...want to rest.

829
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,417
I'll take you to the nearest hotel.

830
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:52,756
Anna Sue wants to spend
a couple more days with me.

831
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:56,655
For today, do exercise two, five and ten.

832
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:49,664
Good morning, Mr. Min.

833
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,196
Good evening.

834
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:58,283
Let's go.

835
00:56:58,681 --> 00:56:59,593
Okay?

836
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:24,958
Eight.

837
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,053
Nine.

838
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,569
Ten.

839
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:31,797
Eleven.

840
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:34,071
I'm doing so well.

841
00:57:34,638 --> 00:57:36,183
Twelve.

842
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,237
Did everyone go somewhere?

843
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:10,968
Don't you hear me?

844
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:19,617
What's this?

845
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,632
I never saw this before.

846
00:58:50,014 --> 00:58:52,045
"Oh My Venus"

847
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,373
Kang Jooeun Day?

848
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:56,276
Live like Kang Jooeun for a day.

849
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:58,592
I said not to think about your body today.

850
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:00,197
Only think about me.

851
00:59:00,323 --> 00:59:03,894
It's sad that you don't know
the sweet taste of life.

852
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,396
You keep speaking to me that way.

853
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,997
More like a friend
than a superior-inferior relationship...

854
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,211
"Friends" as in people
with a mutual affection?

855
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:11,326
Is that it?

856
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,885
Do you know who he is?

857
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:14,472
He's toying with you.

858
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,584
I'm worried that you are
too emotionally invested.

859
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,131
You really don't know?

860
00:59:18,282 --> 00:59:21,119
When a man toys with a woman,

861
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,003
he wants to do other things
with her as well.
