00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,000
 Episode 11 

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,870
You know when it comes to taking opportunities,

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,050
it is better to do it sooner than later.

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:36,930


5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,570
Yes. PD Go.

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,270
Broadcast it.

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,490
- Stop. Kim Yeong Ho! 
- Kim Yeong Ho.

8
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,230
- Mr. Kim Yeong Ho. 
 - Mr. John Kim.

9
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,210
Mr  Kim  Yeong Ho, is it true that you are John Kim?

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,480
Is it the truth? Please just say a word as to the truth regarding your relationship with Anna Sue.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,390
Say it.

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,250
What?

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,150
Block it!

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,200
It appears that the John Kim - Anna Sue story has come out. For now, I'll get us out of here.

16
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,580
I understand.

17
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,210
There will be an official scandal rebuttal press release from

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,090
Anna Sue's side tomorrow.

19
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,410
Were you already prepared for this to happen?

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,890
It's because I've decided to take my bitter drink in one shot.

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,200
But people probably aren't concerned with whether it's true or not.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,280
Whether people know or don't know is probably more important than whether it's true or not.

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,300
As more people know and talk about it, it becomes real. That's the world we live in.

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,030
It is a commotion not just at the villa, but also at the main house and the company.

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,750
Let's go to a quieter place...

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,180
I won't be able to run away

27
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,190
for a day, or a few days, in this way any longer.

28
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm the one who first said not to run away.

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,540
 Mr. Coach 

30
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,700
  The number you dialed can't be reached. After the beep ... 

31
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,960
Who is this lady?

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
What happened?

33
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,030
You must be going somewhere nice.

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,680
Why didn't you answer the phone?

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,070
I got shocked.

36
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,450
Are you okay?

37
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,780
Because there are so many reporters waiting outside of my house

38
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,330
I don't want to go home. It's the same with the hotel too.

39
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,630
 I don't want to go home. 

40
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,970
Do you think I want to sleep at the hotel?

41
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,510
 You think I came to the motel because I like it? 

42
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Even though there is only one room and one bathroom, come in.

43
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,230
To your outer space.

44
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,030
Boarding.

45
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,700
Departing.

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:14,010
♬  I will stay with you  ♬

47
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,880
♬  I will tell you I will love you   ♬

48
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,180
♬  Because you are everything to me  ♬

49
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,520
♬  I am saying you are my love  ♬

50
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,490
♬  and I am never letting you go  ♬

51
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,400
Today Kang Joo Eun is the one dripping with sexiness.

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,610
Did you think you had a monopoly on dripping with sexiness?

53
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,800
With sexiness, it takes someone sexy to recognize it.

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,570
Ah, I can't sleep in a room that's not a suite.

55
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,690
It is a spring mattress as well.

56
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,600
You should be happy that it's a room and not talk nonsense about suites. I might have to make you sleep on the floor with Rascal.

57
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,500
If you're not going to make it sweet, you might as well go out and let me have the bedroom to myself.

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Don't think about anything and just let yourself sleep. Do your worrying and thinking tomorrow.

59
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,590
You're going to be doing it tomorrow anyway; why do you have to start tonight?

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I will call you if I want a comfortable and racy night.

61
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,520
I'd better go wash up. Get some sleep. I'll go outside.

62
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,400
Did you forget something?

63
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,780
Satisfied?

64
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,340
I am.

65
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,710
 Get out. 

66
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,300
 It's not something... someone can make better. 

67
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,270
 It is neuropathy. My body remembers it.  

68
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,360
  Your body is smarter than you think.  

69
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,300
  It might disappear suddenly someday or might stay with me until I die.  

70
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,490
Ah.  Joon Seong.  It's me.

71
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,130
Yeong Ho is at my house.

72
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,860
Don't worry.

73
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,050
Is Hyungnim ...?

74
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,460
Ms. Lawyer, you know.

75
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,120
What can I do for him?

76
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,630
He's in so much pain but I can't do anything.

77
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,840
Just pretend you don't know.

78
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,980
It's harder for Hyungnim to see someone he cares for in pain than to be in pain himself.

79
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,290
For me, our hyungnim is  a father.

80
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,500
Please take care of him.

81
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,380
For me too, there is no other man.

82
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,500
I will take care of him.

83
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,720
Yes.

84
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,800
 Quick. Quick.  That rat SOB is getting away! 

85
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,170
 Sh*t! 

86
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,800
 Where is he? Yo, man! 

87
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,130
 Press down hard. 

88
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,010
 If you keep moving, your leg will break into pieces. 

89
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,810
 You fled with this leg. I don't know if you are stupid or amazing.  

90
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,000
 How is it any of your business? 

91
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
 I told you, Kid, your leg is broken. 

92
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,500
 Where is he? Did you see? Which way did he go?  

93
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,010
 Your blood pressure is also normal. 

94
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,500
 By looking at your face, you're not lacking any blood. You had painkillers, too. 

95
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,380
 What are you? 

96
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,870
 Did you learn to say thank you like that? 

97
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,220
 What about your parents? Did they pass away? 

98
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,430
 If you don't have any parents you're probably not a study abroad student, so then, adoption. 

99
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,120
 What about your adoptive parents? Do you have a place to go? 

100
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,160
 Shit. 

101
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,780
 Why are you getting involved? Who the heck are you? Shit. 

102
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,030
 You and your bad temper. It's not "you," it's" Hyung, " 

103
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,040
 the person who has a soft spot for people who are hurting and who has even more of a soft spot for people who are in danger. 

104
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,770
 Shut the... 

105
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,540
 I don't need your pity. Mother fxxx... 

106
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,100
 Pity... 

107
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,820
 It's not pity, but it's sympathy because I've been there. 

108
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,870
 You get angry and want to fight. 

109
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,630
 If you want to fight, fight. Instead, not with guns and knives, but where there are rules. 

110
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,300
 At least wash your hands, Kid. 

111
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:49,970


112
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,760
It would be good to just leave me alone today.

113
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,920
Did someone say anything? I'll just stay next to you. Lying down while staying still.

114
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Winter is colder for lonely people.

115
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,190
Please help your neighbors in need and share your compassion. Fighting, everyone.

116
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,800
I'm a celebrity specializing in cheering up and comforting.

117
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,630
Seriously.

118
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,790
If anyone were just lying next to you, wouldn't it be consoling?

119
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,580
I am CF Queen Jang Yi Jin.

120
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,820
How can you comfort me if you don't even know the reason I'm sad?

121
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,510
Am I not able to comfort you
 without knowing the reason?

122
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,350
Sad things are all the same.

123
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,000
We're making fast progress.  We kissed and now we're sleeping together right away.

124
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,840
Nice weather!

125
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,480
It feels pretty refreshing today isn't that right Hyung Joon Seong?

126
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,690
Oh, that's right.

127
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,480
Today of all days, it really seems like absolutely nothing is wrong.

128
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,230
What are you two doing here?

129
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,590
Ah, what's with the acting?

130
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,430
Ma'am told us to act  normally like nothing happened.

131
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,630
She did.

132
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,080
Is that acting normal? Everyone, let's eat!

133
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,900
The house is so crowded. You guys are all big.

134
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,240
This doesn't seem like the kind of meal that needs an apron.

135
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,140
It's just the right kind of meal for an apron.

136
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,610
I cleared everything in the fridge so be grateful and eat.

137
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,110
And a drop of sesame oil.

138
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,360
A drop.

139
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,160
I wonder how fermented that sesame oil is.

140
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,300
It's what my mom sent to me yesterday.

141
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,720
Ma'am. Fantastic. It's tastes amazing.

142
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,860
The white rice is the best when it comes to mixing.

143
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
Just one bite.

144
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,690
Let's eat quickly and put the equipment on and come back here.

145
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,200
We have to exercise whether it's raining, windy, or snowing. Don't we have to do it today?

146
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,490
Wow.

147
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,080
- Equipment? 
 - What equipment?

148
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,920
I'll show you the reality of Korean training.

149
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,150
♬  That's right. Why don't you come over here right now girl? ♬ 

150
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,500
Ma'am, it's like we're Robocop. 
♬  I'm feeling so good, ♬

151
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,360
Amazingly, I can see forward.
♬   Everything is so fine.  It's like flying  ♬

152
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,130
What are we doing right--
♬   Everything is so fine.  It's like flying  ♬

153
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,280
♬   When I think of you I am again  ♬

154
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,190
I don't think it's a time for you to show your face.

155
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,490
♬   Thinking of her every morning,   ♬

156
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,490
Okay, clap your hands in front and back of you as hard as you can and follow me.

157
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,560
Ma'am, let's go together.

158
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,710
♬   Yeah over and over I'm looking whether there's a flaw  ♬

159
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,970
Joon Seong, how should I put this? Let's think of it as a warm up.
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

160
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:01,280
♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   
  Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

161
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,110
♬   In my head it's always complicated  ♬

162
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,270
♬ (I'm afraid that she is leaving) ♬ 
♬   Even if I don't dislike it  ♬

163
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,280
Why are you doing this to the tree? Did the tree do something wrong?

164
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,110
Ah, this is all--

165
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,980
This is so good for your blood circulation.

166
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,740
I've been doing this everyday for ten years and I've never caught a cold.

167
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,730
Oh, these men are so weak. Can't you do it hard like this? You can't?

168
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,750
Look, the girl can do it. You all try to do it the way she is doing it.

169
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,590
Young men, you have to try this.

170
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,450
- You have to do this. 
 - Look, look, look.

171
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,170
It is moving up and down with this.

172
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,250
Ah, because of my muscle.

173
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,620
What do you mean by muscle?

174
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,490
It's because it's all clumped together.

175
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,730
I'm telling you, you need to break all this up.

176
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,150
Breathe.

177
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,440
Just you wait and see. Tomorrow all of your bodily waste will come right out.

178
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,230
Come here. Try it.

179
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,410
Where are you going?

180
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,660
As an expert, this treatment is a bit...

181
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
I worked hard to make these abs.

182
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,020
What are you talking about abs? Just you wait and see, tomorrow all your bodily waste will come right out.

183
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,160
Are you going to take responsibility for my abs?

184
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,020
Yeong Ho Hyungnim's abs are mine. You can't say no.

185
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,600
Wait a sec—

186
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Begin.

187
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,170
Are you, by any chance, trying to cheer me up?

188
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,710
Why would I cheer you up?

189
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,390
Being John Kim or the heir to Gahong are both issues that stem from you being so great.

190
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,470
You?

191
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,970
You told me before, your body needs to be tired for your mind to be relieved

192
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,350
This girl. Kids are watching. Let go please.

193
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,510
Omo. Omo.

194
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,550
Again. Again. So embarrassing.

195
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,700
I guess studying hard is paying off.

196
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,450
Even if you become a jobless bum I'll take care of you, so just trust in Noona.

197
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,690
Seriously.

198
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,080
Take good care of the house. I'll go earn us lots of money.

199
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,170
You're going to be late. I'll see you later.

200
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,310
See you later.

201
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,700
As you said, Anna Sue from America has released a statement of denial.

202
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,210
I visited the press from first thing in the morning.

203
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,460
Even though I can't stop them all, the speculative reporting will be restrained.

204
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,870
You are really someone who likes to sleep in.

205
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,480
The elders are waiting.

206
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,040
I prepared clothes for you to change into.

207
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,380
No, I'd like to go just as I am.

208
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:38,500
John Kim! John Kim! John Kim!

209
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,810
Young Master has arrived.

210
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,960
At least he has returned home now,

211
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,250
my child.

212
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,670
Who is that young lady? I hear she's some kind of lawyer?

213
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,030
Just because I am taking the back seat, you aren't really putting me in the back seat, right?

214
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,270
I apologize.

215
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,500
If you, who know Yeong Ho's situation, act like this, you put me in a difficult position.

216
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,850
We have to protect the Yeong Ho's position.

217
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,300
I think if it is the daughter of the CEO of the Deokseong Pharmaceuticals,

218
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,460
that will be enough.

219
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,650
As soon as the renovations for the annex are done, bring Yeong Ho and move in.

220
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,860
Yes, Chairwoman.

221
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,340
Not this one. There is preserved balloon flower root. Bring those for me.

222
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,130
Yes, Ma'am.

223
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,660
Since Mother-in-law's stomach isn't well, please prepare the preserved plum.

224
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm sorry for causing all the elders to worry.

225
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,490
Coming here like this,

226
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:28,660
I'll take it as a sign that you aren't giving up your place.

227
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,200
Get up.

228
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,790
Because I feared injuring it,

229
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,230
your leg has never even been touched by a rod.

230
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,330
Hurry up and become stronger.

231
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,080
Protect your place.

232
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,540
There might not be much time left.

233
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,860
Yes, Father.

234
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,900
Until the 61st anniversary inauguration ceremony,

235
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,440
stay low for now.

236
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:33,000


237
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,730
You should stay and eat as it's been a long time since you've been back.

238
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,990
No, thank you.

239
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,820
Please take good care of Grandmother and Father.

240
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,170
  Lawyer Kim Yeong Han 

241
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,730
A woman who was about to give birth killed her husband.

242
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:34,520
But it was the situation where the mother was facing serious domestic violence from her husband.

243
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,530
Perhaps, in order to protect the baby in her belly,

244
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,660
she pushed her husband and ran away. That was the situation that I remember.

245
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,840
At that time, "domestic abuse" and "victimized wife"

246
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,540
 didn't exist. The Department of Justice also... 

247
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,930
 Regardless of what the circumstances were, as a wife who killed her husband... 

248
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,220
 She will probably have served her full sentence by now. 

249
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,520
 The last thing I heard about the case was that she gave birth to her baby in the prison. 

250
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,110
Why are you leaving things like this in front of someone else's house?

251
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,290
It isn't that. I thought you were going around in the cold...

252
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,270
Whether I am cold or not, how is that related to you?

253
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,460
Don't do something like this again.

254
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,010
Don't come back here again.

255
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,160
Mr. Dripping with Sexiness, please open the door.

256
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,670
I am Lee Hyeon Woo.

257
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,980
The homeowner isn't home right now.

258
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,730
Respect.

259
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,650
Hello.

260
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,280
Mom, I have to pee.

261
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,850
Go quickly.

262
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,980
You are John Kim, the heir to Gahong and even dripping with sexiness...

263
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,260
I called you an unemployed without knowing those.

264
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,730
Yes.

265
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,690
There are boundaries between guys and girls. An unmarried girl being alone with a guy is...

266
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,290
Instead of saying that, there is no one who can watch Min Joon and you are here alone so...

267
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,760
Don't worry too much about my ex-husband, PD Go.

268
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,190
It isn't like we are on good terms since we got divorced, right?

269
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,970
Min Joon, Mom is leaving. I'll see you later.

270
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,290
Excuse me!

271
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,970
Uncle, I can't get down from the toilet.

272
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:09,130
Do you really have to get down? Is it a big one?

273
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,790
They seem to be pulling out all the stops

274
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,540
for the welcome party for the new executive director Kim Yeong Ho.

275
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,190
Whether it is true or not, because of the scandal and the boycott of the directors,

276
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,330
you must be dealing with a lot.

277
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,250
It's not that bad.

278
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,830
It seems that our directors are all in agreement, but the new executive director has a different opinion.

279
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,900
If you sign the document here in advance of the 61st anniversary of Gahong,

280
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:46,930
we might be able to help each other in the long run.

281
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,190
I don't think it is within my authority.

282
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,190
Is that so?

283
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,390
I think we, the directors, have to accept the new executive director.

284
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,450
I am looking forward to the 61st anniversary.

285
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,010
 I told you to get a place where men can get in comfortably. 

286
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,120
 You really listened to me, huh? 

287
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,630
 Min Joon! 

288
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,170
Aunt, when are you coming? This Uncle keeps making me exercise.

289
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,110
That uncle is usually like that.

290
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,120
Just be strong until I come. I will buy snacks and bring them.

291
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,870
It is the face I used to see a lot somewhere.

292
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,830
She was very pretty.

293
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,290
Uncle, I have to pee.

294
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,250
I will go there in a bit.

295
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,460
Our growing sprout  only knows how to go up the toilet and not down. 

296
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,050
He will do very well in the future.

297
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:16,170
 Think of it as an extension of Kang Joo Eun's day. A different kind of sweet taste in life. 

298
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,890
 You are applying that everywhere. I am too good for this. 

299
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,500
Even though it is a way of life to worry and make good decisions,

300
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,990
chilling and killing time can be a way as well.

301
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,190
Unemployed Oppa, fighting.

302
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,030
Uncle!

303
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,950
Hang up. I need to get in action.

304
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,570
Uncle, I took a dump.

305
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,030
Didn't you say it was a sweet taste?

306
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,970
What should I do since I am so sad about Min Joon's grandma?

307
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:57,030
She is still working hard to support her husband who beats her up.

308
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:04,650
But Min Joon's Grandma doesn't want to meet her son, Joon Seong.

309
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,170
How can she face the son she gave up for adoption? Of course, she can feel that way.

310
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,970
I can't tell him what's going on as it is.

311
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,430
I can't convince Min Joon's Grandma either.

312
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,310
What if she runs away?

313
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,880
That's why.

314
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,780
It is a problem for that sexy muscle guy but it is a bigger problem for Min Joon as well.

315
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,110
How can I raise Min Joon alone without Min Joon's Grandma?

316
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,990
Honestly,

317
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,650
I was worried that you might feel uncomfortable because of her prior conviction, even if it was false.

318
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,430
Are you kidding me? She helped raised Min Joon from when he was born.

319
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:53,060
Neither my own mother nor my Mother-in-law did. How could you?

320
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,400
Let me think about that for now.

321
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,370
You are my friend, Lee Hyeon Woo.

322
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,900
Another friend of yours is coming again over there.

323
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,900
PD Go? That human being, seriously.

324
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,220
Hey Ex-husband, did you go to Oh Soo Jin for a legal consultation?

325
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,930
Ex-wife, please pretend you don't know.

326
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,190
What is the matter?

327
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,000
Address me properly since this is related to work.

328
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,520
Address properly, my ass. I will just!

329
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
It isn't worth it. Let's go.

330
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,180
What are you looking at?

331
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,620
Min Joon, Aunt came.

332
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,840
Did you make a lot of money?

333
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,820
You have no idea because you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

334
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,510
I am just a lawyer at a law firm, a salaryman.

335
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,060
When did you wash your hand?

336
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,760
Are you a kid?

337
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,660
By the way, while you are in this house, don't even dream about a comfortable and racy night.

338
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,630
R-rated is prohibited.

339
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,510
Even though Min Joo leaves, assume that he is here and follow the rules.

340
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,380
The place outside of my world is really beyond my expectation and I'm ruined.

341
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,530
You like rhyming words a lot, huh? I'll pull the car out so when the tea comes out, carry the tea out to the car.

342
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,640
"I'll pull the car out so when the tea comes out, carry the tea out to the car," it seems like a literary gem. 
 (the Korean words for car and tea are homonyms)

343
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,520
There is a couple ring by the dressing table.

344
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:38,170
Do you have a lingering feeling for your ex-boyfriend or do you just love the jewelry?

345
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,120
I went to find it again after throwing it away.

346
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:49,470
Even though Woo Sik gave it to me, I wore it for 15 years.

347
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,550
It is also mine.

348
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,910
If you want me to throw it away, I will.

349
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,120
If you don't want to throw it away, don't.

350
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,930
Because there's nothing to throw away when it comes to this woman, Kang Joo Eun.

351
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,650
I told you R-rated is prohibited.

352
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:29,260
Do the exercise routine that I taught you. And stretch, okay?

353
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,890
Okay.

354
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,280
Then my Min Joon will become sexy like you in the future.

355
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,650
I can't guarantee that.

356
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,130
Oh I see. In any case, thank you. We will leave.

357
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,900
Oh Min Joo, leave well. Aigo, my puppy.

358
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,790
We will leave. I will leave you two alone.

359
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,190
What's wrong with you, Ajumma? Then leave, hurry.

360
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,110
Because being John Kim was revealed, "will you become a director of Gahong or not?"

361
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,750
You know that people are asking questions about it, right?

362
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,160
At a time like this, the issue of having a comfortable and racy night

363
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,450
is unreasonable. Plus, I'm a modest woman.

364
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,680
In any case, I think the mind rules the body so

365
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,080
within my space, which is outer space for you, I want you to always be on your best behavior. Okay?

366
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,780
Did I say otherwise?

367
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,340
Your mind rules your body.

368
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,190
You are confident about it?

369
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:43,390
Whether it's confidence, adages, proverbs, or even climbing up walls as a young girl, if it has anything to do with the word "dam" I'm good at it.

370
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,930
Okay.

371
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,180
Oh my.

372
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,600
Please button up.

373
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:48,030
  The Gahong 61st anniversary ceremony will occur as planned along with the inauguration of the new director  

374
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,740
  According to the source, the inauguration of the new director was originally planned.  

375
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,200
  Saying that nothing has been accurately revealed,  

376
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,860
  we have been asked to refrain from writing any speculative articles.  

377
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,200
- Yes. 
   - Even though we are working on it, the press and the board of directors 

378
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,480
  are not easy to deal with.  

379
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,680
 Just think of it as spilt milk. It is better to keep a low profile for now. 

380
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,240
Yes. Instead of crying over spilt milk,

381
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,400
this might be better.

382
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,830
  How long are you going to stay at Kang Joo Eun's house?  

383
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,380
Your jealousy. Please rest.

384
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,000
  Soo Jin! 

385
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,800
 Your car is here. Please open the door.  

386
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,080
  I am sorry. I am coming in.  

387
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,790
Who told you to come in?

388
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,260
Get out.

389
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,510
If you don't want me to come in that much,

390
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,560
you shouldn't have set the password like that?

391
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,480
By chance, you think I don't know my own girlfriend's birthday?

392
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,060
I heard you found out about what PD Go did.

393
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,410
I am on the external legal team of Director Kim Yeong Ho.

394
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,240
It is my job to solve the problem that occurs with my client.

395
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,670
Obtaining his international driver's license was

396
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,040
clearly illegal.

397
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,960
Soo Jin.

398
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,880
Please leave.

399
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,320
I will ask you for a favor.

400
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,550
Why is my life like

401
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,930
salt water?

402
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,240
Regardless of how much I drink...

403
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:18,030


404
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,890
Your desk is a mess as usual, Lawyer Kang.

405
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,920
I guess you have too much time so you are even working on a beautification project.

406
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,100
I was debating on what to wear.

407
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,620
Tomorrow is the 61st anniversary ceremony of Gahong.

408
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,560
There is a possibility that I won't be able to go,

409
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,100
because they don't know if Director Kim Yeong Ho will attend.

410
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,030
Did you know all along that Kim Yeong Ho is John Kim?

411
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,050
That's why you lost weight like that, huh?

412
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,260
I would like you to write the question.

413
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,800
I can just crumble and throw it away.

414
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,260
I am the team leader of the legal team.

415
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,460
I think I should know that much.

416
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,140
I will ask for the certification of the contents from PD Go.

417
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,590
- So that day...
 - Of course.

418
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,890
From Center Manager Im Woo Sik as well.

419
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,400
- What did you just say? 
 - Kim Yeong Ho's international driver's license

420
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,250
was provided by Manager Im Woo Sik.

421
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,270
For the conclusive proof that Kim Yeong Ho is John Kim,

422
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,930
Team Leader Im Woo Sik gave him that.

423
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,000
Why?

424
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,890
I know, huh?

425
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,120
I am also very curious about that.

426
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:11,570
It will be too bad if we can't go to the 61st anniversary ceremony.

427
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,610
It was the chance for me to see how you used to look.

428
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,700
Then.

429
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,240
Seriously.

430
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,050
What happened?

431
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,190
I am here.

432
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,010
Cleaning is...

433
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,500
Not that you can put things in any space you see, but neatly...

434
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,580
What is this? I think you are imagining something racy.

435
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,770
Forget PG-13

436
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,240
and move to R-rated instead?

437
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,460
No. Why did you turn up the boiler that high? Is it because it is someone else's house?

438
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,240
A bed scene tomorrow, right?

439
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,560
Isn't tomorrow a party scene?

440
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,850
It is the Gahong 61st anniversary ceremony.

441
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,320
Are you going to sleep here today as well?

442
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,340
Is my dripping sexiness too much?

443
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,470
You can't think straight.

444
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,800
Your pulse is too fast.

445
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,370
My pulse isn't the only thing that is fast.

446
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,120
I don't know if I will jump on you first so let's make the decision here.

447
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,050
What?

448
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,620
No. Daegu Venus...

449
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,100
spent time with the dripping sexy guy for a few days.

450
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,170
I am not saying that I won't be careful.

451
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,320
Even on kids TV programs, they show seven year olds kissing.  Let's not deny ourselves.

452
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,580
If we add our ages together, it is almost 80.

453
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:33,380
What should I do? I am tired.

454
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,150
Sleep. Sleep. Get some beauty sleep.

455
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,250
You initiated first.

456
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,210
It wasn't mutual?

457
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,440
I'm not really into the too-fiery style.

458
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,470
Wow, pink. 
♬   I'm getting excited today.  ♬

459
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:06,400
Let's go the cute and lovely route. 
♬    I've got the feeling. I've got the feeling.   ♬

460
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,080
♬   When you look at me  ♬

461
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,450
♬   When you call my name  ♬

462
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,770
♬   I'm not confident that I won't laugh  ♬

463
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,210
Executive Director.

464
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:25,100
♬   I get the feeling you're looking at my eyes  ♬

465
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,250
♬  My thinking is fuzzy  ♬

466
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,660
♬  I've got the jitters thinking of you  ♬

467
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,880
♬  I've got the feeling I'm thrilled somehow today   ♬

468
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,380
It is the time for me to go out of the  "outside of my world. "

469
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,260
It seems like Manager Min and I don't get along.

470
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,430
♬  Everything is changed  ♬

471
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,920
You will attend the party tomorrow, right?
♬  I knew love  ♬

472
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,150
♬  Now I won't be crying  ♬

473
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,070
In any case, even if I meet you there, I won't be able to say I am glad or

474
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,040
kiss you.
♬  Love come. Approach me.  ♬

475
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,560
Public life is public life and private is private.
♬  When you hope to see me  ♬

476
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,050
Even if I go there, I will go there as part of the external legal team.
♬  if you call my name  ♬

477
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,910
♬  I get the feeling it's likely I will fall in love.  ♬

478
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,310
I will go.

479
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,750
The rest of the racy and comfortable night will have to happen soon.

480
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,830
 Gahong 61st Anniversary 

481
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,490
What will happen to Kim Yeong Ho?

482
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:59,520
I think they will announce him as the director.

483
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,910
They will push forward with it?

484
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,290
Did the directors on our side turn around?

485
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,640
I think the external legal team has contacted them.

486
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,270
That is what's going to happen?

487
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,730
Where is Hye Ran?

488
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:42,170
Ma'am, you should eat something.

489
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,930
I am a bit late.

490
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,120
Oh my, Lawyer Kang.

491
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,780
You look nice.

492
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,990
I tried hard.

493
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,460
Are you nervous?

494
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,020
You aren't even the Director. Why?

495
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,010
I know, huh?

496
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,140
The chairwoman will enter.

497
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,240
Please be seated.

498
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,070
  Why aren't you coming?  

499
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,850
What happened to Yeong Ho?

500
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,650
We can't reach him.

501
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,360
Find out where he is.

502
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,240
I guess he hasn't come.

503
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,720
I'm sorry. Mr. Coach!

504
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:25,090


505
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,580
You are the main person today. Why are you like this?

506
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,960
What do I do?

507
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,850
I think I will be very late.

508
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,170
People are waiting.

509
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:19,460
Your grandma, your father, Joon Seong, Ji Woong, everyone...

510
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,620
Get up.

511
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,730
Kang Joo Eun.

512
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:35,880
Since you are enduring the pain like this, you aren't at your limit yet.

513
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:42,880
 I can still do it... So I haven't hit my limit yet. 

514
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,160
♬   That's how love is  ♬

515
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,970
Look at me.
♬   You left me and only left pain  ♬

516
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,050
"If I can believe it, I can do it."

517
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,100
"I believe that I can do it, that's why."

518
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,430
 If I can believe it, I can do it. 

519
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,910
 I believe that I can do it, that's why. 

520
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:13,800
♬   You are approaching with the wind silently  ♬

521
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:17,760
♬   To love someone  ♬

522
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,720
♬   To be going to resemble that again  ♬

523
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,730
Director Kim has just now arrived.
♬   It may even cause me to lose but  ♬

524
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:30,260
♬   That's how love is  ♬

525
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,420
♬   Crying and making you laugh  ♬

526
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:44,250
♬  I think I am in love,  ♬

527
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:44,600
♬  I think I like you,  ♬
