1
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,390
The head of the hospital contacted me.

2
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,890
You're all better now.

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,450
You did well.

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,850
- Yes.
 - My seat, right here,

5
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,550
is where you'll be sitting and where your mom used to be.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,900
Responsibility is of course a must, but there can't be any mistakes or flaws in this position.

7
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,430
I am very aware of this.

8
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,250
There will be a lot of eyes on you and a lot of people talking about you,

9
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,290
so watch how you speak  and how you act.

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,410
Yes.

11
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,930
That's all.

12
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,730
I can finally face your mom.

13
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,770
 Episode 9 

14
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:49,260


15
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,200
Executive Director,

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,650
are you feeling alright?

17
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,710
I've been wearing this tie for too long, so I have a slight headache.

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,550
You worked hard. Get home safely.

19
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,100
Mr. Coach!

20
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,040
Don't come any closer.

21
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,490
What's the matter?

22
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,820
What happened?! Did you get hurt?

23
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,630
What can I do? What exactly is the matter?!

24
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,540
Get out.

25
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,100
It's not something... someone can make better.

26
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,090
Why are you like this? Let's hurry up and go to the hospital!

27
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,570
Let's hurry up and go to the hospital!!

28
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,530
 Tap-tap. 

29
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,990
 When you do a "tap-tap," you're supposed to let the person go. 

30
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,310
Leave... Please.

31
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,670
♬  I didn't know that it would be so painful   ♬

32
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:06,140
♬  I didn't know I would want to see you so much  ♬

33
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,400
♬  Slowly my heart would be influenced  ♬

34
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,430
♬  Before I knew it only you filled it completely  ♬

35
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,730
 When I was young, I was really sick. 
 ♬  I enjoyed the   ♬

36
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:28,450
 So I have almost no memories of walking, running, or joking around. 
 ♬  time I had with you  ♬

37
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:34,730
  While I was sick like that, my Mom passed away. 
 ♬  I was happy if you smiled looking at me  ♬

38
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,680
 I was too scared of my father, and I felt sorry for my grandmother. 
 ♬  Just like that  ♬

39
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,600
 I was young, weak, and always in danger. 
 ♬  Time stood still  ♬

40
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,920
♬  I want to stay with you  ♬

41
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,790
♬    I will stay by your side.   ♬

42
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:04,170
♬   I will say I will love you   ♬

43
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,810
  It's probably a neuropathy, 
♬  Because I only see you ♬

44
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,430
 but it might just suddenly disappear one day, 

45
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,000
 or continue until the day I die.  
 ♬  I'm saying I don't have a choice  ♬

46
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,210
♬  Why is it now that I happened to meet you  ♬

47
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:35,310
♬  The person who would make the wounded me happy   ♬

48
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,970
  Someone might look normal on the outside, but it takes time for the wound to heal. 

49
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,780
 Wounds are different than how they look on the outside.  

50
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,060
It looked heavy.

51
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,140
That's okay...

52
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,740
I'll take it to just to the front of your house.

53
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,270
Thank you so much.

54
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,530
For such a young man, you're...

55
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,400
Don't mention it, it's really not a problem.

56
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,550
This way then...

57
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,220
Are you okay?

58
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,070
Are you really okay?

59
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,490
I got caught not being sexy.

60
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm the one that's hurt but you're showing it more.

61
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,250
It was a surprise!

62
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,800
You really scared me!

63
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,360
Sit down for a minute.

64
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,800
I'll say it again when the president gets here,

65
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,740
but why don't the two of you move out?

66
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,720
- Mother— 
 - Through Director Choi,

67
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,600
you must have heard about our Yeong Ho becoming the Executive Director,

68
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,230
so I won't say too much separately on the matter.

69
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,610
For the work you've done for all the past years, I will do my best to find a suitable place,

70
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,650
so don't be too disappointed.

71
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,170
Mother...

72
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,300
I don't have any other ambition ... only that.

73
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,090
Since you have a son, you'll know all too well.

74
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,800
I don't want to let my child stay out there anymore.

75
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,900
- Mother, I— 
 - Because of an oldie's greed,

76
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,150
all this time, you've suffered a lot.

77
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,200
Chief Secretary Min is here, Chairwoman.

78
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,940
Do as I say.

79
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,190
You should start living reasonably.

80
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,550
Chief Secretary Min, let us go in.

81
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,590
How badly did it hurt?

82
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,410
I don't remember it very well.

83
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,230
No matter how many times I think about it,

84
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,510
the place where you went earlier,

85
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,300
it wasn't to see Anna Sue in America, but to go to Gahong Hospital in Daegu.

86
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,300
It wasn't a comfortable racy night.  It was a lonely, painful night,

87
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,110
since that's all you know.

88
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,340
I see you went through my room.

89
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,210
Do you think you're the only one who can do a search and seizure?

90
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,040
What happened?

91
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,950
We've even kissed, and yet you're going to keep being this way?

92
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,680
I had a rare bone cancer (osteosarcoma) when I was young.

93
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,960
Cancer?

94
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,790
But why do you have so many scars?

95
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,540
Because it couldn't be treated in one shot.

96
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,680
And this shows that I'm all better now.

97
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,690
Then, why is it still bothering you?

98
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,700
It's neuropathy. My body remembers it.

99
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,740
The body is smarter than we think.

100
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,940
How often does it hur— No.

101
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Have you been in pain like this since meeting me, while I've been in this house? Like that?

102
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,850
Once in a while, it goes by to a lesser degree too.

103
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,660
I didn't even know...!

104
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,770
I've talked about you behind your back, saying that there's nothing to you except that you're dripping with sexiness.

105
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,900
I've even bad mouthed you saying that you're full of yourself.

106
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,600
That's why you shouldn't judge people based on their looks.

107
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,390
Ah, seriously. I'm the one hurting, but you're the one that's emotional.

108
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,520
Usually, watching someone you care about is harder.

109
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,780
Since I can't hurt for you.

110
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,330
Kang Joo Eun cares about me...

111
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,900
Didn't you know? I care about you. A lot!

112
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,830
Come here.

113
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,040
It doesn't help to take medicine?

114
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,140
If you're like this, what happens to my hypothyroidism?

115
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,800
Since I was young, and until I got older,

116
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,370
even after I grew up, I've spent the majority of my time in a hospital.

117
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,430
You find out, when you stay in a hospital for a long time,

118
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,140
 how many people are hurting in this world. 

119
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,650
  In the end, we all... 

120
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,560
 Whether it's a little or a lot, we're people who are hurt.  

121
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,110
So, don't cry.

122
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,390
 People keep on living while dealing with and withstanding it.  

123
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:07,270


124
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,870
Aigoo. Joo Eun's dad...

125
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,090
I told you I was better but it's not that I'm not hurting anymore,

126
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,060
so Kang Joo Eun who hates lies,

127
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,610
since it's not a lie, don't run away.

128
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,880
Even in this moment, you think I'm pretty.

129
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,980
You're still... a bit lacking.

130
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,760
How can I be any prettier than this?

131
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,300
When you're healthier, you'll be prettier and sexier too.

132
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,540
So... You'll get told off if you get sick.

133
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,990
Yes, Mr. Coach.

134
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,380
Should I ... stay by your side?

135
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,000
If you did, that would be nice.

136
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,410
- Hula Hoop! 
- Hula Hoop.

137
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,580
It's harder than you think, so don't be embarrassed. Let's go. Twirl it!

138
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,530
- Look. How good am I? 
 - Oh!

139
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,280
Wow!

140
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,810
Look at me.

141
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,570
Yes!

142
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,190
Joon Seong!

143
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,540
- Are you okay? 
 - Is it always this hard?

144
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,350
Hyung.

145
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,420
Let's go.  Twirl it.

146
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,200
Let's see.

147
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,770
Oh.

148
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,360
Hyung!

149
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,400
Where's Joon Seong and Ji Woong?

150
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,980
They ate earlier and went to the gym.

151
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,520
When I woke up, you weren't around. When did you leave?

152
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,060
They went to the gym.

153
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,460
Ahh.

154
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,280
Well, I came down sometime before dawn, at four in the morning.

155
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,340
Why?

156
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,030
If you come down after four, it's sleeping together, and before four it's not?

157
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,300
We slept together anyway.

158
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,380
Omo. Omo! If someone hears, they'll think we did something.

159
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,420
I wouldn't know since I was asleep.

160
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,340
Ah, seriously.

161
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,490
Give this one to me.

162
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,860
It's all the same. You and your gluttony.

163
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,590
This oppa really doesn't get it...

164
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,110
By its very nature this is what a romantic relationship is all about.

165
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,520
Ah? Opening it, but opening it for someone else?

166
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,940
Wait a second. "This oppa"?

167
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,640
Then do you want to be my dongsaeng? I'd be thankful.

168
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,420
A romantic relationship is pointless and uneconomical.

169
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,410
You only know about those comfortable and racy nights. You're just a newbie to romance.

170
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,300
Do you... want to call me Ms. Romance Coach?

171
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,950
What did you say?

172
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,980
It looks like... I have a lot to teach you.

173
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,260
Ah, this wicked woman, so early in the morning.

174
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,750
Here.

175
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,450
Yesterday, since it didn't seem to fit the situation I didn't say it, but...

176
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm moving out in a week.

177
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,840
Ah, since a day went by,  there are six days left.

178
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,110
To where? Is it safe? And is it comfortable for a man to come visit?

179
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,400
It's nearby. It's a studio but also close to my friend's place.

180
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,890
It seems comparatively safe.

181
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,470
You'll be busy when you start working at Gahong.

182
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,570
And also, lot of people will be watching, so you'll have to be careful to avoid being talked about.

183
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,500
By some chance, if you're uncomfortable working in the external legal team—

184
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,170
Not doing something because I'm uncomfortable, or because I don't like it,

185
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,130
do you think that's possible when you're getting paid to do it?

186
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,580
The way I see it, it doesn't seem like there are any issues with you taking office.

187
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,930
They must have gotten an external legal team just in case.

188
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,120
It looks like there are some shareholders who are against you taking office as the executive director.

189
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,870
You're so smart...

190
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,390
You seem to keep forgetting,

191
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,820
but I'm an intelligent and pretty lawyer.

192
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,260
You lost too much, only in your face.

193
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,770
I'm an expert at eating and gaining weight.

194
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,290
Do you want me to grant your wish?

195
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,640
Ah, you're a dangerous woman.

196
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,130
To Joon Seong and Ji Woong,

197
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,420
I think it would be best to tell them properly after I move out.

198
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,620
What?

199
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,970
Seriously, it's not like I'm a seven-year-old.

200
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,890
I didn't tell anyone either.

201
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,980
It's already shocking to be involved with John Kim, but the executive director of Gahong?

202
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,220
It's tiring just thinking about it...

203
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,410
So, what about us?

204
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,490
Ah! About us in a romantic relationship! Do I have to say it?

205
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,070
Oh, that's right.

206
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,860
Romance at work is something to be cautious about, since we have to draw a line between public and private matters.

207
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,300
Right. You have abdominal weight, and I'm a coach.

208
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,970
Ah, seriously. How old is this drama?

209
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,380
♬    One two three four, that's right,    ♬

210
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,970
♬  Why don't you come over here right now, girl. Yeah.  ♬

211
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,450
  ♫ Nobody get in my way ♫  

212
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,280
♬  I’m feeling so good   ♬

213
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,030
♬  Everything is so fine  ♬

214
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,370
♬  It's like flying  ♬

215
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,150
♬  When I think of you  ♬

216
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,410
♬   I am again unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

217
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,830
♬  Thinking of her every morning  ♬

218
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,250
♬  I even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo.  ♬

219
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,650
♬  Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

220
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,750
♬  Yeah over and over I'm looking whether there's a flaw  ♬

221
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,710
♬  She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

222
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,250
♬  Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

223
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,690
♬  You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

224
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,410
Hold it.

225
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,990
♬  Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

226
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,470
♬  so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

227
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,430
Ah! I can't.

228
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,550
Oh, I can't do it anymore.

229
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,960
Why do you have no sense?

230
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,390
Omo!

231
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,470
Mr. Coach! Why don't we just kiss instead of working out?

232
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,830
♬   Looks so good,  ♬

233
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,680
I got you!
 ♬   personality so good  ♬

234
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,280
♬   Then you know that's playing foul, God ~  ♬

235
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,970
Well, you said that public is public,

236
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,850
and private is private.

237
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,750
This is a public matter. A couple's exercise that's good for abdominal weight.

238
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,290
Now. Where do you want to go?

239
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,540
Ma'am, Hyung! Ma'am! Hyung!

240
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,990
Hyung!

241
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,750
Why are you on the floor? Aren't you working out?

242
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,170
Ji Woong, it's too hard. Up. Up!

243
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,930
One million and twenty one, one million and twenty two, one million and twenty... three...

244
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,110
Do you want to help?

245
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,570
♬  so beautiful, You know know know yeah~   ♬

246
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,230
♬  so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

247
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,910
♬  To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

248
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,150
I'm hungry!

249
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,470
Did you stick your tongue out at Hyung?

250
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,990
Oh, I do it a lot.

251
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,810
Merong  (sound you make when you stick your tongue out) . Aren't you annoyed?

252
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,250
Is something in my eye? Something got in it.

253
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,430
Ji Woong...

254
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,990
- Do you want me to blow in your eye? 
 - Yes.

255
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,140
Stronger.

256
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,410
Who is it?

257
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,190
Tell Jang Joon Seong to come out.

258
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,670
Jang Yi Jin? Oh, Yi Jin, what's up?

259
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,370
I'm not Jang Yi Jin...

260
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,090
Yes you are. Hyung Joon Seong!

261
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,210
Jang Yi Jin?

262
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,250
Get in.

263
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,110
I'm the CF queen, Jang Yi Jin. People will recognize me if we go anywhere else.

264
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,690
Get in.

265
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,710
Oh, hurry up!

266
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,030
This is rude.

267
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,930
- It was a confession. 
 - Confession?!

268
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,530
"Will you eat with me or kiss me, will you eat wi--"

269
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,210
I remember, so please... Stop...

270
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,670
What are you going to do?

271
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,180
- Miss Jang Yi Jin-- 
 No,

272
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,190
call me Yi Jin...

273
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,390
Why? Even elementary school kids call me without my last name.

274
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,530
Isn't that Jang Yi Jin? Oh, that's Jang Yi Jin— Hey! Yi Jin!

275
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,150
I don't usually take people's last names out, and I also don't like speaking without honorifics. Anyway—

276
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,610
Jang Joon Seong, who has overcome his difficult past as an orphan and became a champion in the shortest amount of time.

277
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,080
Born on April 5th, 1986, blood type is O.

278
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,870
Try typing my name in search. Jang Yi Jin.

279
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:07,270
The first Jang Yi Jin is me. All my scandals are online, so if you're curious, try searching me.

280
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:12,710
That's right. You can't believe them all. Some of them are false.

281
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,630
I-I have to concentrate on preparing for my upcoming fight, so please—

282
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,910
Please!

283
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,830
If you're not going to kiss me, live with me, or die with me,

284
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,750
you should at least eat with me...

285
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,190
 Bulimia and anorexia... 

286
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,210
 Are you going through something difficult these days? 

287
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,470
 Just a little... 

288
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,550
 You should get some air, and take up some hobbies. 

289
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,630
 I am alright. Are you alright? 

290
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,230
 Where are you right now? 

291
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,910
 They said that this is handmade chocolate. Congratulations on passing the bar exam! 

292
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,040
That handmade chocolate that I gave you back then... I found out that they sell it here in Korea too these days.

293
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,200
You'll know from seeing it in the future,

294
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,630
but I'm like this. I apologize like this.

295
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:07,270
Is it not that you don't know what you did wrong?

296
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,350
I'm not that bad of a guy.

297
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,620
About Joo Eun's stalker...

298
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,370
I think that it's possible.

299
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,090
No, that's why I like you.

300
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,330
To Joo Eun, who was your first love that you dated for 15 years,

301
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,790
something dangerous happened.

302
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,670
You broke up with her and you became indifferent overnight?

303
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,910
If you were that kind of Im Woo Sik, I wouldn't have really liked you.

304
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,650
I'm sorry that I didn't answer your phone call or call you back right away.

305
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,910
I think that Joo Eun has gotten another man.

306
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,010
Yeah.

307
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,930
It seems like you already know who he is.

308
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:21,780
Yeah, well... It seems that

309
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,830
he's coming in as the Gahong Group's executive director.

310
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,260
I'm heading in.

311
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,770
It's been a while,

312
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,850
so do you want to drink some tea or take a walk? Or maybe...

313
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,150
No thanks, I'm tired.

314
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,820
I walked a lot today.

315
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,910
Go on ahead.

316
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,810
Soo Jin.

317
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,070
I'm sorry.

318
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,210
"I'm sorry."

319
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,950
Those are the words that a woman hates hearing from a man the most.

320
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,610
I'm leaving.

321
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,170
"I'm sorry."

322
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,930
 Wait a minute! 

323
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,060
 - Ah, I almost missed you!
- Kang Joo Eun, what's wrong with you? 

324
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,830
 I knew you'd be like this. 

325
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,850
 You received special admission to a national university. How can you wear that tie?  

326
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,830
 Take off your necktie. 

327
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,380
 - I don't know how to tie it yet.
- It feels like you're my wife. 

328
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,930
 I'm going to give you a necktie when I propose to you anyway. 

329
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,350
 Whose permission will you propose? 

330
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,830
 I'm Kang Joo Eun. If I set my mind to it, there is nothing I can't do. 

331
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,990
 You'll be late. Go on. 

332
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,570
 I'm leaving! 

333
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,500
 Breaking up and dating, breaking up and dating again, 

334
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,780
 we've had a splendidly dramatic fifteen years together. 

335
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,510
 I, Kang Joo Eun, am your first love, Im Woo Sik. 

336
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,640
 Congratulations. 

337
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,000
 I'm going to give you a necktie when I propose to you anyway. 

338
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,730
First off, free your schedules up for dinnertime tonight.

339
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,960
Even if it's cold, no excuses.

340
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,340
What is it again..!

341
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,520
The first snow has come, the first snow.

342
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,840
We agreed to go camping if I lost five kilograms before the first snow.

343
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,660
That's right, camping.

344
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,320
I know that the first snow has come, but I didn't know that you'd lost anything.

345
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,430
You gained 1.8 kg from 62.2 kg, so you are 64 kg.

346
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,250
Has anything changed since then?

347
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,920
- Of course! 
- How much?

348
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,960
I mean, body weight isn't the important thing here.

349
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,560
How much fat have I lost? How much muscle have I gained?

350
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,040
That's what's important, isn't that right guys?

351
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,110
- That's right.
-  You're right!

352
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,970
Additional source information please, with body measurements.

353
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,520
Ah, seriously. I won't be considered a member of this family as of tomorrow.

354
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,220
Come on and say you'll go! Huh?

355
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,490
You're not the kind of person to let go of a chance you've grabbed onto.

356
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,020
Since you're the type who can do anything, once you set your mind to it.

357
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,890
Okay, deal.

358
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,850
- Huh? 
- Deal?

359
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,830
He said we're going camping! You're serious, right?

360
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,590
Ji Woong!

361
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,090
- One Americano please. 
 -Yes.

362
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,200
Oppa.

363
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,700
Half a shot. Two of the same, please.

364
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,270
Yes.

365
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,160
Don't pout.

366
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,110
Since I could take it to mean something else.

367
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,540
Yes Mr. Coach.

368
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,800
- Please wait just a moment. 
 - Yes.

369
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,300
Did you eat? Where are you moving to? Is it safe?

370
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,950
Ah, it's always the same question every day.

371
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:45,700
I ate a heaping amount of greens, and my place is a studio, but I think it will be safe.

372
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,920
Why don't you pay me the rent and just stay?

373
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,460
Don't I have to just ask for whatever the market value is?

374
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,290
Market conditions? They say people with money are worse.

375
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,570
There's nothing special about a relationship.

376
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,170
As it is,

377
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,730
because of John Kim, I was transported like luggage everyday.

378
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,200
If you become the executive director,

379
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,570
I really dislike being gossiped about

380
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,070
because I went through it a lot when I was young.

381
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,990
Am I putting on a charming act?  I'm not.  I'm the Daegu Venus.

382
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,810
That dimple, seriously.

383
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,650
Wait a minute.

384
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,310
 010-124-1004 

385
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,300
♬    Even with thorns, the flower is pretty   ♬

386
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,030
 010-124-1004 

387
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,250
Can we talk for a minute?

388
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm sorry.

389
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,950
Do you want me to beat him up for you? Do you want to be my lawyer?

390
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,690
Just go.

391
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,150
Don't look elsewhere.

392
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,670
See you later.

393
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,350
You look nice.

394
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,320
I've been working out. You've seen me properly today.

395
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,960
You're not losing to show off to me and Soo Jin, right?

396
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,570
I was worried that you might overdo it to act like it's okay.

397
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,140
I'm not losing, but lost it.

398
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,110
And it's true. I'm doing it to show you both.

399
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:32,240
But beside the two of you, it's also for me and for the world to see.

400
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,300
When I exercise, I don't think about frivolous things and it puts me in a good mood.

401
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,020
It's as difficult as passing the bar,

402
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,070
but it's worth as much too.

403
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,380
Don't you have a trash can at your place?

404
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,600
I thought that if it gets thrown away, you should do it.

405
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,710
Since it's something that has meaning.

406
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,330
Okay, I'll throw it away.

407
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,120
I'll recycle it properly too. Will that satisfy you?

408
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,850
Mother sometimes texts me after her early morning service.

409
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,180
Just asking me how I am. To be healthy.

410
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,940
Ah, my mom. Seriously.

411
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,020
I'll tell her to stop, so don't reply to her.

412
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,480
My mom will keep her hopes up for no reason.

413
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,060
I'm sorry.

414
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,660
The past fifteen years, it wasn't just a relationship between you and me,

415
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,500
but also with your mom and Jae Hyeok too. Even the people we've come to know.

416
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:28,100
I didn't realize there was a process and order when saying good-bye.

417
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,220
What exactly are you trying to do right now?

418
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,030
I don't regret breaking up with you.

419
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:42,300
but hearing that you, my first love, met another man and you're happy,

420
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,620
the news that someone other than me could be next to you

421
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,630
didn't feel that great. It's selfish, I know.

422
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,550
Im Woo Sik, what are you trying to say?

423
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,910
I'm not telling you I'll come back.

424
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:08,370
Just... The past... Something that lingers even after the emotions are gone... How should I say...

425
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,430
The feelings that can't be explained with any theories?

426
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't think I can ignore it while living my life.

427
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,130
In this one-lane world,

428
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,100
I'm sure that sometimes... we'll meet again.

429
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:34,770
If I didn't know you, I would have said this was all a show, but since I do,

430
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,980
I will take it back, too,

431
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,430
what I said about not being able to wish you a happy and long life.

432
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,190
I'm sorry, and I'm also thankful.

433
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,410
I think even good-byes need to be learned.

434
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:59,510
While going through everything we did as first-loves...

435
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,230
That's right. Since this is our first proper breaking up.

436
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:13,530
I'm sure we'll get used to our reality and the tomorrow that's not the days past.

437
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,770
I'm already very used to it.

438
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,990
Ow, my shoulder.

439
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,370
Not there.

440
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,900
 Huh? Where is she? 

441
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,190
 The reason for your forward head posture, viewing your monitor and cellphone for hours with poor posture.  

442
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:14,090
 You have to get up, get up and stretch regularly, and keep your head straight, as if someone's pushing it. Okay? 

443
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,930
Oh, that surprised me.

444
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,300
Did something good happen?

445
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,080
You kept smiling.

446
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,400
I'm all about blessing in disguise, and no pain, no gain, lately.

447
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,640
How is the copyright case coming along?

448
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,500
You said it's not urgent, so I've been taking my time organizing the files.

449
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,950
Then what are you doing these days, Lawyer Kang?

450
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:08,290
I'm working on a right-to-a-view suit, filed by Mr. Choi Moon Seong and 14 other clients.

451
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:13,070
The copyright case has become urgent, so get to it as soon as you can and report back to me.

452
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,590
Ah, you should clean your surroundings.

453
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,990
Jeez. It was good briefly.

454
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,580
Oppa. Oppa did you go?

455
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,450
 Im Woo Sik 

456
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,850
 OH! Soo Jin 
 Your party did not answer the phone... 

457
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,410
Oh, PD Go, it's me.

458
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:04,170
 I have proof that the house where John Kim lived is privately owned by Lee Hong Im. 

459
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,410
 How should I release this?  

460
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,860
Is that so?

461
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,130
See that? What did this orabeoni (older brother) tell you?

462
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,500
To that household, you and Yeong Joon are nothing.

463
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,350
After twenty years of taking care of her, she now wants to make her grandson the executive director,

464
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,770
so she's telling us to get out and take whatever she offers.

465
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,600
That sly fox Chairwoman Lee is a problem too, but your husband is even worse.

466
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,180
President Kim originally was considerate.

467
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,330
He's considerate?

468
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:46,980
He's so considerate that he makes his wife miserable and ships his son off to America?

469
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:53,120
Brother, I didn't come here to get scolded.

470
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,100
Just wait and see.

471
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,220
Sigh, you always get backstabbed.

472
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,330
Even if they kick you out, stay.

473
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,020
It'll be the end if you leave the house.

474
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,390
I got the data and am confirming it.

475
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,330
It's not long until you take office.

476
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,270
You should prepare thoroughly.

477
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,590
Ah, that nagging.

478
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,380
Let me nag one more time.

479
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,070
You have to sort out your personal life and be very cautious.

480
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:50,110
The people around you could get hurt more than you.

481
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,060
Then, I will hang up.

482
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,070
Thank you.

483
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,610
I will invite you, Directors, to a game of golf very soon, okay?

484
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,860
Let's meet again. Yes, haha.

485
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,490
- Let's do that. 
- Let's meet again next time.

486
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,870
I'm all done.

487
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,750
Hyeon Woo, start. Right now!

488
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,740
Ah, this is heavy.

489
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,540
Hey, Kang Joo Eun, aren't you being too hard on me?

490
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,550
Hey, your son, Go Min Joon, who went as his parents to his preschool?

491
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,240
You and that dripping with sexiness guy.

492
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,710
If you know, hurry up. We don't have time.

493
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,110
Ah, but isn't a man supposed to set up the tent?

494
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,370
The men will be here soon.

495
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:06,450
The dripping with sexiness, dripping with muscles, and even the cute cutie-pie.

496
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,250
Ah, this girl. Where do I start?

497
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:17,210
Let me introduce you. This is Lee Hyeon Woo, who helps me reminisce and is my friend for over sixteen years.

498
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,450
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Hyeon Woo, and all about her reminiscences.

499
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,410
And this is Kim Yeong Ho.

500
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:30,450
Ah, you're that man that's dripping with sexiness!

501
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,420
I'm Kim Yeong Ho.

502
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,600
Ah, and this is the Korean Snake RFC champion, Jang Joon Seong.

503
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,940
Hello.

504
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,740
Oh my, oh my, you really are dripping in muscles.

505
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,780
Sorry, she's the type to say everything she's feeling inside.

506
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:54,060
Ah, and this is Kim Ji Woong. He's a trainer and a Harvard graduate.

507
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,880
The future Marine!

508
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,120
Second Ma'am!

509
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,730
Oh my, thank you.

510
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,790
A friend of Ma'am's is also a friend of mine.

511
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,080
Nice to meet you!

512
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,310
A cutie pie and a Harvard grad, at that, seriously.

513
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:15,740
I want to make him Min Joon's private tutor.

514
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,210
Kang Joo Eun, a moment please.

515
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,660
Ma'am!

516
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,360
You said this was camping.

517
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:41,490
That's right, camping.  In Korean, an outing, also known as a retreat, or a school trip, or a type of "Daeseongri"?

518
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,280
"Deaseongri"?
 (an hour away from Seoul, common place for M.T.' s)

519
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:50,080
You, Joon Seong, and Ji Woong probably haven't ever done this before.

520
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,960
Seriously, what's the use of only having a good body?

521
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,760
You guys are worthless when it comes to memories.

522
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,750
So you're saying that you're going to show us the taste of the sweetness of life as a group this time?

523
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:07,290
It's nothing big, but it's good to try something that everyone else has tried at least once.

524
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,420
I ask that you actively participate.

525
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:15,200
Ah, and don't make it obvious.

526
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,380
Why don't you be careful of that, since you're so thorough and meticulous.

527
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,160
Okay now, light the fire and gather in a circle.

528
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,150
- Let's light the fire, let's light the fire.
- No, I'll give you a piggyback ride.

529
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,300
- I'll give you a piggyback ride.  I'll give you a piggyback ride.
- No, no, seriously, why are you doing this?

530
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,790
Why are you being so nice?

531
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,590
Because I'm worried that you'll whine about being cold again.

532
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,410
Whine?

533
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,430
Alright, alright!

534
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,450
Wearing a bag?

535
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:59,550
This for that matter is a classic. It's a firm sticking point when it comes to a field trip. Teach?

536
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,370
Yes. I'm Memory Conductor Lee Hyeong Woo.

537
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,270
Now, first of all, everyone clap in four four time!

538
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,060
One, two, three, four.  Faster!

539
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,500
One, two, three four.  Wearing a bag.

540
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,450
- Three times!
- Those shoulders, shoulders, shoulders are lovely.

541
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,190
Oh my, so you guys don't know about this then.

542
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,310
Hey, use your shoulders a bit!

543
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,590
Where else are you going to use those broad shoulders?

544
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,870
♬ Your shoulders are beautiful... Ji Woong, you too.

545
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,380
- Yes.
- Alright, then shall we start?

546
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,520
- Cute Ji Woong, are you ready?
- Yeah!

547
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,790
Okay, one, two, three, four!

548
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,000
-- Wearing a bag.

549
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,450
 - Three times. 
-- Those shoulders, shoulders, shoulders are lovely.

550
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,180
♬ While watching that image,

551
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,020
♬ Walking without you,

552
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,690
♬  1-2-3

553
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,530
♬ Walking light-footed,

554
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,500
♬ Even when I'm on the wayside,

555
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,340
♬ It only makes me happy,

556
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,260
♬ Sitting by the side of the road,

557
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,680
♬    face to face  ♬

558
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,500
Light the candles.

559
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,790
At least during this time, there will be no need to talk to the person next to you,

560
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,090
or joke around, I think.

561
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,540
Okay, close your eyes.

562
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,280
Wait, what the heck are we doing right now?

563
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,260
This is the highlight, close your eyes.

564
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,840
If tears fall, don't wipe them.

565
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,910
Just let them fall.

566
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,100
Confession time will begin now with me.

567
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,250
When I, Lee Hyeon Woo, lost my mind from hearing about my first husband PD Go's dating scandal,

568
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,110
I accepted two child support payments in one month.

569
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,460
That is my confession.

570
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,860
Alright, it's your turn, Mr. Dripping-in-sexiness.

571
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,090
Active participation.

572
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,720
I'm dating Kang Joo Eun.

573
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,670
What?

574
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,090
- Heol!
- When?

575
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,130
Am I the only one doing it?  The dating.

576
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:59,230
I'm dating Dripping With Sexiness.

577
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,410
Kang Joo Eun!

578
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,680
This little...

579
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,490
Hyeon Woo is kind of similar to me,

580
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,050
since birds of a feather flock together.

581
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,510
This time it's green and before it was yellow,

582
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,220
now the red light will very soon come on I suppose.

583
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,850
Am I some kind of traffic light?

584
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:48,320
Or you could turn on the red light, since it's the last night.

585
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,070
What is with this guy?!

586
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,580
You know you like it.

587
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,630
Wait a minute.

588
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,700
I think Director Choi has information on John Kim.

589
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,340
The media hasn't come out with any information yet,

590
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,850
but I think that they have a definite card.

591
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:46,300
At a time like this, how can you be engaged in a private life?

592
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,130
Confession time hasn't ended yet.

593
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,850
I'm leaving.

594
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,410
What's with you, seriously?

595
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:21,710
You saw him last time, right?  Over here is my precious Alberto,  Manager Min.

596
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,840
Executive Director.

597
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,180
This is the official CEO of my private affairs.

598
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,080
She is Kang Joo Eun who is in a romantic relationship with me.

599
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:45,180


600
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,600
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬
