00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,480
 Episode 4 

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,460
You didn't know?

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,660
Not know what?

4
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,220
Hypothyroidism.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,780
You didn't know...

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,020
Wait a minute.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,280
So you're saying that I have hypothyroidism?

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,420
Don't you get physical checkups?

9
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,740
Wait a second... So I...

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,060
You can't push yourself or get stressed.

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,660
That's why you fainted today. Maybe that's why you fainted in the airplane too...

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,120
At least I know now.

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,450
Also, why do you, Yeong Ho Hyeong-nim, feel bad?

14
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,360
What happens to my body is my fault and my responsibility.

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,780
You're someone I'm so thankful towards.  Even though you don't give me a chance to show gratitude to you.

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,400
Anyway, I keep racking up the mileage for being indebted to you like this.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,980
Thank you. Goodbye.

18
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,590
If you're going to do this, let's do it properly.

19
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,280
I am... John Kim.

20
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,830
Hypothyroidism is— Ah...

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,200
the reason you don't lose weight no matter how hard you work out... That explains—

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,470
Then, what happened to what I did?

23
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,440
All that work I did while nearly dying?

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,550
Ah, that. That's something UFC fighters normally do to train...

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey!

26
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,770
Am I a joke? How dare you commit fraud against a lawyer? Huh?

27
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,760
Ah... Let's not grab by the collar. It keeps opening up...

28
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,760
You don't know how hard it was for me to do. I worked so hard...

29
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,620
I really must have looked like an idiot.

30
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,990
The training was so sloppy, but for you to fall for it... Wow.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,080
I don't know whether you're innocent or foolish.

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,630
After committing fraud, you're saying that the person who was fooled is at at fault?

33
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm not saying that it's your fault but I can't comprehend it.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,820
Because it's urgent! Because I'm desperate... Because I want to believe it.

35
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,880
That's the reason people fall for it.  Not because people are dumb or foolish, you jerk.

36
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,640
Whether I take legal action or deal with it emotionally, I'll figure it out later.

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,090
Before my thyroid explodes, I need to take myself out of this situation.

38
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,770
 There's nothing else that's wrong, but the result from her blood test is a bit... 

39
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,440
 TSH. There's something like that. 

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,410
 It's a bit high. When it's high— 

41
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,100
 Hypothyroidism. 

42
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,320
 Are you a doctor? 

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,750
 She shouldn't have been pushing herself... This woman... 

44
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,820


45
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,070
 Go! 

46
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,870
 Today, you're dead. 

47
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,890
 This jerk!  

48
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,700
 Yes, Ma'am! You're killing it! 

49
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,720
 Are you her guardian? 

50
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,660
 By the looks of it, more so than you. 

51
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,920
 Can I ask what your relationship to Joo Eun is? 

52
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,700
 A relationship where one keeps fainting and the other keeps saving. 

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,940
 I haven't decided yet whether it's coincidence or fate. 

54
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,470
 Why does she keep... For what reason... 

55
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,860
 There's nothing really wrong with her, right? I think I have the right to at least worry. 

56
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,340
 If you're going to stay, I'll be going— 

57
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,180
 I'd like to... ask for a favor. 

58
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,320
 But, can I 

59
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,700
 really become different?  

60
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,780
 Since it's you, John Kim, I'll believe you. 

61
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,320
 Because it's urgent! Because I'm desperate... Because I want to believe it. 

62
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,740
 That's why people fall for it, you jerk. 

63
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,940
No matter what, you're going to be with Joo Eun?

64
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Kang Joo Eun.

65
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,420
This man, why isn't he coming?

66
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,780
 Oh Soo Jin 

67
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,580
Yes! I'm almost there!

68
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,360
Yes.

69
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,280
 Trending News 

70
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,220
 Fainting Video 

71
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,620
 Th-Th-Thank you. Th-Th-Thank you.  

72
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,020
Why did you drink so much by yourself?

73
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,520
You came? I thought you weren't coming.

74
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,880
I told you I was.

75
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,680
I went to see Joo Eun.

76
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,680
I heard she fainted.

77
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,780
I see.

78
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,860
She had a guardian.

79
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,480
So? Were you upset?

80
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,420
It's a relief. Why would I be upset?

81
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,220
Later,

82
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,900
even if I marry someone and get divorced,

83
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,580
I don't think I can get remarried.

84
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,320
I would feel bad.

85
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,260
I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

86
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,280
If you're sorry, that's good enough for me.

87
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,250
It's good enough...

88
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,540
since I'm the most horrible wench in the world.

89
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,720
I think I know how you feel.

90
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,420
Being the most horrible bastard in the world...

91
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,800
I think it's better to be that, right now.

92
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,780
For you, I mean.

93
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,260
 What crap is this now!?! 

94
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,910
Oh! I thought you had cancer or something!

95
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,030
It's not thyroiditis, but hypothyroidism.

96
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,860
Oh.

97
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,580
Ah! I heard that's the trend right now. Think of it like you're susceptible to trends.

98
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,540
Hey. Lee Hyeon Woo.

99
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,330
Your mom once told me when I was getting divorced,

100
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,360
"Even if you fall down, don't cry."

101
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,190
"Even if you hurt your knees, you'll get sympathy."

102
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,520
She meant that even if something goes wrong, something else will work out instead.

103
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,550
Mom!

104
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,820
Oh! You miss your mom. You want to see your mom?

105
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,440
It's not that.

106
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,740
Kang Jae Hyeok jerk is getting married.

107
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,340
With a 21-year-old. Excessive speed violation (getting pregnant).

108
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,240
That kid doesn't have any money or a job, but he has that kind of talent.

109
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,040
What is it? To you again?

110
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Ah! This Kang Jae Hyeok, this jerk! Ah really!

111
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,650
Oh! I nearly died doing it and I even got scammed!

112
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,460
Huh? What? Scam? What?

113
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,030
It's nothing. Later.

114
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,720
Aigo. You must be sleepy. Seeing how you're talking nonsense, you're sleepy.

115
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,610
Hurry up and get some sleep. This won't do. Aigoo.

116
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,490
Lie down.

117
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,500
Don't make anything. I don't have an appetite.

118
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,970
Don't worry, don't worry. I'm not crazy. Why would I make something when you didn't even ask for it?

119
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,150
I was going to take Woo Sik's  since you still have some left.

120
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,010
 - Lee Hyeon Woo.  
 - Huh?

121
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,420
Did you really not put that plant here?

122
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,820
I told you to get some sleep!

123
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,320
Omo! It really came alive. Joo Eun, it really came—

124
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,320
That's why when you were prettier, you should have become Miss Korea. But you wanted to become a lawyer— Seriously.

125
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,220
It's a miracle of miracles that you even became a lawyer.

126
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,330
Ah, what's with hypothyroidism now?

127
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,880
Sleep, sleep. Sleep.

128
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,590
 Start. 

129
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,760
Joon Seong Hyung's chicken salad.

130
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,360


131
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,410
♬  Shake it. Shake it. Shake it for me! Huh!

132
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,250
Okay!

133
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,990
Hyung. Just tell me.

134
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,360
I'll die if we keep going like this. Did I do something wrong?

135
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,290
I feel like it's my fault, that's why.

136
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,420
But, why do you keep pulling your shoulder out?

137
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,470
- I know, right? 
 - Is something wrong?

138
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,240
It's not that, but since I've injured it before, I must be trying to spare it from injury.

139
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,980
Were you always such a smart person to be calculating and keeping yourself from injury?

140
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,690
Get another physical.

141
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,310
Yes.

142
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,390
Hyung-nims! Time to eat!

143
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,900
Hey, kid! You should eat well in order to have luck.

144
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm going to give it to the dog if you don't want to eat it.

145
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,450
Ji Woong!

146
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,140
I was joking! Woo-hoo!

147
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,480
Our grandmother, my grandma  once said that to me long time ago.

148
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,110
I told Kang Joo Eun that I'm John Kim.

149
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,670
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

150
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,780
She suffers from hypothyroidism.

151
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,540
Then...

152
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,900
We shouldn't have been pushing her that hard.

153
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,190
That's why... in that way...

154
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,030
She was totally bloated.

155
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,020
What I dislike the most is crying because of other people,

156
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,490
and what I dislike even more is crying because of myself.

157
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,670
Ah! Seriously! They'll say that even my eyes have become fat!

158
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,730
I'm ruined. I'm ruined. Ruined!

159
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Should I just take sick leave?

160
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,970
It's the most popular video right now, "The Fainting Lawyer".  I wonder why she fainted.

161
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,640
I shouldn't be laughing.

162
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,870
Then you can just stop laughing!

163
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,660
Law-law-lawyer Kang.

164
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,440
Are you okay?

165
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,040
I'm not okay so everyone face forward.

166
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,490
You don't look okay.

167
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,920
I have thirteen months left on my loan,

168
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,540
and my younger brother who doesn't have a damn thing is getting married.

169
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,150
But... I have hypothyroidism.

170
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,420
These are the things that are really not okay.

171
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,210
I think I drank too much.

172
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,210
Aren't you cold?

173
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,270
Yes. It's warm.

174
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,310
Oh, Hyung!

175
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,660
I told you to buy something with flowers, like a bouquet. What is this?

176
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,290
This is an air freshener. Maybe she'll forgive us if her air becomes good.

177
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,410
What do we tell the lawyer? I can't even take another step.

178
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,100
Ma'am likes me a lot and she's a kind person.

179
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,110
Don't worry,  Hyung.

182
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,450
Why don't they let me know over the phone?

183
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,690
Are you okay?

184
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,740
Yes, thanks to you. I already sent a text to the CEO

185
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
not to worry about me.

186
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,520
Yes. I got the text.

187
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,500
It's good for you, but not for the firm.

188
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,870
By the way, before we go on, let's sort out our titles.

189
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,310
Sort out our titles?

190
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,940
No way... You want me to call you Vice-CEO?

191
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,430
Shouldn't you? Since people are watching.

192
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,970
No matter what, we're at work. It might make it seem like we have no ranking or order.

193
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,760
- Right now— 
 - Vice-CEO, right now.

194
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,430
Are you asking me to use honorifics? Are you joking?

195
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:43,580
Are you asking me to use honorifics? Are you joking? (formally)

196
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,530
I'm not joking, Lawyer Kang.

197
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,550
I hear our homepage is being flooded with questions about the "Fainting Lawyer".

198
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:58,340
The CEO suggested that you work from home for the time being.

199
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,700
Until it dies down a little.

200
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,500
Hey, Oh Soo Jin. Did I commit a sin?

201
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,410
When did I say that you committed a sin?

202
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,940
Vice-CEO, I'm fine, so—

203
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,930
Just because you're okay,

204
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,830
it doesn't mean this matter is okay.

205
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,980
We are lawyers, not comedians.

206
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,220
Hey, Oh Soo Jin.

207
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,220
At the discretion of the Vice-CEO, let's have you work from home for a week.

208
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,940
Hey!

209
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,780
Oh... That's right.

210
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,060
It's the same outfit as I had on yesterday.

211
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,740
You're quick with the visuals.

212
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,080
Then.

213
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,140
Ma'am!

214
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,640
What happened? Did she cuss at you? Sue her. You are a lawyer.

215
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,280
She is the Vice-CEO of the lawyers.

216
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,740
Should I scold her for you? I will just!

217
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,440
Who is the one that needs to be scolded, seriously?

218
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,830
I am very sorry, Ma'am. Please forgive me.

219
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,200
Hundred percent sincerity.

220
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,160
I am sorry.

221
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,740
In trying to protect our Hyung-nim, we caused a very big discourtesy to you, ma'am.

222
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,440
Are you okay?

223
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,180
Because you got hurt, my heart also got hurt. Heartbreak!

224
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,580
I am to blame as well for you fainting yesterday. I have no excuses...

225
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,920
In any case, I'm really sorry.

226
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,520
Ma'am, we were crazy. Crazy. Hyung is also crazy.

227
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,720
We're very brazen. Ma'am, you're a lawyer so one misstep and we're totally— Slice!

228
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,880
Oh, seriously!

229
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,900
Ma'am laughed.

230
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Get up! What kind of tea do you want?

231
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,980
- Are we allowed to have you give us some? 
 - Then do you want me to give you a beating?

232
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Since you're my guests who brought me a present.

233
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,980
Oh, Ma'am!

234
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Ma'am, this is ...

235
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,200
an air freshener.

236
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,420
 You should have wakened me. 

237
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,900
 You were sleeping so soundly. 

238
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,480
 Do you want to go inside? 

239
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,560
 Next time. There is a golf meeting early tomorrow. 

240
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,200
 You must be tired. 

241
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,580
 I will go. 

242
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,580
 Sleep well. 

243
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,580
 I will call you tomorrow. 

244
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
 Okay. 

245
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,880
Thank you for forgiving me. Then...

246
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,840
Where's he going?

247
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,320
Ma'am, fighting!

248
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,640
Why "fighting"?

249
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,330
Are you still mad?

250
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,880
I am only not mad at Ji Woong and Joon Seong.

251
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,300
You don't need me now?

252
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,400
Kim Yeong Ho...

253
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,580
Do you have evidence that you are John Kim?

254
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,200
You should have been that suspicious before.

255
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,180
You don't like it because it is me? Should I leave?

256
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,860
I don't like that you fooled me and deceived me.

257
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,620
Whoever it is, even if that happens to be the one and only, John Kim.

258
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,460
I said I'm sorry.

259
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,930
Can I ask you why you being

260
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,100
John Kim is a secret, Kim Yeong Ho?

261
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,740
It's because I am the son of a wealthy household who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

262
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,340
That's why I will get told off by my grandmother and father for bringing dishonor to the family name.

263
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,320
What? It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

264
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,920
It's not like you're that interesting of a person.

265
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,320
Let's say that not being able to lie is your strong point. Let's get out.

266
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
To where?

267
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,260
Aren't you going to go on a diet?

268
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,480
I'm the kind of person who might get fooled once, but not twice.

269
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,640
Also... I'm pretty meticulous, since I'm a lawyer.

270
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,980
Is it a contract?

271
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,040
- What's the other one? 
 - Pardon?

272
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,100
 Physical Examination Results Notice 

273
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,210
- Oh, the results from your physical. You really are meticulous since you're a lawyer. 
 - Oh!

274
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,180
This is a personal privacy matter. Seizing without authority is—

275
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,620
It'll save us some time, since we were going to do a physical anyway.

276
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,020
Give it to me!

277
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,820
October 9th is very recent and danger, warning, required...

278
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,940
Seriously.

279
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,560
I've never seen such a wicked (sounds the same as 'required') woman.

280
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,460
I am a dangerous woman as well.

281
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,540
I've seen everything I should. Is there a reason for you to get embarrassed?

282
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,660
You don't mean... Do you think you can hide under those clothes?

283
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,860
Oh, what are you doing now?

284
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,800
You can always break a contract, but not me. I always come through with my promise.

285
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,760
In the future, your body is mine. It's up to me what I choose to do with it.

286
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,780
"No, I can't. I won't." Those won't work.

287
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:02,800
I am saying that from now on, there won't be anything that you can stop just because you want to stop.

288
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,760
If you understand,

289
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,100
let's go.

290
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,940
 Respectful Relationship 

291
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,220
Our Yeong Ho, how is he doing?

292
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,720
He told us to stay at least 3km away, so we're taking care of him from a distance.

293
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,420
Since he just unpacked, let's watch him until he comes to his senses.

294
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,760
By the way, what happened with the girl from Deoksung Pharmaceuticals?

295
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,420
After the initial arranged date, only once...

296
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,020
She's nice and healthy. She seemed good.

297
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,180
What brought you here?

298
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Since it's cold out,

299
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,040
I thought your health might suffer, so I brought some hot tea—

300
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,140
Go down. This isn't a place for you to come up to.

301
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Please forgive me.

302
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,300
Hmm, Mother-in-law, today...

303
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,900
Yeong Joon is coming today, that's right.

304
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,580
You should go greet him, Daughter-in-law.

305
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,240
Maybe you want to get together in the evening and have dinner.

306
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,460
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

307
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,460
 It's a VVIP medical examination center within the VIP center. It's a plan for an upgrade 

308
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,300
to be used only by a select few.

309
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,180
It's very luxurious in looks.

310
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,560
Maybe since you were a medalist, the idea is superb.

311
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,460
Gahong is the best medical examination service in Korea.

312
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,360
It's good for our image

313
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,500
and differentiation strategy is good for global marketing also.

314
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,720
Let's do that. It provides a great image for us.

315
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,460
By the way, have you looked into Branch Manager Kim Yeong Ho?

316
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,300
Only on the surface for now.

317
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,090
I will let you know when I find something more definite.

318
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,370
  International Driver's License
 Kim Yeong Ho 
 USA-IDL:019999281 

319
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,310
 She said not to come.  

320
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,810
 Can I ask what your relationship is to Joo Eun is? 

321
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,970
 A relationship where one keeps fainting and the other keeps saving. 

322
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,800
 I haven't decided yet if it's coincidence or fate. 

323
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,180
  010336798 

324
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,660
 It's me, Woo Sik.  

325
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,560
 Jae Hyeok was worried about you.  

326
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,150
 How are you feeling? 

327
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,980
 How do you know that guy? 

328
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,480
  It is me, Woo Shik. Jae Hyeok is worried about you. How are you feeling? How did you know that guy? 

329
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,590
Is the temperature okay?

330
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,250
Yes.

331
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,590
  Im Woo Shik 

332
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,020
Okay. It's good. Okay.

333
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,470
Forty thousand. Just five seconds left. You're almost there. Come on man!

334
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,340
How many did I do?

335
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,290
Wait a moment.

336
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,130
Korean Snake?

337
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,720
Yes.

338
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,630
Why did you reject me?

339
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,630
What are you—

340
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,350
The advertisement! CF! You said you wouldn't use me.

341
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,770
What?

342
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,720
Did you come from outer space? It's me, Jang Yi Jin. The queen of CF's, Jang Yi Jin!

343
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,510
The skin goddess, Jang Yi Jin. Uncommon bodyline.

344
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,300
The first pick for a female entertainer who men want to have as their girlfriend!

345
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,130
Whoa.

346
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,120
You really came. Hi, Yi Jin.

347
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,620
 Hi. 

348
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,300
Hey, Yi Jin!  Hey! I'm sorry.

349
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,420
Mr. Snake is the one who should be apologizing.

350
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,280
I couldn't even sleep.

351
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,970
I only said that I'll think about it.

352
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,310
Think? You need to think about shooting an ad with me?

353
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,820
Are you a guy?

354
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,560
Appendectomy?

355
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,570
Hey Yi Jin,  you're embarrassing me. The appendix is on the right side. Come on, get out of there!

356
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,160
Right.

357
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,420
Oppa, I think Mr. Snake is sick somewhere.

358
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,710
It's sad that I have hypothyroidism,

359
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,300
but 32 years of age doesn't make me feel bad.

360
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,670
I guess you are pretty brave.

361
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,120
But the fact that I have to take medicine for the rest of my life is a bit...

362
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,450
Don't think about eating and instead, think a little about how not to eat.

363
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,920
Seriously. If people hear it, they will think I am eating really good stuff.

364
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,370
That's why I'm saying not to eat it. It's not even good stuff.

365
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,570
It's something you won't have to take once it recovers its function.

366
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,910
But, where are we going right now?

367
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,890
Ah, how should I say this?

368
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,270
To do a search and seizure?

369
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,380
 Before &amp; After 

370
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,670
According to Article 12 Section 1 of the Constitution, a citizen cannot be subjected to an illegal—

371
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,850
How else? Should I... measure you with a tape measure?

372
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,850
I have the right to refuse to be subjected to a warrantless interrogation.

373
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,300
I told you that you can't say, "No, I can't. I won't", didn't I?

374
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,290
Your body is now mine. Mine.

375
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,960
Mine. It's up to me what I choose to do with it.

376
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,320
♬   Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

377
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,060
I think I also have the right to not look like a strange guy.

378
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,850
- No! No! 
 ♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady.   ♬

379
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,420
♬  Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

380
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,460
​♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady    ♬

381
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,030
​♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eye off ​ ♬

382
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,800
♬   so beautiful, so beautiful  so beautiful, You know know know yeah   ♬ 

383
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,730
♬   ​so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

384
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,720
♬   ​To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

385
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,020
- Excuse me. Why don't you just look here instead? 
- Shh.

386
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,890
You cannot speak.

387
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,320
Yes?

388
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,380
Your family has sent a message asking you to come to dinner.

389
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,390
I can't go.

390
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,410
Yeong Joon seems to have returned to Korea for a short while.

391
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,170
Tell them I'm far away and it's too hard for me to get back.

392
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,910
I'll tell them that.

393
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,840
Madam, it seems like Yeong Joon is back.

394
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,510
She's been missing him so much. How is she going to wait all that time?

395
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,750
It's only three years.

396
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,760
Chairman.

397
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,590
I guess in private, you're our in-law.

398
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,320
Our Yeong Joon has received a scholarship again.

399
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,040
What was it called again? What was the name?

400
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,460
He received a scholarship from an Ivy League.

401
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,130
He gets his intelligence from my brother-in-law, you see?

402
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,370
Oppa.

403
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,870
You did well. You did right by your mother.

404
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,600
- Yes. 
 - He even gets his good looks from my brother-in-law!

405
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:05,640
Anyway, Yeong Joon, mind your behavior and your mental attitude.

406
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,940
You know what our family motto is.

407
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,250
"Taking great pride in our history and tradition..."

408
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,920
How long will you be staying?

409
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,180
Ah, he's going back after one week.

410
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,380
He must have a lot of studying to do.

411
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,290
Go back safely and tell me if you need anything.

412
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,040
Yes, thank you, Father.

413
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,870
I will go upstairs now, Chairman.

414
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,740
Don't take our Yeong Ho's return to Korea lightly.

415
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,990
It's this oldie's last wish, so everyone please

416
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,600
help our Yeong Ho  find his rightful place.

417
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,430
Mmm, it's very good without being fishy.

418
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm glad it suits your taste, Mother.

419
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,390


420
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,650
Should I leave the car here?

421
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,950
Where did all that embarrassment go from earlier?

422
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,320
I left it in my dreams.

423
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,920
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

424
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,090
You're John Kim, right?

425
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,880
This time it's really you, right?

426
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,880
Probably, the more you see me, you'll find that you're right.

427
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,540
For a woman of our generation, I'm very noble and pure.

428
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,050
I'm really going to believe you, okay?

429
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,190
You always laugh whenever I'm being serious.

430
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,700
Don't worry, the very noble and pure, Miss Kang Joo Eun.

431
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,900
As long as I'm John Kim, there's no way I'll be quitting first.

432
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm going to try hard.

433
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,360
Since giving up is not my way, either.

434
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:19,410
Even though I'm a little embarrassed, my mileage of being indebted to you is at full capacity. Then...

435
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,120
Ma'am! Ma'am!

436
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,860
Excuse me for coming so early in the morning, but I've been sent as today's helper.

437
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
Good morning, Ma'am.

438
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,600
Wait a minute.

439
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,920
What is this, before breakfast—

440
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,980
I told you yesterday that I'll see you tomorrow.

441
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,120
But still...

442
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,740
Ma'am, by any chance, is your boyfriend here?

443
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,740
- She got dumped. Wham! 
 - Omo! Omo!

444
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,340
Come in.

445
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,760
Excuse me.

446
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,640
That human being doesn't know privacy.

447
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,040
Omo!

448
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,680
- Find them. Go. 
 - Yes, sir.

449
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,120
Joon Seong, is there anything that can be saved?

450
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,540
- Ji Woong. 
 - There is nothing to save, Sir.

451
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,520
Nothing. They are all dead.

452
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,280
Why? They are good for the body.

453
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,200
Since you won't comprehend, even if I give you a long explanation—

454
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,760
It's not good for hypothyroidism.

455
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,960
I've been taking them religiously.

456
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,900
The sesame oil is in the process of fermentation.

457
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,860
I didn't know about it since it was far inside the cabinet.

458
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,380
This was in the fridge. What is this?

459
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,580
I think it's a mosquito killer.

460
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,420
I was going to keep it for a long long time.

461
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,200
This is something you can eat, and something you can't eat.

462
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,540
But... It's like I have to keep off as much as possible.

463
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,960
I really like dry seaweed and seaweed soup.

464
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,460
You should eat seaweed soup. Once a year, on your birthday.

465
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,760
Ma'am.

466
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,100
- Whose are these? 
 - Omo!

467
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,800
Grandma?

468
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,940
Your style is... great. Like that actor... Kim Dong Wook.

469
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,900
- Boo! 
 -   Insomnia?  

470
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,220
I sleep well anywhere.

471
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,460
But you can't sleep when and where you're supposed to.

472
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,160
You sleep on the couch most of the time. You stay up all night and try to catch up with sleep all at once.

473
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,380
You drink caffeine day and night, so your digestion can't be good,

474
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,800
and you don't exercise enough while having all that excess weight,

475
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,820
so you have constipation and your organs are weak.

476
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,310
You probably have problems with your knee joints and you get tingling sensations in your hands and feet.

477
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,670
Seeing your posture, your back and spine are probably not in such good condition.

478
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,770
Seeing how you walk, your pelvis is out of alignment and your hip joint too, it can't be—

479
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,840
If you have hypothyroidism, you definitely suffer from chronic fatigue and you gain weight.

480
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,400
You are prone to getting colds and you keep having fits of bad temper.

481
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,060
And you are... Yong Pal? (short for skillful quack)

482
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,000
What?

483
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,080
No matter what, we'll have to see your test results, but I'm probably not wrong.

484
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:33,180
Since you won't die, listen carefully. Sleeping, eating, walking, moving,...

485
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,580
You have to re-do everything. Okay?

486
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,280
The accumulation of all your repetitious habits, that is what brought on your illness

487
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,500
and probably made your body the way it is.

488
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,700
  You are John Kim, right? It is for real this time, right? 

489
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,560
 For a woman of our generation, I'm very noble and pure. I'm going to really believe you now, okay? 

490
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,980
  I will work hard because I won't ever give up.  

491
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:46,260


492
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,920
I can just go there. You don't have to come...

493
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,180
I would like that as well but there is a need for me to come.

494
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,860
I am not cold.

495
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,820
You will need it later.

496
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,560
Look over this now.

497
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,600
To put it simply, overall, you're overweight.

498
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,420
Especially your abdomen, and that butt.

499
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,240
You're in danger of various adult diseases. You could hurt your lumbar disc. Let's go.

500
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,220
Wait a minute! Am I being subjected to a strip search again?

501
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm arresting you this time. Or is it, imprisonment?

502
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,060
Where am I being transported to?

503
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,820
We are almost here.

504
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,360
Oh!

505
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,860
So this is your house? Wow.

506
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:30,020
Don't call me Mr. John Kim or Yeong Ho Hyung-nim. Call me Mr. Coach in the future.

507
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Mr. Coach?

508
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,420
It looks like I have a lot to teach you.

509
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,040
Okay, Mr. Coach.

510
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,180
But, Mr. Coach, do I have to keep being transported like  just now? Can't we do it somewhere else?

511
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,700
You've become recognizable, and all you need is right here.

512
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,360
Also, I am—

513
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,060
Secret Trainer, John Kim.

514
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,820
Being transported like luggage will be safer for you, John K— I mean, Mr. Coach.

515
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,720
Joon Seong, Woong and I will take turns being in charge of you.

516
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,160
Because of me...

517
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,540
Everyone will be suffering, right? So do your best. Think of it like you're taking the bar exam again.

518
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:14,960
I thought I was going to die taking the bar exam. Everyone said it was a miracle.

519
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,120
Then this time, let's wish you luck, since you've already used up your miracle.

520
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,420
- No, I'm not saying that I want to retrieve the beauty that I'm not fated to, but I was a— 
 - Shhh!

521
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,200
You said... "beauty"?

522
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,160
If you haven't seen it, don't even say it, Mr. Coach.

523
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,500
You see, my nickname was "Daegu Venus" once.

524
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,880
There was almost no man for whom I wasn't their first love in South and North Gyeongsang province.

525
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,140
Never mind. You'll see it soon enough.

526
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,900
By any chance... Do you suffer from mythomania?  (pathological tendency to lie or exaggerate) 

527
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,720
What did you just say?

528
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,620
How much do you want to regret it later by making absurd remarks—

529
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,120
No, no. I'll deal with my own regrets so why don't you go stretch?

530
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,520
Am I a puppy or what?

531
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,600
Yes, Mr. Coach.

532
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,060
If it is hard...

533
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,860
- I will tell you. 
 - Please endure.

534
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,820
I am okay.

535
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,420
About what?

536
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,320
Okay then.

537
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,460
You've heard of squats, right?

538
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,520
I've done them.

539
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,810
It will hurt your joints because of your weight.

540
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,580
Please!

541
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,500
Please say it in a non-embarrassing way, Mr. Coach.

542
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,120
Follow what I do. Legs, shoulder width apart.

543
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,040
Cross your arms in front.

544
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,660
Tighten your waist. Straighten your back.

545
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,540
Look to the front.

546
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Firm up your butt muscles.

547
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,140
That's right. Go down slowly.

548
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,980
Up. Up!

549
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,760
Again.

550
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,640
Again, down.

551
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,960
You can't. You said you were a beauty?

552
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,940
Let's wait and see.

553
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,980
I am sorry. Focus. Crouch down.

554
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,000
Down!

555
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,680
Up!

556
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,100
It will be easier if you tighten your belly. Down again.

557
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,640
Down!

558
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,540
  Sleep on the bed. 

559
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,760
  Even if you can't sleep, make a habit of doing it.  If your feet are cold, put on socks.  

560
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,480
♬   Darling u Whoo  ♬

561
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,860
  As for stretching, do it about 20 minutes after you wake up.  

562
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,800
  Take your thyroid medication on an empty stomach.  

563
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,000
  Warm water.  

564
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,600
  Your low body temperature usually affects your digestive system.  

565
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,280
♬   You will be my love forever 
 My love which will last forever  ♬

566
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,060
♬   Darling u Whoo  ♬

567
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,160
♬   I was afraid of love  ♬

568
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,580

569
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,080
♬   Foolish me  ♬

570
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,740
What again? What?

571
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,540
♬   Falling You changed me  ♬

572
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,320
 As if someone is pushing your forehead gently, bring your chin forward, 

573
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,780
 firm up your middle back and 

574
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,400
 lastly, your butt. 

575
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,160
 Hip! 

576
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,960
Yes. Yes, Mr. Coach.

577
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,800
Get lost.

578
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,800
I said, "GET LOST"!

579
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,350
How could he be so strict even in my imagination?

580
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,880
Are you okay? It is uncomfortable every time, right?

581
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,340
Since I have done it for a few days, I am now used to it. Sometimes, I doze off too.

582
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,180
But, what should I do? I interrupted your training.

583
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,620
We got caught lying to you. This is our punishment.

584
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,360
Thank you for keeping our hyung-nim's secret.

585
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,480
I feel like a blackmailer.

586
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,320
In any case, thank you to everyone. I will pay it back by becoming a beauty.

587
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:01,280
I am looking forward to it. We are almost there. You should get ready now.

588
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,560
Ready to go!

589
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,140
You scared me. Ji Woong.

590
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,350
Yes, Mr. Coach!

591
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,340
Thank you for today as well.

592
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,960
I lost five kilos. One kilo a day.

593
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,280
It isn't good for you to be optimistic.

594
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,720
Maybe you got your system working again because of the medication.

595
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,720
Go in. It is very late.

596
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,480
Yes, Mr. Coach.

597
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,020
Who is it? Who is it?

598
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,020
  Mr. Coach.  

599
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,580
It's me, Joo Eun.

600
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,240
Who... ?

601
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,380
Why are you pretending you don't know me?

602
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,460
Why are you shocked?

603
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,450
It's me.

604
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,380
Why... Why are you doing this?

605
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:09,540
I even brought the flower pot you like.

606
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,490
Save me.

607
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,920
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

608
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,300
♬    Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬
