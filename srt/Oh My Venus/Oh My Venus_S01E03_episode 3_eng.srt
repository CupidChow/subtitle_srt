1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,270


2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,820
  That friend told me, 

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,290
 "You must be in pain or feel lonely."  

4
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,640
 "If not, maybe both." 

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,590
 What happened? 

6
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,980
 Episode 3 

7
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,120
Ma'am, what's wrong?

8
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,960
Please promise me that you'll only tell the truth.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,060
For me, it's an opportunity that might not come again.

10
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,080
You are John Kim right?

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,090
What?!

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,950
You are John Kim, right?

13
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,630
That's right.

14
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,470
John Kim.

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,810
Wow.

16
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,030
Are you really—

17
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,470
Wait, John Kim.

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,690
I don't think it's something we can talk about here. 
Why don't we go in first?

19
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,380
Did you just stick your tongue out in my palm?

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,720
Well, I was talking and you just clamped ...

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,490
Why would John Kim do secret training?

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,780
If the other room heard it

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,330
your reason for coming here might be lost.

24
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,830
Why did I come here?

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,150
If you particularly wish to hear it from my mouth.

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,210
Let's just say I heard it. Anyway, thank you for your decisive testimony.

27
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,740
John Kim. Omo, John Kim!

28
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,420
If there's no confession, the justice system usually  convicts a defendant on circumstantial evidence.

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,430
For example, of all things...

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,470
Press pass for the Stella Show's broadcaster, ABC.

31
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,590
Of all things, the same occupation as John Kim, who is a trainer.

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,880
Of all things, an intonation and tone that matches well with the name John Kim.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,380
Along with that, of all things, a statement from an affiliate saying he is Asian.

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,170
Just three of "of all things" is enough to be circumstantial evidence.

35
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,210
But then, there are four of "of all things".

36
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,040
Right now, just looking at all three of your expressions, I gain confidence in my assumption.

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,040
Ah yes.

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,940
My best friend's ex-husband is a very famous showbiz PD.

39
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,710
I hope you remember that.

40
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,260
Of all things,

41
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,340
are you threatening us right now as a lawyer?

42
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,690
Rather than threatening, it's more like a firm and heartfelt request.

43
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,780
Ah, if threatening works, then I will go with that.

44
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,480
Okay. Whoa.

45
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,020
Ma'am, look.

46
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,410
I'm not John Kim.

47
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,930
Honestly, no, never!

48
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,330
No...

49
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,590
Omo, John Kim...

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
- Let us discuss this first.
- I still have things to tell him—

51
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,820
Wanting to become the second Jennifer Anderson, I'm sure John Kim will know.

52
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,630
Hands up!

53
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,110
She is a Korean lawyer, Kang Joo Eun.

54
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,140
- Kim Ji Woong, you—
- I'm sorry.

55
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,710
I mean, but who would have thought that on the plane...

56
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,340
It's unbelievable!

57
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,050
And I never knew that would be in my jacket.

58
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,840
So why did you even have that broadcast station press pass anyway?

59
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,020
As a keepsake?

60
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,490
Ah, my legs are...

61
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,160
There's no use crying over spilled milk. It's not going to be undone.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,610
What do we do, Hyung?

63
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,180
That's right.

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,100
Sincerity moves heaven and killing is a crime.

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,880
Eventually, chances like these do come! Thank you!

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,330
Mom, I ate a champion.

67
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,810
 What's with you, what did you eat? 

68
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,660
 Aigoo, even if you like Woo Sik that much ... 

69
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,920
 - A reborn queen of queens! 
- A reborn queen of queens! 

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,260
 - Kang Joo Eun!
- Kang Joo Eun! 

71
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,130
 It's totally Venus! 

72
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,870
 Venus! 

73
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,700
 What just happened? 

74
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,530
 Amazing! 

75
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,250
Is there any way?

76
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,080
She's not someone who would let go of an opportunity that she's grabbed.

77
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,070
Ji Woong.

78
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,260
You, who are you?

79
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,450
I'm John Kim...

80
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,580
I'm hyungnim.

81
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,600
How much do you want to lose? You must have a goal.

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,060
I'll tell John Kim that myself,  separately.

83
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,190
John Kim doesn't understand Korean that well, that's why I—

84
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,980
- Translate—
- Team doctor!

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,830
It's a little late for my introduction but I'm Kim Yeong Ho, responsible for translating and working as the team doctor.

86
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,800
Ah yes, Kim Yeong Ho. But he talks really well in Korean.

87
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,020
- John Kim, we- 
- Uh, yeah. Uhm...

88
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,830
You know  when I get really nervous, like speaking Korean. And you I just don't know what to say...

89
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,270
If he gets nervous, his English is like this.

90
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,830
Ah, okay.

91
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,100
I searched John Kim  online. It said he's a UFC champion.

92
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,330
Yes, well...

93
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,780
He's really amazing. So you two are on the team with Jang Joon Seong.

94
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,350
From now on the three of us are part of Kang Joo Eun's team.

95
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,120
Omo.

96
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,750
Omo.

97
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,790
Really?

98
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,710
Wow!

99
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,870
John Kim. John Kim.

100
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,750
♬   When I think of you I am again  ♬
♬   unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

101
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,560
♬   Thinking of her every morning, I  ♬
♬   even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo  ♬

102
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,770
♬   Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

103
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,480
♬   Yeah over and over I'm looking whether there's a flaw  ♬

104
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,920
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬ 
♬   Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

105
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,580
Since it's the last supper, just one bite.

106
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,470
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

107
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,350
Oh, Hyeon Woo.

108
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,450
Aigoo, I can tell just by the sound of your chewing. Buzz! It's soondae (blood sausage)!

109
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,000
Ding! It's soondae and ddoekbokki. 
  (Blood sausage and rice cake.) 

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,820
Since it's the last supper, don't nag me too much.

111
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,140
There's no end to your last supper.

112
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,130
Never mind that. What's that "life chance" you talked about earlier?

113
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,450
You'd get hurt if you'd know.

114
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,330
Check it yourself later.

115
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,280
Hurt?

116
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,960
At this age, I'm a divorcee raising a child alone. 
How much more will I get hurt?

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,890
Hurry, it's really frustrating!

118
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,790
 If it's such special information, my child support cost will go up.  

119
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,560
 It came back to life. 

120
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,240
Hey, have you come to my house?

121
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,260
I don't even have time to go to my child's kindergarten!

122
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,090
Anyway, Hyeon Woo. Min Joon's mom.

123
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,950
You see,  life gives a chance for you to live no matter what.

124
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,170
Joo Eun.

125
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,080
By any chance, are you on the porch?

126
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,470
Do you feel like jumping off?

127
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,240
Should I go there?

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,390
Aigoo!

129
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,730
I'm just saying, it's a beautiful night.

130
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,430
Seriously? I got scared!

131
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,450
Let's do well. Fighting!

132
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm really sorry, Hyung!  I was wrong, I was!  Me!

133
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,900
Brothers, what is this? It's been hard for you.

134
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,070
Shake it, shake it for you. Shake it.

135
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,710
Yes.

136
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,080
Here, here, here.

137
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Because of you, I'm the one dying.

138
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,630
Drink it, drink it.

139
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, Manager Min.

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm at your new place. Everything will be ready by this afternoon.

141
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,610
 Just come empty-handed. 

142
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,830
How sweet.

143
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,490
You can contact me anytime.

144
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,020
I'll leave it in your hands, Lawyer.

145
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,430
- Yes. 
- Thank you.

146
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,580
Hyeon Jung.

147
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,120
- Yes. 
- Coffee please.

148
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,400
The sugar...

149
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,410
just one.

150
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,950
Huh?

151
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,590
Lawyer, are you perhaps sick anywhere? What do you mean by one sugar?

152
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,790
Hyeon Jeong, do you know the feeling of being full without eating?

153
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,920
No way.

154
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,380
Lawyer, are you trying to diet again?

155
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,130
By chance, do you know of John Kim?

156
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,570
Lawyer, are you a fan too?

157
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,880
You don't even know his face. What fan?

158
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,920
That's right, I don't even know his face.  No one knows it.

159
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,270
Ah, Lawyer, about Vice-President Oh Soo Jin.

160
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,680
Why?

161
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,070
I mean, because of those darned organics, I'm about to become a farmer.

162
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,580
We're applying oil, too.

163
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,020
Your skin is really good.

164
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,070
No matter how much one takes care of it, it's very different than being born with it.

165
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,860
Is that so?

166
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,240
We're also the professionals.

167
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,730
You can tell when someone is born with it.

168
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,800
That isn't true.

169
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,590
Center General Manager, you must not be busy.

170
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,130
I'm in the middle of working.

171
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,460
Escorting VIPs is the job of the Center General Manager.

172
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,110
I didn't know to that extent.

173
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,050
The more I see you, the more I'm greedy for you.

174
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,720
To be envious of the past.

175
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,930
Again.

176
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,870
I'll just escort you to the car.

177
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,290
 11 -  Center General Manager's Office 

178
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,650
Thank you.

179
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,540
 12 - President
 Board Room  

180
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,410
 I'm sorry, President. 

181
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,030
 The road was wet with rain... 

182
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,950
 We took them to the hospital but 

183
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,730
 both Madame and Driver Jeong ... 

184
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,470
 How did this... 

185
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,050
 I should have escorted her.  I'm sorry. 

186
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,920
 I will report to the President.  You make the funeral preparations. 

187
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,630
 Yes, President. 

188
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,400
 As to the chief mourner, your son— 

189
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,210
 No, that won't happen. 

190
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,800
 It's not yet time to throw him outside 

191
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,360
 in front of his mother's portrait (of the deceased). 

192
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,630
 If he can dare to act from an ulterior motive, 

193
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,740
 that's the time. 

194
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,080
 I'm sorry, President. 

195
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,660
 Mom. 

196
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,970
 Mom. 

197
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,240
 Mom. 

198
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,110
It would've been good if you had made contact in advance through Manager Min.

199
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,430
I know.

200
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,410
You don't really like getting involved.

201
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,220
What happened for you to come all the way here?

202
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,290
The American branch resignation acceptance, please cancel it.

203
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,770
- It's the wish of the President. 
 - You're the one with authority over personnel affairs, Director.

204
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,890
Please reassign me to the branch.

205
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,510
That would probably be better for you as well, Director.

206
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,740
If it can't be avoided or enjoyed, it must be accepted.  That is life.

207
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,860
What you're talking about is the silver spoon that you were born with by being part of this family.

208
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,060
You need to know that life is not just sweet.

209
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,880
As you know, I didn't grow up knowing only sweet tastes.

210
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,830
Then, for now ...

211
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,780
Perhaps if there is a next time,

212
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,990
then I'll make an appointment in advance.

213
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,820
What brings you here?

214
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,700
Did I come somewhere I'm not allowed to?

215
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,690
Branch President.

216
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,940
About the American branch, he finalized the resignation.

217
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,560
As you know, it's noisy in America as well.

218
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,580
What should I tell the chairwoman when I call her?

219
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,320
Since I have nowhere to go now because I was fired from my job,

220
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,350
please have Manager Min do something for me.

221
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,970
Tell her to stop being mad at me and answer my calls.  I miss her.

222
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,710
Okay?

223
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,170
You should have told me.

224
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,270
Mother knows just by taking one spoonful.

225
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
Madam,

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,700
because you were taking care of the memorial service yesterday, you seemed too tired.

227
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,880
How can you do this all the time?

228
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,800
They say that food is medicine. We can't be careless about it.

229
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,860
It's clam porridge.

230
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,810
I'm sorry, Mother.

231
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,420
No, it's fine.  For you to take a nap during the day,

232
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,270
you must be getting old also.

233
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,450
You can leave.

234
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,250
Yes.

235
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,780
 Our Yeong Ho was at the president's office? 

236
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,790
- Yes
- Ah, Hyung. They said that we don't have night training this week.

237
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,270
Is that right?

238
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,950
Then that place would be good.

239
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,550
How is the house?

240
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,820
It's totally nice, Hyung.

241
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,950
We'll stay here well.  Thank you.

242
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,110
Hyungnim, I love you!

243
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,550
I'm sure it will work out somehow.  First, let's just survive, and see.

244
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,940
Yes, I'll see you later.

245
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,630
I won't need to go out to the gym.

246
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,250
Hey, take a look.

247
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,240
Kim Ji Woong.

248
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,750
Nah, man.  J to the K.

249
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,420
I'm John Kim.  Whoo!

250
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,670
What kind of person parks like...

251
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,920
Was it you?

252
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,750
You don't have my number in your contacts?

253
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,000
I've never received your business card.

254
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,110
What kind of employee doesn't know their superior's number?

255
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,440
Put it in your phone.  I'll pull it out while you're doing it.

256
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Get out, get out.  I said, get out.

257
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,180
What's the use of driving a new car?  You can't even pull it out.

258
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,020
What's the point of just knowing how to pull it out?  It's not your car.

259
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,060
Hey.  Hey.

260
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,770
Hey!

261
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,710
If she's a lawyer, then she's an educated person.  She'll keep the secret, right?

262
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,400
I hope so, but I have to be able to trust her.

263
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,040
Excuse me.

264
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,260
Ma'am!

265
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,730
Listen to her voice, it's way too happy.

266
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,970
Where should I change my clothes?

267
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,620
Wait, why is this small?

268
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,750
Did I gain more weight?  I'm about to go crazy, seriously.

269
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,630
Kim Ji Woong.

270
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,900
Don't let your resolve weaken.  You need to be be hard on her so that she gives up quickly, and we can be done with it.

271
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,230
 John Kim. 

272
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,350
We're not curious, so why don't you just come out.

273
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,750
I mean, only John Kim needs to be here.  Why are you all standing there in a group of three?

274
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,450
We're a team, and John Kim's Korean is a bit...

275
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,320
Yeah.  I, uh, really, my Korean is...

276
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,030
Come on, baby.

277
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,200
Well, since I'm going to lose it quickly.

278
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,030
You should start as soon as possible, John Kim.

279
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,860
Ma'am.

280
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,060
Jang Joon Seong.  Kim Yeong Ho.

281
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,070
This will serve as my introduction.

282
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,880
Then what should we start with, John Kim?

283
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,260
From this moment, John Kim's training will begin.  Follow after me.

284
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,230
Down.

285
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,750
- Back down. 
 -  Joon Seong!  

286
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,880
What the heck is he doing?

287
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,760
Sorry, what we just did was stretching.

288
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,610
You can start.

289
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,450
Ah, I just need to go around once?

290
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,600
You will be going around continuously.

291
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,610
Continuously.

292
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,260
Go!

293
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,070
Come on, come on.  Up!

294
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,730
Up. Come on!

295
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,490
 We upgraded the moves from the last session. 

296
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,360
Oh my goodness, that looks difficult.

297
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,750
What the heck are they doing?  Crazy, they're crazy.

298
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,030
Whether you wash up before you leave or not, that's up to you. And the door will lock automatically.

299
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,880
Then."I'll see you tomorrow morning, man!"

300
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,950
Is what John Kim told me to tell you.

301
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,070
 Feeling like I wanted to turn back time, 

302
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,130
 was it okay for me to want it so earnestly? 

303
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,180
 Do I really want to get on a time machine?  Is it impossible in the present? 

304
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,960
 Still, I'm Kang Joo Eun. 

305
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,460
 If I just put my mind to it, I can do anything. 

306
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,460
 It's true that the start is half of it, right? 

307
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,690
Aren't you cold?

308
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,380
Isn't this why you called me?

309
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,300
I lost weight so that I could do this.

310
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,570
Since I saw it enough, wear this.
 All the workers are off so there's no heating. It's cold.

311
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,300
I'm not cold at all.

312
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,050
But I really can't swim.

313
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,000
I didn't have any occasion to swim before.

314
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,590
Even though I retired, I'm a national swimmer in name.

315
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,820
But his girlfriend is like a beer bottle, does that make sense?

316
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,520
I even taught Joo Eun.  Ah.

317
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,170
Are you going to make that face every time you talk about Joo Eun?

318
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,540
This face isn't cool at all.

319
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Let's not force ourselves to avoid it. We should just acknowledge whatever happened in the past.

320
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,100
Still, I dislike it.

321
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,000
♬   Two, three, four.  That's right.   ♬

322
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,780
♬   Why don't you come over here right now, girl.  Yeah.   ♬

323
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,950
Fighting!
♬   I’m feeling so good   ♬

324
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,750
Ma'am, why aren't you running? 
♬   Everything is so fine  ♬

325
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,150
I am running! 
♬   It's like flying  ♬

326
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,300
Ma'am, fighting!

327
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,870
You look really skinny right now! 
♬   When I think of you I am again  ♬

328
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,070
♬   unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

329
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,650
♬   Thinking of her every morning,  

330
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,910
♬  I even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo.  ♬

331
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,400
♬   Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

332
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,390
♬  Yeah over and over I'm looking whether there's a flaw  ♬

333
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,700
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

334
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,810
♬  Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

335
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,160
♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady  ♬

336
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,470
♬  Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

337
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,320
♬   So beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

338
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,530
♬  So beautiful, You know know know yeah~   ♬

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,150
♬   ​So beautiful, so beautiful   V

340
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:10,200
♬  To me you are too perfect, Girl. It's you. I'm gonna say to you.  ♬

341
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,760
Hi, Ma'am.

342
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,570
Oh, it's so heavy! Oh!

343
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,270
That's about the same as your fat weight.

344
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,770
This is heavy bag training, Ma'am.

345
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,930
Will you be alright?

346
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,930
You're dead today.

347
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,070
Ma'am.

348
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,690
One, two.

349
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,330
I'm sorry. Come here!

350
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,750
Why are you interfering?

351
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,070
You bastard!

352
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,790
Ma'am!

353
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,450
Ma'am. Don't die.

354
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,510
You have to put your ears into the water slightly.

355
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,410
What, when you put your face down?

356
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,890
Why? Did water go up your nose?

357
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,650
What did you do?

358
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,030
Why?

359
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,780
You're pretty even with your hair wet.

360
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,390
Really?

361
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,630
Oh, Ma'am. You're killing it!

362
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,990
Ma'am, you're very cool right now.

363
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,090
Oh!

364
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,990
That's good.

365
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,910
- Joon Seong. 
 -  Oh, cramp! Cramp! 

366
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,270
What should we do?

367
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,910
Meow! Meow! 
  (The Korean word for cramp (muscle spasm) is the same as for mouse/rat) 

368
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,230
- I don't think it's going to work like this. 
- No. If it was going to be like this, she should have lost weight earlier.

369
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,370
She seems like she really wants to lose weight, though.

370
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,670
It doesn't seem like she's losing weight.

371
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,310
I feel bad for our ma'am. She's the same. 
She's not losing weight.

372
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,790
 Has Anna Sue acknowledged being John Kim's woman? 

373
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,090
This ...

374
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,030
I don't see any sign of that news going away.

375
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,750
Oh!

376
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:11,250
John Kim.  I jumped rope 300 times. Sleep well.

377
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,410
You sleep well, too, Ma'am. I love you.

378
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,530
Ah, we have an interview tomorrow.

379
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,030
Oh, I forgot.

380
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,610
Where's John Kim?

381
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,370
"Oh, Ma'am. Jang Joon Soong has an interview today. See you tomorrow. Fighting!"

382
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,910
"I love you, Ma'am."

383
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,350
When did our John Kim do that?

384
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,370
Today, your John Kim is not here, so should we just go?

385
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,430
Then, how disappointed would our John Kim be?

386
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,150
If John Kim heard, he would be moved.

387
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,490
That's why I keep sending our John Kim Kakao messages.

388
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,190
Today, this.

389
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,450
- Should I do it? 
- Go.

390
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,370
Wait a second.

391
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,100
 Arranged Date. Cha Son Young 

392
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,710
This date is hard to refuse.

393
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,250
You should go. I know how to do it since I did it before.

394
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,910
Well, John Kim was unfortunate that he met me and has to suffer,

395
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,370
but because of me, you and Jang pro are having a hard time for no reason...

396
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,870
You should go! You're not supposed to make a girl wait.

397
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,730
Then.

398
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,010
Ah, excuse me.

399
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,750
When do I need to do this until?

400
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,550
As much as you can do since that's your limit. After you're done, clean up and the door—

401
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,850
- The door- 
- I know. It locks automatically.

402
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,510
Don't worry about me.

403
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,230
Ha!

404
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,490
I'm sorry.

405
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,430
You're not supposed to make a girl wait, but I had to change.

406
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,890
Ah, it's okay. I didn't wait long.

407
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,690
You should order.

408
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,850
Don't do that.

409
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,630
 Mother-in-law 

410
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,650
Wait a moment.

411
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,100
 My Woo Sik ❤︎ 

412
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,410
Why?

413
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,130
What?

414
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,090
Your mother doesn't know?

415
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,290
How do I tell her, when it's obvious she'll find out?

416
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,370
For now, I'll take her there.  Come quickly.

417
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,310
Aiyoo, I'll forget my son-in-law's face.

418
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,290
How have you been all this time? Have you been well?

419
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,670
- Yes. 
 -  You look so good.  

420
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,230
I brought my son-in-law some kimchi you like.

421
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,650
 It should taste better than the one I gave you last time. 

422
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,550
It's all good.

423
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,490
Really?

424
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,190
Mom.

425
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,770
Aigoo, look at her.

426
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,790
You didn't even call.

427
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,410
I came to see my children, so why do I have to call you? Right, Woo Sik?

428
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,150
Yes.

429
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,690
Let's go. Woo Sik is busy.

430
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,430
 Even if he's busy he's has to eat. 

431
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,670
Let me eat at this kind of place, too.

432
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,970
I'll treat you next time, so let's go out!

433
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,810
Mother is hungry, after she eats, hm?

434
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,710
Mother!

435
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,110
Huh?

436
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,910
Mom.

437
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,250
It just happened like that.

438
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,080
We're going to become a family anyway.

439
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,390
Let's not be uncomfortable. In a way, this is like the meeting of the families (before marriage).

440
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:53,350
Mom. You should go. You have to go.

441
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,890
 Why are you like that to our hyungnim? 

442
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,150
Kang Jae Hyeok!

443
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,590
Honey, should I sit?

444
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:05,400
Hyungnim, I'm sorry that we jumped the gun but this is going to be my wife.

445
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,190
That is... I'm sorry since this our first time meeting,

446
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,020
but whether it's the meeting of the families or a chance to tell the whole story, let's do it another time.

447
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:20,120
Kang Jae Hyeok, we're still strangers here so let's not expose everything about ourselves, huh?

448
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,780
What is this, Woo Sik?

449
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,760
Mother, the thing is—

450
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,790
What you gave me before and the one from six months ago, I ate them all.

451
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,610
- Woo Sik and I broke up, Mom.
- Kang Joo Eun!

452
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,270
What?

453
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,550
Aigoo, Father  (above) .

454
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
Aigoo, Father.

455
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,980
Woo Sik, I'm sorry.

456
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,400
Couldn't you change your mind?

457
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,590
Ever since that happened to Joo Eun's dad,

458
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,940
Joo Eun lost her timing because she was so busy making a living for my sake.

459
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,790
- Mom. 
 - I'm asking you.

460
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,990
Couldn't you take our Joo Eun back?

461
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,040
I apologize.

462
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,990
No, no.

463
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,780
I'm the one who's sorry.

464
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,780
- Mom.
- Please just stay still!

465
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,540
No matter what your child has done, 
the mother is always at fault!

466
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,950
It won't happen again, Woo Sik.

467
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,020
Please forgive me, Mother.

468
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,790
 Then... 

469
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,840
Hey! Woo Sik! Woo Sik!

470
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,160
You're so crazy! At your age, what are we going to do?

471
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,670
- Aigoo. Seriously,  are you out of your mind? Huh? 
 - Ouch. 

472
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,450
Aigoo, Father.

473
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,130
Do you feel uncomfortable?

474
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,320
I feel uncomfortable and concerned.

475
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
I can't help but notice...

476
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,410
Just let me off at the terminal.

477
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,750
Okay.

478
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,880
You don't need to get out.

479
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,580
That is... About the marriage—

480
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,880
I told you Woo Sik and I broke up!

481
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,240
Ah, please!

482
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,180
I'm talking about Jae Hyeok. Jae Hyeok, your younger brother!

483
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,840
A girl's temper is this bad. I'm surprised Woo Sik dealt with it this long.

484
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,560
Just stop it.

485
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,050
Drop me off at the terminal

486
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,780
- and just leave. 
 - How many times are you going to tell me!

487
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,500
I said it just twice. Twice!

488
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,230
Forget it.

489
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,650
I've lived on even with after my husband passed away.

490
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,290
Over there. Let me off over there at the terminal.

491
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,710
I got it okay? I will just leave after dropping you off.

492
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,370
 Please save me. 

493
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,060
 Why? Why are you doing this? 

494
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,820
 Why are you doing this to me? 

495
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,370
 Please take me somewhere else. 

496
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,290
 - Mom!
- You crazy little... 

497
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,750
 I feel uncomfortable and concerned. 

498
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,670
 I can't help but notice... 

499
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,760
What? You finished?

500
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
Ugh, I'm so tired.

501
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,440
So tired. But you can't stop the champion.

502
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,350
I got it. I'll go to Joon Seong's nighttime training.

503
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,170
 You get some rest. 

504
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,910
Yes, sir.

505
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,970
Thank you. I love you.

506
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,260
Is he here already?

507
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,000
What are you doing right now?

508
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,230
John Kim said—

509
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,380
What did John Kim say?

510
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,630
Ah, what are you saying?

511
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,490
Do you really think that doing this will make you lose weight?

512
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,820
If you lose weight, how will things be different?

513
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,700
Even if things aren't any different, couldn't I lose weight anyway?

514
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:34,210
I'm... only trying to do as much as I can
 since I was told to do that.

515
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,910
But you've gone over your limit right now.

516
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,120
No.

517
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,080
I can do whatever it is if I make up my mind to do it.

518
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,910
I can still do it... So I haven't hit my limit yet.

519
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,360
There is a difference between what you want to believe and what you can do.

520
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,640
For me, it's the same.

521
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,250
If I can believe it, I can do it.

522
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,960
I believe that I can do it, that's why.

523
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,250
If I do it just once more, it will be 107th time.

524
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,260
Lucky seven.

525
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,290
Give it a rest.

526
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,520
I can do it. Let go.

527
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,390
Listen to me.

528
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,300
You'll get hurt this way.

529
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,640
But, why call for a driver?

530
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,390
At this time of the night, a taxi or a driver cost the same.

531
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,560
Your body might not react the way you want.

532
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,510
You have to consider other people's safety too.

533
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,990
You called for a driver, right?

534
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,710
Yes.

535
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,790
- Please take good care of her.
- Yes.

536
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,370
Then, I'll be going.

537
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,610
Don't think about anything and go to sleep 
after a warm shower and lower-body soak.

538
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,790
Then, you shouldn't feel so bad tomorrow.

539
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,160
That was the lawyer's car, right?

540
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,110
- Yes. 
 - She was still at it?

541
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,220
Wow. She's amazing.

542
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,230
She's foolish but fearless, and she's even timid. Really.

543
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,390
Don't get out.

544
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,730
Let's rest for today.

545
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,880
Huh? You want me to take a break from training?

546
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,170

 Trainer JK 

552
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,410
 John Kim. What I couldn't do today, I will work on even harder tomorrow.  

553
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,650
 Please don't misunderstand because it's not that I didn't want to do it.  

554
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,920
 Then, see you tomorrow. 

555
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,150
  But  

556
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,150
  can I  

557
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,760
 really 

558
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,800
 become different? 

559
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,210
 What you want to believe and what you can do are different things. 

560
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,320
 To me they're the same. 

561
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,560
 I can do it if I believe it. I believe that I can do it, that's why. 

562
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,890
 Since it's you, John Kim, I will believe you. 

563
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,680
 Lawyer! You coffee is already waiting there for you. 

564
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,080
I'm sure you don't want to see me for too long, so I'll get right to the point.

565
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,800
You'll have to go on TV, Lawyer Kang.

566
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,220
What?

567
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,800
It's a live news show on a main channel and they would like a female attorney.

568
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,900
But am I the only female attorney at our firm?

569
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,940
You, me, Lawyer Kim, and Lawyer Choi. So four.

570
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,420
I have an important meeting, Lawyer Kim is in court, and Lawyer Choi feels sick from being nervous about being on TV.

571
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,000
I guess you forgot but I have all the issues that others have.

572
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,520
I feel kind of sick right now.

573
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,480
The CEO is happy that it will be a good PR for our firm. Let's not disappoint him.

574
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,920
Hey, Oh Soo Jin. Are you trying to get revenge on me?

575
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,660
Why would you? Why exactly are you being this way?

576
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:20,260
Revenge? How is going on TV... revenge?

577
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,870
 For example, if you copy someone else's social posting  or use their photos—

578
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,920
Oh, it's bitter.

579
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,140
Joo Eun, you've heard people say that you're very brazen.

580
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,220
It's nothing much. Come to your senses.

581
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,660
Ah, that scared me. Seriously.

582
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,450
According to Article 46 of the copyright laws... According. According... Ahem!

583
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,020
Why is my voice cracking so much?

584
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,260
 John Kim, I have a TV appearance this afternoon all of a sudden. 

585
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,360
 I am reporting to you that I won't be able to participate 
in this afternoon's run. 

586
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,800
 I'm nervous, but fighting! 

587
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,640
 Our Ma'am 

588
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,900
Hyung, has Ma'am arrived?

589
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,360
She can't come because of work!

590
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,420
Fighting!

591
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,020
What's with the "fighting"?

592
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,460
 On today's program, we will discuss copyright laws that are 

593
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,280
 easy to break or violate. 

594
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,920
 I taught Joo Eun too— Oh... 

595
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,760
 Mother-in-law 

596
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,960
 Are you trying to get revenge on me? 

597
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,580
 How is going on TV... revenge?  

598
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,040
 Today, to discuss this issue, we have Lawyer Kang Joo Eun with us. 

599
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,320
 Hello. 

600
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,020
 - Hello. I'm Lawyer Kang Joo Eun.  
 - What?

601
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,400
What happened to her face?

602
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,180
 According to Article 46 of the copyright laws, 

603
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,540
in order to use someone else's material,

604
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,480
no matter whether it's for profit or nonprofit,

605
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,060
you have to get proper permission for usage.

606
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,540
But more importantly,

607
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:41,020
violating someone's intellectual property is the same 
as stealing someone's assets,

608
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,040
so I think it's something that has to do 
with each person's moral conscience.

609
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,480
Yes, I see. Thank you for sharing this great information.

610
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,100
 Yes. 

611
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,280
 Since we're coming to you live, there has been a slight accident. 

612
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,480
 We apologize to the viewers. 

613
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,280
 We will go to a commercial now. 

614
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,860
- Lawyer! Please come to your senses!
- Lawyer! Miss Lawyer!

615
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,660
Miss Lawyer!

616
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,920
 The second ambulance of my life. 

617
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,860
 Where am I headed to right now? 

618
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,200
 The first time, even my corset got taken off. 

619
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,500
 This time, I wonder how much more of me will get exposed. 

620
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,730
What is this...

621
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,300
Oh, Woo Sik, it's me. Joo Eun—

622
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,560
 Sorry.  I'll call you later.

623
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,060
Where are you going?

624
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,420
I'll call you when I get back.

625
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:15,170


626
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,220
♬    A beautiful place  ♬

627
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,780
How did you...

628
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,380
I must have been in a location closest to you.

629
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,000
I didn't rip it up today.

630
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:37,870
What are your thoughts today? The worst day of your life has changed again.

631
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,660
I don't feel like I'm going to fly from happiness.

632
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,200
This might be a useless question, but

633
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,130
why do you want to lose weight so much?

634
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:55,660
Huh! It really is a useless question.

635
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,420
It's not like you're going to live with me 
so why don't you just be quiet.

636
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,900
No one knows that for sure, but what's with speaking informally?

637
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:24,090
You're someone I'm so thankful towards. Even though you don't give me a chance to show my gratitude.

638
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:28,820
Anyway, I keep racking up the mileage for being indebted to you like this.

639
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,520
Thank you. Goodbye.

640
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,550
If you're going to do this, let's do it properly.

641
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,580
I... am John Kim.
