 Episode 1 

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,250
 1999, Daegu 

3
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,820
 Is Kang Joo Eun prettier or am I? 

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,310
 Are you crazy? 

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,060
 Hello. I'm a high school student,  

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,190
 an eighteen year old male student, Lee Sang Park.
   

7
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,850
 
-  The girl that I like 
 

8
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,870
  attends a girls high school, and her name is Kang Joo Eun. 

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,040
Joo... Joo... Eun?

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 But, she's such a pretty student— 

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,960
It's Kang Joo Eun again!?!

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,020
 From our radio program, 

13
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,990
 this song goes out to the Daegu Venus, Kang Joo Eun. 

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,450
Weight is 48.6, height is 170cm, and chest is 36!

15
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,560
That's crazy! Is she even human?

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,240
What did she eat growing up to end up like that?

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,090
Her body would be like this.

18
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,560
- Be quiet! 
 - She was just born different.

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,390
- That's right! 
 - I said, be quiet!

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,420
When life is this unfair, what's the point of studying?

21
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,400
- That's right.
 - Stop!

22
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,900
Hey, Kang Joo Eun. Someone wrote your name at the school entrance.

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,980
Ah seriously...

24
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,340
 I love you 

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,620
Don't they know you're supposed to write it in pencil?

26
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,160
Listen up.

27
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,370
Erase them.

28
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,060
You delinquents over there.

29
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,860
- What? 
 - Quit smoking or you won't get any taller.

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,840
Tall— Even if you get taller, quit smoking. You might keep growing.

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,880
- What are you? 
 - The famous daughter,

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,690
Daegu's Venus.

33
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,760
Look at you.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,090
- Pick it up. 
 - Hey.

35
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,690
Since everyone likes you, you can't see straight (are conceited).

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,520
What can't I see straight? I can see this well!

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,960
Kang Joo Eun.

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,470
That's right. I'm Kang Joo Eun. So what?

39
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,460
See what happens if you smoke here again.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,720
- I think you'll be in huge trouble. 
 - Huh?

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,840
Ah, this thing.

42
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,290
Stop getting so heated or your ice cream will melt.

43
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,560
Let's go.

44
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,630
What's with him? Did he not smoke?

45
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,740
Thank you, Venus.

46
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,180
Wonderful, beautiful, fantastic!

47
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,980
Your mom gave birth to you so you could become Miss Korea.

48
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,680
No. My mom says I should just study.

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,490
No, no, no!

50
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,260
Your face is not made for studying.

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,580
So, I am very busy right now.

52
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,560
Oh. Miss Kang Joo Eun. Wouldn't you like to change your life?

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,430
I have no special complaints about my life.

54
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,500
And... Straight hair suits me better.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,440
Then.

56
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,760
Oh. Oh my God!

57
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,030
I'm sure she's Miss Korea. What will you become otherwise?

58
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,000
 Lawyer! I can become one! 

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,350
You can't study well this way. Here.

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,410
Thanks.

61
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,910
You have your finals soon, right? You can just look at this.

62
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,880
Oppa. Because of me, you keep studying just the basics.

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,030
Oh? Joo Eun, no.

64
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,860
I think the basics is what studying is all about.

65
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,480
When you're working this hard to get into law school,

66
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,100
what else is there we can do for you except this?

67
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,180
Joo Eun, I've written out everything to help you with your English.

68
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,490
I wish I could do it for you.

69
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,730
Silence.

70
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,710
Your dream is to become a lawyer,

71
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,760
and you went to Jooan Elementary School, Middle School, and now you're in your second year of Jooan High School,

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,010
Kang Joo Eun?

73
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,460
That's right. I'm Kang Joo Eun. Why?

74
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,540
- You know me, right? 
 - Should I?

75
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,660
Are you famous? Are you in a textbook?

76
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,250
So far, I'm only at the mid-Joseon era. Whereabouts do you appear?

77
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,720
I'm in the papers.

78
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
I attend a nearby sports high school. At least,

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,350
I'm a member of the national swimming team,

80
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,330
and recently I took part in the world competition of young swimmers as a national representative.

81
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,380
- No, I'm on my way back from it! 
 - Oh, I am so sorry.

82
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,950
I should have had a bouquet of flowers ready for you.

83
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,790
- I came from Seoul. 
 - Don't lie.

84
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,310
The recent swimming competition was held in France—

85
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,860
Not that—

86
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,330
I thought your wish was to speak with a Seoul dialect...

87
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,840
I was scouted from Seoul and came here.

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,090
By any chance, did you read the Ceci magazine?

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Only little girls read that!

90
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,090
Your dimples are pretty.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,070
Oh, if someone heard you, they'll think you're flirting with me.

92
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,360
I don't know very well but it's probably something I can only say just once.

93
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,410
Since there's only one first love for a man.

94
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,990
 1999 FINA World Youth Athletic Championships 

95
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,760
Kang Joo Eun,

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,370
from now on you're my first love.

97
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,680
Using a Seoul dialect is not very easy.

98
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,800
It's probably as hard as becoming a lawyer.

99
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,380
No. I can do anything if I set my mind to it.

100
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,590
I'm Kang Joo Eun.

101
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,800
Then why don't you set your mind to me too?

102
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,280
1999 → 2014, Seoul

103
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,940
 It was true. I was Kang Joo Eun who could accomplish anything  I set my mind to. 

104
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,690
You came?

105
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,060
- Hyeon Jung, please bring some tea. 
 - Yes.

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,890
Have a seat.

107
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,020
 I thought that if I became a lawyer, my life and world peace would be guaranteed, 

108
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,120
 but it was all lies. 

109
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,790
 Life gets worse and worse, 

110
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,770
 and it's true that dreams can come true. 

111
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,840
 That fact is true, but...  

112
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,250
 I could be left with no clothes that fit me. That is the reality. 

113
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,120
This is the swimmer, right?

114
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,680
But who is this woman next to him?

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,220
 It's true he's a swimmer. 

116
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,320
 His name is Im Woo Sik, a boyfriend of 15 years as well as my first love. 

117
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,810
 The woman next to him is... me! 

118
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,630
Isn't that putting one's neck into a nose?

119
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,690
It's putting one's neck into a noose.

120
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,420
Why is she blaming me when she asked for it?

121
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,850
What in the world lasts forever?

122
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,520
It's natural for love and woman to decay over time.

123
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,570
Men are all the same, right?

124
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,670
They like it if it's pretty and like it even more when it's young and pretty.

125
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,340
Isn't that so?

126
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,540
Well, it's true there's a higher chance.

127
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,200
Is she amateur?

128
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,390
Who leaves evidence of their love affairs?

129
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,810
She just got pissed off since she's using all the excuses and getting a divorce.

130
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,550
If that's the case, it looks like you're taking all the blame.

131
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,370
That's what I'm saying!

132
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,680
Oh! Is the adultery law being abolished?

133
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,860
It's not like I have some guilty feelings or anything.

134
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,430
I'm not an assemblyman, so...

135
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,920
She eventually lost her husband to a glamorous woman and couldn't even get alimony.

136
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,000
She should've got a more expensive lawyer.

137
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,980
- So... 
 - Yes.

138
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,950
That glamorous woman is me.

139
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,060
That ex-wife accused me so I'm going to sue her back

140
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,430
for false accusation, damaging my reputation, insulting me, spreading false information, violating human rights...

141
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,230
Violating privacy! Put whatever is possible.

142
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,340
Settlements? Never, absolutely never!

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,420
I'll call you after reviewing the files.

144
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,890
But then, the other side also seems to feel wronged, so...

145
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,930
How about thinking about it

146
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,880
- once more—
- It seems, you got me all wrong.

147
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm not a person to reconsider.

148
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,290
You have to win unconditionally.

149
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,690
When you eat a lot of sweets, it's a major sign of stress.

150
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,010
I guess you didn't know.

151
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,870
But, it releases the stress...

152
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,510
What do you mean? You get stressed a lot by gaining weight.

153
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,390
The flowers have wilted.

154
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,640
They haven't

155
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,080
died off yet.

156
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,160
Give them some water.

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,550
 I seriously almost hit her! 

158
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,780
Karma, poetic justice, what are they even doing?

159
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,470
The person who had an affair with that young glamorous woman is our CEO's "friend."

160
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,310
Hyeon Jung, does a lawyer really have to go this far?

161
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,200
You're doing it because you're a lawyer.

162
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,850
Don't you know his motto?

163
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,800
That's right!

164
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,170
How can a lawyer not know when her secretary knows?

165
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,040
CEO.

166
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,960
If you want to gossip about it, you should at least do a good job in maintaining security.

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,180
It's not that.

168
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,100
I think Kim Mi Jin's case is a bit unjustifiable.

169
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,360
Oh, unjustifiable?

170
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,940
Unjustifiable!  Unjustifiable again?

171
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,070
What is this being utterly unreasonable in the law firm?

172
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,640
This unjustifiable, that unjustifiable.

173
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,430
You always go on with that conscience and moral duty.

174
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,590
Oh my. Look here Lawyer Kang.

175
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,230
If that conscience and moral duty were always applied, we'd all starve and die!

176
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,810
It's not just about conscience and moral duty.
We're still lawyers.

177
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,190
How can we do unfair harm to an innocent person?

178
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh-ho, this girl, really.

179
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,310
It's illegal to choose customers to be on the taxi.

180
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,500
A lawyer is a legal law service job.

181
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,340
I frequently told you that.

182
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,370
Your dream and hope? Attain it with your own money.

183
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,890
Don't try to attain them while getting salaries from others.

184
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,590
Finish this matter as a priority!

185
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,750
CEO. Excuse me, CEO.

186
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,000
Lawyer.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,410
You said you still have 14 months worth of loans!

188
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,710
"Do you know why the past is important to us?"

189
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,720
"It's because the past is the lesson for today."

190
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,420
 Wow.
2012 

191
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,940
 Who even looks at this? 

192
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,010
Moving the desk on purpose.

193
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,270
If you want to start your own, you can always tell me.

194
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,440
I will send you a big flower pot.

195
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,440
 2014
LA 

196
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,830
 Hollywood's biggest troublemaker, Anna Sue. 

197
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,830
 Yet another scandal. The girl is crazy. She has some problems. 

198
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,500
 Yes, definitely. 

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,390
 Well let's talk about this as we go through this paparazzi... 

200
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,040
 Very young kid, now star of the Stella Show 

201
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,730
 Before Jennifer Anderson met trainer John Kim,
 she was almost hopeless. 

202
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,750
 But he turned her into a queen of queens, and sent a hopeful message to women all over the world. 

203
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,900
 The very John Kim, this hero of the Stella Show,  is now engulfed in a scandal. 

204
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,960
 Person on the other end? 

205
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,260
 It's Anna Sue, Hollywood's infamous troublemaker  with a merciless tongue and problems with MJ. 

206
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,330
 Sources say John Kim is an Asian man in his thirties, 
and that's all we know. 

207
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,990
 You know I'm really hoping for the couple. John Kim, 

208
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,880
 He's such a great guy, and, you know, we all want to root for his relationship. 

209
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,620
 Shame on Anna Sue... 

210
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:54,300


211
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,980
 Anna Sue 

212
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
 Anna Sue 

213
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,760
 It's something I found out after becoming a lawyer. 

214
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,210
 Lawyers' work is usually something like this. 

215
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,180
 With this case, a plaintiff's deputy starts a defending speech like this. 

216
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,070
 It starts with "I". 

217
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,000
 For example, "Do you think I haven't tried going on a diet?" 

218
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,220
 Something like this? 

219
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,250
 I even followed some power blogger's method by eating only bananas, lettuce, tofu. 

220
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,780
 Alias, One Food. 

221
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,790
 It was excessive and there were side effects. 

222
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,380
 The method of one actress known for her overall beauty? 

223
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,100
Do you have raspberry tea?

224
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,230
We don't.

225
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,770
 Pass.  So you don't.

226
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,970
 This one glamorous sexy celebrity's method. 

227
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,440
 Relaxing lower-body bathing and full bathing each day. 

228
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,700
 And of course, the standard method that everyone knows. 

229
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,920
 Constant exercise and a sufficient amount of sleep. 

230
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,570
 Sufficient amount of sleep. 

231
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,610
 Also more importantly, a stress-free and positive heart. 

232
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes.

233
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,230
Please continue.

234
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,170
"You can just blab all you want, it's none of my business"? 
 Is that what it is? 

235
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,320
No... It's not that...

236
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,030
 Anyway, when dieting becomes pointless, 

237
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,940
 unfortunately, this yo-yo effect comes with it. 

238
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,860
 This annoying yo-yo ruins everything. 

239
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,090
 Joo Eun &amp; Woo Sik
15-year Anniversary ♥ 

240
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,180
 My Woo Sik ♥ 

241
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,510
 Where are you? 

242
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,170
 Haven't you finished working yet? 

243
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,950
 Your dimples are pretty. 

244
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,940
 My Woo Sik ♥ 

245
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,570
Yeah, what?

246
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,820
 I have something to tell you. 

247
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,380
I know. I know that place as well.

248
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,070
Yeah.

249
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,130
 I'm not going to kneel, okay? 

250
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,340
 If you did, I would have taken it off. 

251
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,990
 That's a relief. This is an expensive ring. 

252
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,390
 What day is today? 

253
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,650
 Today? It's December 23rd. 

254
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,810
 Starting today it's day 1, okay? 

255
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,420
Thirty carats. As if. Who am I, Elizabeth Taylor?

256
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,400
Still, I'm your friend. I was a total believer.

257
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,110
 If he made you wait 15 years, Woo Sik, he should do that much for you! 

258
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,850
Did he age me the 15 years?

259
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,610
Listen to you with your bullshit.

260
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,870
Let's just call your being old as par for the course, but what about the weight?

261
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,960
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you?

262
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,110
I am a Western type glamour style.

263
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,080
Whenever I mention your weight and success you always bringing up glamorous style.

264
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,690
Bad natured kids will misunderstand that a divorcee is jealous.

265
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,750
A divorcee that runs the business of a debt ridden spinster?

266
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,220
What kind of world is it these days that—

267
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,590
This is the day that the debt ridden spinster gets proposed to.

268
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,310
- Stop spoiling my good day and hang up. 
- Don't like it too much!

269
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't know if it's because you've gained weight but your heart has gotten bigger too. You're so emotional.

270
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,660
Oh, hang up the phone.

271
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,360
Anyway, you're just getting what you're supposed to get so don't overdo it, okay?

272
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,910
Oh no. What do I do?

273
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,040
It seems to have fallen.

274
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,100
- Use mine. 
 - Excuse me?

275
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,150
Oh, no. It seems like a new one.

276
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,030
I have many.

277
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,400
Then. Thank you.

278
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,080
 Black is a color that appears to make you look slim 

279
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,860
 but it doesn't make you slim, damn it. 

280
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm here.

281
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,870
Oh, you're here.

282
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,500
You said that you were so busy that you didn't even have the time to check your KaTalk messages. What's the occasion?

283
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,940
No matter how busy I am I have to do what I should.

284
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,040
Today is our 15th Anniversary.

285
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,720
I couldn't reach you by phone the last few days because you were planning this.

286
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,010
Over here.

287
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,570
Why are you doing this? So embarrassingly?

288
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,170
To our 15th Anniversary.

289
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,910
I was thankful all this time.

290
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:30,350

291
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,430
 Starting today it's day 1, okay? 

292
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,510
 It's an expensive ring so that's a relief. 

293
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,540
It's my heart.

294
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,050
Accept it.

295
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,910
Why is your heart

296
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,670
over here?

297
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,340
I'm really sorry that it happened this way, Joo Eun.

298
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,980
So I'm asking why your heart is over here?

299
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,890
- What used to be on your finger... 
 - Joo Eun.

300
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,080
What exactly is this?

301
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,520
I seem too much like a rat bastard. That's why.

302
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,150
That's why.

303
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,320
So if you gave me wine and a flower bouquet you would seem less like a rat bastard?

304
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,630
Don't fool around and hurry up and give over the ring.

305
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,210
Just accept my heart that wanted to take care of our 15th Anniversary.

306
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,140
- I'm sorry Joo Eun. 
 - What is this guy saying, Im Woo Sik?

307
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,730
Are you crazy? Are you mad?

308
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,770
Why is "I'm sorry" coming out at the timing of marriage.

309
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,750
Joo Eun.

310
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,810
- Let's...
 - Shut up.

311
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,570
- Joo Eun, I- 
 - I understand so shut up.

312
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,780
- What do you understand?! 
- The meaning of this ring.

313
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,270
And with what feeling you're returning this ring.

314
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,050
Between the you at the time you gave me this ring,

315
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,420
and the you who is returning this ring, I know how different you are.

316
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,350
I understand.

317
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,030
But Woo Sik

318
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,970
I'm too tired tonight so let's do it all later.

319
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,550
- Hey, hey, Kang Joo Eun. 
 - Oh, please!

320
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,940
Breaking up and dating, breaking up and dating,

321
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,610
through the fighting and all the bullshit, and even through the most fruitful years, it's 15 years now.

322
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know if you've forgotten completely but I'm Kang Joo Eun.

323
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,150
I, Kang Joo Eun, am first love to you, Im Woo Sik.

324
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,950
So... through this kind of one-sided declaration?

325
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,970
It's not going to be so easy.

326
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,170
You wanted to take care of my 15th anniversary for me?

327
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,120
What did you do until it became 15 years for me?

328
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,530
Congratulations.

329
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,680
♬  Baby only you,  ♬

330
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,700
♬  The one and only you,  ♬
 - Joo Eun.

331
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:07,260
♬  You're my darling, You're my darling, You're my love,  ♬

332
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:15,800
  ♫ The one who didn't know love, that's you br&gt;The one who fell for that, that's me ♫  

333
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,840
♬  Without my even knowing, falling you,  ♬

334
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,710
 Would there be, somewhere in the legal code that I memorized to death, 

335
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,180
 some way to make me understand this situation right now? 

336
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,390
 I don't know if everyone may be equal in front of the law, 

337
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,660
 but not in front of the mirror. 

338
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,150
♬  I'm the person who can embrace your envious hurts for you,  ♬

339
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,950
 Drink Raspberry to get thin! 

340
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,030
 Would you give up on life? Could you give up on life 

341
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,400
 just because you had a bitter taste of failure? 

342
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,060
 Would you give up on life, as a woman, just because you're fat  

343
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,100
 or you've aged? Ladies and gentlemen. 

344
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,830
 Today, I'd like to introduce to you a woman who is 

345
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,000
 reborn. She is... 

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,570
 Forget the past. She is 

347
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,580
 not the woman who failed in marriage or wrecked her life 

348
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,860
 with drugs and alcohol. 

349
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,420
 Now I give you 

350
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,080
 the reborn 

351
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,580
 queen of queens. 

352
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,100
 Jennifer Anderson. 

353
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,760
 Who could have made this possible? 

354
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,660
 In truth, John Kim made Jennifer 

355
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,330
 and he completed her. 

356
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,880
 She's really beautiful. 

357
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,850
 Jennifer. John Kim, who was able to help her rediscover her lost past and smile.  

358
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,180
 This is everything we know about John Kim. 

359
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,680
 The John Kim whose face we don't even know. 

360
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,610
 Why are we going wild about that man? 

361
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,690
 Who could he possibly be? 

362
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,570
One. One, two.

363
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,300
Raise the leg.

364
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
Relax your shoulders.

365
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,380
You're doing well.

366
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,520
Fight!

367
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,450
One, two.

368
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,470
Come.

369
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,290
Yes, Hyeon Woo.

370
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,410
  Hello? Are you Joo Eun? You have time, right? At the practice area... 

371
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,930
I must be crazy.

372
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,080
You slept, right?

373
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,270
- If you're taking the plane, get me some eye cream at the cosmetic store. 
- HANG UP!

374
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,720
Eye cream! Not ice cream. That's what you like.

375
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,140
Hello? Joo Eun.

376
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,420
I wonder how the proposal went...

377
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,020
Is that why she slept until late?

378
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,510
 Please go on a trip to America. 

379
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,690
 Just over the weekend. 

380
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,180
 I'm coming! I'm here! 

381
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,180
 Hyung! 

382
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,250
Yeah. I'm getting washed.

383
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes.

384
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,190
Hyung Yeong Ho, the steak is burning.

385
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,310
- Turn it over.
- Turn it over.

386
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,210
It's over.

387
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,340
Akira got a lot better.

388
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,860
Hyung! The sweet potatoes are burning.

389
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,000
- Flip them. 
- Flip them.

390
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,200
- What time is it? 
- It's the night plane.

391
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh my God! "Anna Sue neither denying nor admitting to the scandal."

392
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,760
Dating rumors?

393
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,350
 What?! John Kim?! Really, WHO is he? 

394
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,390
What should we do, Hyung?

395
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,160
Wow. The visual is totally perfect.

396
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,190
You really suit each other.

397
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,650
This is a big deal. If Koreans found out about this...

398
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,990
They just do what they want.

399
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,800
The one with the long tail is the one at fault, not the one who stepped on it.

400
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
What are you thinking of doing?

401
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,870
Let me think about why it's darker under the lamp. 
(People don`t realize what's right under their nose)

402
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,530
Anyway, tomorrow's work is for tomorrow.

403
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,110
No. No. No. It's not work. Scandal.

404
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,180
You little...

405
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,410
Hello?

406
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,970
Yeah. Korean Snake manager right here...

407
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,260
What about our luggage?

408
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,620
I sent them off already, and packed what needs to be carried.

409
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,330
You were always this way...

410
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,480
Be careful of your body.

411
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,070
You opened wide the gates of hell, and you're worrying about others?

412
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,210
Right.

413
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,300
You're not young anymore, and your opponent is very young.  You know that, right?

414
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,660
You're not going to come before the match?

415
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,660
As a sponsor and a coach,

416
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,810
I pampered and raised you to be a champion.

417
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,220
You look like you have a complaint.

418
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,610
I'm acting cute.

419
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,650
Come on, let's fight.

420
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,470
 Manager Min 

421
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,330
Yes, Manager Min.

422
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,400
What?

423
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,460
I'm doing fine.

424
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,950
Yes, then.

425
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,920
He called to check up on me, but I feel uneasy.

426
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,410
Did the Korean elders find out?

427
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,890
If so, he would've chased the people out or he would've been chased.

428
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,050
If you try to act cute, you're dead.

429
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,990
 Do they think America is like Gyeonggido? 

430
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,360
 So they told you to come as soon as you arrived? 

431
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,640
 Wow, your boss is really something. 

432
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,690
My stomach has been hurting.

433
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,630
Did I get indigestion?

434
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,250
Oh, that's good. If your stomach doesn't feel well, you'll lose weight.

435
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,640
That has some effect.

436
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,020
My stomach feels bubbly.

437
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,890
It really hurts.

438
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,450
It's better than your body being weak. It's fine!

439
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,820
I'm glamorous.

440
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,820
 Then just live in America, then.  It's full of glamor types everywhere. 

441
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,290
 Oh yeah! What happened with Woo Sik? 

442
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,820
 Did he give you the ring? How much did he spend? 

443
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,620
He gave me something very expensive.

444
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,410
Let's talk about when I go back.

445
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,440
Miss Lawyer. Should I go get you?

446
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,600
No thanks. I won't forget your eye cream, Min Joon's dermatitis lotion,

447
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,070
and Min Joon's grandma's scarf.

448
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,710
I'm hanging up.

449
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,260
 You're in America, right? Give me a call when you get back. 

450
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,440
Did Min Joon's field trip go well?

451
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,340
You should have sent me some pictures.

452
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,090
The field trip is next week.

453
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,710
My ex-wife has a lot of interest in her ex-husband.

454
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,460
Of course, since that's where the child support comes from.

455
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,910
Does my ex-wife know John Kim?

456
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,740
Korea is an internet-savvy nation.

457
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,990
The customers are even saying stuff.

458
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,680
As expected, bringing up the issues that draw in the public.

459
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,940
That's a producer's instinct.

460
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,130
That calls for a hundred exclamation marks.

461
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,600
Sheesh, look at that!  "Just who is he, what is the truth?"

462
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,000
They have the drive but no facts.

463
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,810
News these days has no impact either.

464
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,590
I'm going.

465
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,530
Just deposit it automatically.

466
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,880
Do you think divorce is something to brag about, that you would carry the child support around?

467
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,610
Do you think child support is a bill?

468
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,140
 The champion was an orphan!!  Korean Snake! 

469
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,870
Let's go!

470
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,950
Who would see you as a Harvard student?

471
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,560
I always wear this Harvard shirt though.

472
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,930
Exactly. You should put it in the trunk.

473
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,770
No!

474
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,270
The airplane is cold. I'm hungry.

475
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,550
Eat something on the way.

476
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,450
Thank you.

477
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,550
Hey ma'am. We are people who had to meet by fate.

478
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,660
- Excuse me?
- Destiny.

479
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,900
Oh, nice face.

480
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,690
Thank you.

481
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,890
Omo, omo.

482
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,140
It's okay. I'm a gentleman.

483
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,690
I feel so bad towards your traveling companion. This is an expensive seat...

484
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,450
It's nothing. Travel comfortably.

485
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,560
Thank you so much.

486
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,580
Oh, you scared me.

487
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,670
 Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop! 

488
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,710
 Winner! 

489
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,570
Korean Steak?

490
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:01,620
No! Korean Snake. Jang Joon Seong.

491
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,170
He's a total champion.

492
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,630
- Ah, Korean Snake.
- Yeah.

493
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,790
Are you a professional athlete?

494
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm manager and trainer.

495
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,250
It's a little weird for me to say it myself,

496
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,380
but I'm a bit famous.

497
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,360
 When are you coming? I need to see you. 

498
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,820
 You're in America, right? Call me when you get back. 

499
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,670
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but can I have one more blanket?

500
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,730
Yes, I'll prepare it for you.

501
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,540
Wear this.

502
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,830
Ah, I'm okay.

503
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm also okay.

504
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,020
Here.

505
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,710
Okay, just for a bit.

506
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,190
You... You look really cute in the fur.

507
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,270
 We are flying through a turbulent area. 

508
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:33,390
 Since there is a lot of turbulence, please stay in your seats and fasten your seat belts. 

509
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,420
 This is your captain speaking. Our flight is now... 

510
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,870
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

511
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,730
 Thank you. 

512
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,710
 Ladies and gentlemen. 

513
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,750
 Right now, there is an emergency patient. 

514
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,660
 If there are any passengers in the medical field, please notify the flight attendants. 

515
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,530
 Announcement to all passengers. We have an emergency. 

516
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,730
I was going to surprise him.

517
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,410
- Oh, Hyung!
- If you're surprised, then it's fine.

518
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,780
You can't take off your seatbelt.  Right now, the airplane is—

519
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,910
Where is the patient?

520
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,540
Why Korea, all of a sudden?

521
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,320
It's the last place they'll search.

522
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,790
Ma'am! Ma'am, come to your senses!

523
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,090
- Ma'am!
- Ji Woong.

524
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,200
Hyung, how are you here?

525
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,570
Did you see her eat anything?

526
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,920
- She didn't eat anything. Just coffee and some medicine.
- What kind of medicine?

527
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,790
It hurts.

528
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,880
- Hyung, how did you get here?
- Hurry.

529
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,920
Okay, okay, okay.  Coffee, some medication that I don't know the name of, and wine.

530
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,430
I-I-I don't know.  Save our Ma'am.

531
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,200
What should we do? An emergency ...

532
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,070
And some IV solution and a hot pack too— No, bring whatever you have.

533
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,410
Yes.

534
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,160
This ahjumma...

535
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,450
Does she have a bag?

536
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,300
Here it is.

537
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,350
Ah, it hurts!

538
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,730
Save me. Please save me.

539
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,130
We need to move her, but her size is not easy to handle.

540
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,180
A stretcher...

541
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,250
- Joon Seong.
- Should I carry her on my back?

542
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,710
That's dangerous. You'll throw your back out.  It's better to lift her.

543
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,830
- Now. At the count of three.
- Okay.

544
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,860
One, two, three.

545
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,030
Hold on. Again. Hold on.

546
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,970
One, two.

547
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,800
- You can't come in here. I apologize.
- What?

548
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,730
Hyung! Fighting!

549
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,950
Take good care of Ma'am!

550
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,270
- For now, put your seatbelt on.
- Okay.

551
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,090
If you need me.

552
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,780
I did inform the captain that there is a medical emergency situation.

553
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,160
- Please stand and hold up a blanket.
- Excuse me?

554
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,120
- I need to take her clothes off.
- Ah, yes.

555
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,690
Since I'm in a bit of a hurry.

556
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,970
What is this?

557
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,260
Ah, I'm going to have to spank it a bit.

558
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,630
Ah, this won't do.

559
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,970
This is going to sting.

560
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,130
Please hold this.

561
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,000
- Joon Seong.
- Yes?

562
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,790
The left side.

563
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,960
It looks like she's in shock.

564
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,670
She's too cold.

565
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:04,420


566
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,350
Who are you?

567
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,470
Where am I?

568
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:33,270
Probably somewhere in the middle of the atmosphere. 
 It's obviously not heaven.

569
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,190
Who... Who did this to me?

570
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,450
Your "thank you" sounds perfunctory to me.

571
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:51,630
Excuse me, but can the person who put this in please take it out?

572
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,230
How long should I keep pressing down on it?

573
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,890
Excuse me, but what should I do if it keeps bleeding?

574
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,730
Unlike the way you look, you really value your body.

575
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,750
Oh, hey. Just stay put.

576
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,290
You're probably not wearing much, since I ripped it all off.

577
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,120
What?

578
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,980
Pardon me, but I'm really curious.

579
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,140
Why did you do it?

580
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,940
What do you mean?

581
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,600
You were drinking on the flight.

582
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,900
You took caffeine and sleeping pills.

583
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,040
Ah, that...

584
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,570
Diet pills with unclear ingredients,

585
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,780
and even an abdominal support belt.

586
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,150
Oh my. Why are you doing that with another person's body?

587
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,180
I mean, you even went through another person's bag.

588
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,820
- Isn't that a bit impolite on a first meeting?
- Shhhhh...

589
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,130
Do you realize the reason you're lying in first class is because of an in-flight emergency situation?

590
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:24,660
I did look in your bag since you weren't able to respond, but since it's our first time meeting, I did think it was rude—

591
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,770
I didn't expect that.

592
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,370
I'm not saying that I'm not grateful.

593
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,950
Should I just open the door and go out?

594
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:42,180
By chance, did I save a person that wanted to die?

595
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,360
What did you say?

596
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,710
If not, then why would you do that to your body?

597
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,120
On an empty stomach, at that, and on an airplane.

598
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,990
I mean, would a person who wanted to die take pills with unclear ingredients to lose weight?

599
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,720
- Look here, Ahjumma.
- Omo, omo, omo.

600
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,050
You seem like a single lady, but if you want to lose weight, sweat it out.

601
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,960
Don't needlessly starve yourself and take weird pills, or use abdominal support belts.

602
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,530
Excuse me, I'm thankful that you saved me,

603
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,010
but I don't want to reveal my private life.

604
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,040
Since you're the first woman whose clothes I took off five minutes after meeting,

605
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,990
I felt too comfortable.  I acknowledge that.

606
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,800
I folded the abdominal support belt nicely and put it in your bag.

607
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,410
Oh my, I'm so grateful.

608
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,920
I shouldn't file a claim for damages, since you saved me.

609
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,470
And one more thing, it's not an abdominal support belt, but a corset.

610
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,500
It's just that I've never ripped anything like that before.  I'm sorry.

611
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,780
Don't mention it.  I want to repay your kindness,

612
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,210
but it would be really nice if I could do it without looking at your face.

613
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,120
Excuse me.

614
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,780
Excuse me.

615
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:12,180
If you really feel like that, there is a way.

616
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,000
What is it?

617
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,290
What do you mean, he hasn't come out?  What happened?

618
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,500
We were contacted not long ago, but we did double check the list of passengers that boarded the plane.

619
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,250
If not here, then from where would a passenger who boarded the plane come out?

620
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,670
Yes, Chairman.

621
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,970
No, I'm certain that he arrived.

622
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,010
I'll contact you after I look into it.

623
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,540
 Seoul One Heart Hospital to the Emergency Room. 

624
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,940
 I should have just opened the airplane door and left earlier. 

625
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,590
 I don't know well, but it's probably something I won't be able to say twice 

626
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,080
 because there's only one first love for a man. 

627
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,400
 You're in the U.S., right? Make sure to call me when you get back. 

628
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,200
 Make sure to call me when you get back. 

629
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,250
 When are you coming? I need to see you. 

630
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,110
 When are you coming? I need to see you. 

631
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,500
 From today onward you're my first love. 

632
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,290
 Your luggage? 

633
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,430
 It didn't come from the airport. 

634
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,270
Oh! Oh! Patient!

635
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,320
See you later.

636
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,440
I know it's rude but it's because I'm really curious.

637
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,720
Who are you talking to?

638
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,560
Excuse me!

639
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,390
By chance, do you have any thoughts of returning to the hospital?

640
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,920
Get in then.

641
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Want me to get out and open the door?

642
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,270
I think that I might be safer than this roadway.

643
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,560
Enter your address and secure your seat belt.

644
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,190
Ah.

645
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,090
 Your voice-guided directions will commence...for your safety... 

646
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,940
I thought a few days ago that  that  day was the worst day of my life.

647
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,890
It must not have been.

648
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,530
It's today.

649
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,420
Are you acting like this because I had you ride an ambulance?

650
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,860
- That's just— 
 - You must have had your own circumstances.

651
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,690
I don't expect your understanding,

652
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,530
but even I have my own circumstances so don't look at me too strangely—

653
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,980
I won't look at you.

654
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:46,640
Right. Even if not today, make sure to go back to the hospital.

655
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,380
Your temperature is too low compared to your inherent size.

656
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,760
 Arrived at the destination... 

657
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,860
You can stop here.

658
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:15,910
If the greeting of "goodbye" were to be the last words, I think that would be sufficient carfare.

659
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,310
You don't give a person the space to be thankful.

660
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,080
Well anyway, I am indebted to you.

661
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,980
I suppose this will be our last greeting. Goodbye.

662
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,140
Ah... It's all wet.

663
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:59,000
 LOSIR ==&gt; LOSER 
Desert &amp;Tea Boutique 

664
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,570
 I thought that if I just believed in myself 

665
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:21,720
 I was the Kang Joo Eun that could do anything. That's what I thought. 

666
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,910
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

667
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,320
Excuse me!

668
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,890
Excuse me! Excuse me!

669
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,920
Excuse me.

670
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,150
Please save me! Why are you doing this? Don't do this. Just this once.

671
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,950
This woman only asks me to save her when she sees me

672
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,010
when she's not even going to be thankful.

673
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,500


674
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:24,000
♬ She is my beautiful, beautiful lady  ♬

675
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,270
♬  Even seeing you again and again, you're beautiful ♬

676
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,600
♬  You're my beautiful, beautiful lady  ♬
