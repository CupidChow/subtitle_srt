1
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,112
That friend told me...

2
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:12,635
...I was either...

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,039
...lonely or in pain.

4
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:19,611
Or both.

5
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,816
"Episode 3"

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,835
Ma'am, what brings you here?

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,060
Please swear to tell only the truth.

8
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:52,426
This may be my only chance.

9
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:53,752
What?

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,812
Are you...

11
00:00:57,312 --> 00:00:58,103
...John Kim?

12
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,334
What?

13
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,349
You are John Kim, right?

14
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:15,153
Right.

15
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,046
John Kim.

16
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:24,932
Oh, my gosh. This is insane.

17
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,404
You really are John Kim...

18
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,541
Let's not talk out here. Let's go inside.

19
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,751
Did you just lick my palm?

20
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:49,488
I was talking, but you...

21
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:50,299
Hush!

22
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:54,113
Why do you think
John Kim is a secret trainer?

23
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:59,197
If you tell the world,

24
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,294
it'll defeat the purpose of
why you're here.

25
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:04,390
Why am I here?

26
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,726
If you must hear me say it...

27
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:11,849
There's no need for that.

28
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,062
Anyway, thank you for
the conclusive evidence.

29
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:16,745
John Kim.

30
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:18,247
My gosh, John Kim.

31
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,518
When there is no confession,

32
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:25,367
the court relies
on circumstantial evidence.

33
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,569
For example, you happened to have,

34
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:32,805
an ID from ABC Studios which runs
the "Stella Show".

35
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:36,907
You happened to be a trainer,
just like John Kim.

36
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:41,339
You speak the way the person named
John Kim would've.

37
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,224
Moreover, there happened to be
a companion testimony...

38
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:46,189
...that stated that he is Asian.

39
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:50,560
Three is more than enough,

40
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:53,381
but there are four pieces
of circumstantial evidence.

41
00:02:55,634 --> 00:03:00,439
Your expressions make it more concrete.

42
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:05,975
Please keep in mind that
my best friend's ex-husband,

43
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:10,879
is the producer
of a very famous entertainment show.

44
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:13,304
You happen...

45
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,987
...to be an attorney.

46
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,276
And now you're threatening us?

47
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,082
I'm not threatening you.
It's just a very serious request.

48
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:26,318
If threatening works, though,
I can just go with that.

49
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,138
Okay.

50
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,454
Ma'am. Look.

51
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,541
I'm not John Kim.

52
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,344
No way. No.

53
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,262
Never.

54
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,833
Gosh, John Kim.

55
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,122
-We need to talk.
-I'm not done...

56
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:47,347
I'm sure John Kim knows that
you want to be the next...

57
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:48,640
...Jennifer Anderson.

58
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:52,213
Hands.

59
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:00,582
My Korean attorney is Kang Jooeun too.

60
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:02,988
Jiwoong, you...

61
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:04,628
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,340
I mean...

63
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,936
But who would've thought that
on the plane...

64
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,609
It's unbelievable!

65
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:16,201
I had no idea she had my jacket.

66
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:19,504
So why did you carry around the studio ID?

67
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:22,470
As a souvenir?

68
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:25,610
My legs hurt.

69
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,647
There's no use crying over spilled milk.

70
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,795
What should we do?

71
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:43,525
Yes!

72
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,451
"Faith will move mountains."

73
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,597
Who knew I'd get an opportunity like this?

74
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,362
Thank you.

75
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,681
Mom, I'm full of life.

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,756
What? What did you eat?

77
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:15,727
Woosik is nice to put up with you.

78
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:19,197
The reborn queen of queens.

79
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,340
Kang Jooeun!

80
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,788
-You look great.
-You're beautiful.

81
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:41,655
Oh, my gosh!

82
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,566
Amazing!

83
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:11,829
We have no other choice.

84
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,559
She's isn't the type
to let go of an opportunity.

85
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,719
-Jiwoong.
-What?

86
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:21,391
Who...

87
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:23,579
...are you, again?

88
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,911
I'm... John Kim.

89
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,608
I mean, I am you.

90
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,119
How much weight do you want to lose?

91
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,882
You must have a goal.

92
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,435
I'll tell John Kim alone.

93
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:45,478
Your John Kim is not fluent in Korean.
So, I as the...

94
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:46,664
-The translator.
-He's the team doctor!

95
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,190
Let me introduce myself.

96
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:55,114
I'm Kim Youngho, interpreter and doctor.

97
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,707
I see, Kim Youngho.

98
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,097
But John Kim speaks Korean well.

99
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,366
-John Kim, remember we...
-Right, I am...

100
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:04,541
You know, sometimes
when I get really nervous,

101
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,215
I don't know what to say.

102
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,694
When he gets nervous,
this is how he speaks.

103
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,646
I see.

104
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:14,158
John Kim told me about you,
so I looked you up.

105
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,396
You're a UFC champion?

106
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,131
Well... Yes.

107
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,466
That's so cool.

108
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,247
So the two of you
are in Jang Junseong's team?

109
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,538
From now on,

110
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,664
the three of us will be on your team.

111
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:37,577
Oh, my gosh.

112
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,483
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:43,108
Really?

114
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,484
John Kim.

115
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,791
It's my last supper,
so I'll just have one bite.

116
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,688
Hey.

117
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:32,924
I can tell just by hearing you eat.

118
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,548
-Blood sausage.
-Plus spicy rice cakes.

119
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,264
It's my last supper, so go easy on me.

120
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,994
Gosh, you have so many "last" suppers.

121
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:48,074
What was that chance of a lifetime thing
that you mentioned earlier?

122
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,745
You'll be in danger if you know.

123
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,717
Check for yourself later.

124
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:02,354
Danger?

125
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,823
I'm a divorcee with a kid.

126
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:06,523
What more danger could I be in?

127
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,828
Tell me. You're killing me.

128
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,307
If Producer Ko gets an exclusive,

129
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:13,084
he'll get to pay more for childcare.

130
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:14,702
It came back to life.

131
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,598
Did you stop by here?

132
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,472
I don't even have time
to go to my kid's kindergarten.

133
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,514
Anyway, Hyunwoo.

134
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,292
Minjun's mother.

135
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:31,072
Life must give you a chance
so that you can survive.

136
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,385
Jooeun.

137
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,086
Are you on the balcony?

138
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,673
You want to jump off, don't you?

139
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,694
Should I come over?

140
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:44,924
Come on now.

141
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:46,932
It's just that...

142
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,768
It's a beautiful night.

143
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,335
Gosh, you scared me!

144
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:00,979
Okay then.

145
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,396
Let's do this!

146
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,630
I'm sorry!

147
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,362
It's my fault. Me!

148
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,402
My big brothers.

149
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:38,143
Look what I have.

150
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,370
I shook them like a hundred times.

151
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,294
Shake it. Shake it for you. Shake it.

152
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:45,275
Here. You too. Here.

153
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm taking a beating because of you.

154
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,029
Drink up. Drink.

155
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,841
Yes, Mr. Min.

156
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:58,670
I'm at your house in Nonhyeon-dong.

157
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,635
It'll be done by this afternoon.

158
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,007
You just need to come.

159
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:10,582
Great.

160
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,966
Call me anytime.

161
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,482
I'm counting on you, Lawyer Kang.

162
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,494
-Thank you.
-Bye.

163
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,587
-Hyunjeong. Coffee, please.
-Okay.

164
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,237
As for sugar,

165
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:37,595
-just put one in.
-Pardon?

166
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,566
Are you feeling okay today?

167
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:47,376
Only one sugar?

168
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:49,206
Hyunjeong.

169
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:52,203
Do you know the feeling of being full...

170
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,651
...without even eating?

171
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,703
That's absurd.

172
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,065
Are you going on another diet?

173
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:02,898
Have you heard of...

174
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,613
...John Kim?

175
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:07,195
Are you a fan too?

176
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:11,529
But you don't even know what
he looks like.

177
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,016
Right?

178
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,529
I don't even know what he looks like.

179
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,673
Nobody knows.

180
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,156
Oh, right.

181
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:27,557
-Vice President Oh...
-What about her?

182
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,928
I might have to take up farming.

183
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,851
She keeps asking for organic things.

184
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,492
We'll apply the oil now.

185
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,074
You have such nice skin.

186
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,676
Some people
put a lot of effort in skincare,

187
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,830
but you can't compare that
to people who naturally have good skin.

188
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,348
Is that right?

189
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,702
We're experts.

190
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:56,278
We know if you naturally have good skin.

191
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:00,431
That's not true.

192

"Gahong VIP Body Consulting Center"

193
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:23,382
I guess you're not busy.

194
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,914
I'm doing my job right now.

195
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:30,297
Escorting VIPs is part of my job.

196
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,705
I didn't think I could feel this way.

197
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:39,995
I want you for myself.

198
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,530
I even became jealous of your past.

199
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,712
Stop that.

200
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,838
I'll escort you to your car.

202
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,275
Thank you.

"Boards Office"

204
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,029
I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,190
It was raining.

206
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,360
We rushed them to the hospital,

207
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,738
but Mrs. Kang,

208
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,409
and the driver,

209
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,274
How could this...

210
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,730
I should've looked after her. I'm sorry.

211
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,470
I'll report it to the chairman.

212
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,936
Take care of the funeral arrangement.

213
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,377
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,861
So, Youngho should...

215
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:23,820
No.

216
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,617
He can't be shown to the public yet.

217
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,608
When he becomes able,

218
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,225
to pay respects to his mother...

219
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,158
That time.

220
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:41,864
I'm sorry, sir.

221
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:48,376
Mom.

223
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:55,209
Mom.

224
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,938
You could've just
sent words through Mr. Min.

225
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,205
You're right.

226
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:11,042
You don't like getting involved.

227
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,065
What brought you here?

228
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:20,934
Cancel my resignation at the U.S. branch.

229
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,664
-It's the chairwoman's order.
-You're the head of HR.

230
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,153
Please reassign me.

231
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:35,082
I'm sure you'd prefer that too.

232
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:41,403
If you can't avoid nor enjoy it,
you must accept it. That's life.

233
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:48,822
That is the family motto...

234
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,238
...that you've been benefiting from.

235
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,808
You need to know
that life isn't always sweet.

236
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:07,808
As you know,

237
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:09,640
I never really tasted,

238
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,443
sweetness growing up.

239
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,164
If you'll excuse me.

240
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:20,765
Oh, right.

241
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:24,433
If there is a next time,

242
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,434
I'll make an appointment.

243
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:54,709
What brought you here?

244
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:57,194
Am I not allowed to come here?

245
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,158
Sir.

246
00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:02,579
My resignation was processed already.

247
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,084
Things are messy out there, too.

248
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:11,875
What should I tell the chairwoman?

249
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,982
Tell her I got fired and
have nowhere else to go,

250
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,866
so do something about Mr. Min for me.

251
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:24,911
Tell her to stop being angry
and to answer my calls.

252
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:26,542
Tell her that I miss her.

253
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,187
Okay?

254
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:42,297
You should've told me.

255
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,981
You know she can tell
after just one spoonful.

256
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:50,423
But you seemed exhausted after...

257
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,567
...the memorial preparations yesterday.

258
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,971
How can you always...

259
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:59,161
It's like her medicine. I can't be lazy.

260
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,728
It's porridge.

261
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,931
I'm sorry, Mother.

262
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,440
It's fine.

263
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,303
You must be getting old, too.

264
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,685
It is unlike you to take a nap.

265
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,121
You may go.

266
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:29,881
Okay.

267
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:43,369
Youngho went to his father's office?

268
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,383
Hello.

269
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,434
There won't be any training
at night this week.

270
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,049
Really?

271
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:24,424
I see.

272
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,175
That place will be good.

273
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,471
How do you like the house?

274
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,373
I like it a lot.

275
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:34,284
Thank you.

276
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,115
I love you.

277
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,975
It'll work out somehow.

278
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,469
Let's just live there for the time being.

279
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:43,368
Yes, see you later.

280
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,104
We might not need to go to the gym.

281
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,978
Hey, look at me.

282
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:54,530
Kim Jiwoong!

283
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,086
Oh, man. J to the K.

284
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,017
I'm John Kim.

285
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:12,808
Who would park like this?

286
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:24,934
Was it you?

287
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:28,267
Didn't you save my number?

288
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,926
You haven't given me your business card.

289
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,846
You are supposed to know
your superior's number.

290
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:37,614
Save my number while I move my car.

291
00:22:09,992 --> 00:22:11,061
Get out.

292
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,815
Get out of the car.

293
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,361
What's the point of having a luxury car?

294
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:41,488
You can't even maneuver it.

295
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,488
You maneuver it so well.

296
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,377
Too bad this is not your car.

297
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:48,103
Hey.

298
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:49,611
Hey.

299
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:53,041
Hey!

300
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:01,084
Since she is an attorney,

301
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,703
she will keep her word, right?

302
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:04,886
I hope she will.

303
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,603
But I can't trust her.

304
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:08,711
Excuse me.

305
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:11,834
Ma'am.

306
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,733
Did you hear her voice?

307
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,051
It sounds too innocent.

308
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,638
Where can I change my clothes?

309
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:25,407
Goodness.

310
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:27,543
Why is this small?

311
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:31,407
Have I gained more weight?

312
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,272
This is driving me crazy.

313
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:39,701
Jiwoong.

314
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,288
You need to be strong.

315
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,177
Make her work until she gives up, okay?

316
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,018
-That's the best way for us.
-Okay.

317
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:47,879
John Kim.

318
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:59,129
We're not curious. Just come out.

319
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,629
I only need John Kim.

320
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:04,159
I don't need all of you here.

321
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,080
We work as a team and
John Kim can't speak Korean well.

322
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:09,453
Yes. I...

323
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,874
I can't speak Korean well.

324
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,752
Come on, baby.

325
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,119
Well... I'll lose weight in no time.

326
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,749
You'd better start as soon as possible.

327
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:31,138
John Kim.

328
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:33,229
Ma'am.

329
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:38,633
Jang Junseong.

330
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:40,323
Kim Youngho.

331
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:43,697
John Kim.

332
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,013
"Geontu Law Firm,
Attorney Kang Jooeun"

333
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:46,925
It'll replace my introduction.

334
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:48,890
So,

335
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,107
what should I do first,

336
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,563
John Kim?

337
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:56,923
From now on, we'll start
John Kim's training.

338
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,060
Follow my moves.

339
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,491
Down.

340
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:09,911
A little more.

341
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,118
Junseong.

342
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,524
What is he doing?

343
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,256
Sorry, we were just doing the stretching.

344
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,625
You can start now.

345
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,801
Do I need to do a lap?

346
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,720
You need to keep doing that lap.

347
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,366
Over and over again.

348
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:55,776
Go.

349
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:15,940
Come on, up.

350
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:18,925
Come on!

351
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,046
This is an advanced version of...

352
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:24,363
...an exercise that helps build muscles.

353
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,800
It looks so hard.

354
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,895
They must be crazy to do those things.

355
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:32,093
They're crazy.

356
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:33,288
My goodness.

357
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,553
You can take a shower if you want to
and go home.

358
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,442
The door will be locked automatically.

359
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:56,082
"See you tomorrow, man."

360
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,017
This is what John Kim said.

361
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,125
I want to turn back time...

362
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,601
...so badly.

363
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:11,335
Do I want to travel in a time machine...

364
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,495
...that's impossible in real life?

365
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:17,817
However, I'm Kang Jooeun.

366
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,174
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

367
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,229
"A good beginning is half the battle."

368
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,722
I hope that is true.

369
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,411
Aren't you cold?

370
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:03,169
Didn't you call me for this?

371
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,586
I went on a diet for this.

372
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:15,601
I've seen you now so just wear this.

373
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,124
They turned off the heater.
You'll be freezing.

374
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:20,497
I'm not cold at all.

375
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:25,035
By the way, I can't swim.

376
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,240
I've never gone swimming before.

377
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,928
Even if I am retired now,

378
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:34,746
I used to compete for the national team.

379
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,531
It doesn't make sense
that my girlfriend can't swim.

380
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,949
I taught Jooeun how to...

381
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:46,595
Will you make that face
whenever you talk about her?

382
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,904
I don't like this face at all.

383
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,050
Let's not force ourselves.

384
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,472
We can forget the past
only when we accept it.

385
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,791
That doesn't mean I'm happy with it.

386
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:32,210
-Amazing.
-You look great.

387
00:29:57,235 --> 00:29:58,099
Go.

388
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:01,833
You can do it.

389
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,145
Why aren't you running?

390
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,367
I am running.

391
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:07,453
Ma'am, you can do it.

392
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,557
You look thin already.

393
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:27,025
Okay!

394
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,598
This won't do. Lift her up.

395
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:46,647
Go.

396
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,483
Hi, ma'am.

397
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:02,277
Gosh, it's heavy.

398
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:06,681
It weighs about the same as
your body fat.

399
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,596
-This is Heavy Bag training.
-Will you be okay?

400
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:13,621
I'll knock you out today.

401
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:19,386
Oh, Ma'am.

402
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:20,480
One, two.

403
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:25,685
I'm sorry.

404
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,712
Get over here.

405
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,839
Why are you bothering them?

406
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:33,666
You brat.

407
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:37,456
Ma'am.

408
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,088
Ma'am. Don't die.

409
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,465
Your ears need to be in the water.

410
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,163
-Teach me how to swim forward.
-What?

411
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,870
What's the matter?
Did water get into your nose?

412
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,957
-Goodness
-Come here.

413
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,588
You're pretty even when your hair is wet.

414
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,062
Really?

415
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,010
Ma'am, you're doing good.

416
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:50,577
Ma'am, you're doing great.

417
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:52,321
You look like Hulk.

418
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:53,344
Go.

419
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:54,659
Good.

420
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,446
-Junseong.
-I've got a cramp.

421
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,046
What should we do?

422
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,015
This isn't working.

423
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,588
If it was easy, she would've
done it already.

424
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,683
She seems so determined though.

425
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,064
But she isn't losing any weight, right?

426
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,824
I feel bad for her.

427
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,935
She is the same as before.
This isn't working.

428
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:38,243
"Anna Sue, Is She John Kim's Woman?"

429
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,527
That rumor is still going around.

430
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:56,035
"John Kim, I did 300 jump ropes.
Good night."

431
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,164
Ma'am, good night.

432
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,152
I love you.

433
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,730
Jiwoong and I have an interview tomorrow.

434
00:34:09,015 --> 00:34:10,550
Oh, right.

435
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,324
Where's John Kim?

436
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,641
"Ma'am, I have to go to
an interview with Junseong."

437
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:30,837
"See you tomorrow. Good luck."

438
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,153
"I love you, Ma'am."

439
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,558
John Kim doesn't speak like that.

440
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,672
Since John Kim is not here,
shall we just skip it then?

441
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:42,291
He will be disappointed then.

442
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:45,465
John Kim would have been
touched to hear that.

443
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:49,255
So, I often send text messages
to my John Kim.

444
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,953
You'll do this today.

445
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,132
-Shall I start?
-Go.

446
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:04,064
Hold on.

447
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,200
"Blind Date Cha Seonyoung"

448
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:11,498
It'll be hard to turn her down.

449
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:13,411
You can go.

450
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,893
I've done this before,
so I know what I'm doing.

451
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:23,098
John Kim is unlucky that
he's stuck with me,

452
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:27,091
but I don't want to
trouble you or Junseong.

453
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:30,107
You can go.

454
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:32,619
You shouldn't make a lady wait.

455
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:34,916
All right.

456
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:36,300
By the way,

457
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:38,845
how long should I do this?

458
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:41,431
As long as you can. That's your limit.

459
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:43,066
When you're done,
turn off the lights and the door...

460
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:44,731
It will be automatically locked.

461
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,285
Don't worry about me.

462
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,592
Hello.

463
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,199
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,524
I shouldn't make a lady wait,

465
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,875
but I had to change my clothes.

466
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:14,537
That's okay. I didn't wait for long.

467
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,533
-Let's order something.
-Okay.

468
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:52,466
Stop it.

469
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,093
"Mother-in-law"

470
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,379
Give me a second.

471
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,625
"My Woosik"

472
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,181
What do you want?

473
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:57,691
What?

474
00:37:58,661 --> 00:37:59,863
Didn't you tell your mother?

475
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:04,088
I couldn't tell her. She'd be so upset.

476
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm going to meet her first,
so come as soon as you can.

477
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:12,546
I haven't seen you in a long time.

478
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,410
How have you been?

479
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,417
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

480
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:20,554
You look even more handsome.

481
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:24,483
I brought the kimchi that you like.

482
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:27,006
This will taste better than the last one.

483
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:28,927
Everything you make tastes good.

484
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:30,197
Really?

485
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:34,863
Mom.

486
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,651
Gosh, look at her.

487
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:44,969
Why didn't you call me first?

488
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:48,294
Why bother? I'm just here to see my kids.

489
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:50,778
-Don't you agree, Woosik?
-Yes.

490
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,230
Let's go. He is busy.

491
00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:57,819
He has to eat even if he is busy.

492
00:38:57,924 --> 00:39:00,033
Let me eat in this fancy restaurant.

493
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:02,345
I'll treat you later. Let's go.

494
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,533
Your mother's hungry.

495
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,377
Let's just eat first.

496
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:15,609
Mother!

497
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:22,632
Mom.

498
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,798
It just happened this way.

499
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:29,791
We'll be a family anyway.

500
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,137
This is like an official gathering
before the wedding.

501
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:35,529
Mom.

502
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:39,766
Go. You have to go.

503
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:42,402
-Why are you telling him to go?
-Jaehyeok.

504
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,304
Honey, shall I sit?

505
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:47,922
I'm sorry.

506
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:50,369
I feel bad that I'm getting married
before you do,

507
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:51,837
but I hope you understand.

508
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,090
Excuse me.

509
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:56,581
I don't mean to be rude,

510
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:58,249
but if you came to greet us
or to tell us something,

511
00:39:58,351 --> 00:39:59,641
let's do it later.

512
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:01,572
Jaehyeok.

513
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:06,521
She isn't family yet.
Let's not bare all, okay?

514
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:21,513
What's going on?

515
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:24,188
You see...

516
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,205
I was the one who ate
the kimchi you made last time.

517
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:27,514
The one from six months ago too.

518
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:31,240
We broke up, Mom.

519
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:32,340
Jooeun!

520
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:36,123
What?

521
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,213
Oh, my goodness.

522
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:44,297
Oh, my goodness.

523
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:51,004
Woosik.

524
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:53,542
I'm sorry.

525
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:57,290
Can't you change your mind?

526
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:00,869
After what happened to her dad,

527
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:05,585
Jooeun was too busy
taking care of Jaehyeok and me.

528
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:08,543
-Mom.
-Please, I beg you.

529
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:12,994
Can't you take her back?

530
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:17,780
I'm sorry.

531
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,838
It's okay.

532
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:28,636
I'm the one who is sorry.

533
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,912
-Mom.
-Be quiet!

534
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:35,211
If a child does something wrong,
it's the mom's fault.

535
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:40,353
This will never happen again.

536
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:50,950
I apologize for all this.

537
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:53,551
Goodbye.

538
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:00,340
Woosik.

539
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:01,765
Woosik.

540
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:03,657
Are you crazy?

541
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:06,590
Who will you find at your age now?

542
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:10,595
Are you out of your mind?

543
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,192
Oh, my goodness.

544
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,834
Is something wrong?

545
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:20,533
Something's bothering me.

546
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:22,533
It's disturbing...

547
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:25,160
...and distracting me.

548
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,976
Drop me off at the terminal.

549
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:50,662
Okay.

550
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:53,468
Don't bother getting out.

551
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:57,165
Okay.

552
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,053
About the wedding...

553
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,172
I told you, Woosik and I broke up.

554
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,094
Please stop.

555
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:11,115
I'm talking about Jaehyeok, your brother.

556
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:13,079
I see.

557
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:19,484
I'm shocked that Woosik lasted
so long with your temper.

558
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:22,663
That's enough.

559
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:26,542
Drop me off at the terminal and go home.

560
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,248
How many times will you say that?

561
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,247
I said it twice. Only twice.

562
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:37,900
It'll be okay.

563
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:41,106
I survived even after my husband died.

564
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,608
Drop me off at the terminal...

565
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,781
I know.

566
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,322
I'll drop you off and go home.

567
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,193
Help me.

568
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:25,257
Please help me!

569
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:27,134
Please!

570
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:33,756
Please take me away from here.

571
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:34,903
Mom.

572
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,707
Are you crazy?

573
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:38,807
Something's bothering me.

574
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,772
It's disturbing...

575
00:44:42,115 --> 00:44:43,319
...and distracting me.

576
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,392
What is it? Are you done?

577
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:54,286
I'm exhausted.

578
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,675
I'm so tired.

579
00:44:55,982 --> 00:44:57,778
But you can't stop the champion.

580
00:44:57,918 --> 00:45:00,772
Okay. I'll train Junseong.

581
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:01,770
You should get some rest.

582
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:05,129
Yes, sir.

583
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:07,704
Thank you. I love you.

584
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:17,816
Is he here already?

585
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:48,879
Goodness.

586
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,771
What are you doing?

587
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:55,642
John Kim said...

588
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,278
Who cares about what John Kim said?

589
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:01,948
What do you mean, "who cares"?

590
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:04,768
Do you really think
this will make you lose weight?

591
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:05,842
If you do,

592
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,901
what would change?

593
00:46:08,288 --> 00:46:11,332
Why are you so serious?
I'm just trying to lose weight.

594
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:14,135
I was told,

595
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:17,198
to do as much as I could,

596
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,060
so that's what I intend to do.

597
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,454
You've already exceeded your limit.

598
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:29,643
I did not.

599
00:46:30,577 --> 00:46:31,778
I can do anything...

600
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:34,383
...if I put my mind to it.

601
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,126
I can still do it.

602
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,728
That means I haven't reached my limit yet.

603
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:41,816
Believing that you can do something...

604
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,950
....is different from being able to do it.

605
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,179
It's the same to me.

606
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:49,996
If I believe it, I can do it.

607
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:52,378
I believe that I can.

608
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,411
If I do one more repetition,

609
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,859
it'll be 107 times.

610
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:00,998
Lucky seven.

611
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:04,995
You need to stop.

612
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:07,778
I can do it. Let go.

613
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,209
Listen to me.

614
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,016
You might hurt yourself.

615
00:47:17,554 --> 00:47:20,256
You didn't need to call a driver.

616
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,125
It's the same price as taking the taxi.

617
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:27,729
You may be unable to control your body.

618
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:30,047
You need to think of the safety of others.

619
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,142
Did you ask for a driver?

620
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:34,430
Yes.

621
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,432
Please take her home.

622
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:38,442
Yes, sir.

623
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:42,849
Okay, then. Bye.

624
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:57,467
Don't think about anything.

625
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,000
Take a warm shower before going to bed.

626
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,556
Then, you'll feel better tomorrow.

627
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:17,349
Isn't that Lawyer Kang's car?

628
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:19,452
Yes.

629
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:21,037
Was she working out until now?

630
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:25,498
She's really trying hard.

631
00:48:25,754 --> 00:48:30,091
She's ignorant, brave
and determined, too.

632
00:48:32,984 --> 00:48:34,063
Don't get off.

633
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,748
Let's rest tonight.

634
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:37,908
What?

635
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:39,588
We're not working out?

636
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:58,561
"Son-in-law Woosik"

637
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,013
"Contacts"

638
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,591
"My Woosik"

639
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:26,769
"Are you sure
you want to delete this contact?"

640
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:29,660
"Contact deleted"

641
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:34,359
"Trainer JK"

642
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,114
John Kim.

643
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,355
I'll work harder tomorrow.

644
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:49,160
Please believe that
I really want to do this.

645
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:53,307
I'll see you tomorrow.

646
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:55,961
But...

647
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:57,811
...can...

648
00:49:58,612 --> 00:49:59,710
...I...

649
00:50:00,868 --> 00:50:03,786
...really change?

650
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:12,756
Believing that you can do something...

651
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:14,563
...is different from being able to do it.

652
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:15,985
It's the same to me.

653
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:19,787
If I believe it, I can do it.

654
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,203
I believe that I can.

655
00:50:25,343 --> 00:50:26,811
I'll believe that I can change...

656
00:50:27,353 --> 00:50:28,504
...since it's you, John Kim.

657
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,402
I left your coffee on your desk!

658
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:09,561
I'll be quick since you don't want
to see me for long.

659
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,522
You need to appear on TV.

660
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,115
What was that?

661
00:51:15,683 --> 00:51:17,454
It's a local newscast...

662
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,691
...and they want a female attorney.

663
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:25,260
Am I the only female attorney at our firm?

664
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:28,859
There are four.
You, me, Lawyer Kim and Lawyer Choi.

665
00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:31,334
I have an important meeting
this afternoon,

666
00:51:31,437 --> 00:51:33,010
and Lawyer Kim is in court.

667
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:35,170
Lawyer Choi has stage fright.

668
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,468
You must have forgotten.

669
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,794
I have everything the others have.

670
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:44,546
I'm getting nauseous.

671
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:48,540
The president is happy because
it'll be good publicity.

672
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:50,072
Don't disappoint him.

673
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:52,068
Hey, Soojin.

674
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,663
Are you trying to get revenge?

675
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,458
Why?

676
00:51:57,798 --> 00:51:59,154
Why are you doing this?

677
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,147
Revenge?

678
00:52:02,316 --> 00:52:06,022
Why is asking you to go on TV, a revenge?

679
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:22,643
For example, using a photo from
someone else's SNS...

680
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:32,688
That's bitter.

681
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:38,204
You have lots of guts, Jooeun.

682
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,679
This is nothing.

683
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:40,938
Get yourself together.

684
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:44,985
That scared me.

685
00:52:45,112 --> 00:52:46,447
Gosh.

686
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:54,082
Article 46 of the Copyright Law states...

687
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:58,708
What's wrong with my voice?

688
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,200
John Kim.

689
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,201
I have to appear on TV this afternoon.

690
00:53:10,723 --> 00:53:14,160
I'm reporting that I'll have
to skip my afternoon run.

691
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:17,017
I'm nervous, but I'll do my best.

692
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:20,897
"My Ma'am"

693
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:22,618
Is she there already?

694
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:28,216
She can't make it.

695
00:53:30,152 --> 00:53:31,104
Good luck!

696
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:36,553
What luck?

697
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:41,067
Today we will be discussing
copyright infringement...

698
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:44,178
...that can be committed easily
without realizing it.

699
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:46,486
I taught Jooeun how to...

700
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:49,118
"Mother-in-law"

701
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,356
Are you trying to get revenge?

702
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:56,040
Why is asking you to go on TV, a revenge?

703
00:53:56,171 --> 00:54:00,308
We have Lawyer Kang Jooeun with us today.

704
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:01,471
Hello.

705
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,177
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Jooeun.

706
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,880
What's wrong with her face?

707
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:10,523
Article 46 of the Copyright Law states,

708
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:13,834
that if you wish to use
someone else's creative work,

709
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:16,947
you must obtain their consent,

710
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:19,295
regardless of whether or not
you use it for profit.

711
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:22,787
Most importantly, one should keep in mind,

712
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:27,402
that it is the same as stealing
someone's money or property.

713
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:31,195
One should be aware of this
and act morally.

714
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:32,640
I see.

715
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:35,276
Thank you for your time.

716
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:44,566
We had a slight accident
during our live broadcast.

717
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:48,289
We ask for your understanding.

718
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,084
We'll go for commercials.

719
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:01,879
-Lawyer Kang.
-Call an ambulance.

720
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,304
-Hurry.
-Lawyer Kang.

721
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,396
Lawyer Kang.

722
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:09,855
It's the second time
I've been in an ambulance.

723
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,656
Where am I going?

724
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:15,408
The first time,

725
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:17,886
they took off my corset.

726
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,178
What will happen to me this time?

727
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,368
Oh, no.

728
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:40,919
Woosik, it's me.

729
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,761
-Jooeun...
-Sorry. I'll call you back later.

730
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:47,064
Where are you going?

731
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:48,886
I'll call you when I'm back.

732
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,527
How did you know?

733
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:55,956
I was nearby.

734
00:56:57,003 --> 00:56:58,042
I see.

735
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:08,759
I'm not the one
who ripped it off this time.

736
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:20,011
How do you feel?

737
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:23,745
You have a new worst day of your life.

738
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,417
I've been better.

739
00:57:27,592 --> 00:57:29,513
That's for sure.

740
00:57:31,419 --> 00:57:33,597
I'm sure this is a stupid question,

741
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,830
but why do you want
to lose weight so badly?

742
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:41,855
That really is a stupid question.

743
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:44,444
Just because you're not
interested in me...

744
00:57:44,866 --> 00:57:46,516
You never know.

745
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:48,498
And let's not be rude.

746
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,806
I'm grateful,

747
00:58:07,683 --> 00:58:09,843
but you never give me
a chance to thank you.

748
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:14,696
Anyway, I keep owing you.

749
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,881
Thank you.

750
00:58:20,198 --> 00:58:21,317
Goodbye.

751
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:39,287
If you're going to do it,
let's do it right.

752
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:43,116
I am...

753
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:44,966
...John Kim.

754
00:59:13,863 --> 00:59:15,950
"Oh My Venus"

755
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,448
Do you have proof that
you are in fact, John Kim?

756
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:20,558
Get lost!

757
00:59:20,678 --> 00:59:22,213
This evil witch.

758
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,694
That swollen face.

759
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,257
It's all over.

760
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:27,860
I went to see Jooeun.
She had someone there.

761
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,344
Why are you here so early?

762
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:31,018
Do you have a boyfriend?

763
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,945
-She was dumped.
-Oh, my gosh.

764
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:37,741
Sleeping, walking, eating, and moving.

765
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,378
You must redo them all. Okay?

766
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:43,481
Jooeun, it's me.

767
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:49,430
Help me.
