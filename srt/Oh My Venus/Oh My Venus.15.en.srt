00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,473
"Previously, on 'Oh My Venus'"

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:05,818
Help me.

3
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:10,329
Please don't kill me.

4
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,396
Help me.

5
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:20,314
Jooeun.

6
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,120
Every time you see me,
that's what you say.

7
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:28,691
Let's go.

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,953
Somewhere outside your world.

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,166
Boarding.

10
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:37,888
Take off.

11
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,119
You are John Kim.

12
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:40,531
Right?

13
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:41,775
Right.

14
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,477
-John Kim.
-Oh, my gosh.

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,880
From now on, the three of us
will be on your team.

16
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,713
Give it back!

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,321
Dangerous, warning, recommend caution.

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,789
What's wrong with you?

19
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,984
You wicked woman.

20
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,978
Attack me as much as you want.

21
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,316
Why you evil stalker.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,372
Your body belongs to me.

23
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:15,676
I won't take no for an answer.

24
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,270
Where is Youngho?

25
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:31,250
Did something happen?

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,161
Youngho.

27
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,214
I'll search every inch
of Gahong hospital.

28
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,579
I'll search to the edge of the Earth.

29
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:42,690
No, I'll search the entire
universe to find him.

30
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,132
Please go back.
He doesn't want to see you.

31
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:47,563
It's okay to be sick.

32
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:51,600
It's okay if you're not as
beautiful or not as sexy.

33
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:54,381
Just please come back to me.

34
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:56,883
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,473
I didn't tell you sooner...

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,771
...just how much I love you.

37
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:12,637
I don't know if you know this.

38
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:18,711
But to me, a miracle is...

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,840
...you looking at me,
as lovely as ever.

40
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,666
It may be very simple and natural...

41
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:31,407
but I think the miracle of Christmas...

42
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:36,701
...is you, the one I need by my side.

43
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,406
"Episode 15"

44
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,840
I don't think I can let you go tonight.

45
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,154
I never said I was leaving.

46
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:38,572
This.

47
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,143
You saw it.

48
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,246
Of course.

49
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,035
This is what kept me going.

50
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,074
I'm sorry for making you wait, Jooeun.

51
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:59,139
Thank you for coming
sooner than I expected, Coach.

52
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:02,706
What did you wish for?

53
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:06,054
Not to be sick?

54
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:09,825
Not me.

55
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:16,037
For you not to be sick.

56
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,399
I hope tonight will be...

57
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:33,663
...a restful and warm night.

58
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,188
Okay.

59
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:12,517
A warm night.

60
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:31,932
I didn't say anything.

61
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,122
This is warm.

62
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,339
Isn't this a little too hot...

63
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,675
...for it to be a warm night?

64
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,680
It's because I'm used to hugging
this rascal when I sleep.

65
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,858
You are bewitching.

66
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,420
It's not my fault.

67
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:57,830
It's yours for coming back
looking so beautiful and sexy.

68
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:03,829
Gosh.

69
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:11,920
I give up on the warm night.

70
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,118
Let's have an erotic night, okay?

71
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,543
Okay.

72
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,087
You're the one that seduced me again.

73
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,749
Wasn't it mutual?

74
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,174
I want to see.

75
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,136
I can't concentrate if it's bright.

76
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,591
We need to get up.

77
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:45,153
Junseong and Jiwoong will be here soon.

78
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,152
Sleep more.

79
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:53,656
The guys are having dinner
at Junseong's mother's house.

80
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,814
What does that mean?

81
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,250
It isn't a dream.

82
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,197
Thank goodness.

83
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:16,064
What kind of dreams have you been having?

84
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,834
-That's right.
-What?

85
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,636
Unless you're at work
or with your family...

86
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:28,129
...you better be in my sight.

87
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,314
Otherwise, you're in trouble.

88
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:37,464
Okay.

89
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,620
You told me to stay in your sight.

90
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,685
You're the one who turned around.

91
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,469
I'm hungry.

92
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:31,743
Darling.

93
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,273
I'm hungry.

94
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,806
If you want to eat...

95
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,418
...shouldn't you get dressed first?

96
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,436
Or it'll end up being
a restful and erotic day.

97
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,069
Here you go.

98
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:03,813
When did you get this?

99
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,850
I got it just in case you ask for help...

100
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:11,074
...and I have to rip your clothes again.

101
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,545
It looks good on you.

102
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:14,434
That's right.

103
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,453
I made this last night.

104
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,717
But I thought you'd make a fuss
if I asked you to eat at night.

105
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,801
I wish you'd be more careful
with what you eat.

106
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,196
Did you take your thyroid pills?

107
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,171
You told me not to rely on it.
That I should try living without it.

108
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,662
It's not good to take medication.

109
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,382
I don't have to take it anymore.
They told me last month.

110
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:42,845
They said my cholesterol
and thyroid levels are normal.

111
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:44,905
Gosh.

112
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:49,139
You've become more beautiful and sexier.

113
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,700
Good job.

114
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,231
What did I tell you?

115
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:01,110
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

116
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:04,881
Would it be all right
if I said a few words?

117
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,553
It's stressful to miss someone.

118
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:15,156
But even under severe stress,
she overcame hypothyroidism.

119
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,125
I contribute this glory to Kang Jooeun,
the former Venus of Daegu...

120
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:22,418
...and currently known
as the Venus of Youngho!

121
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,152
Are you giving yourself the glory?

122
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,853
I guess you deserve it.

123
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,730
Do you agree that I'm your Venus?

124
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:33,041
You must be filled with love for me.

125
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,063
I admit that I'm filled with love for you.

126
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,129
-I admit it.
-I knew it.

127
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,939
I made it bland.

128
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,488
I know you're reducing your salt intake...

129
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,341
...but eat at least a spoonful for me.

130
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:52,245
Thank you.

131
00:11:57,403 --> 00:11:59,268
What shall we do today?

132
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,890
Since I have a meeting
in the evening, until then...

133
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,964
We can stick by each other...

134
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:14,653
And then what?

135
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,816
We'll just stick by each other's side.

136
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:20,182
Okay?

137
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,029
At times, it seems
that you're an easy woman.

138
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:28,796
Deal.

139
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:29,815
Deal?

140
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:31,721
Deal.

141
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,192
Deal?

142
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:36,544
Gosh.

143
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,259
What's that?

144
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,362
-It's cold.
-Don't.

145
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,548
What does that mean?

146
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,571
My hands are full.

147
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,025
I almost forgot...

148
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:16,111
...that I need to check on something.

149
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,998
What is it?

150
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,663
Gosh.

151
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,056
Fifty-four.

152
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:28,535
Fifty-five.

153
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,054
Fifty-six.

154
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:31,823
Fifty-seven.

155
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,402
Fifty-eight.

156
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,124
Fifty-nine.

157
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,350
-Sixty.
-Goodness.

158
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,152
You wanted to see if I could
hold a plank for a minute?

159
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,935
You said in the video
that you could do it.

160
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,579
Your muscular strength has improved.

161
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,009
Good job. Let's do it again.

162
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,176
How many times are you going to check?

163
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,613
I already did five sets.

164
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:56,806
Five sets?

165
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:58,559
That's enough.

166
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,777
Let's wrap this up with a 30-minute run.

167
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,742
We were just kissing.

168
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,847
Why are we training all of a sudden?

169
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,187
Where is this punk?

170
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:15,878
You wanted us to stick together.

171
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:18,613
Yes, Coach.

172
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,411
Are you okay?

173
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,161
Aren't you overexerting yourself?

174
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:35,508
When broken bones heal,
they become stronger.

175
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:37,912
As long as they heal properly.

176
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:41,121
Did your bones heal properly?

177
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:46,486
Just like you, they are great now.

178
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,925
Why aren't you running?

179
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:53,192
I'm running, Coach.

180
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:29,859
Wow.

181
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,158
Did you just poke me in the ribs?

182
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,552
"Mom"

183
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:54,255
It's my mom.

184
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:56,839
I apologize, Ma'am.

185
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,317
Hey, Mom.

186
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,246
You're in Seoul?

187
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,871
I'm in the neighborhood.

188
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,356
I'll be home in a minute.

189
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,753
All right.

190
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,983
It's time for us to part
with each other today.

191
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,843
You're right.

192
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:20,342
There's an exception when
it comes to your mother.

193
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,282
See you tomorrow.

194
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,128
She's here for a wedding,
and will stay for the night.

195
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:32,115
I envy your mother.

196
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,594
She's spending the night with you.

197
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,248
I'll go change my clothes.

198
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,651
Do you know where your clothes are?

199
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:47,956
Goodness. I know where they are.

200
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:55,345
Oh.

201
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:11,364
Let's go on all the dates...

202
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,000
...that we've missed the past year.

203
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,147
I won't miss out on anything...

204
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,391
...and be twice, no, three times as happy.

205
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,712
-Let's tell your mother...
-We can tell her later.

206
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,283
Let's take our time.

207
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,871
There is no rush.

208
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,804
Go inside.

209
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,029
I'll call you.

210
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,203
Wait a moment.

211
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,195
Didn't you forget something?

212
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,324
Goodness.

213
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,583
Bye.

214
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,326
Bye.

215
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,814
Drive safely.

216
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:21,972
Mom.

217
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,050
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

218
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:27,873
Why did you bring all these?
They look heavy.

219
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:29,498
I came here on a chartered bus.

220
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,478
I could manage. It wasn't that heavy.

221
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:36,015
Are you coming from
a wedding or something?

222
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,908
What? Well...

223
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,868
My goodness.

224
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:44,800
Doesn't it upset you at all?

225
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,298
Why would I be upset?

226
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:50,821
You go to weddings and
give out gifts while you age.

227
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,507
Why are you hiding your lover boy from me?

228
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,990
Another year has passed.

229
00:18:57,075 --> 00:19:00,640
Your prime years are coming to an end.

230
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,267
I need to change and go out.

231
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,253
Are you going out again?

232
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,966
Did you eat?

233
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:17,490
My friend has three grandchildren.

234
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,863
All her sons and daughters are married.

235
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,411
She has nothing to worry about now.

236
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,298
You have a grandchild, too.

237
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,071
You also have a 22-year-old
daughter-in-law.

238
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:27,087
I know.

239
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,313
She gave birth to a child
at the age of 22.

240
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:32,309
How old are you?

241
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:34,936
Do you even know how old you are?

242
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,037
I'll take care of myself.

243
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,289
Tell me why.

244
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,782
Why won't you introduce
your boyfriend to me?

245
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,539
Later.

246
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,347
It will be too late.

247
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:54,481
What's wrong?

248
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,880
Is he a fugitive or in a huge debt?

249
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,158
Is there something wrong with him?

250
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:04,612
No, it's not like that.

251
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:06,418
I can take care of myself.

252
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,809
Why don't you get married yourself?

253
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:10,958
You're the one that's running out of time.

254
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,070
You're not saying you won't get married.

255
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,099
I'll be on my way now.
It won't take long.

256
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,308
They even make you work on weekends.

257
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,154
When will you have time to get married?

258
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:24,724
A guy in a huge debt?

259
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,827
My mom sure has a wild imagination.

260
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,253
I'm here, Vice President Oh.

261
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:34,093
Did you contact the other victim?

262
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,266
Will she testify?

263
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,393
I'm a master at convincing people.

264
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,801
I'll come to you.

265
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,002
The charges are for assault while dating.

266
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:48,247
But the assertion that
there were prior incidents...

267
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:51,706
...is a purely unilateral one
from the victim's side.

268
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:56,155
My client is a civil servant.

269
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:58,955
Although he feels that
he is falsely charged...

270
00:20:59,222 --> 00:21:01,510
...he would like to settle.

271
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:02,816
I see.

272
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,432
We don't have enough evidence...

273
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,290
...to prove physical assault.

274
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:13,381
We don't have medical records
of the prior assaults.

275
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,409
As for injuries that heal in two weeks,
we usually end those in a settlement.

276
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:19,449
However.

277
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:26,920
You're so pretty.

278
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:29,139
Stop that.

279
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,774
Stop that. I'm embarrassed. Stop it.

280
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,414
Fine. Just for ten seconds.

281
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:35,945
-No.
-Come on.

282
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:41,122
Youngjun plans to take time off
from school and join the army.

283
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:45,642
Mrs. Choi has been
volunteering in the suburbs.

284
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:53,807
I guess she's not meant to live in peace.

285
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:58,732
What about the other thing?

286
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,367
It's Attorney Kang Jooeun's business card.

287
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:08,742
She's an attorney at the law firm, Geontu.

288
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,370
Her father passed away in an accident.

289
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:13,575
She has a mother and
a brother who is married.

290
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:16,339
Their financial situation...

291
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,398
That's enough.

292
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:19,843
Good work.

293
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,744
"Geontu Law Firm, Kang Jooeun"

294
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,292
That's familiar, isn't it?

295
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:41,594
What is this? This is vulgar.

296
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:46,432
Your client seems to have
done this vulgar act often.

297
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:48,624
Do you have proof?

298
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,569
Counsel...

299
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:56,669
You have no proof that the person
in this video is your client...

300
00:22:56,753 --> 00:23:00,506
...or that the person who
posted it is my client.

301
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,087
I mean, how do you know who's whom?

302
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,505
The faces are blurred out.

303
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,402
You know who it is,
and so does our client.

304
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:14,722
Our client is getting psychiatric
counseling because of it.

305
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,730
When we searched
through the video files...

306
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:19,431
...we found a voice recording
of our client and yours.

307
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,793
We are analyzing it now.

308
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:29,120
Then the settlement...

309
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,199
We will not settle.

310
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:32,993
You did it to your ex-girlfriend, too.

311
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:36,788
You used the same methods
and posted similar videos.

312
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:38,711
Of course, she agreed to testify.

313
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:46,927
Based on Article 307 of Criminal Law,
we can charge you for defamation.

314
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,131
And illegal use of information
on communication networks...

315
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,291
...and violation of protection laws.

316
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,434
Punishment for sexual assault
in accordance with Article 14.

317
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:59,838
Your position as a civil servant
may be compromised.

318
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:04,401
Since you have concurrent charges,
the punishment will be increased.

319
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:08,514
Don't go anywhere far.

320
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:30,975
That's a pretty ring.

321
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,787
Are you sick?

322
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:38,831
It's just a stomachache.

323
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,461
You're back together with
Kim Youngho, right?

324
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:45,462
Congratulations.

325
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:47,740
You saw?

326
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:53,545
I'm sure you won't like
it if I say this...

327
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,138
...but I can't ignore what I see.

328
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:57,529
What is it now?

329
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,611
You need to eat.

330
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,148
Look at yourself. You're pale.

331
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:05,263
You're thin enough.

332
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,201
And you're pretty.

333
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:08,786
I hear you.

334
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:10,538
Who said I'm starving?

335
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,239
I'm leaving.

336
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:17,990
Go to the hospital and
get it checked out.

337
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,637
Before I drag you there myself.

338
00:25:20,495 --> 00:25:21,887
Fine.

339
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:25,434
Happy New Year.

340
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:31,155
Goodness. She doesn't look happy at all.

341
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,914
"Woosik"

342
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:00,256
The person you have
called is unavailable...

343
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:04,263
What do you want for dinner?

344
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,519
I'll bring it over.

345
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,338
You haven't been eating lately.

346
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,655
Chicken soup? Chicken porridge?

347
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:20,238
Is she busy?

348
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:34,739
Abalone porridge?

349
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,483
This isn't good.

350
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:49,943
This is Oh Soojin.

351
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:53,691
I've been tested.
I just need to go over the results.

352
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:57,218
May I change my appointment
from next week to today?

353
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:07,472
I didn't want to disturb you
during your meeting.

354
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:11,228
Are you at your office?
Parking lot? Are you driving?

355
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,276
If you're driving, let's talk later.

356
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,301
"Coach"

357
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,543
"Oh My Venus"

358
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:27,759
Are you done?

359
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:30,048
I'm heading home now.

360
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,420
You should rest.

361
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,282
You must be tired because of the jet lag.

362
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,405
I'm not tired because of the jet lag.

363
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,323
Oh, my gosh.

364
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:45,966
Junseong and Jiwoong aren't with you?

365
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:49,199
They went to your place.

366
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,117
What?

367
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,329
They had nothing to do, so I sent
them to your house with some fruit.

368
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,251
I didn't want your mom to be bored.

369
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:58,198
Jiwoong texts your mom.

370
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:03,278
You know, my mom adores Jiwoong.

371
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,417
She likes Junseong a lot, too.

372
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,819
My elevator's here.

373
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,822
Let's talk again before bed.

374
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:13,112
Get home safely.

375
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:15,974
I will, Coach.

376
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,114
Mom, I'm home.

377
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:24,952
I'm here.

378
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:26,636
-Yes!
-Oh, she's here.

379
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,735
I'm here.

380
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:31,466
I'm a professional!

381
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:35,736
Oh, my. I destroyed you.

382
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,256
-I'm going to change.
-Okay.

383
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,105
Hold on. Let's see what I have.

384
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,544
Hi, Woosik.

385
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,350
You weren't picking up earlier.

386
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,830
Were you busy?
Or are you not feeling well?

387
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,501
I had a meeting.

388
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:00,852
I'm fine.

389
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:02,138
Will you be home late?

390
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,603
Yes, a little.

391
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:06,931
I have another meeting to attend.

392
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,622
Have you eaten anything?

393
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,423
Of course.

394
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:14,080
You always say you ate,
but you really don't eat much.

395
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:17,678
I'll pick up some porridge
on the way. See you soon.

396
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,803
-Soojin.
-Yes?

397
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:25,487
Where are you?

398
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:28,376
I'm at the office.

399
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,415
Are you sure you're okay?

400
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,061
I'm fine.

401
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:36,737
I'll see you later.

402
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:41,580
"Seoul Gahong Hospital"

403
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,234
"Obstetrics and Gynecology"

404
00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:08,094
I just want to see the results.

405
00:30:08,382 --> 00:30:10,974
-My name is Oh Soojin.
-Oh Soojin?

406
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,438
You may go to examination room five.

407
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,247
Thank you.

408
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:24,546
Sell your cards.

409
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,688
You should.

410
00:30:25,772 --> 00:30:27,670
Sell your cards.

411
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,753
One, two, three.

412
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:32,006
-Oh, gosh.
-Give me 300 won each.

413
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,174
Thank you.

414
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,476
Here we go.

415
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:37,465
That's it.

416
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,790
I won another point.

417
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,094
-Mom!
-See? I won another point.

418
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:45,002
-Shut your mouth.
-How about this?

419
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:48,508
You have nothing. I think I'll win.
What have you got, Jiwoong?

420
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,170
-Bam!
-Wow.

421
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,918
Okbun, give me the card.

422
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:56,187
Didn't you just learn
how to play this game?

423
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,149
You are on a roll today.

424
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,557
It's a bit rude to call
her by her first name.

425
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:04,557
That's okay. I heard Americans call
each other by their first names.

426
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,255
Okbun, your turn.

427
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:08,567
Ma'am's mommy, go.

428
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,586
Let me see.

429
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,142
Your mother ordered some food earlier on.

430
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:16,710
I told you not to eat at night.

431
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:18,519
-Let me...
-No, I'll go.

432
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:20,205
I'm not playing this round.

433
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,517
Did you know that a set menu of
bossam and jokbal is called bojok?

434
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:29,032
How much is it?

435
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,186
What?

436
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:33,265
I don't know. I didn't get the change.

437
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:34,416
Hold on.

438
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,768
Why are you here?

439
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,231
Jooeun! Come back quickly!

440
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:42,567
I think I need to introduce
myself to your mother.

441
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:44,042
I'm coming.

442
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:45,686
Let's go inside.

443
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:47,062
Wait.

444
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:50,507
My mom's wearing the clothes
that you left behind.

445
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:51,816
Do not laugh, okay?

446
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:58,032
I'm too nervous to laugh right now.

447
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,385
Gosh, don't be nervous.

448
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,064
She's just a mom.

449
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,955
She's not just any mom.

450
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,673
She's your mom.

451
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,497
I haven't felt like this before.

452
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,792
Do I look pretty?

453
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,594
Yes, you look pretty.

454
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,065
Jooeun!

455
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:15,982
Let's go.

456
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,823
Youngho!

457
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:32,553
We should get going now. It's late.

458
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:35,052
No, I'm winning now.
The game is not over.

459
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,788
Come on, Jiwoong.

460
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,168
-We'll see you next time.
-Goodbye.

461
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,182
Please, don't get up.

462
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:45,734
I assure you, he is a good guy.

463
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,469
Okbun.

464
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:54,163
Youngho is my hero.
Please go easy on him.

465
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:55,706
And I'll see you next time.

466
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:57,830
I'm a professional Go-Stopper.

467
00:32:58,793 --> 00:32:59,811
What is he saying?

468
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,411
I won't see you out.

469
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:02,328
That's okay.

470
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,050
I'm glad I changed clothes before coming.

471
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,723
Otherwise your mom and I
would be in couple wear.

472
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,645
Jooeun, who is this?

473
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,779
Is he the delivery man?

474
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:22,456
Goodness. Why do you ask
when you already know?

475
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,950
It seems to run in the family.

476
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,698
Tell him to have a seat.

477
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:37,666
How do you do?

478
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:40,032
My name is Kim Youngho.

479
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:44,712
Mom.

480
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:58,036
Are you going to keep dating Jooeun?

481
00:33:58,754 --> 00:33:59,587
Pardon me?

482
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,116
Oh.

483
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:06,438
Yes.

484
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,648
That's good enough.

485
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,183
Mom.

486
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,835
Aren't you being too cool right now?

487
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:21,202
I've met him, and he said
he would continue to date you.

488
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,787
That's enough.
What else do you need?

489
00:34:31,956 --> 00:34:34,003
Ma'am. This is for you.

490
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:41,112
Goodness.
The flowers are beautiful.

491
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:44,395
I'm good at playing Go-Stop.

492
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,243
Shall we go at it?

493
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,563
It's late. You don't need to see me out.

494
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:01,304
Text me.

495
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:02,344
Okay.

496
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:08,087
Wait.

497
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:11,844
Bye.

498
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,891
Soojin.

499
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:39,707
Where are you?

500
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:49,210
I've got porridge.

501
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,182
You didn't eat yet, right?

502
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:54,712
I'm sorry. I don't feel like eating.

503
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,271
Even so, you need to eat.

504
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:02,432
What is this?

505
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:17,256
I saw you at the hospital.

506
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,195
I saw you going into
the OB-GYN department.

507
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,411
I'm not pregnant.

508
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,057
There's no way I would be pregnant.

509
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:37,440
I don't want to be, either.

510
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,300
I've thought about it.

511
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:46,020
But I don't think I'm ready.

512
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,407
I want to pursue my career.

513
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:55,361
If I get married and have a child...

514
00:36:58,265 --> 00:37:00,914
...things will be difficult for my career.

515
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:06,324
How can you say that?

516
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,754
What's that?

517
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,208
What happened?

518
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,972
Is something wrong?

519
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,753
Just because I'm not pregnant
doesn't mean something's wrong.

520
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,244
Soojin.

521
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:27,962
Please leave.

522
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:30,801
I'm tired.

523
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:33,184
I have a lot to do this weekend.

524
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,148
-What's wrong with you?
-I told you to leave.

525
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,230
Just because I accepted your ring...

526
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:46,397
...doesn't mean anything's settled.

527
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:53,068
What happened?

528
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:54,346
Leave!

529
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,555
Get some rest.

530
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,213
I think you should.

531
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:14,808
I'm leaving.

532
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:37,415
It's polycystic ovarian syndrome.

533
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,877
The lining of your uterus is
thin and weak.

534
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:43,521
It makes regular ovulation
and implantation hard.

535
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:45,842
Let's see.

536
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:50,259
Your blood test shows nutrition
and mineral deficiency.

537
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,226
Are you...?

538
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,777
I have been on a severe
diet until recently.

539
00:38:54,861 --> 00:38:56,301
I see.

540
00:38:57,886 --> 00:39:00,495
Your period has been irregular
for quite some time.

541
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,039
You also have anemia.

542
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,580
How long have you been
taking anti-depressants?

543
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:12,584
Does the medication affect my condition?

544
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,251
Of course it does.

545
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:23,862
It's been two months
since I stopped taking it.

546
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,876
Now, I'm only taking pills for anemia.

547
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,818
It could be hard...

548
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:32,801
...for you to get pregnant.

549
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:42,952
Are you getting married soon?

550
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,116
You can be treated with medication.

551
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,655
If your condition gets better, it's
not impossible to get pregnant.

552
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,212
How long will it take to get better?

553
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,711
Is it even possible?

554
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,030
Well...

555
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:02,190
Depending on the treatment
and how your body reacts...

556
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,739
...it might take a few years
or it might be impossible.

557
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,635
But don't lose hope.

558
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:12,441
Hope?

559
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:23,221
Everyone takes it for granted.

560
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:27,900
But I need to cling on to hope.

561
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,319
I'm not pregnant.

562
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:58,945
There's no way I would be pregnant.

563
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,350
I don't want to be, either.

564
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:07,170
I've thought about it.

565
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:10,922
And I don't think I'm ready.

566
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:14,272
I want to pursue my career.

567
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:20,311
If I get married and have a child...

568
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:25,803
...things will be difficult for my career.

569
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,255
How can you say that?

570
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,683
What's that?

571
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:42,102
What happened?

572
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,908
Is something wrong?

573
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:49,689
Just because I'm not pregnant
doesn't mean something's wrong.

574
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:51,109
Soojin.

575
00:41:51,895 --> 00:41:52,928
Please leave.

576
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,737
I'm tired.

577
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,088
I have a lot to do this weekend.

578
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,984
-What's wrong with you?
-I told you to leave.

579
00:42:07,854 --> 00:42:09,153
Just because I accepted your ring...

580
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:11,329
...doesn't mean anything's settled.

581
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:40,854
Now that I've met your mom,
I'm trying to watch what I say.

582
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:42,011
Although, it is night time.

583
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:45,709
Did you get home safely?

584
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:47,902
I'm about to sleep.

585
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:55,748
You take after your mother.

586
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,914
Yes, that's what people say.

587
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:05,051
You did well today. Thank you.

588
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:07,343
I felt very reassured.

589
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:20,658
You might find my family...

590
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:22,077
...a little difficult.

591
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:29,726
I'm not that easy, either.

592
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,918
Anything is better than...

593
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:40,304
...being apart from you and
not being able to see you.

594
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:41,812
For me, at least.

595
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,468
Good night, Coach.

596
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:46,215
I'll see you tomorrow...

597
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,526
...and every day, right?

598
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:59,117
Let's go somewhere tomorrow.

599
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,023
Where?

600
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:07,601
Somewhere outdoors?

601
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:12,716
Yes, Coach.

602
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,244
Go to sleep.

603
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:17,021
Have a restful and warm night.

604
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,968
The restful and warm night
already won't happen because...

605
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:24,976
...you will appear in my dreams.

606
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:29,275
Goodness.

607
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,445
Youth is the best period of life.

608
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:35,375
Flirt all you want.

609
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:40,065
Mom.

610
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:41,922
What?

611
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:45,927
Nothing.

612
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,887
Good night.

613
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:50,221
You silly.

614
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,426
I'm going to sleep.

615
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:09,864
Let's go.

616
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:14,111
Are you going abroad somewhere?

617
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,432
You wanted to go outdoors.

618
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:19,500
Let me inspect your baggage.

619
00:45:19,757 --> 00:45:21,785
What? Wait!

620
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:24,222
What are you...?

621
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:25,868
Gosh.

622
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:32,314
Cute and lovely, down to sexy and lovely.

623
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,751
You brought both of them?

624
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,802
You really are bewitching, aren't you?

625
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,428
I thought we'd be sleeping over.

626
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:41,436
You know I'm meticulous.

627
00:45:42,149 --> 00:45:45,013
I'm sorry to let you down,
but this is a day trip.

628
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:48,463
I'll take this for now.

629
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:51,949
Gosh.

630
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:09,154
Is this...?

631
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:11,050
Your mother's memorial?

632
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,816
Is this too pink?

633
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:20,966
Do I look okay?

634
00:46:25,603 --> 00:46:26,942
You look fine to me.

635
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,399
"Seo Jiyeon"

636
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:50,841
Did you knit this yourself?

637
00:46:51,677 --> 00:46:53,148
Greet my mother.

638
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:00,041
Hello.

639
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,973
I'm Kang Jooeun.

640
00:47:05,085 --> 00:47:08,052
I will stick by your son...

641
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:14,031
...and make sure he stays
happy, beautiful and sexy.

642
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,680
It's nice to meet you.

643
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,505
Please look kindly on me.

644
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:26,609
Thank you very much...

645
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:28,833
...for giving birth to such a great man.

646
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,350
Thank you very much.

647
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:29,186
Counselor Kang.

648
00:48:29,503 --> 00:48:32,698
I am Youngho's grandmother, Lee Hongim.

649
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,429
If you're free...

650
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:37,490
...I'd like to see you tomorrow night.

651
00:48:42,994 --> 00:48:45,664
Did you pay your respects to your mom?

652
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:49,373
What were you doing?

653
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:54,220
A stone tower.

654
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:01,765
Is that how you build a stone tower?

655
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:05,418
There's no rule that says
it has to be stacked high.

656
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:06,995
Why should I?

657
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,605
What if it topples over?

658
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:11,245
Stacking two stones is secure.

659
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:13,320
That's your heart.

660
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:16,110
And that's mine.

661
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:22,416
Why does my heart look
slightly and incredibly bigger?

662
00:49:23,018 --> 00:49:23,941
Is that a problem?

663
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:25,941
Of course not.

664
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:30,830
Let's go.

665
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:34,368
Where are we going?

666
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:36,758
We're going to do
what everyone else does.

667
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:37,851
We're going on a date.

668
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:40,455
I hate the cold.

669
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:45,210
But we can walk outside
while holding hands.

670
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,518
You're such a romantic.

671
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:54,171
I'm cold. Let's change
into warmer clothes.

672
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:28,722
Darling.

673
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,578
Do you like it?

674
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:31,532
Sure.

675
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:33,354
This is fun.

676
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:07,976
When you're on a date,
you do embarrassing things

677
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,992
...and act like you have
a screw loose in your head.

678
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:14,004
If you're crazy about each other,
you can't act normal.

679
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:16,809
Dating is difficult.

680
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:20,370
What was that?
Are you crazy about me?

681
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:22,690
What?

682
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:26,455
I thought I just heard you say
that you're crazy about me.

683
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,300
Let's go. Oh, my!

684
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:29,720
How crazy are you about me?

685
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:32,643
Goodness. Why do you ask?

686
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:33,929
You already know the answer.

687
00:51:34,013 --> 00:51:35,663
I'm crazy about you, too.

688
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:56,636
Should we write one, too?

689
00:51:57,926 --> 00:51:58,792
Nah.

690
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:01,033
- Why not?
- No.

691
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:15,566
You're so funny.

692
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:17,574
You didn't want to do it.

693
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,895
Why are you thinking so hard?

694
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:22,573
It only took me a second to write this.

695
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:24,342
Be quiet.

696
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:25,463
I need to concentrate.

697
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:27,511
We only get one wish.

698
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:30,314
The first one?

699
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:32,584
No. The second?

700
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,014
I guess they're the same.

701
00:52:57,099 --> 00:52:58,630
Counsel Kang.

702
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:03,080
I am Youngho's grandmother, Lee Hongim.

703
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:05,829
If you're free...

704
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,653
...I'd like to see you tomorrow night.

705
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:21,322
Were you writing an essay for a test?

706
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:24,535
Was yours a short-answer test?

707
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,452
What's there to think about?

708
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:28,768
There's only one thing.

709
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,717
My finger is cold.

710
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:42,913
Look.

711
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,902
At least put a soju bottle cap as a ring.

712
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,455
I even went to your mom's memorial.

713
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:51,603
Forget it.

714
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,330
The rich are so stingy.

715
00:53:59,548 --> 00:54:03,250
I mean... I'm not being materialistic.

716
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:05,642
I already gave it to you.
Why are you acting dumb?

717
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:07,604
What?

718
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:53,884
I want to put this ring on you.

719
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,487
Could you come over here?

720
00:56:22,742 --> 00:56:25,378
Goodness.

721
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:33,432
Jooeun.

722
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:39,763
I may hurt you at times.

723
00:56:41,475 --> 00:56:45,269
It may also be difficult at times.

724
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:51,486
But I want to live with Kang Jooeun.

725
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:52,845
Forever.

726
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,700
Kang Jooeun is now...

727
00:57:17,182 --> 00:57:18,015
...mine.

728
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,865
"Kang Jooeun's wish: Youngho, Coach"

729
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:39,256
"Kim Youngho's wish:
Oh My Venus, Kang Jooeun"

730
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,123
"Oh My Venus"

731
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:35,408
Jooeun.

732
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,476
Won't you reconsider?

733
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,124
Miss Kang Jooeun has arrived.

734
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,391
You can give me enough money
to live on for the rest of my life...

735
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:45,234
...or insult and degrade me.

736
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,164
Even if you try to keep us apart...

737
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,924
...I cannot leave Youngho.

738
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,109
I'm going to stick right beside him.

739
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,392
I'm sorry.

740
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:59,508
Miss Kang. When you get
old, you become stubborn.

741
00:58:59,592 --> 00:59:01,805
If you're going to give me an envelope...

742
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:04,915
...I'll give one to you first.
