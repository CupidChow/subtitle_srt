00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,339
"Episode 4"

2
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,685
Did you not know about it?

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,596
About what?

4
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,294
Hypothyroidism.

5
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,943
I guess you didn't.

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,230
Wait a second.

7
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:35,470
Are you saying that I have hypothyroidism?

8
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:38,635
Don't you get physical check-ups?

9
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,478
Hold on a minute.

10
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:42,588
So I...

11
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:45,851
You shouldn't overwork yourself
and you must avoid stress.

12
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:49,856
That's why you fainted today
and on the plane.

13
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:57,289
At least I know about it now.

14
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:01,586
Why does it seem like you
feel bad about this?

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,470
It's my body.

16
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,663
It's my fault and my responsibility.

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,301
I'm grateful,

18
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,786
but you never give me a chance
to thank you.

19
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:18,944
Anyway,

20
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,652
I keep owing you.

21
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,581
Thank you.

22
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,229
Goodbye.

23
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,847
If you're going to do it,
let's do it right.

24
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,676
I am...

25
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,433
...John Kim.

26
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,601
If you have hypothyroidism,

27
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:25,712
it explains why you didn't lose weight
even though you exercised.

28
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,891
Then, what was I doing?

29
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:32,280
That crazy workout I was doing.

30
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,415
Oh, that?

31
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,852
It's what UFC athletes do to train.

32
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,215
Hey!

33
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:48,099
How dare you con an attorney?

34
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:56,494
I'm not threatening you.

35
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:57,923
Your shirt just keeps opening up.

36
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,291
Do you know how hard I worked?

37
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,999
I worked so hard.

38
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,901
I must have looked like such a fool.

39
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,169
We were so obvious,
but you still fell for it.

40
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,947
I don't know if you're naive or foolish.

41
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,658
You conned me,

42
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,409
but you're saying it's my fault?

43
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,611
I'm not blaming you.
I just can't understand.

44
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,063
Because it was urgent.

45
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,786
Because I was desperate.

46
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:34,179
Because I wanted to believe.

47
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:37,362
That's why people fall for it.

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,172
Not because they are stupid
or ignorant, you jerk.

49
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:50,053
I'll decide later
if I want to press charges or not.

50
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:55,358
I need to leave before my thyroid bursts.

51
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,899
Everything else is fine
but her blood test shows...

52
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:13,090
...her TSH levels...

53
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,049
It's something in the blood.

54
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,201
It's a bit high, which means...

55
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,010
She has hypothyroidism.

56
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,185
Are you a doctor?

57
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,151
She shouldn't have worked so hard.

58
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,033
She shouldn't have.

59
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,468
Go.

60
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:43,865
I'm going to knock you out.

61
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,215
You brat.

62
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,694
Ma'am, that's good.

63
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:21,783
Are you her guardian?

64
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,770
More than you are.

65
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,065
May I ask...

66
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,153
...what your relationship with her is?

67
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,874
She keeps fainting and I keep saving her.

68
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:41,351
I haven't decided yet...

69
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,978
...whether it's coincidence or fate.

70
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:47,872
Why is she...

71
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,561
Why does she keep...

72
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:58,674
It's nothing serious, right?

73
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,870
I have the right to be concerned.

74
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,949
I will get going,
if you're going to stay here.

75
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,516
Please...

76
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,357
...look after her.

77
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,267
But...

78
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:36,077
...can...

79
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:37,653
...I...

80
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,118
...really change?

81
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,115
I'll believe I can change...

82
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:44,581
...since it's you, John Kim.

83
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,896
Because it was urgent.

84
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,673
Because I was desperate.

85
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,171
Because I wanted to believe.

86
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,757
That's why people fall for it, you jerk.

87
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,127
Even now, she's important?

88
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,453
Kang Jooeun.

89
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,442
Where isn't he here, yet?

90
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,580
"Oh Soojin"

91
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:05,016
Hi. I'm almost there.

92
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,516
Okay.

93
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,349
"Lawyer fainting on live show"

94
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,048
"Fainting video"

95
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,254
Thank you.

96
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,855
Thank you.

97
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,324
Why did you drink so much?

98
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,505
Here you are.

99
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,369
I thought you weren't coming.

100
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,016
I said I'd come.

101
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,863
I went to see Jooeun.

102
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:04,779
I heard she fainted.

103
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,997
I see.

104
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:12,013
She had someone there.

105
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,495
So,

106
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:18,658
were you upset?

107
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,271
I was relieved, not upset.

108
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,417
Later on...

109
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:40,021
...if I marry someone...

110
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,132
...and get a divorce...

111
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:45,728
...I don't think I'll be able to remarry.

112
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,524
I'll feel too bad.

113
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,436
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

114
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,277
It's okay as long as you're sorry.

115
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,475
That's good enough.

116
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,751
I'm the bad guy anyway.

117
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:13,616
I think I know how you feel.

118
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,519
I feel like I'm...

119
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,834
...the evil jerk as well.

120
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,663
To you, I mean.

121
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:42,624
It's nonsense.

122
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,656
I thought you had cancer or something.

123
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,847
It's not even thyroid cancer.
It's just hypothyroidism.

124
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,040
A lot of people have hypothyroidism.

125
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,326
You're just one of those people.

126
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,388
Hey, Hyunwoo.

127
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,562
When I got a divorce, your mom said to me,

128
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,095
"Don't cry even if you fall."

129
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:11,198
"Every cloud has a silver lining."

130
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,483
If something bad happens,

131
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,301
something good will happen too.

132
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,256
Mommy.

133
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:24,422
You miss your mommy?
It's okay. Don't cry.

134
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:26,358
That's not it.

135
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,051
Jaehyeok is getting married...

136
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:31,145
...to a 21-year-old.

137
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,482
He got her pregnant.

138
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,150
He doesn't have money or a job,

139
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:39,085
but he is talented in some way.

140
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:43,094
What's wrong?

141
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,063
You again?

142
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:48,800
Jaehyeok, that brat.

143
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,681
Why that...

144
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,067
I worked so hard,

145
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,480
but I got conned.

146
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,313
What? You were what?

147
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:02,810
Never mind. I'll tell you later.

148
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:04,742
Gosh.

149
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,242
You must be sleepy.

150
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:09,480
Stop babbling and go to sleep.

151
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,798
Now.

152
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,329
Go ahead and lie down.

153
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:17,158
Don't cook anything. I have no appetite.

154
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:20,965
Don't worry. Why would I do that?

155
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,996
I'm going to take some kimchi.
You still have a lot.

156
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,612
-Hyunwoo.
-What?

157
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,901
You really didn't put that plant there?

158
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,748
Go to sleep already!

159
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,040
It really did come back to life.

160
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,234
Jooeun, it really...

161
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,540
You should've become
Miss Korea when you could.

162
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,288
Why did you become a lawyer?

163
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:55,377
It's still a miracle
that you became a lawyer though.

164
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:59,020
What's with the hypothyroidism?

165
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:01,298
Go to sleep.

166
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,200
It's okay. Sleep.

167
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,681
Start.

168
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,759

Just tell me.

173
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,346
You'll kill me at this rate.
Did I do something wrong?

174
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:18,014
I think it's my fault.

175
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,401
By the way,

176
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:24,212
why do you keep
pulling your shoulder back?

177
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:26,285
I don't know.

178
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,728
-Does it hurt?
-No.

179
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:31,054
I think I'm just worried
because it was injured before.

180
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,875
When did you become so afraid?

181
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,167
-Get another physical.
-Okay.

182
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,438
Hey guys!

183
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,169
It's time to eat!

184
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,238
Hey, you!

185
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:58,618
What are you doing in front of the food?

186
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:01,195
-If you don't eat it, I'll take it away.
-Jiwoong.

187
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,504
Just kidding.

188
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,315
My grandma used to say that to me.

189
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,056
I told Jooeun.

190
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,515
I told her that...

191
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:14,895
...I'm John Kim.

192
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:15,815
-What?
-What?

193
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,486
She has hypothyroidism.

194
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:21,490
Then...

195
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,903
I shouldn't have made her
work so hard.

196
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,302
That's why she was...

197
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,012
...so swollen.

198
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:39,380
I hate crying because of other people,

199
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,276
but I hate crying for myself even more.

200
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:45,232
Gosh.

201
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,548
They'll say even my eyelids got fat.

202
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:49,550
It's all over.

203
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,762
It's all over.

204
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:55,086
Should I just call in sick?

205
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,700
Thank you.

206
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,606
This video is hot right now.

207
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:04,547
Why did she faint? She's so huge.

208
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,349
I shouldn't laugh.

209
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,961
Then, don't laugh.

210
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:11,953
Lawyer Kang.

211
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:14,244
Are you okay?

212
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,073
I'm not okay,

213
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:17,972
so face forward.

214
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,249
Lawyer Kang, you don't look well.

215
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,686
I have 13 months left on my loan,

216
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,945
but my penniless little brother
is getting married.

217
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:42,455
And...

218
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,895
...I have hypothyroidism.

219
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:49,192
This is why I'm not okay.

220
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,304
I'm so drunk.

221
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,019
Aren't you cold?

222
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,276
No. I'm warm.

223
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,121
-Oh, no.
-Careful.

224
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:38,377
I said to get a bouquet. What is this?

225
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,671
This freshens up the air.

226
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,690
Ma'am will forgive us if
she gets some fresh air.

227
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:47,174
What do we say to her?
I don't know how to face her.

228
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:48,762
She loves me,

229
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:50,793
and she's really nice.

230
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,087
Don't worry.

231
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:05,814
"Physical Examination Result"

232
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,536
"Recommend consultation."

233
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,629
"Dangerous, cautious."

234
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,271
Why didn't they call me and
tell me about this?

235
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:26,477
Are you okay?

236
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,641
Thanks to you, I'm fine.

237
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,112
I already told the president
not to worry.

238
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,397
Yes, I heard.

239
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:39,570
Well, I'm glad you're okay...

240
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:41,598
...but the firm isn't so okay.

241
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:51,585
First, let's figure out how to
address each other.

242
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,206
"How to address each other"?

243
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,321
Are you telling me...

244
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:00,210
...that you want me to
call you "Vice President"?

245
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:03,217
Shouldn't you?

246
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:05,214
What will others think?

247
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,603
This is our workplace, after all.

248
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,900
You may appear rude.

249
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,590
-You really...
-"Vice President Oh, really..."

250
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,391
That's how you want me to speak to you?

251
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:15,259
Are you joking?

252
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,517
"Shall I speak like this to you, ma'am?"

253
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,162
"Are you kidding, ma'am?"

254
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:26,440
I am not kidding, Lawyer Kang.

255
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:31,033
Questions about "the fainting attorney"
are flooding our website.

256
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:35,672
The president suggests
you work from home for a while.

257
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:39,171
Until things quiet down a bit.

258
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,716
Soojin.

259
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,081
Did I commit a crime?

260
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,109
Did I say that you did?

261
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:47,863
Vice President Oh,

262
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,660
I'm fine, so...

263
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:51,781
Just because you're fine,

264
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,780
it doesn't mean everything else is fine.

265
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:58,678
We are lawyers, not comedians.

266
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,027
Soojin.

267
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,582
As your superior, I'm telling you...

268
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,049
...to work at home for one week.

269
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:05,924
Hey!

270
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,100
Yes, I'm wearing the same clothes
from yesterday.

271
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:22,872
You pick up on things quickly.

272
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,273
See you.

273
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:33,284
Ma'am.

274
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,433
What happened?
Did she insult you?

275
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,615
Sue her. You are a lawyer.

276
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,131
She is also a lawyer.
A vice president at that.

277
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:49,717
Do you want me to do something about it?
I'm going to...

278
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,616
I'm mad at you too.

279
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,367
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

280
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,983
Please forgive me.

281
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,383
I mean it 100 percent.

282
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:15,708
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,889
We were just trying to protect Youngho.

284
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:20,829
We apologize.

285
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,363
How are you feeling?

286
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:27,380
Because you were sick, my heart ached too.

287
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:31,453
-Heartbreak.
-It was my fault that you fainted.

288
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,845
I have no excuses.

289
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,291
I'm really sorry.

290
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,265
Ma'am, we were crazy. Crazy.

291
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:42,440
He was crazy too.
We were too reckless.

292
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,834
Since you are an attorney,

293
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,977
if we got caught, we would've been sliced.

294
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:51,009
You punk.

295
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,887
She smiled.

296
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:58,506
We're good now.

297
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,773
Get up.

298
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,735
What would you like to drink?

299
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,653
Are you giving us something to drink?

300
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:10,269
Should I beat you up instead?

301
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,395
You are still...

302
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:14,581
...my guests, and you brought me a gift.

303
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,129
Ma'am.

304
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,018
Ma'am, this...

305
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:23,676
...will freshen up the air.

306
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,601
Why didn't you wake me up?

307
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,174
You were sound asleep.

308
00:22:58,395 --> 00:22:59,596
Do you want to come inside?

309
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,350
Next time.

310
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,801
I have a golf meeting
early tomorrow morning.

311
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,325
You must be tired.

312
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,411
Bye.

313
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:21,728
Sleep well.

314
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,644
I'll call you tomorrow.

315
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:29,310
Okay.

316
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:15,924
Thank you for forgiving us.

317
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,114
See you.

318
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:20,671
Where is he going?

319
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,404
Ma'am, good luck.

320
00:24:25,286 --> 00:24:26,790
What is he talking about?

321
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:29,830
My gosh.

322
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:37,642
Are you still mad at me?

323
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,943
I've only forgiven Jiwoong and Junseong.

324
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:46,130
Don't you need me anymore?

325
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,527
Do you have proof...

326
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:53,441
...that you are in fact, John Kim?

327
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:56,443
Why didn't you ask that before?

328
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,012
It seems like you don't like it
that I'm John Kim.

329
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:02,624
Should I leave?

330
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,684
I just hate that you deceived me.

331
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,517
It doesn't matter who it is.

332
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:10,993
Even if it's John Kim.

333
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,601
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:22,968
Why is it a secret...

335
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:28,380
...that you are John Kim?

336
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:31,824
I was born...

337
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,292
...with a silver spoon in my mouth.

338
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:40,050
My grandmother and father
will be enraged if they find out.

339
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,663
They will think it's a disgrace.

340
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,443
What are you talking about?

341
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,848
If you don't want to tell me,
it's all right.

342
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,694
I'm not that interested anyway.

343
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:55,225
Let's just say that
not being able to lie is your strength.

344
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,800
Shall we go now?

345
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:58,278
Where to?

346
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,485
Aren't you going to lose weight?

347
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:07,281
I was duped once,
but I won't be duped twice.

348
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:09,258
Also,

349
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,563
I'm a lawyer.

350
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:14,881
I'm very meticulous.

351
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,190
Is this a contract?

352
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,698
Where's your copy?

353
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:24,972
What?

354
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,948
"Physical Examination Result"

355
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:29,516
This is your physical assessment.

356
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,242
You're really meticulous.

357
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:38,185
You are illegitimately seizing
private documents!

358
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,480
It will save time.
You needed this physical anyway.

359
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,090
Give it back!

360
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,789
It's dated October 9th.
That's recent.

361
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,120
Dangerous, cautious,
recommend consultation...

362
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:50,595
What's wrong with you?

363
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:53,121
I need to be cautious with you.

364
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:55,304
I'm also dangerous too.

365
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:59,598
I've already seen it all.
You don't have to be shy.

366
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,407
Do you think...

367
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:05,018
...your clothes can hide all that?

368
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:14,024
What are you doing?

369
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:18,326
A contract can be broken,
but I'm not like that.

370
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:19,932
I keep my word.

371
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:21,734
From now on,

372
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:25,018
your body belongs to me.

373
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:26,534
It's up to me.

374
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,949
I won't take "no" for an answer.

375
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:35,043
From now on,

376
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:39,956
you can't stop even if you want to.

377
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:41,839
If you understand,

378
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,291
let's go.

379
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,744
"The Late Seo Jiyeon"

380
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:17,426
How is Youngho doing?

381
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:20,687
He doesn't want me to be too close.

382
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,760
I'm monitoring him from a distance.

383
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:25,120
Since he finished unpacking,

384
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,691
give him some time to settle in.

385
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,286
By the way,

386
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,586
how are things going with that girl?

387
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:35,080
They met each other once
after the blind date.

388
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:38,402
She seems nice and healthy.

389
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,138
I think she's a good match.

390
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:49,283
What are you doing here?

391
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:51,680
It's getting cold.

392
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,257
I was worried about your health.

393
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,852
I've brought you some tea.

394
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,376
You can go back.

395
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,410
You shouldn't be here.

396
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:02,981
Please forgive me.

397
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,416
Do you...

398
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,608
...have time today?

399
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,131
Youngjun is coming home today, isn't he?

400
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,738
You should pick him up.

401
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:20,813
We can all have dinner together.

402
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:22,554
Thank you.

403
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:32,961
The VIP center could be upgraded
to a VVIP medical exam center.

404
00:29:34,183 --> 00:29:36,000
It looks very nice.

405
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,992
You have some great ideas.

406
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,834
It must be because you were a medallist.

407
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:43,849
"As for medical service, Gahong is..."

408
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,320
"...the best in the country."

409
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,140
It's also good publicity.

410
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,712
We can differentiate ourselves...

411
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:50,736
...and it's also good
for global marketing.

412
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:54,080
Let's go with this.
It seems like a good plan.

413
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:55,396
Are you...

414
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,218
...still digging things up on Youngho?

415
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,052
I haven't found much yet.

416
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,250
When I find something concrete,
I'll report to you.

417
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,879
"Kim Youngho"

418
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,564
She said, "Don't come".

419
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:26,505
May I ask...

420
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:28,428
...what your relationship with her is?

421
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,865
She keeps fainting and I keep saving her.

422
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,762
I haven't decided yet
whether it's coincidence or fate.

423
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:54,360
It's me, Woosik.

424
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:57,728
Jaehyeok is worried about you.

425
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,366
How are you feeling?

426
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:05,061
How do you know that guy?

427
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,348
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

428
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:30,427
"Im Woosik"

429
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,825
Okay, good.

430
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:46,577
Okay.

431
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:50,546
25. Five more seconds.

432
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,383
You're almost there. Come on, man.

433
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:55,339
How many did I do this time?

434
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,382
-Please wait a moment.
-Sure.

435
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,773
-Are you Korean Snake?
-Yes.

436
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,322
-Why did you reject me?
-What?

437
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,535
I'm talking about the commercial.

438
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,953
-You didn't want to do it with me?
-What?

439
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:39,036
Are you from the outer space?

440
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:42,499
It's me, Jang Yijin.
The queen of commercials.

441
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:45,269
The woman who has lovely skin
and a gorgeous body.

442
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:48,338
The celebrity who is
the most desired by men.

443
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:53,396
She is really here.

444
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,051
Hi, Yijin.

445
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,776
Hi.

446
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,209
Hey, Yijin.

447
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,119
I'm sorry.

448
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:03,405
I'm sorry.

449
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,502
He is the one who should be sorry.

450
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:11,994
I couldn't even sleep.

451
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:13,931
I just said I needed time to think.

452
00:33:14,816 --> 00:33:16,084
"Time to think"?

453
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:20,113
Do you really need time to think about it?

454
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,598
Are you really a man?

455
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,275
Did you have an appendectomy?

456
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,132
Yijin, you're embarrassing me.

457
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:33,217
The appendix is on your right side.
Let's go out.

458
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,196
Right.

459
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,486
Hey.

460
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,324
He seems sick.

461
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,287
"Kang Jooeun, 32 years old"

462
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,432
I'm sad about having hypothyroidism.

463
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:51,065
But I don't hate that
I'm only 32 years old.

464
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:54,438
You are cheerful.

465
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:58,332
I can't believe that I have
to take this medicine all my life.

466
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:03,053
Why do you think you have to
take it all your life?

467
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:04,735
My goodness.

468
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:06,633
You make it sound like
it's something valuable.

469
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:09,284
That's why I'm telling you
you shouldn't continue to take it.

470
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,591
You don't have to take it
once your thyroid recovers.

471
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,802
Where are we going, by the way?

472
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,235
How should I put this...

473
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,181
Let's say that it's a search and seizure.

474
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:39,440
"Beauty Body Clinic Center"

475
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:45,319
In accordance with Article 12 of
the constitution, without consent...

476
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:46,445
What else could I do?

477
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:49,731
Do you want me to measure you?

478
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,620
I have the right...

479
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,668
...to deny this search and
seizure interrogation.

480
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,080
I told you that I wouldn't
take "no" for an answer.

481
00:34:57,187 --> 00:34:58,953
Your body belongs to me.

482
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,934
It belongs to me. It's up to me now.

483
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:09,976
I think I also have the right
not to look like a pervert.

484
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:41,339
Hey...

485
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,005
I'd rather you look at me.

486
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:45,624
-Hush.
-Please remain silent.

487
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,022
Hello.

488
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:12,019
There will be a family dinner.

489
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,172
I can't attend.

490
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:16,334
Youngjun has come to Korea for a while.

491
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:19,676
Please tell them that...

492
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,614
...I'm far away and won't be able
to make it on time.

493
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:25,152
I'll do so.

494
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:37,704
That must be Youngjun, Ma'am.

495
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,268
She has been missing her son so badly.

496
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,871
It's only for three years.

497
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:55,984
Chairwoman.

498
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,519
I forgot it's a family meeting.

499
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,070
Did you hear?

500
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,576
Youngjun got a scholarship again.

501
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,578
What was it called?

502
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,991
Ivy...

503
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:14,124
He received a scholarship from
an Ivy League.

504
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:18,126
He's really smart.
He takes after his family.

505
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:21,187
Namcheol.

506
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,634
You did a good job.

507
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,992
Your mother must be very proud of you.

508
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:28,197
Thank you.

509
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,306
He is also handsome like his father.

510
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,272
Youngjun.

511
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,876
You have to be exemplary
both in behavior and mind.

512
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,750
Gahong is not an ordinary family.

513
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,885
We have a long history and tradition...

514
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:52,422
How long will you stay?

515
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,772
He'll stay for a week.

516
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,176
He has a lot to study for.

517
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,795
Take care of yourself.

518
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,705
Tell me if you need anything.

519
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,825
Yes, thank you.

520
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:05,199
Father.

521
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,754
-Please excuse me.
-Youngho coming back...

522
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,130
...is not something to ignore.

523
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,852
This is my last wish.

524
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,500
Please help...

525
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:19,102
...Youngho find his place.

526
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,429
Please help him.

527
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:31,997
This is delicious.

528
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:35,299
I'm glad you like it.

529
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:57,639
Should I leave my car here?

530
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:06,188
Weren't you embarrassed a while ago?

531
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,490
I've left all that in my dreams.

532
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,872
See you tomorrow.

533
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:21,141
Are you really John Kim?

534
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:23,646
It's really you this time, right?

535
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:24,655
As time passes,

536
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:27,070
you'll know for sure.

537
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:30,156
I'm a pretty innocent person.

538
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:31,817
Can I really trust you?

539
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,282
You laugh whenever I'm serious.

540
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,451
Don't worry, innocent Miss Kang Jooeun.

541
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:44,587
As long as I'm John Kim,
I won't give up on you.

542
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:47,179
I'll work hard too.

543
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:50,579
I don't give up either.

544
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,451
I'm a little humiliated,

545
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,687
but I still owe you a lot.

546
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,014
Good night.

547
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,313
Ma'am!

548
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:39,997
Excuse us for coming so early.

549
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,164
I am your hired hand today.

550
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:45,083
Good morning, Ma'am.

551
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,679
Hold on a second.

552
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,843
Why are you here so early?

553
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,251
I said yesterday that I'd see you today.

554
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,168
What?

555
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,068
But still...

556
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:06,438
Is your boyfriend here, perhaps?

557
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:07,748
She was dumped.

558
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:08,933
Oh, my gosh.

559
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:14,507
Come in.

560
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:18,795
Excuse us.

561
00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:24,480
He doesn't value privacy at all.

562
00:41:26,644 --> 00:41:27,388
Gosh.

563
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,303
Find them.

564
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:47,470
Go.

565
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:48,966
Yes, sir.

566
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,580
Junseong.

567
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:15,347
Is anything salvageable?

568
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:19,906
-Jiwoong.
-There's nothing to save, sir.

569
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:22,677
Nothing. They're all dead.

570
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,138
What? These are good for you.

571
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:43,676
I'll be short, since you won't
understand anyway.

572
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,828
It's bad for hypothyroidism.

573
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,639
I ate them so diligently.

574
00:42:51,843 --> 00:42:53,129
This sesame oil is...

575
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,835
...becoming fermented.

576
00:42:57,724 --> 00:42:59,659
I didn't know because it was in the back.

577
00:42:59,782 --> 00:43:01,784
This was in the fridge.

578
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,176
What is this?

579
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:04,581
It looks like mosquito repellent.

580
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:08,649
I wanted to prolong its use.

581
00:43:11,814 --> 00:43:13,538
These are the foods...

582
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:15,243
...that you can eat.

583
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,234
Not these.

584
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:19,766
But...

585
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,589
...am I supposed to fast?

586
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:28,566
I love seaweed and seaweed soup.

587
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,327
You should eat seaweed...

588
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,596
...once a year, on your birthday.

589
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:35,798
Ma'am.

590
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:40,769
-Whose are these?
-Oh my.

591
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:41,991
Your grandma's?

592
00:43:46,038 --> 00:43:48,202
You have good style.

593
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,986
It's like Kim Duhwan.

594
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,038
Insomnia?

595
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:56,037
I sleep well anywhere.

596
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:59,100
You don't sleep well
when and where you should, right?

597
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,003
You sleep on the couch.

598
00:44:01,117 --> 00:44:03,319
You pull all-nighters and binge sleep.

599
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:08,945
Caffeine overkill is bad
for your digestive tract.

600
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,858
You have a high body fat percentage
but lack exercise.

601
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,297
You get constipated
and your intestines are weak.

602
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:16,074
You must have knee and other joint issues.

603
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:18,458
From your posture I assume
you have back problems.

604
00:44:18,576 --> 00:44:21,075
Your hips are misaligned.

605
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,894
Your hips are probably...

606
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:29,393
With hypothyroidism,
you're probably exhausted easily.

607
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:32,397
You get cold often and are irritable.

608
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,304
Are you...

609
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:36,140
...a skilful quack?

610
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:38,218
What?

611
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:40,528
Anyway,

612
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,773
we need to see the test results first,

613
00:44:42,907 --> 00:44:44,225
but I'm sure I'm right.

614
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:05,696
This isn't going to kill you,
so listen up.

615
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:09,919
The way you sleep, walk, eat, and move.

616
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,595
You must redo them all.

617
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,739
Okay?

618
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:20,382
Your bad eating habits caused
your illness...

619
00:45:21,947 --> 00:45:23,693
...and your body.

620
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,862
Are you really John Kim?

621
00:45:54,132 --> 00:45:55,521
It's really you this time, right?

622
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:57,923
I'm a pretty innocent person.

623
00:45:58,196 --> 00:45:59,415
Can I really trust you?

624
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,904
I'll work hard too.

625
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:04,224
I don't give up either.

626
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:42,356
I could've gone to you.

627
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,744
You didn't have to...

628
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:47,387
That would've been nice but I had to.

629
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,640
I'm not cold.

630
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:52,982
You'll need it later.

631
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:55,688
Look through this now.

632
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:07,047
To put it simply,

633
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,293
you are obese.

634
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,575
Especially...

635
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:14,360
...in the abdomen and buttocks region.

636
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:17,309
You have various adult diseases...

637
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:20,071
...and a herniated disk. Let's go.

638
00:47:20,188 --> 00:47:24,224
Wait. Is this another search and seizure?

639
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,710
You're being arrested this time.

640
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,311
No, is it a detention?

641
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:33,869
Detention?

642
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:42,870
Where am I being transported to?

643
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:44,054
We're almost there.

644
00:47:57,313 --> 00:48:00,853
So this is your house.

645
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:05,766
From now on, don't call me
"John Kim" or "hey, you".

646
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:06,965
Call me "Coach".

647
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:09,385
"Coach"?

648
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:11,643
I have a lot to teach you.

649
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:15,055
Okay, Coach.

650
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:17,641
But Coach,

651
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,612
must I keep being hauled
around like cargo?

652
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:22,056
Can't we do it elsewhere?

653
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:23,877
People recognize you now...

654
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:25,475
...and everything you need is here.

655
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:27,179
And I am?

656
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:29,164
You're secret trainer, John Kim.

657
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,043
I guess me being hauled here is
better for you, John...

658
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:35,940
I mean, for you, Coach.

659
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,583
We will take turns training you.

660
00:48:41,725 --> 00:48:42,963
I feel bad.

661
00:48:43,062 --> 00:48:45,264
Everyone is working hard for you
so you work hard, too.

662
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:47,162
Think of it as retaking the bar exam.

663
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,775
I almost died studying for the bar exam.

664
00:48:50,454 --> 00:48:51,971
Everyone said it was a miracle.

665
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:56,734
Since you've used up your miracle,

666
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,732
pray for luck this time.

667
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:03,480
I'm not saying I want beauty that
I never had.

668
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:05,571
I was...

669
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:11,338
Did you just say "beauty"?

670
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:17,640
You never saw me before,
so don't say anything.

671
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,239
My nickname used to be Venus of Daegu.

672
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,970
There wasn't a boy there...

673
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:27,121
...for whom I wasn't their first love.

674
00:49:28,662 --> 00:49:29,679
Forget it.

675
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:31,786
You'll see for yourself soon enough.

676
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:33,007
Are you...

677
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,968
...a pathological liar?

678
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:39,298
What?

679
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,479
You'll regret it later, so don't...

680
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,935
I'll regret it on my own,

681
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,207
so you just stretch.

682
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,821
What am I, a puppy?

683
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:04,715
Yes, Coach.

684
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:09,868
If you're too tired...

685
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,144
-I'll let you know.
-...deal with it.

686
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,422
I'm fine.

687
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:21,545
What?

688
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:25,327
Okay.

689
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:39,982
Have you heard of squats?

690
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:41,677
I've done them before.

691
00:50:52,537 --> 00:50:55,473
They will hurt your joints
because of your weight.

692
00:50:55,724 --> 00:50:56,694
Stop that.

693
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:00,724
Please use less humiliating terms,

694
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:01,833
Coach.

695
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:03,570
Follow me.

696
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:05,319
Feet shoulder width apart.

697
00:51:07,157 --> 00:51:09,293
Cross your arms.

698
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:14,899
Flex the muscles in your back.

699
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:16,346
Straighten your back.

700
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:18,723
Face forward.

701
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:22,036
Squeeze your glutes.

702
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:26,328
Slowly, go down.

703
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:29,162
Up.

704
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:31,073
Up.

705
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:34,711
Again.

706
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:36,666
Down.

707
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:40,618
No, not like that.

708
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:42,218
Did you say "beauty"?

709
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:46,790
You'll see.

710
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:49,181
I'm sorry. Let's focus.

711
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:50,281
Down.

712
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:53,148
Down.

713
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:56,834
Up.

714
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:01,130
It'll be easier if you
strengthen your core. Down.

715
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:02,838
Down.

716
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:10,792
Sleep only in your bed.

717
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:13,792
Even if you can't sleep,
get into the habit.

718
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,721
Wear socks if your feet get cold.

719
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:23,148
Stretch 20 minutes after waking up.

720
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:27,620
Take your medicine before breakfast.

721
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:28,929
Drink lukewarm water.

722
00:52:29,902 --> 00:52:33,670
Cold water may hinder digestion.

723
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:52,660
What now? What?

724
00:52:56,472 --> 00:52:59,569
Pretend someone is pushing your forehead.

725
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:02,877
Pull your chin in
and straighten your back.

726
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:04,799
Lastly,

727
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,030
you need to squeeze those glutes.

728
00:53:11,044 --> 00:53:13,146
Yes, Coach.

729
00:53:20,062 --> 00:53:21,081
Get lost.

730
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:22,927
Get lost!

731
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:32,770
How is he annoying me
even in my imagination?

732
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:05,705
Are you okay?

733
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,194
It must be uncomfortable.

734
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:14,599
I got used to it now.
I even doze off at times.

735
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:20,083
I'm sorry for disturbing your training.

736
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,672
I got caught lying to you.

737
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:23,097
I'm glad I can make it up to you.

738
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:26,191
Thank you for keeping Youngho's secret.

739
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:29,004
You make it sound like
I'm blackmailing you.

740
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:32,009
Anyway, thank you. All of you.

741
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,879
I'll repay you with my beauty.

742
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:35,670
I'll be looking forward to it.

743
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,651
We're almost there. Get ready.

744
00:54:40,204 --> 00:54:41,498
Ready to go!

745
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,420
Oh, my gosh.

746
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:45,293
Jiwoong.

747
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:33,561
Yes, Coach.

748
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:42,704
Thank you for today.

749
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:49,365
I lost 5 kilograms.

750
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:51,199
That's a kilo a day.

751
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:55,632
Being overly optimistic is bad for you.

752
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:59,250
It may be because you're taking medicine
for your hypothyroidism.

753
00:56:01,346 --> 00:56:02,347
Go inside.

754
00:56:02,516 --> 00:56:03,483
It's late.

755
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:04,696
Yes, Coach!

756
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,109
Who is it?

757
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:44,254
Who is it?

758
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,871
"Coach"

759
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,779
Jooeun, it's me.

760
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:58,994
Who...

761
00:57:00,141 --> 00:57:02,710
Why are you pretending
like you don't know me?

762
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:25,666
Why are you so surprised?

763
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:28,624
It's me.

764
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:31,405
Why are you doing this?

765
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:41,921
I brought you...

766
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:46,843
...that plant that you like.

767
00:57:56,426 --> 00:57:57,767
Help me.

768
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,624
"Oh My Venus"

769
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:39,659
Why did you become a lawyer
if you can't even protect yourself?

770
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,012
For somebody, it feels like
the end of the world...

771
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:45,831
...but for others, it's trivial.

772
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,909
I don't want to go home. I'm scared.

773
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:50,691
What's your relationship?

774
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:53,659
I know her well.
We've known each other for a while.

775
00:58:54,027 --> 00:58:57,792
If you show up in front of Jooeun again,
I'll kill you.

776
00:58:58,344 --> 00:58:59,647
Reincarnation definitely exists.

777
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:03,766
I must have done
something horrible in my past life.

778
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:04,795
Let's go.

779
00:59:05,744 --> 00:59:07,290
Somewhere outside your earth.
