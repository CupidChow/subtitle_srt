1
00:00:02,822 --> 00:00:04,920
Oh, my arms, legs, shoulders, and knees...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,340
"Episode 6"

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,145
She isn't even that pretty
for a Western woman.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,247
For an Asian woman,
I have western features, too.

5
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,078
How long is he staying there?

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,953
Why don't you just live
with Anna Sue in the States?

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,737
Eight.

8
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,822
Nine.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,408
Ten.

10
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,564
Eleven.

11
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,971
Oh yes, I'm doing so well.

12
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,022
Twelve.

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,849
Did everyone go somewhere?

14
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,058
Goodness.

15
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:13,688
You startled me.

16
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,214
Why did you sneak in?

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,659
Help me up.

18
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,543
What's this?

19
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,525
I never saw this before.

20
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,599
Stop that.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,999
What are you doing to my cheek?

22
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,002
This thing here.

23
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,373
Where did you get it?

24
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,281
Do you think I picked it up
on the streets?

25
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,309
You're wearing makeup.

26
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,122
Are you trying to impress someone?

27
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,460
It's just sunblock.

28
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,379
The fluorescent light might tan my skin.

29
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:32,981
I'm so sore.

30
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,688
I must have worked out too much.

31
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,757
I'm aching all over.

32
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:41,027
My face is half the size now.

33
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,432
That's what happens.

34
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,399
You usually lose weight from the top down.

35
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,543
Your belly is still...

36
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,592
I said that my face is half the size,

37
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,130
not elsewhere.

38
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,944
I haven't heard that
cheerful voice in a while.

39
00:02:58,924 --> 00:02:59,788
It's nice.

40
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,673
You must have enjoyed
your trip to the States.

41
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,320
Your face is half the size, as well.

42
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:09,341
Well,

43
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:13,075
it was a meaningful and valuable time.

44
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,333
It was the moment...

45
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,997
...I'd been waiting for.

46
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,944
You, Rascal! Get over here!

47
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,075
His name is Rascal.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,778
Rascal.

49
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,549
You need a beating.

50
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,497
Rascal, you're dead today.

51
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,151
Go on.

52
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,781
You, Rascal!

53
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,344
What did you do there?

54
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:48,495
Answer me!

55
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:28,352
Based on my opinion,

56
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,041
you are 99.9 percent healed.

57
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:34,187
It wouldn't be an exaggeration...

58
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:35,939
...to call it a miracle.

59
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,052
"The Strength of Time Spent Alone"

60
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,827
A meaningful and valuable time?

61
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,281
The moment you'd been waiting for?

62
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,265
So you really had...

63
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:05,144
...a restful and erotic evening?

64
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,516
What's this?

65
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:18,560
What?

66
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:20,220
This.

67
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,024
I wanted to cook the prodigal son
a homemade meal.

68
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,912
Although I regret it now.

69
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,437
I don't eat carbohydrates.

70
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,732
I also keep a low-salt diet.

71
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,211
Homemade meals are
supposed to be like that.

72
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,782
It's supposed to be spicy,
sweet, salty and warm.

73
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,256
That's what food is and that's
what it's supposed to taste like.

74
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,123
What's the point of being sexy all over?

75
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,913
Your life has no flavor.

76
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,958
What is this?

77
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,223
This.

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,805
It's a food cover.

79
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,624
It's the thing moms use when they
don't want to set the table twice.

80
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,727
Your mom didn't use that?

81
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,988
You must have been spoiled.

82
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,868
I'm seeing a lot of things
for the first time today.

83
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,676
I'm going to wash up
and then go get a massage.

84
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:20,521
You should get massages from men.

85
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,738
That way...

86
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,350
Lower, please.

87
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:41,765
Stop!

88
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:44,372
Don't...

89
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:45,732
...get a massage.

90
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:46,693
What?

91
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,610
Why not? I'm so sore.

92
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,315
I'll do it instead.

93
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:58,497
Oh my.

94
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,832
What?

95
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,265
You will?

96
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,196
I'm sore from head to toe.

97
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:11,885
Is that okay?

98
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:14,896
Fine.

99
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,870
I don't know if I washed my feet today.

100
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:32,100
This is my first time dancing
without alcohol in my system.

101
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,482
That thing does a better job
than I do in this case.

102
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,521
What's this for?

103
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,328
This could look a bit enticing.

104
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:53,940
I don't want it to be another
restful and erotic night.

105
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:02,782
Can you turn the volume up?

106
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:07,678
I wonder what happened today.

107
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,400
Thank you for watching.

108
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,741
Please turn this off.

109
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,373
You're not done yet.

110
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,721
I feel so refreshed.

111
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:30,930
That's enough.

112
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:32,529
That's enough.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,925
You keep speaking to me that way.

114
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,220
I'm your coach. Speak to me with
a little more respect.

115
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,681
I did.

116
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:49,378
Rather than a stiff
superior-inferior relationship...

117
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,103
...wouldn't it be better...

118
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,331
...to be...

119
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,774
Go on.

120
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:03,309
More like friends?

121
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:05,975
Friends?

122
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:08,866
You mean...

123
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,352
..."friends" as in people
with mutual affections?

124
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:13,550
That kind of 'friend'?

125
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,680
Mother, is something wrong?

126
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,748
No.

127
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,274
You can go rest now.

128
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,786
I'll give you a massage.

129
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,283
I'm fine.

130
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:51,747
You don't need to do that.

131
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,600
It's my duty to serve you.

132
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,769
I know what people say about me.

133
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,965
"Her only daughter died,"

134
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,368
"but all she worries about
is the company."

135
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:09,072
"She married off her son-in-law..."

136
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:11,077
"...and is bleeding him dry."

137
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:16,416
"She's a selfish old woman
who abuses her son-in-law's wife."

138
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,722
-Mother...
-Whenever...

139
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,836
...you call me that...

140
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,529
...it weighs me down more and more.

141
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:30,897
Youngjun is smart and polite.

142
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:32,854
You raised him well.

143
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,764
It's all...

144
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,483
...thanks to you.

145
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,976
Make sure you teach him well.

146
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,989
Don't get greedy...

147
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,863
...and don't get his hopes up.

148
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,524
"Through that period,
I realized that I could change"

149
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,358
"The feeling of loneliness
to great energy"

150
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:04,691
Youngho!

151
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,415
Long time no see.

152
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,331
Youngho, I've missed you.

153
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:19,518
Junseong told me.

154
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,296
You're well now, right?

155
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,352
You feel good, right?

156
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,818
My prayers were answered.

157
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:28,613
Thank you, God.

158
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:33,020
Thank you, God, for helping my Youngho.

159
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:35,096
My big brother Youngho.

160
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,498
Oh, also have you seen Ma'am?

161
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,147
She wasn't lying about being
the Venus of Daegu.

162
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,513
She's totally...

163
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,201
That's true.

164
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,543
But this is a shame. It was cute.

165
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:55,548
Where's Junseong?

166
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,017
He already left.

167
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:00,933
Come on.

168
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,489
Even a champion needs his privacy.

169
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,604
Ms. Jae Sunja refuses to meet with you.

170
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,860
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,310
Where are you?

172
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:58,077
Where have you been all night?

173
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,146
I was working.

174
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:01,460
The neighbors will say something.

175
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,861
Is that what bothers you?

176
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:04,730
-I'm sorry.
-You need a beating.

177
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:05,831
Get over here.

178
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:08,421
You need a beating. Get over here.

179
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,722
Don't get distracted.

180
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,128
I'll shave your head if you do.

181
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:23,135
I won't. Good night.

182
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,205
Thank you...

183
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,976
...for being well.

184
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,182
Don't try to be cute and go to sleep.

185
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:45,150
Youngho, wake up.

186
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,893
Wake up.

187
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,551
There's no competition.
What's with the scale?

188
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,406
Today, it's for Ma'am.

189
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,612
Ma'am, come on.

190
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:07,993
Hold on.

191
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,396
Did you empty your system in the washroom?

192
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,351
I already did.

193
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,253
I didn't even drink water all day.

194
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:15,548
Miss Kang.

195
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:17,323
Good luck.

196
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,861
-It's 62.2!
-You did it.

197
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,863
-You did it.
-You weigh 62.2 kg!

198
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,018
-You're 62.2 kg.
-You did it!

199
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:55,681
This is all...

200
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,310
...thanks to both of you and...

201
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,947
...the man who trained me remotely
even when he was busy dating.

202
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:05,208
The world renowned trainer, John Kim.
Thank you.

203
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:07,837
What are you doing?

204
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,599
Are you competing in the RFC?

205
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,377
What's the big deal?

206
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,924
You didn't tell him?

207
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,010
Tell me what?

208
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,468
What's this about?

209
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,353
You said you'd take full responsibility.

210
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:29,656
If she lost 15 kg...

211
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,898
...we promised to grant her a wish.

212
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,267
Congratulations.

213
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:37,367
Go ahead then. I'm going back to sleep.

214
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,354
All three of us...

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,421
...must grant her the wish.

216
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,856
All for one. One for all.

217
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,165
It just happened that way.

218
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,202
What's your wish?

219
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,312
Live like Kang Jooeun for just one day...

220
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,301
...without a single word of complaint.

221
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,041
Hey.

222
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:17,775
Hey!

223
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:25,003
Are you saying that for an entire day...

224
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,537
...we all have to live recklessly?

225
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,623
That's spiteful of you.

226
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,262
What do you mean?

227
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:35,594
I don't live recklessly.

228
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,788
The point is to add
to the pleasures of life.

229
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,675
It's to relax and enjoy
the sweetness of life.

230
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,133
You want to eat sweet and salty food.

231
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,005
You don't want to exercise.
Is that what you want?

232
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,547
You have hypothyroidism.

233
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,083
You're also overweight.
You have gastritis,

234
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,654
a fatty liver and high cholesterol.

235
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,737
Don't you see my face?

236
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:55,790
It got so small.

237
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,784
Your body belongs to me.

238
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,737
Your face is not the case.

239
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,279
I was a risky and
dangerous woman in the past.

240
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,328
I admit that.

241
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,249
-But...
-No, no.

242
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,400
"But Coach."

243
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,802
But Coach,

244
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,127
I knew you'd say that so I prepared this.

245
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,264
I'm meticulous and thorough, too.

246
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,148
These are my blood test results.

247
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:31,209
It's been improved, right?

248
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,837
That just shows that
the red light went out.

249
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,536
The green light didn't turn on yet.

250
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:42,473
Red and green aren't the
only colors in this world.

251
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,097
There's yellow too.

252
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:47,833
The doctor said I can
eat whatever I want for a day.

253
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,817
I heard it clearly.

254
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:54,784
Should I get a doctor's referral?

255
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,880
"Jong Yonghwa Obstetrics"

256
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,542
How did you know that
an ob-gyn does the blood work?

257
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,485
Oh my.

258
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,389
Internet.

259
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:14,627
Deal?

260
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,779
Okay. Deal.

261
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,561
Oh, my gosh.

262
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:31,575
Hey, you.

263
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,637
Please add a lot of whipped cream.

264
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,673
Here's the mint chocolate macchiato,
single americano and cafe mocha.

265
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,109
This one is with extra whipped cream.

266
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:41,186
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your drinks.

267
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:44,657
What?

268
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,826
Who got the americano?

269
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,906
I said not to think about your body.

270
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,600
Only think about me.

271
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:58,212
It's Kang Jooeun Day today.

272
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,552
This will be your first warning
for thinking about your body too much.

273
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,569
Since you already ordered it,
so I'll let it go this time.

274
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,032
How long has it been?

275
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,312
See you later.

276
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:22,637
Let it go just this once.
She worked very hard.

277
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,438
It's commendable.

278
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,541
She was like Rocky.

279
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,976
She deserves it.

280
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,995
She only lost weight in her face.
Who would like that?

281
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,293
"Kang Jooeun Day"?

282
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,450
Gosh.

283
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,221
Keep going. Go on.
This isn't it. Stop!

284
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:41,960
Play.

285
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,967
It was worth it to go all
the way to the States.

286
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,711
This is what I needed.

287
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,882
Are you sure that's John Kim's house?

288
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,349
I got a tip from someone in Hollywood.

289
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,326
If it's wrong, it's their fault.

290
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,981
What should the title be?

291
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:00,824
"Mystery Trainer John Kim"

292
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,500
"His identity finally revealed?"

293
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,627
Remove the question mark.

294
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,380
We need an exclamation mark.

295
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,021
We need thousands of them.

296
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,197
"His identity finally revealed!"

297
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,822
Are you sure this is okay?

298
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,710
Let him sue us.

299
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,569
If he does, we'll find out who he is.

300
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,656
He's either Japanese, Chinese or Korean.

301
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:18,417
Thirty percent accuracy means
that it's a fact.

302
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:21,011
If anyone recognizes that house,

303
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,888
we'll find out who he is.

304
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:24,525
Good morning, everybody.

305
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,695
-Good morning.
-It is a good morning.

306
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,714
Have a good day.

307
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:31,830
It was a good morning until a moment ago.

308
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,436
Good morning, President.

309
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:44,877
Are you only focused on
losing weight lately?

310
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:47,312
-Pardon?
-The daughter of the CEO.

311
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:51,151
I'm talking about the case you
refused to take on.

312
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:55,687
I heard Miss Oh is taking on
the case herself.

313
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,247
That's because...

314
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,432
I already...

315
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,160
...reprimanded her for it.

316
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,654
Don't you have a meeting, President?

317
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,740
That's right.

318
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,032
All right.

319
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,618
Let's talk again after my meeting.

320
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,771
This case is our first priority.

321
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,045
Please put together
a strong team for the case.

322
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,252
-Yes, Sir.
-Okay.

323
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,033
Vice President Oh.

324
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:28,745
Good morning.

325
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,763
Miss Kang.

326
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:31,561
Come to my office.

327
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,664
You must be on a diet.

328
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:42,468
Your face is getting...

329
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:48,513
You've already seen me this way before.

330
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:50,476
Are you dating someone?

331
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,346
You're the one in a relationship.

332
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,983
I hope you have a passionate relationship.

333
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,852
I'll ask you a question.

334
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:03,960
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

335
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:08,026
-What?
-It all depends on...

336
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:10,378
...whose point of view you take on.

337
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,802
Are you trying to be funny?

338
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:20,341
These are copyright lawsuits
over television content.

339
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:24,380
Since there's lack of understanding
about originality in Korea...

340
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,005
...it will be quite demanding...

341
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,288
...and tedious.

342
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,240
Look for legal precedents first.

343
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:33,118
If it is demanding and tedious work,

344
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,787
why did you have to call me in so early?

345
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,157
We aren't even pressed for time.

346
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,370
I'm the one who's busy.

347
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:49,201
Bye now. Good luck.

348
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:56,050
Why does her office have to be so nice?

349
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,573
Live like Kang Jooeun for just one day...

350
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,541
...without a single word of complaint.

351
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,123
Have you still not memorized
the fourth verse yet?

352
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,549
Well, I keep forgetting
the beginning of the fourth verse.

353
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,618
Give me that.

354
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,242
Next applicant.

355
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,573
Introduce your family. Start.

356
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,707
Yes, sir.

357
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:54,942
My grandfather fought in the Korean War
as a marine.

358
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,368
He was a very brave man.

359
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:58,503
Salute!

360
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,015
My mother is also Korean.

361
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,985
She is a strong and beautiful lady.
She's also scary.

362
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,069
But don't worry.

363
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,338
I'm good. And I'm half Korean.

364
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:10,382
My father is Chinese.

365
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,253
Oh, it is from My Venus.

366
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,423
Please give me a second, sir.

367
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:21,060
"Thank you for your cooperation."

368
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,843
"Here are the missions
for Kang Jooeun Day"

369
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:26,865
Mission?

370
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,702
What am I going to do
with this Venus of Daegu?

371
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,972
In short,

372
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:36,953
find the most comfortable
position in the world,

373
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:39,257
and don't do anything.

374
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:41,562
I'll call it, "play dead".

375
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:43,392
"Play dead"?

376
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,676
I see.

377
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,931
It is to stay still and do nothing.

378
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:49,126
I'm home.

379
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,208
Jang Junseong.

380
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:52,739
Where have you been?

381
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:55,454
If you get distracted...

382
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,309
Since you said you'll shave my head.

383
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:05,020
Finally you understand me.

384
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,166
Come on. Let's play dead.

385
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,920
-What?
-We're going to play dead.

386
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:14,624
Okay? Okay.

387
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:18,116
Okay.

388
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,725
Okay. Good.

389
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:29,552
Good. Next.

390
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:31,658
We have three more missions to complete.

391
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,712
Mission number two.

392
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,819
Watch a romantic movie...

393
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,204
...and be deeply moved by it.

394
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:47,049
Are you crying?

395
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:49,957
This is nuts.

396
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,471
Stop there.

397
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:06,597
You are not supposed to go near
any exercise equipment.

398
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,548
Junseong!

399
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,109
Get out of there.

400
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,377
Mission number three. Take a nap.

401
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,974
As if it were night,

402
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,384
have a sound sleep.

403
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,829
Sleep well.

404
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,618
"International Driver's License
Kim Youngho"

405
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,502
Good job, Mr. Im.

406
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:09,448
He looks totally different from
when he was a kid.

407
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:13,457
We have no choice but to make
Mr. Choi come over to our side.

408
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:15,793
That depends on our competence.

409
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:17,773
Let's get started.

410
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:21,439
He will probably expect
a large portion of the company stock.

411
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,958
Life is a game...

412
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,846
...with a score of 49 to 51.

413
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:31,638
If you give up one precious point...

414
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:33,761
...but earn two, you win.

415
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,339
Keep in contact with them.

416
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,590
We'll see what happens.

417
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:39,758
Okay.

418
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,136
The person you are calling is not...

419
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:48,066
"OH! Soojin"

420
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:50,987
Where are you?

421
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,941
Where did you learn your manners?

422
00:27:57,021 --> 00:27:57,881
I apologize.

423
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,965
The media and reporters have
bothered me enough,

424
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:04,672
and now an attorney is stressing me out.

425
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,686
Would you please step outside
for a moment?

426
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,062
How dare you tell my masseuse...

427
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:14,159
What?

428
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:15,642
Aren't you an attorney?

429
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,763
I'm the Vice President of Geontu Law Firm.

430
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,147
My name is Oh Soojin.

431
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:26,137
When our attorneys visited you,

432
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:28,115
you asked for the President.

433
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,810
Vice President is not
the same as the President.

434
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:31,953
What's wrong with this law firm?

435
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:34,623
The president has
an important meeting right now.

436
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,714
Are you kidding?

437
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,294
I'm the daughter of the CEO
of Myeongeun Electronics.

438
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:41,210
My father gave a huge amount of
money to your firm.

439
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,083
No amount of money...

440
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,750
...can beat the media.

441
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:46,992
That's nonsense.

442
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,521
You already beat up employees
at a department store.

443
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,231
Everybody knows about it.

444
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:57,263
If you continue to get beauty treatments
while being confined,

445
00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:59,809
we won't be able to protect you.

446
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,358
Protecting me is your job.

447
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,376
You are attorneys.

448
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,420
You guys do anything for money.

449
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:07,372
If so,

450
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,191
we need to charge your father
for more money.

451
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,120
Don't act so tough just because
you have the looks.

452
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:19,834
Don't forget you live off my money.

453
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,831
They really did it.

454
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:28,934
So adorable.

455
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:36,729
Miss Kang, will you work overtime tonight?

456
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:38,600
No.

457
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:41,343
Go home. I'll wrap it up here.

458
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:42,281
Okay.

459
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,362
Miss Kang, stop losing weight.

460
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:48,062
You look like you're going to die.

461
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,456
Right. It feels like I'm going to die,

462
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,387
but I need to be careful
because of my thyroid.

463
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,628
I see.

464
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:02,547
I was told in the hospital
that I have a high fat to muscle ratio.

465
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:04,284
See you tomorrow.

466
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,359
It's been so long since I had a feast.

467
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,230
My restaurant is under renovation.

468
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:25,238
I'm starving to death, Minjun.

469
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:27,602
Eat this.

470
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:30,812
Of all days, why is it renovated today?

471
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:32,515
Mom.

472
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:35,178
Give her something to eat.

473
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:36,865
Auntie is starving.

474
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,133
Don't be so smart.

475
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,479
Go practice for your dance.

476
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:41,665
My goodness.

477
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:46,654
He took after his father
and has no sense of rhythm.

478
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:50,381
It's the first time we've done
any construction work...

479
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,022
...and I have no food at home.

480
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,984
That's bad timing.

481
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,032
You're right.

482
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:58,445
That's why we are still friends
after 16 years, right?

483
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:00,936
Your face...

484
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,375
...reminds me of you in the old days.

485
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,943
My body will go back to what it was soon.

486
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,921
I'm more passionate
than when I studied for the bar.

487
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:15,630
You failed that exam many times.

488
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:18,149
You are dampening my spirits.

489
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,180
You're so grumpy and you have no friends.

490
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:24,829
Where in the world are you staying?

491
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,286
With somebody who is worse than I am.

492
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:33,074
He's not a friend, but something similar.

493
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,552
'Friends' as in people
with mutual affections?

494
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,788
You don't have to worry.

495
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,144
I'm afraid he's going to kick me out.

496
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:46,671
Is he...

497
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,524
...the Mr. Sexy Guy?

498
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,988
Is there something going on
between you two?

499
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:54,479
It doesn't matter if he's
oozing with sexiness.

500
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,475
He has a foul temper and foul mouth.

501
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,918
He has spare rooms.

502
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,532
It's like a boarding house.

503
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:02,987
Other guys live there too.

504
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,572
Guys?

505
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,911
You're living with some guys...

506
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,788
...while I'm ecstatic about
receiving more money...

507
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:12,244
...for child support.

508
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,445
Did Producer Ko get an exclusive?

509
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,338
He went to the States.

510
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:20,596
-He found where John Kim lives.
-What?

511
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:23,767
-What's wrong?
-How did he find out?

512
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:24,886
Is it for sure?

513
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:26,816
Did he see John Kim enter the house?

514
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,323
If he did, everybody would've known.

515
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:31,575
He got some tips over there.

516
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,518
He said that 30 percent accuracy
means it's a fact.

517
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,301
"John Kim"

518
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,785
He is quite international.

519
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:52,924
"Jiwoong"

520
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,961
Jiwoong, please put me on speaker.

521
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,532
Everybody, stop.

522
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:05,228
Put down the organic grass
and unseasoned meat.

523
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:06,681
Put them down right now.

524
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,792
The next mission is...

525
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,885
...to eat out.

526
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:20,899
That's all.

527
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,517
Are we going to a fancy restaurant?

528
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:29,465
I think she wants to be
treated like a princess.

529
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,852
I'll wear a suit.

530
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:33,845
Everybody, let's dress up.

531
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,823
Suit style.

532
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:46,200
"Meet Flour"

533
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,726
Are we too dressed up?

534
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,713
-Let me go.
-It's just one day.

535
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,619
Miss Kang went through
a lot to lose weight.

536
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:55,825
That's not something to brag about.

537
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,317
Losing weight is good for her.

538
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,695
Youngho, she deserves some praise.

539
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,603
I can't eat flour.

540
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,105
What are you doing?

541
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,181
Why don't you eat?

542
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:27,966
These look delicious.

543
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,923
It's really good.

544
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:36,013
I'll just eat a little since
I'm watching my weight.

545
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,710
If I were you, I'd move to
the higher weight division.

546
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:48,099
Say ah...

547
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,628
Put it down.

548
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,323
Just try it.

549
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:53,481
It's really good.

550
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:54,926
No, thank you.

551
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,818
I already know what it tastes like.

552
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:58,569
Not as well as I know.

553
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,743
I'm sorry, Youngho.

554
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:04,727
Sorry. Because today is Kang Jooeun Day.

555
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,158
- You two will pay for this tomorrow.
- Open your mouth.

556
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,640
Say ah...

557
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,211
Ah...

558
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,832
Score!

559
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:27,020
I don't eat carbohydrates.

560
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:28,508
It's too salty.

561
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:31,022
Eat it just for one day.

562
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,850
How can a human live without
eating carbohydrates?

563
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,263
Rather than being a princess,

564
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,256
you just want to be
a fairy that eats a lot?

565
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,003
Are you calling me a fairy?

566
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:41,849
Next,

567
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,032
we'll take a photo of this moment.

568
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,445
You're really enjoying this.

569
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:49,550
Let's gather around.

570
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:51,434
Make me look pretty.

571
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:54,795
Youngho, make a funny face. Hurry up.

572
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,728
No matter what face I make,
I'll look better than her.

573
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:03,378
-Say cheese.
-Cheese.

574
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,752
Do you play golf?

575
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:11,846
I'm only a beginner.

576
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,782
You need to know
how to play golf to do business.

577
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:17,525
-Let's play sometime.
-Okay.

578
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:20,971
Hey, Mr. Im.

579
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,344
Don't mind me.
Go ahead and answer it.

580
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,149
Excuse me.

581
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:28,115
This is Im Woosik.

582
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:29,979
I'm calling from
the Gangnam Police Station.

583
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:32,490
Why is the police calling me?

584
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:35,100
I see.

585
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:39,535
What's wrong?

586
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,158
Did you drink and drive?

587
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,567
No. It's not a big deal.

588
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,487
Before an important matter,

589
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:47,297
you have to be careful
of what you say, think and do.

590
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:48,702
Be careful of women too.

591
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,517
Yes, sir.

592
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:53,507
Let's go.

593
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:25,544
"OH! Soojin"

594
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:28,285
Soojin.

595
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:29,823
Where are you?

596
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,305
I'm in the office.

597
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Are you still in the office?

598
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,392
When will you finish working?

599
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,964
It will take some time.

600
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:41,835
I'm quite busy today.

601
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:43,995
Really?

602
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:47,331
All right. Take care.

603
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,082
I'll call you later.

604
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,188
Hello.

605
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,984
I'm Attorney Yang Kyeongjun.

606
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,108
I'm Im Woosik.

607
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:45,968
What did you mean by assault?

608
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,392
Are you denying that?

609
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:49,953
I mean...

610
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,284
In the afternoon of November 17th, 2014,

611
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,967
my client got injuries
requiring three weeks of treatment.

612
00:38:57,812 --> 00:39:00,403
You also blackmailed him.

613
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:01,627
What are you talking about?

614
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:09,001
If you show up in front
of Kang Jooeun again,

615
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:10,404
I'll kill you.

616
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,208
If you've been watching,

617
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:13,869
you must know what I'm capable of.

618
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:15,840
Don't go near Kang Jooeun again.

619
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,935
This isn't a warning. It's an order.

620
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,586
My client recorded what you said.

621
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:26,023
You said, "I'll kill you", "Get lost",

622
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,915
"This isn't a warning. It's an order."

623
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,795
Those words are enough
to threaten ordinary civilians.

624
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:34,423
This isn't something we can just ignore.

625
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,270
Do you have an attorney?

626
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:38,576
He does.

627
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:49,528
I'm Oh Soojin, Im Woosik's attorney.

628
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,157
"Geontu Law Firm
Oh Soojin"

629
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:16,300
It's no fun brushing my teeth
with nothing stuck between them.

630
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:24,782
"Vice President Oh"

631
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:25,734
At this hour?

632
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,126
How is she planning to upset me now?

633
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,630
"Vice President Oh"

634
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:38,342
Did I eat too much?

635
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,913
It's okay. I'll exercise tomorrow.

636
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,226
What is it?

637
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,137
The police station?

638
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,127
She's here. The witness.

639
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:30,693
It's been 15 years?

640
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,501
Yes.

641
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:39,819
They were each other's first love...

642
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,929
...and lovers for 15 years.

643
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,516
You don't become strangers overnight...

644
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:46,835
...just because you break up.

645
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:48,583
This is insane.

646
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,291
But if he found out...

647
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:56,273
...that a strange man
was stalking his ex-girlfriend...

648
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:58,582
...and threatening her...

649
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,619
...it is clearly an
extenuating circumstance.

650
00:42:02,928 --> 00:42:05,890
His injuries are insufficient
to be a criminal offense.

651
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:07,173
Of course,

652
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,510
I'd like you to investigate the hospital

653
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:11,192
that provided the medical report.

654
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:14,375
This won't be easy.

655
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:16,167
But...

656
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,939
...there isn't enough evidence
of him stalking her.

657
00:42:20,024 --> 00:42:22,876
That's why we called a witness.

658
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:27,946
The guy that requested
the surveillance footage.

659
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,518
The guy that says he's
like your guardian.

660
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:31,799
He was with you, right?

661
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,101
He has nothing to do with this.

662
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:38,089
You didn't call him, did you?

663
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:39,926
I'm here. The witness.

664
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,435
Soojin, wait.

665
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,075
You should...

666
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,288
...talk to her first.

667
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,881
I'll leave first.

668
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:14,580
Goodness.

669
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:23,567
You look good.

670
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:26,003
My face is half the size now.

671
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:27,750
Does this look good to you?

672
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:31,252
Why did you do it?

673
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,021
I'm sorry.

674
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:36,297
I overreacted.

675
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,492
I was worried that you didn't
have anyone beside you.

676
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:41,074
Just in case you didn't...

677
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,431
It was pity,

678
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:45,032
or something like that.

679
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:47,449
I am all alone...

680
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:48,927
...because of you.

681
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:51,684
And how dare you pity me!

682
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:53,830
I can't ignore you just
because we broke up.

683
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,160
I would've helped a stranger
on the street if I saw that happening.

684
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:58,893
You shouldn't overreact.

685
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,281
I'm so grateful. Happy?

686
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:04,436
Do you know who he is?

687
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,279
What?

688
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:10,781
He may be...

689
00:44:11,138 --> 00:44:13,918
...a more significant
person than you think.

690
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:16,304
Are you jealous?

691
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:17,955
Are you upset?

692
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:20,968
Are you jealous
because he's better than you?

693
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,061
He could be toying with you.

694
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:27,020
I'm worried that you are
too emotionally invested.

695
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,600
It's not likely that he really has
feelings for you.

696
00:44:32,413 --> 00:44:34,104
Mind your own business.

697
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:36,415
Are you bored?

698
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,861
I should just kill you.

699
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,016
Watch your language.

700
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:44,782
Why are you only getting worse?

701
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,401
Getting worse?

702
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:52,763
You and I...

703
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:54,587
...have lived 15 more years...

704
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:56,522
...than 15 years ago.

705
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,364
I, who wanted to be a lawyer,
became a lawyer.

706
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,760
And you, who used to be a swimmer,

707
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,085
are now working at a large corporation.

708
00:45:07,477 --> 00:45:09,149
Why am I only getting worse?

709
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:13,010
If I gain weight, is that getting worse?

710
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:16,486
I'm still the same Kang Jooeun.

711
00:45:17,391 --> 00:45:18,599
Think about it.

712
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,168
How have I changed from 15 years ago?

713
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,258
Soojin is...

714
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:30,163
...a capable attorney.

715
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:31,780
Much more than I am.

716
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:34,965
I'm sure everything will be fine.

717
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,625
Bye.

718
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:47,734
Thank you for your cooperation.

719
00:45:48,403 --> 00:45:49,470
You may go now.

720
00:45:57,632 --> 00:45:59,467
They were each other's first love...

721
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,226
...and lovers for 15 years.

722
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:05,299
You don't become strangers overnight...

723
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:06,484
...just because you break up.

724
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:08,632
This is insane.

725
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:21,045
Mr. Min.

726
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,377
I have a favor to ask.

727
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,657
It's personal.

728
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:31,833
Excuse me.

729
00:46:41,876 --> 00:46:43,615
You may already know who I am.

730
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:46,959
I figure we'll meet one day anyway.

731
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:51,041
I'm Gahong Center
General Manager, Im Woosik.

732
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,538
I haven't decided yet.

733
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,547
Is this...

734
00:46:58,192 --> 00:46:59,682
...about Kang Jooeun?

735
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:01,659
No.

736
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,804
When I think about it...

737
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:06,023
...I don't have the right to be concerned.

738
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:10,254
Thank you for giving your statement.

739
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:11,672
Don't mention it.

740
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:13,433
May I go now?

741
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:16,527
Jooeun gets cold easily.

742
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:20,531
I'm glad I could help.

743
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:38,188
I thought you took a taxi and left...

744
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,523
...since you're so independent.

745
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,700
We're going to the same place anyway.

746
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,302
Why waste fuel?

747
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,048
I'm so cold.

748
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:13,255
Hi, Oh Soojin.

749
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:16,359
Hi, Woosik.

750
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,012
"Chocolate
Made in Germany"

751
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:19,537
These are handmade chocolates.

752
00:48:20,374 --> 00:48:22,032
Congratulations on your exam.

753
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:24,742
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

754
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:27,219
Here he comes.

755
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,493
If you look the way you do,
you need to at least...

756
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:35,942
...pick up on things quickly.

757
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:37,775
Don't come to places like this.

758
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:38,889
Go home right now.

759
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,926
What the...

760
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:47,158
What does she take me for?

761
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,386
How dare you talk that way?

762
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,408
Do you want to die?
How dare you talk to her like that?

763
00:48:55,493 --> 00:48:57,173
-Woosik.
-You...

764
00:48:57,258 --> 00:48:58,909
You're Im Woosik, right?

765
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:01,378
Yeah, I'm Im Woosik.

766
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:03,188
Do you want to sue me?

767
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,708
Go ahead.

768
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:07,737
My friend Soojin passed the bar exam...

769
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:11,130
...and my girlfriend Jooeun
will pass it soon.

770
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:15,329
So clumsy.

771
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:18,522
Let's go.

772
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,273
Woosik!

773
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:25,540
You got hurt.

774
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:27,175
I'm fine.

775
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:28,733
Are you okay?

776
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:32,879
Let's go.

777
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:42,690
If you show up in front
of Kang Jooeun again,

778
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:44,090
I'll kill you.

779
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,744
If you've been watching,

780
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:47,413
you must know what I'm capable of.

781
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:49,468
Don't go near Kang Jooeun again.

782
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,589
This isn't a warning. It's an order.

783
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,864
Wait.

784
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,865
There are 30 minutes left
until the day's over.

785
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,300
I can get coffee right?

786
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:33,168
That's why.

787
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:36,459
Don't you know you have insomnia?

788
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:37,661
If you drink coffee now...

789
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:40,671
Even if I don't drink coffee tonight,
I won't be able to sleep.

790
00:50:40,842 --> 00:50:42,381
It'll just be one drink.

791
00:50:57,506 --> 00:51:00,121
The sweetest drinks that you have are...

792
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:02,700
...white chocolate and
mint chocolate, right?

793
00:51:02,863 --> 00:51:05,440
Yes. Which would you like?

794
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,465
-Both, please.
-Okay.

795
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,248
Gosh.

796
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,824
May I pay with this?

797
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,244
Of course.

798
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:23,747
Here you go.

799
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:28,444
If I asked him for money,

800
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,264
he wouldn't have let me get it.

801
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:35,250
Mr. Min, I have a favor to ask.

802
00:51:35,536 --> 00:51:36,910
It's personal.

803
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:46,937
How may I help you?

804
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:52,194
Earlier,

805
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:55,746
there was a complaint
filed against Im Woosik.

806
00:51:55,923 --> 00:51:56,849
That's right.

807
00:51:57,124 --> 00:51:59,813
They settled it and the case was dropped.

808
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:02,119
We're worried because people tend to talk.

809
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:05,356
Let's talk in private.

810
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:16,600
Yes. It's been taken care of.

811
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:21,538
What's personal to someone
may not be for others.

812
00:52:22,016 --> 00:52:23,273
Please be cautious.

813
00:52:23,576 --> 00:52:26,987
Please be cautious with
your complaints and nags, too.

814
00:52:27,072 --> 00:52:27,911
Okay?

815
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,616
Just a minute.

816
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:49,513
Did it break down?

817
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:26,077
What's wrong with it?

818
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:30,187
I don't know myself.

819
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:35,444
There are 10 minutes left
in Kang Jooeun Day,

820
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:37,160
so drink without complaining.

821
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,188
You really don't know
the sweetness of life.

822
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,969
Others may say you have a great body...

823
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:50,927
...but when you think about it, it's sad.

824
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:55,286
"Live like Kang Jooeun."

825
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:58,224
Are you happy now that
you got back at me?

826
00:54:00,014 --> 00:54:01,054
Actually,

827
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:03,251
it was a gift.

828
00:54:04,384 --> 00:54:05,885
I wanted you to taste some sweetness.

829
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:15,744
One of our rights is the right
to pursue happiness.

830
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,923
All people have the right
and duty to be happy.

831
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:22,276
No matter who they are.

832
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,124
I know it's not good for my body...

833
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,269
...but to me...

834
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:31,779
...this is my right to pursue happiness.

835
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:38,058
You gave me the gift of
your right to pursue happiness?

836
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,796
Is that it?

837
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:43,539
I wanted you to rest
at a yellow light for a day.

838
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:46,083
I wanted you to take a break from
being at a red or green light.

839
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:51,682
I may be out of line, but you
seem exhausted at times.

840
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:53,739
That's why.

841
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,709
It'll take time to fix the car, right?

842
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:05,669
I'm going to get some air.
It's stuffy in here.

843
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:49,679
As you know...

844
00:55:50,524 --> 00:55:51,531
...I never really tasted...

845
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:54,220
...sweetness growing up.

846
00:55:56,129 --> 00:55:58,748
Actually, it was a gift.

847
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:00,470
I wanted you to taste some sweetness.

848
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:05,773
I may be out of line, but you
seem exhausted at times.

849
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:15,411
It's way too sweet.

850
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:20,644
You surprised me.

851
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:30,995
It's too sweet.

852
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:33,002
That's mine.

853
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:38,863
Did the worst day
of your life change again?

854
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:42,666
Don't fold the umbrella.

855
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:44,791
It could become a weapon.

856
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:55,347
Look away.

857
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:57,214
This dimple is mine.

858
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,587
He could be toying with you.

859
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:07,506
I'm worried that you are
too emotionally invested.

860
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,196
It's not likely that he really
has feelings for you.

861
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:16,934
Stop looking at me.

862
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:20,837
How long will it take them to fix it?

863
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,906
Fix what?

864
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:25,501
I thought the car broke down.

865
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:26,501
The tow truck...

866
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:31,448
It's the tow truck that broke down.

867
00:57:33,006 --> 00:57:33,953
What?

868
00:57:35,322 --> 00:57:36,159
Then...

869
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:38,951
...why are we standing out here?

870
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:40,262
It's nice.

871
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:44,300
I got to taste the sweetness of life, too.

872
00:58:04,158 --> 00:58:05,245
It's fascinating.

873
00:58:07,228 --> 00:58:08,763
Stop joking around.

874
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:13,873
Seems like you really don't know.

875
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:25,161
If a man...

876
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:27,504
...jokes around with a woman...

877
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,268
...he wants to do other things
with her as well.

878
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,215
Because your body belongs to me,

879
00:58:41,636 --> 00:58:43,426
you can't say no.
