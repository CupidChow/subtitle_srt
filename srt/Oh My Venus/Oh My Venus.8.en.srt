1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,723
I'll escort you.

2
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,106
You are being overprotective.

3
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,447
You'll make me go astray.

4
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,000
The backseat is safer.

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,143
Mr. Executive Director.

6
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,829
Okay.

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,318
But we'll take my car.

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,139
"Episode 8"

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,502
We hired the external legal counsel...

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,233
Yes.

11
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,914
Just in case things get complicated.

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,317
So you don't need to worry about it.

13
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:52,868
Yes.

14
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:06,032
Ever since I first met you,
I've been grateful.

15
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,653
Thank you, Buff John Kim.

16
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,338
Big Brother Youngho.

17
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,895
Youngho.

18
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,464
Coach.

19
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,926
Where are you?

20
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:23,381
I'll be back late so make sure
to exercise alone.

21
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,055
Yes, yes, Coach.

22
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,134
I need to talk to you,

23
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:37,941
so call me when you're done.

24
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,273
This is Kang Jooeun.

25
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,343
Come in.

26
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:48,707
Yes, Ma'am.

27
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,827
Hello.

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,730
I'm Chief Secretary Min Byungwook...

29
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,425
...from Gahong Group.

30
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:15,849
Let me introduce
the executive director...

31
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,437
...of Gahong Medical Group.

32
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,265
Please, excuse me.

33
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,230
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,577
I want to live as long as Iron Man,

35
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,145
and be as secretive as Batman.

36
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,230
I was born...

37
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,734
...with a silver spoon in my mouth.

38
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,335
Being alone with a guy like me in a suite,

39
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,552
must be something out of your league.

40
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,805
Where are you going?

41
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:44,117
Beats me.

42
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,254
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:53,356
I...

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,076
I...

45
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,970
I thought...

46
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,841
Calm down...

47
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,488
...and take a deep breath.

48
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,549
Don't get worked up.

49
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,750
Take a deep breath.

50
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,050
You...

51
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:23,049
...really are...

52
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,581
...out of my league.

53
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,233
Mr. Min.

54
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,447
Please apologize for me.
Ask them to wait 10 minutes.

55
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,017
Breathe.

56
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:19,332
That way, we can talk.

57
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,666
Talk about what?

58
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,591
Kang Jooeun.

59
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,752
At first, you lied to me.

60
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,092
Then you conned me.

61
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,615
Now, you betray me.

62
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,132
Did you think...

63
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,998
...I'd be intimidated just because...

64
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:35,568
...you are Gahong's executive director?

65
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,840
I'm sorry. Please take the next one.

66
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,434
I said before I hate people
who lie and deceive others.

67
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,515
How...

68
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,285
How could you...

69
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,328
I'm sorry for not telling you.

70
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,722
I was wondering how to tell you.

71
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,275
But...

72
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,507
...did I give you a ring?

73
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,776
Did I ask you to marry me?

74
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:03,506
Or did I say you were...

75
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:04,945
...my first love?

76
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:16,743
Did I say that?

77
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,345
So, why are you being like this?

78
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,498
What?

79
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,880
Why are you so angry?

80
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,189
Why are you running away already?

81
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:28,900
Running away?

82
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,963
You're right.

83
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,649
I did nothing wrong.
Why am I running away?

84
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:36,729
What I mean is,

85
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,579
I wasn't trying to lie.

86
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,475
Let's keep doing what we've been doing,

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,861
whether it's dating or dieting.

88
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,738
Since I think...

89
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,269
...I've finally tasted
the sweetness in life.

90
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,336
Not saying what you must is also lying.

91
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,181
If the other person feels deceived,

92
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,342
that means you deceived them.

93
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,378
Date?

94
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,267
I don't do that with
someone who lies to me.

95
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,091
Like you said,

96
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,193
I didn't get a ring,

97
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,364
and it's not like
you asked me to marry you.

98
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,728
I don't know why I was so worked up.

99
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:15,354
Let's go.

100
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,537
Everyone is waiting.

101
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,884
As you can see,

102
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,919
there won't be a problem obtaining
the largest share.

103
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:32,518
As long as there isn't a problem
with the directors' shares,

104
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:36,472
there shouldn't be a problem
with being appointed executive director.

105
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:40,642
The acquired shares from
the subsidiaries look fine as well.

106
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:45,815
I think it would be best to make a smooth
transition of executive directors,

107
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,596
and make the approval requirements
stricter for mergers.

108
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:54,014
Gahong's legal department
will take care of it.

109
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,643
We'd like you to be on standby
in case a need arises.

110
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,677
Secrecy is...

111
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,988
Yes, we are aware.

112
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,515
Executive Director Kim Youngho.

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,016
I think that's enough for today.

114
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,930
We've prepared a meal. Please, join us.

115
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:18,231
I need to go to my mother's.

116
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,753
Please let them know.

117
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,969
Why don't you tell him yourself?

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,527
You seem to be close.

119
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:38,289
Let's talk.

120
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:42,116
Please come with us, Sir.

121
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:49,438
I'm sorry,

122
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:51,931
but I have a prior engagement.

123
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,127
Did I give you a ring?

124
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,402
Did I ask you to marry me?

125
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,163
Or did I say...

126
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,540
...you were my first love?

127
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:22,672
I need to talk to you.

128
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,597
So call me when you're done.

129
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,835
"Coach"

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,809
"Mom"

131
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:39,011
-Hi.
-When are you getting here?

132
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:42,032
I didn't even say that I left yet.

133
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:43,813
I'm leaving now.

134
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:45,501
Okay.

135
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,696
We'll see you next time.

136
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,965
We look forward to working with you.

137
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,168
The feeling is mutual.

138
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,430
Don't follow me.

139
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,222
This is a private matter, okay?

140
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,242
"Venus of Daegu"

141
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,044
The number you're calling
is not available.

142
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,262
Please leave a message after the beep.

143
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:26,521
Youngho!

144
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,621
Junseong is getting his makeup done.

145
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,389
He looks super cool.

146
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,694
Ma'am?

147
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,760
Hold on.

148
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,828
Junseong, did Ma'am call you?

149
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,755
Yes, she said she was going
to her mother's today.

150
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,086
That's right. Hometown.

151
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,860
She went to her hometown.

152
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,163
Okay.

153
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:48,074
Good luck and don't cause trouble.

154
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,742
Okay.

155
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:00,288
I just hate that you deceived me.

156
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,435
It doesn't matter who it is.

157
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,073
Even if it's the one and only...

158
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,435
...John Kim.

159
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,852
At first, you lied to me.

160
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:08,009
Then you conned me.

161
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:09,656
Now, you betray me.

162
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:12,633
I said before I hate people
who lie and deceive others.

163
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:15,840
How...

164
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,604
How could you...

165
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:18,764
You...

166
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,170
...really are...

167
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,044
...out of my league.

168
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,050
I'm being punished.

169
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,704
"North Daegu"

170
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,303
This is all a debt,

171
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,425
but at least I'll get to eat
all the chicken I want.

172
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,087
Mom! Your VIP is here!

173
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,065
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

174
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,400
Excuse me.

175
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:23,369
I'd like some fried chicken
and a rotisserie chicken.

176
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,825
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

177
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,327
An order of fried chicken
and a rotisserie.

178
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,379
An order of fried chicken
and a rotisserie.

179
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,548
Kang Jaehyeok.

180
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,508
What would you have done without me?

181
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:40,252
Who knew we'd be so busy? We're a hit.

182
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:41,338
Go.

183
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:43,747
Two more orders of fried chicken!

184
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,591
Two more orders of fried chicken.

185
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,343
This photo.

186
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,673
-Let's do it one more time.
-Okay.

187
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,247
Okay, get ready. One more time.

188
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,465
Hold on.

189
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:54,739
Okay, that's great.

190
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,804
Okay.

191
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:59,072
Jump.

192
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,075
Again.
One, two, three!

193
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,394
Okay! Good.

194
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,725
Okay, that's it.

195
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,905
That's great.

196
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,151
Hold her hand.

197
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:14,721
That's great.

198
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,801
That's perfect.

199
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,205
You're looking good.

200
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,070
Jiwoong!

201
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,905
I'll give you my autograph.

202
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,478
-Just give me five minutes.
-Not your autograph.

203
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:36,952
I want autographs from Girls' Generation.

204
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,112
Okay.

205
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:40,980
Okay, deal.

206
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:42,595
Hey. Hey. Hey!

207
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,077
Do you want to go out to eat
or do you want to kiss me?

208
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:54,994
What?

209
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,533
Do you want to go out to eat,

210
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,165
or do you want to live with me?

211
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,171
Hold on. I'm not done yet.

212
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,603
Do you want to go out to eat,

213
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:10,936
or do you want to date me?

214
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,936
Do you want to die?

215
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,732
It's "Do you want to die?",
not "Do you want to date?"

216
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:18,644
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,406
-Get out.
-Wait! He didn't answer me.

218
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:23,984
Do you want to go out to eat?

219
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:26,027
-Just once!
-Are you trying to...

220
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,930
-...kill me? Get in.
-Wait. Wait.

221
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,897
-Are you trying to kill me?
-Junseong!

222
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,365
Sorry, Junseong.

223
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,774
Ma'am isn't answering her phone.

224
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,307
Let's go.

225
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,875
Let's go.

226
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,567
Hey Jooeun!

227
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,634
Hello.

228
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:48,967
Where's your husband?

229
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,171
She's still single.

230
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,146
She is?

231
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,550
When are you getting married?

232
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:58,090
You're pretty enough.
Why can't you get married?

233
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,277
My Jooeun is a lawyer.

234
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,395
The guy she was going to marry
was just busy working at Gahong.

235
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,077
He could be busy after they get married.

236
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:08,734
Get married and have kids
before it's too late.

237
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,216
The thing is...

238
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,802
Go on home. You must be tired.

239
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,439
Eunbi! Jooeun is going home!

240
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,136
Enjoy yourselves.

241
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,913
-Good night.
-Bye.

242
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,635
You have to be careful during
your first trimester.

243
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,382
Yes. Thank you.

244
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:31,105
Call me if Jaehyeok upsets you.

245
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,158
I will.

246
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:33,392
Oh right.

247
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,262
I heard you were dieting.

248
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,209
This is a thoughtful dowry.

249
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,292
It's not a dowry.

250
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:43,139
Take care of Jaehyeok
for the rest of your life.

251
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,969
That would be the best thing
you could give me.

252
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:46,263
Take care.

253
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:48,207
-Mom, I'm leaving.
-Bye.

254
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:23,572
I'm sorry, Dad.

255
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:28,282
I forgot today is your birthday.

256
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,393
Heat up the soup.

257
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:43,128
Forget about the diet.
You should eat when you're home.

258
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,613
"Jiwoong"

259
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,857
Ma'am, where are you?

260
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,933
Ma'am, aren't you coming today?

261
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,561
Ma'am! Ma'am?

262
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:50,668
Ma'am?

263
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,307
"Coach"

264
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,440
I need to talk to you,

265
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,042
so call me when you're done.

266
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,815
"Missed Call
Coach"

267
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:04,483
He only called me once?

268
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:08,621
Your effort is commendable.

269
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,495
"Hyunwoo"

270
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,211
Bring back your mother's kimchi.

271
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,284
Why isn't he calling me?

272
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:52,931
What a jerk.

273
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,754
Why am I like this?

274
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,157
Am I going through puberty?

275
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,808
Is this menopause?

276
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,752
I must be crazy.

277
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,993
"New message
Coach"

278
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,272
Since you are the Venus of Daegu,

279
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:25,875
you must be in Daegu.

280
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,237
Come out.

281
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,183
I hate being cold more than anything.

282
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,355
What do I do?

283
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,661
What should I do?

284
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:12,546
Where is my car key?

285
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,301
I'll take this taxi.

286
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,701
Thank you.

287
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,739
-Where to?
-Ayang Railroad Bridge, please.

288
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,725
I came all the way from Seoul.

289
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:35,128
Why don't you come...

290
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,196
...from there to here?

291
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,351
Belly fat can be a good thing at times.

292
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,139
Oh, please.

293
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:27,679
You're warm.

294
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,324
I hate being cold the most.

295
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,152
You are not wearing glasses.

296
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,694
Did you put on makeup too?

297
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,459
Are you expecting me to do something...

298
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,599
...that I'm not doing?

299
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:34,079
My eyesight is not that bad.

300
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:35,981
When I was young,

301
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:39,418
I wore them to look
a bit more intelligent.

302
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:42,067
Then, it became a habit.

303
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:45,573
That's good that I can see you clearly.

304
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:52,157
I'm not a rash person
who falls easily for guys.

305
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,250
You are.

306
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,705
What?

307
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,415
I won't beat around the bush.

308
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,618
I'll just tell you...

309
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:14,421
...what I couldn't tell you before.

310
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:19,391
I was...

311
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:22,327
...very sick when I was young.

312
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:27,560
I could hardly walk, run
or joke around as a kid.

313
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:29,015
I have no memories like that.

314
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:32,180
While I was sick,

315
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,342
my mom passed away.

316
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:40,790
I couldn't even bow...

317
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,364
...and pay respects at my mom's funeral.

318
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:43,708
So I just hid.

319
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:46,485
My father was scary...

320
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:48,291
...and I felt bad for my grandma.

321
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,351
I was young, weak,

322
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,893
and always at risk.

323
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,584
I was born with a silver spoon
in my mouth,

324
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,165
but it was neither a happy
nor a warm childhood.

325
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,024
I tried to run away from it,

326
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:04,496
but I just kept going in circles,

327
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:06,849
until I came back here.

328
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:12,313
I am...

329
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,060
...weak when it comes to people in pain.

330
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:16,382
But...

331
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:19,941
...I'm weaker when it comes
to people who are in danger.

332
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:23,223
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

333
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:24,794
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

334
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:27,271
So, you should let it go this once?

335
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,827
Okay?

336
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:32,256
Does it hurt anymore?

337
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:35,370
Are you okay?

338
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:38,257
They said that I've recovered.

339
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:47,906
What do you think?

340
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:50,163
Is this enough to prove my recovery?

341
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:54,934
That was enough.

342
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,509
Hey.

343
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,109
Let's go.

344
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:28,278
If I go on a date one more time,

345
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:29,816
I'm going to ache all over.

346
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:36,628
What's that expression on your face?

347
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:38,008
Now you want to date properly,

348
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:39,918
after all we've already done?

349
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:43,828
After all we've already done,

350
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:45,951
it's hard to take it all back.

351
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,290
I wish I can elope with you,

352
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,034
but your mother would be worried.

353
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,098
Drive carefully.

354
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,447
When you get tired
on the road, take a break.

355
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,599
Go inside.

356
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,387
Don't take this the wrong way.

357
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,369
It's not out of lust,

358
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:40,227
but out of concern.

359
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,165
Shall we...

360
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,263
...sleep together holding
each other's hands only?

361
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:56,141
Junseong!

362
00:27:57,858 --> 00:27:58,783
What is it?

363
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,715
Youngho won't be coming home tonight.

364
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,702
What?

365
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:04,120
-I wonder if he's okay.
-No, look at this.

366
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,619
"Boys, I can't go home tonight."
"Don't worry about me."

367
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:10,623
"I can't go home tonight."

368
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,157
You know what I'm saying?

369
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:16,443
Hey, what good is a champion?

370
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,863
-You're so slow.
-What are you talking about?

371
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:20,391
You really don't get it?

372
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:22,511
-Shut your mouth. What...
-Junseong.

373
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,047
We haven't...

374
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,652
...eaten ramyun noodles for a year.

375
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,122
That's the big deal?

376
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,260
We can't eat it when Youngho's around.

377
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,479
But he's not here.

378
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,561
Okay? I'll cook it.

379
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:55,060
I'm sorry, Sir.

380
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,334
They say that it's worse to drive tired
than to drive drunk.

381
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,280
I think this is more dangerous.

382
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:11,316
Are you sure this is
out of concern for me?

383
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,805
Why don't you just close
your eyes for a while?

384
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,095
Is this why you sent your mother
to your brother's house?

385
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,529
Come on.

386
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:30,411
Why aren't you talking
about working out today?

387
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,108
Why do you think I asked you to meet me
all the way over there?

388
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:38,443
Is it because...

389
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:41,246
Walking is best to
straighten out your hips.

390
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,501
You walk with your toes turned out.
Let's work on that.

391
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:46,799
I can't...

392
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,600
...believe...

393
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:50,455
...how consistent you are.

394
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:57,195
Your body belongs to me.
It's my responsibility.

395
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,476
The executive director position.

396
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:19,003
Do you really have to do it?

397
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,256
Why?

398
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,141
Now that you've met your Prince Charming,

399
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,661
do you think it'll be tiring?

400
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,260
If you are Prince Charming,

401
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,562
my life is "rags to riches",
and I'm Snow White.

402
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,379
My car is white as well.

403
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,234
It just seemed...

404
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,809
...that you didn't want the position.

405
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:47,757
If it was what you wanted,

406
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:50,447
you wouldn't have gone
in circles to get here.

407
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,200
Well...

408
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:59,342
...you seem to prefer working out...

409
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,784
...compared to using your head.

410
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:06,926
I am more confident in working out.

411
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,112
I can prove it right now.

412
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,685
What are you talking about?

413
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:19,354
You are showing me your back.
Do you want a back hug?

414
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:20,948
Okay.

415
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:26,695
This is a foul. I was defenseless.

416
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,709
I've already seen you
defenseless on the plane.

417
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:34,025
The support belt is unforgettable.

418
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,113
It's called a corset.

419
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,129
A corset.

420
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,664
Please don't get sick.

421
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,876
I think you're beautiful...

422
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,507
...when you're healthy.

423
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,353
Being healthy...

424
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,847
...is the sexiest thing.

425
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,954
I like your back.

426
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,256
It is almost as wide as mine.

427
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:06,558
Gosh.

428
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,411
Don't turn off the light.

429
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,672
It'll be a warm and
erotic night if you do.

430
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,546
I can't believe...

431
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,710
...she fell asleep.

432
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,684
Let me introduce the executive director...

433
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:19,424
...of Gahong Medical Group.

434
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,671
You said you didn't want
to get in a time machine,

435
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,540
so why are you in it?

436
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,825
The number you're calling
is not available.

437
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:06,073
Please leave a message after the beep.

438
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,774
"Im Woosik"

439
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,570
The subscriber cannot be reached.

440
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:23,303
Please leave a message after the beep.

441
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,423
How could you do this to me?

442
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,794
I've changed so much.

443
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,313
I've...

444
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,521
I've...

445
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:51,215
...changed so much now.

446
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:54,814
This shouldn't be happening to me.

447
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:01,489
What pretty and glamorous
girls used to have...

448
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:05,349
...should be mine now.

449
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:07,880
I should have all that now.

450
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:16,508
Why?

451
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,389
Why are things the same as before?

452
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:25,984
Why?

453
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:56,953
What do you mean...

454
00:36:57,684 --> 00:36:59,607
...John Kim may be...

455
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:01,927
...within Gahong?

456
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:06,346
There is a reporter in the States
who follows John Kim obsessively.

457
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:09,513
I met that reporter when I was there.

458
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:13,534
He said that John Kim's home
was under a Korean name.

459
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,868
So I dug a little deeper...

460
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,417
...and found out that
it was under Lee Hongim.

461
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,472
That's a familiar name. Isn't it?

462
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,044
Gahong?

463
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,809
Chairwoman Lee Hongim?

464
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:32,053
Although John Kim left,
it's still in Lee Hongim's name.

465
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,880
That means he's related to her.

466
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:38,638
If that Lee Hongim is
in fact Gahong's chairwoman,

467
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:42,191
that means that John Kim
is part of the Gahong family,

468
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:44,262
or he's related to them.

469
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:56,274
Producer Ko, who else knows about this?

470
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,279
I told you, it's an exclusive.

471
00:37:58,684 --> 00:38:00,311
Hold off on reporting it.

472
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:01,612
Are you serious?

473
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:04,818
Once I go public with this,
it will be huge.

474
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,617
It will be incredible.

475
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:10,889
I may be able to convert
it from a hunch to a fact.

476
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:11,988
What?

477
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:13,224
And...

478
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,935
...don't tell Hyunwoo
or Jooeun about this.

479
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,803
"OH! Soojin"

480
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,944
The number you're calling...

481
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:36,547
Although John Kim left,
it's still in Lee Hongim's name.

482
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:39,577
That means he's related to her.

483
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:41,519
Kim Youngho...

484
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,155
...may be John Kim?

485
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,479
If you're going to nag,
just say it.

486
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:57,258
You said it's a personal matter.

487
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,962
We'll head out now.

488
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:02,556
Thank you, Mr. Min.

489
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:30,416
Sorry I'm late.

490
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:35,898
Where is Mr. Choi Jinho?

491
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,972
Mr. Min found out about...

492
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,388
...his slush fund.

493
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,406
He called yesterday
to say he is resigning.

494
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:49,208
-Then...
-Kim Sungcheol will become the CEO.

495
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,967
And Kim Youngho will become
the executive director.

496
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,854
That means Youngjun and I
are out in the cold.

497
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:58,956
Is there nothing on Kim Youngho?

498
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,594
You must have heard of John Kim.

499
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,578
He's a popular personal trainer
in the States.

500
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,442
He was in a scandal with Anna Sue.

501
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:10,529
Oh, yes.

502
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,577
What about him?

503
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,909
What happens if Kim Youngho...

504
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:17,374
...is John Kim?

505
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:23,548
What?

506
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:24,882
What was that?

507
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:27,595
What if that is true?

508
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,516
It'll be a way to win over
the shareholders...

509
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,959
...who value tradition and prestige.

510
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:41,894
Star Im,

511
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,175
can this...

512
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,809
Can this be really be true?

513
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,824
I'll find out as quickly
and quietly as possible...

514
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:53,080
...before the 61st anniversary
inauguration ceremony.

515
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:00,137
Junseong.

516
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:02,021
How is your weight?

517
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:04,455
It's almost there.

518
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,224
It's been five o'clock for hours.

519
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:13,268
Why do I feel so lethargic?

520
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:15,137
You'll get sick if you work too hard.

521
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:17,498
It's the weekend.
You can take a day off.

522
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,901
This feels like we're playing dead.

523
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,340
Kang Jooeun Day.

524
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,276
You're right.

525
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,513
When is Ma'am coming back?

526
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,382
I'm so bored.

527
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,246
I'm home.

528
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,990
What were you doing?

529
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,325
-You're back.
-You're here.

530
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,490
I've missed you so much.

531
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:45,963
Why are you acting cute?

532
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,682
Let's tell them about yesterday later.

533
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:03,247
It's embarrassing.

534
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:05,549
Don't say anything
while we're all together.

535
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:09,076
Jiwoong! Your Ma'am...

536
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,254
...wants to tell you something.

537
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,347
What is it? Go ahead.

538
00:43:14,663 --> 00:43:17,532
Did Junseong's shoot go well?

539
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:21,666
Jang Yijin is totally into Junseong.

540
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,854
"Do you want to go out to eat or kiss me?"

541
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:25,755
Jiwoong.

542
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,323
"Do you want to go out to eat..."

543
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:28,853
-"...or sleep with me?"
-I told you to stop.

544
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,495
"Do you want to go out to eat?"
"I'm Jang Yijin."

545
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,079
I've heard that before.

546
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:39,317
Jang Yijin has high standards.

547
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,353
Put those in the refrigerator, please.

548
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:43,957
-Yes, Sir!
-In a while. After I get him.

549
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,118
Get over here.

550
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:46,353
Come here.

551
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:48,295
I'll see you later.

552
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,828
I'm going to get some rest.

553
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,109
Does it hurt anymore?

554
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:30,057
They said that I've recovered.

555
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,073
The meticulous Venus of Daegu's medicine.

556
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:55,359
Kang Jooeun.

557
00:44:55,598 --> 00:44:56,668
It's time to work out.

558
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:58,266
What time?

559
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,409
Can't you work out alone on the weekends?

560
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,019
Weren't we...

561
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,856
...dating, Youngho?

562
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,857
That's unrelated to this.

563
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:30,843
Plus, in here, call me "Coach". Okay?

564
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:34,461
Wow. Seriously.

565
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:35,998
Do you have a split personality?

566
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,168
You need to get healthier.

567
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:41,132
I want to taste the sweetness
of life for a long time.

568
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,352
I understand, but

569
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,762
I have hypothyroidism, so...

570
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,267
Everyone is a patient to a certain extent,

571
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:55,120
whether you're born that way
or become that way later.

572
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:00,613
I'm fine,

573
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:04,013
but my thyroid may be strained.

574
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:07,197
Don't worry. That depends on the coach.

575
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:09,906
Yes, Coach.

576
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:12,268
I lost a lot of weight.

577
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:15,242
Strengthening your muscles is more
important than losing weight.

578
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:19,462
That's the only way you can overcome
hypothyroidism and adult diseases.

579
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:20,626
Wait a second.

580
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:24,982
Will I become big and bulky?

581
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:27,812
That would be really sexy,

582
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:30,597
but it's difficult for women
to build muscle like that.

583
00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:33,702
Sit with your knees apart...

584
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,693
...and put your feet together.

585
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:39,008
Straighten your back.

586
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,067
This is a simple stretch for your hips.

587
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,774
Exhale.

588
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:51,257
Ouch!

589
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:55,062
Ouch! That really hurts!

590
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,097
You need to learn how to prevent
cramping in your legs.

591
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,834
If your hips are misaligned,
your balance will be off.

592
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,054
Rock back and forth.

593
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,859
Do this whenever you can. Don't forget.

594
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:11,935
Straighten your back.

595
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,502
You can go farther. Go.

596
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:17,491
Your back.

597
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,570
Don't resist!

598
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,311
Don't resist!

599
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:34,098
It was a good morning until a moment ago.

600
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:40,791
If you cross your legs like that,

601
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:42,682
it will misalign your hips,

602
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:44,754
and that will hinder blood circulation.

603
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:47,196
It makes your legs cramp up, too.

604
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,635
You are a health nut, aren't you?

605
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,009
Gahong's executive director, Kim Youngho.

606
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:00,477
You know him, don't you?

607
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,447
At the hotel that day...

608
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,919
"She said don't come."

609
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:10,857
He said that, right?

610
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:12,779
I see.

611
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:17,055
Are you talking about
the time I caught you...

612
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,399
...with my ex-boyfriend at the hotel?

613
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:23,033
Since we are the external
legal counsel for Gahong,

614
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:25,869
if you have a personal relationship
with the client,

615
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,805
I thought that I,

616
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,174
as your superior, should know about it.

617
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:33,258
Making me report my personal life...

618
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,331
...seems like a human rights violation,

619
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,233
Ma'am.

620
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:38,418
It's your personal life?

621
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:42,583
If he's the executive director of Gahong,

622
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:46,493
that means
he's the future owner.

623
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:48,572
Are you saying that
you have private matters...

624
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,339
...with a man like that?

625
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:55,633
How interesting.

626
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,198
Is this a type of mental victory?

627
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:00,136
Or...

628
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,172
...do you want to get revenge
even if it's in your imagination?

629
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:06,143
Revenge?

630
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,580
Do I look that bored to you?

631
00:49:10,593 --> 00:49:13,408
You live your life, Vice President Oh.

632
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,825
I will live a long,
happy and healthy life.

633
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:18,731
I'll live 100 years.

634
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,143
Did you get the settlement
for Myeongeun Electronics?

635
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,812
Why should I do that?

636
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:29,518
It's your job. You even
sent over a box of tonic.

637
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:31,435
She says she won't settle.

638
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:34,025
I don't know what you warned her of.

639
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,366
I didn't warn her.

640
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:36,590
I advised her.

641
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:39,202
I studied hard in law school.

642
00:49:39,287 --> 00:49:40,689
I should make use of it.

643
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,250
You don't have anything else
to say, do you?

644
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,292
It was a good morning,

645
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:49,830
up until a few minutes ago.

646
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,623
We're waiting for you, Sir.

647
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:28,395
I'm coming.

648
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:06,489
Come in.

649
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,671
The new executive director, Kim Youngho...

650
00:51:15,011 --> 00:51:16,306
...came to introduce himself.

651
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,434
I'm Kim Youngho. I apologize
for the late introduction.

652
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:45,569
I think he looks very different from
the photographs of John Kim. It's...

653
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:49,508
Wow.

654
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,178
My nephew...

655
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:55,280
...is all grown up now.

656
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,481
It's nice to meet you, Mr Choi.

657
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:02,309
I'm the only one who saw him when
he was young, right?

658
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:07,824
Anyway, let's work hard together.

659
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,295
I'm the General Manager, Im Woosik.

660
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,831
I look forward to working with you.

661
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:15,992
Same here.

662
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:17,853
I look forward to working with you.

663
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:21,951
I'll see you at the inauguration ceremony.

664
00:52:41,752 --> 00:52:44,322
This is Lawyer Kang Jooeun speaking...

665
00:52:46,384 --> 00:52:47,440
Junseong?

666
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,281
Are you free after work?

667
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:53,188
Yes.

668
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:56,336
I just have to wrap up
what I'm working on.

669
00:52:58,514 --> 00:52:59,404
Okay.

670
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:16,111
Should we go get some drinks?

671
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:18,870
I have a fight coming up.

672
00:53:18,997 --> 00:53:20,131
That's right.

673
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,641
I'm sorry.

674
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,493
It just looks like it's
a difficult topic to bring up.

675
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:27,414
That's not it,

676
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:28,805
but it isn't easy.

677
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,977
Do you want me...

678
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:36,134
...to help you find your mom?

679
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:39,540
I found my mom...

680
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:44,150
...but she doesn't want to see me.

681
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:47,517
I can't do anything about that,

682
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:50,227
but I don't think she's doing well.

683
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:54,331
I was thinking of a way to help her out.

684
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,167
You are the only person...

685
00:53:57,566 --> 00:53:59,101
...that I can trust in Korea.

686
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,313
What about Youngho?

687
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:02,705
I don't want him to know.

688
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:06,100
He'll be disappointed.

689
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:08,378
Here.

690
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:18,123
I'll do anything I can to help.

691
00:54:19,629 --> 00:54:21,221
I know you're busy.

692
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:23,421
What about the fee...

693
00:54:23,506 --> 00:54:25,195
Come on, now.

694
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:27,171
What are you saying?

695
00:54:28,007 --> 00:54:29,966
I owe you much more.

696
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,436
Thank you for letting me repay you.

697
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,440
This isn't the type of work you do, is it?

698
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:39,552
It isn't.

699
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:43,736
I wish this was the type
of work Lawyers did.

700
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,650
Thank you.

701
00:54:47,128 --> 00:54:49,219
I'll take you home and
then head to the gym.

702
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,294
You don't have to put that on yet.

703
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:56,493
These will all be fond memories.

704
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:57,797
Oh.

705
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,786
I'm moving out next week.

706
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,667
I found a place.

707
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:08,138
-I'm disappointed.
-No, no. Where are you going?

708
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,818
I'm not thick-skinned enough
to be happy about...

709
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,135
...freeloading off of other people.

710
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,635
Look! It's snowing.

711
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,400
It's the first snowfall.

712
00:55:26,468 --> 00:55:28,111
Ma'am. Did you lose five kilograms?

713
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:29,775
I really want to go camping.

714
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,333
Oh, no.

715
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:35,378
I didn't.

716
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:36,865
You don't know yet.

717
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,336
I know.

718
00:55:39,823 --> 00:55:41,049
I didn't.

719
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:46,611
Where is Youngho right now?

720
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:50,680
Isn't it okay...

721
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:53,402
...as long as Youngho doesn't see it?

722
00:55:53,487 --> 00:55:54,933
Okay, let's pretend we didn't see this.

723
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,668
-This isn't snow. No.
-It isn't snow.

724
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:05,495
Youngho.

725
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:09,166
Coach.

726
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:12,467
Is he asleep?

727
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:15,272
Is he out?

728
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:30,020
Sure, camping is nice and all,

729
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,426
but we should see
the first snowfall together.

730
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:36,995
Youngho!

731
00:56:37,912 --> 00:56:38,969
Coach?

732
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,965
Can I just go in like this?

733
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,952
Youngho.

734
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:46,627
Are you sleeping?

735
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:49,222
Coach.

736
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,108
It's snowing.

737
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:01,499
I know he owns this place but
he really does sleep in a grand hall.

738
00:57:12,781 --> 00:57:15,265
Where did he go?

739
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:33,113
Coach... Coach.

740
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,368
Stay away.

741
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,145
Stay away!
