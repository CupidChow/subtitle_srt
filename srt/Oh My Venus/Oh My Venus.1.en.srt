1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,611
"Episode 1"

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:05,905
"Daegu, 1999"

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,222
Am I prettier than Jooeun?

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:10,849
-Are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

5
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:21,580
"Hello, I'm Lee Sunghak."

6
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:24,481
"I'm 18 years old and I live in Daegu."

7
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:28,021
"I am writing about a girl
I have a crush on."

8
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:32,268
"She's a junior at Juwan Girls' High
School. Her name is Kang Jooeun."

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,437
-Jooeun?
-Jooeun?

10
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,455
She must be a very beautiful girl.

11
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,161
Are they talking about Jooeun again?

12
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,550
This song is dedicated to Kang Jooeun,

13
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,774
who is also known as the Venus of Daegu.

14
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,451
Our next song is "On the Bus".

15
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,261
-Not only that!
-Not only that!

16
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:53,353
-Of course!
-Of course!

17
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,180
-I'll get sick!
-I'll get sick!

18
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,623
-He's on the bus. Find him.
-Find him.

19
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,569
Get over here.

20
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:08,707
The Venus of Daegu is here.

21
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:11,808
-She's gorgeous.
-Sit down!

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,722
You're 48.6 kilograms?

23
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:56,024
You're 170 centimeters tall
and your bust is 36 inches?

24
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,612
That's crazy, Jooeun.

25
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:00,190
-Are you even human?
-What do you eat?

26
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:02,890
-She doesn't eat, that's why.
-Shut your mouth.

27
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:05,449
-She's a different breed entirely.
-You're right.

28
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,391
-Keep it down!
-She's really...

29
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:12,228
Life is so unfair.
What's the point of studying?

30
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,201
-I know.
-Be quiet.

31
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:18,749
Hey, Jooeun.

32
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,159
Someone is asking for you at
the main entrance.

33
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:23,657
That's so annoying.

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,452
Why didn't you use a pencil?

35
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:30,540
Listen carefully.

36
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:37,162
Goodness.

37
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,178
-Jooeun.
-What's this?

38
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:41,980
Erase that.

39
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,313
-Hey, you guys smoking over there.
-Gosh, that startled me.

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,773
-What?
-Quit smoking. You won't grow.

41
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:58,666
Even if you're tall, quit.
You could still be growing.

42
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,298
-Who is this?
-She's a famous girl.

43
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:02,951
She's Venus of Daegu.

44
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:04,674
Hey.

45
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:06,680
Pick that up.

46
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:10,490
Just because everyone in
Daegu thinks you're pretty,

47
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,697
do you think you can talk to
me like that?

48
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,269
Why not?

49
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:15,141
I told you to pick this up.

50
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,513
Kang Jooeun.

51
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,175
I'm Kang Jooeun. What do you want?

52
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,166
Don't you dare smoke here again.

53
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,265
If you do, you guys will get in trouble.

54
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,348
Stop getting worked up.

55
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,454
Your ice cream is melting.

56
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:57,768
Let's go.

57
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:02,608
What's wrong with him?

58
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,455
Was he not smoking?

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,629
You're perfect!

60
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,040
Wonderful.

61
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,954
Beautiful. Fantastic!

62
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:23,810
Does your mom tell you to be Miss Korea?

63
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,060
No, she doesn't.

64
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,596
My mom tells me to study.

65
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:29,116
No. You shouldn't.

66
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:32,161
You don't look like you'll need to
study in the future.

67
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm very busy.

68
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:39,346
Hold on, Jooeun.

69
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,527
Don't you want to improve your life?

70
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,256
I have no complaints with my life.

71
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,493
And...

72
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,386
...I look good with straight hair.

73
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,278
Bye.

74
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,705
Oh, my gosh.

75
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,794
You don't want to be the next Miss Korea?

76
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,780
Then what will you be?

77
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:59,172
"Become an attorney
I can do it!"

78
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,223
You're sniffling.
You might catch a cold.

79
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:06,302
Thanks.

80
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,188
Your finals are coming up, right?

81
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,723
You can just study off of these.

82
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,106
-But...
-Yes?

83
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,843
...you keep studying the basics
because of me.

84
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,924
No, Jooeun. That's not true.

85
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,501
Studying is all about knowing the basics.

86
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:22,166
You're studying so hard to get
into law school.

87
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,484
This is all we can do for you.

88
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,794
I found a kid from the States to
help you with English.

89
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,117
I wish I could be the one to help you.

90
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,755
Silence.

91
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,465
Your future goal is to become a lawyer.

92
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:05,876
You're a junior
at Juwan Girls' High School.

93
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,017
Kang Jooeun?

94
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,125
Yes, I'm Kang Jooeun.
What do you want?

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,468
You know me, right?

96
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,206
Should I?

97
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,800
Are you someone famous?

98
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,504
Are you in the textbooks or something?

99
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,736
I'm only halfway through
the Joseon era in my textbook.

100
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,195
Which part are you in?

101
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,939
I'm in the papers.

102
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,454
I go to a sports school nearby.

103
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,245
I'm the youngest athlete
on the National Swim Team.

104
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:34,212
I was a junior representative at
an international meet.

105
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:35,411
I mean, I just finished the competition.

106
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,218
I'm so sorry.

107
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,322
I should've gotten you a bouquet.

108
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:44,626
-I'm from Seoul.
-Don't lie.

109
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,301
That competition was held in France.

110
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,625
That's not what I meant.

111
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,722
I thought you wanted to
learn the Seoul dialect?

112
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,662
I was scouted in Seoul.

113
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:01,786
Did you...

114
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,505
...read "CC"?

115
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,043
Only losers read that magazine.

116
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:14,744
Your dimples are cute.

117
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:21,987
Some might think you're trying
to seduce me,

118
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,694
by telling me that you'll teach me
the Seoul dialect.

119
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,511
I don't know for sure, but...

120
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,483
...I probably won't be able to
say this again.

121
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,982
For a man, his first love...

122
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,592
...can only come once.

123
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:16,104
"1999 FINA World Championships"

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
"1500 meters swimming, Winner"

125
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,206
Kang Jooeun.

126
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:23,304
Starting today, you'll be my first love.

127
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:31,639
Seoul dialect is really hard.

128
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:35,331
It's probably just as hard
as becoming an attorney.

129
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:36,614
No.

130
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:40,193
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

131
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:41,585
I'm Kang Jooeun.

132
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:44,399
Then put your mind on me, too.

133
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,570
"Seoul, 2014"

134
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,203
I used to be like that.

135
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:29,583
I could do anything if I put
my mind to it.

136
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,073
That's the old Kang Jooeun.

137
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:34,871
Hello.

138
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,211
-Get us some tea.
-Okay.

139
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,026
Please, have a seat.

140
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:48,911
I thought if I became an attorney,

141
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,940
I'd be able to help keep world peace
and guarantee my own safety.

142
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,072
I was wrong.

143
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:00,358
Life is one disaster after another.

144
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:01,969
The problems never end.

145
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,645
It's true that dreams come true.

146
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:09,083
It is true, but when they do come true...

147
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,196
...your clothes stop fitting.

148
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:14,686
He's a swimmer, right?

149
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:17,141
Who's the woman next to him?

150
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,809
Yes, he is a swimmer.

151
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,827
His name is Im Woosik.

152
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,202
He's my first love
and boyfriend of 15 years.

153
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,999
The woman next to him is me.

154
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,470
She fell into her own track.

155
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,545
-You mean, "her own trap".
-Well.

156
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,328
She did it to herself.
Why is she blaming me?

157
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,647
What in life lasts forever?

158
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:44,269
Love, women and everything else
fade with time.

159
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,500
All men are the same.

160
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,658
They like pretty girls.
Even more so if they're young.

161
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:50,745
Don't you agree?

162
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,462
It's true that the probability is high.

163
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,179
Do I look like an amateur?

164
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,328
Who leaves evidence of cheating nowadays?

165
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:02,517
She's just mad because her husband
wants a divorce.

166
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:05,433
It does seem like
she's putting pressure on you.

167
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,271
That's exactly what I'm saying.

168
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:10,500
Is the law against adultery
going to be repealed?

169
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:15,469
It's not that I'm worried or anything.

170
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,750
I'm not a congresswoman, so...

171
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:21,366
She lost her husband to a hottie...

172
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,063
...and didn't get alimony.

173
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,164
That's why she should've hired
an expensive lawyer.

174
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:28,795
Excuse me.

175
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,881
-Are you saying that you're...
-Yes.

176
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,176
Yes, that "hottie" is me.

177
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:38,082
The ex-wife pressed charges,
so I'm doing the same.

178
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,503
Defamation, false claims
and invasion of privacy.

179
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,153
Include anything that may work.

180
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,437
I will never, ever settle.

181
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,311
I'll call you after I review
the documents.

182
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,305
Even so,

183
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:03,882
consider that the other party
was also harmed...

184
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,515
You misread me.

185
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,982
I'm not someone who reconsiders.

186
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,229
Please win at any cost.

187
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:17,801
If you eat a lot of sweets,
it will stress you out.

188
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,800
You don't seem to know that.

189
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,059
-It relieves stress.
-Nonsense.

190
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,644
You get stressed when you gain weight!

191
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,558
Your plants are all dead.

192
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:34,916
They aren't...

193
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:38,883
...dead yet.

194
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,350
You should water them.

195
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,940
I almost smacked her.

196
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,237
What happened to justice and virtue?

197
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:53,214
Why is there none of that?

198
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,002
Lawyer Kang.

199
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,506
The man who cheated with that lady...

200
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,362
...is our president's best friend.

201
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,501
Hyunjeong.

202
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,214
Must an attorney do things like this?

203
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,786
It's because you're an attorney
that you do it.

204
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,796
Don't you know the president's motto?

205
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:10,891
I know.

206
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,083
How can an attorney not know...

207
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,884
...something even a secretary knows?

208
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,077
President.

209
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,920
If you're going to gossip,

210
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,715
at least be careful about it.

211
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,491
That's not it.

212
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,640
Kim Miji's case seems a bit unfair.

213
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,192
Unfair, unfair!

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,830
Are you complaining about fairness again?

215
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,907
What is this nonsense at a law firm?

216
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,495
You're always
complaining about fairness...

217
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,298
...ethics and morals
an attorney should have.

218
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,904
Let me explain something to you.

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,435
If everyone cared about ethics and morals,

220
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,088
we'd starve to death.

221
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,601
Ethics and morals aside,
we're still attorneys.

222
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,217
We shouldn't hurt someone
who did nothing wrong.

223
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,287
What am I going to do with you?

224
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,280
It's illegal for taxi drivers to refuse
certain passengers.

225
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,417
That goes for attorneys too.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,224
I've told you this over and over.

227
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,622
Obtain your hopes and dreams...

228
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,396
...on your own time.

229
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,291
Don't act like this when you're at work.

230
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,840
This case must be your top priority.

231
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:16,456
President.

232
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,021
-President.
-Lawyer Kang.

233
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:23,252
You still have 14 months left
on your loan.

234
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:26,672
Do you know why the past is
important to us?

235
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:29,852
It's because we need to
learn from our past.

236
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,319
"2012"

237
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,918
This is just...

238
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,972
He moved your desk in retaliation.

239
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:45,162
If you want to start your own practice,
just let me know.

240
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,788
I'll send you a nice plant
to congratulate you.

241
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,449
"L.A., 2014"

242
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:56,443
Hollywood's biggest trouble maker,
Anna Sue.

243
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,166
Yet another scandal.

244
00:14:58,255 --> 00:14:59,454
The girl is crazy.

245
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,645
She has some problems.

246
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:02,523
Yes, definitely.

247
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,430
Well, let's talk about this
as we go through,

248
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,537
these paparazzi cuts from yesterday.

249
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,539
Very good, Kim.

250
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,026
The star of the "Stella Show"
is now engulfing...

251
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,547
Before Jennifer Anderson met
secret trainer John Kim,

252
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,338
she was lost in darkness.

253
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,707
He turned her into a queen of queens...

254
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:20,574
...and sent a hopeful message to
women all over the world.

255
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:23,313
That very John Kim,
the hero of the "Stella Show"...

256
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,560
...is now engulfed in a scandal.

257
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,051
The person on the other end is Anna Sue,

258
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:29,486
Hollywood's infamous troublemaker,

259
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,095
with a merciless tongue
and problems with drugs.

260
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,878
Sources say John Kim
is an Asian man in his 30s...

261
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,259
...and that's all we know.

262
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,762
You know, I'm really hoping
for the couple...

263
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:41,314
John Kim, he's such a great guy...

264
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,689
...and you know we all want to
root for his relationship.

265
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,694
Shame on Anna Sue.

266
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:41,675
I learned this after becoming an attorney.

267
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,586
This is what lawyers typically do.

268
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,786
We usually begin by stating that...

269
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,100
...we defend our clients...

270
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,884
...for the following reasons.

271
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,315
For example.

272
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,880
Do you think I never tried to
go on a diet?

273
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:58,979
Something like that?

274
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,993
I tried eating only bananas,
cabbage, and tofu,

275
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:05,162
as suggested by a blogger.

276
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,754
It was a one-food diet.

277
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,337
But it was hard
and there were side effects.

278
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,307
An actress known for her looks
said her secret was...

279
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,034
Do you have raspberry tea?

280
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,343
No, we don't.

281
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:22,233
Pass.

282
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:23,350
I see.

283
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:29,952
A sexy celebrity said that her secret
was to take two leisurely baths a day.

284
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:33,254
There's also something about
dieting that we all know.

285
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,456
The best of all methods.

286
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,853
Exercising consistently...

287
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:39,874
...and getting plenty of sleep.

288
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,459
Plenty of sleep.

289
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,454
And above all, avoid stress. Be positive.

290
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:51,562
Yes.

291
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:54,100
Please go on.

292
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,799
Are you telling me you don't care...

293
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:58,010
...because it's not your business?

294
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,521
No. That's not it.

295
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,878
Anyway, when a diet
becomes a waste of time,

296
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:07,778
that pesky yo-yo tags along.

297
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,100
That annoying yo-yo...

298
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:11,896
...makes me cry.

299
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,073
"Jooeun and Woosik's 15th anniversary"

300
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:27,087
"My Woosik"

301
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,278
Where are you?

302
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:34,294
"Where are you?"

303
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,925
Are you still at work?

304
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,776
"Are you still at work?"

305
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:53,231
Your dimples are cute.

306
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,866
"My Woosik"

307
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:07,858
Hi. What is it?

308
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,793
I need to talk to you.

309
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,880
I know.

310
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:12,896
I know the place too.

311
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:15,071
Okay.

312
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,195
Sure.

313
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,391
I won't get down on my knees.

314
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:44,754
If you did, I would've taken
the ring right off.

315
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,466
It's an expensive ring. I'm glad I didn't.

316
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,219
What date is it today?

317
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,799
Today? It's October 23rd.

318
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,017
Today is Day 1 of our relationship.

319
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,891
I don't expect a 30-carat ring.

320
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,275
Hey, I'm not Elizabeth Taylor.

321
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,183
I'm your friend.
I'm not comparing you to a dead woman.

322
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,183
He made you wait for 15 years
and now you're old.

323
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,992
He has to get you a nice ring.

324
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,560
He's not the one who made me old.

325
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,341
Stop talking nonsense.

326
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,324
Okay. You got old all by yourself.

327
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,723
How about your weight?

328
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:34,128
How many times do I have to tell you?

329
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,407
I have a curvy Western-style body.

330
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,977
You always insist
that you have a curvy body.

331
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:45,679
Some people might misunderstand you.

332
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:47,446
They might say
a divorcee is just feeling jealous.

333
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,403
A divorcee with a business
is jealous of a single lady in debt?

334
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,085
Times have changed now.

335
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:55,198
That single lady who's in debt
is going to get proposed to today.

336
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,768
You're ruining my day.
I'm hanging up.

337
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,087
Don't be too excited.

338
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,361
It seems your heart got bigger,
along with your body.

339
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,729
You are too emotional.

340
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,532
Hang up now.

341
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:07,683
You deserve the best, but don't overreact.

342
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,183
Oh, no!

343
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,253
Did you drop it down the drain?

344
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:37,093
-You can use mine.
-What?

345
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,800
No, thank you.

346
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,342
It looks new. I'm all right.

347
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,285
I have several of these.

348
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,685
I'll use it then. Thank you.

349
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,915
Black makes you look slim,

350
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,013
but it doesn't make you slim.

351
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,218
Darn it.

352
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:23,066
I'm here.

353
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,063
You're here.

354
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:41,361
You said you were too busy to even
check your messages.

355
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:42,370
What's the occasion?

356
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:44,767
Even though I'm busy,
I have to do what I have to do.

357
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,386
Today's our 15th anniversary.

358
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,972
Is this what you were planning for
the past few days?

359
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,177
Excuse me.

360
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,980
You're embarrassing me.

361
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,406
To 15 years.

362
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:24,203
Thank you for those years.

363
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,707
Today is Day 1 of our relationship.

364
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,697
It's an expensive ring. I'm glad I didn't.

365
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:21,808
It's my heart.

366
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,398
Please accept it.

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,167
Is this your heart?

368
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:32,976
Why is your heart in this box?

369
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:36,515
I'm very sorry, Jooeun.

370
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:40,814
I'm asking why is your heart in this box?

371
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,230
-It was on your finger.
-Jooeun.

372
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,327
What's this for?

373
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:54,176
I don't want to look like a bad guy.

374
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:55,366
That's why...

375
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,482
That's why?

376
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,833
So, you thought
buying me wine and flowers...

377
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,692
...would make you less of a bad guy?

378
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,950
Stop kidding around
and give me the real ring.

379
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:11,577
I just wanted to celebrate
our 15th anniversary.

380
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,776
I'm sorry, Jooeun.

381
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,485
What are you talking about?

382
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,291
Are you crazy?

383
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,553
Have you gone insane?

384
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,188
Why are you apologizing
when you should be proposing?

385
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,093
Jooeun.

386
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:28,007
-We should...
-Shut up.

387
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,471
-Jooeun, I mean...
-I got it so just shut your mouth.

388
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:36,169
-What do you get?
-I get what this ring means.

389
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,543
I get why you are returning
this ring to me.

390
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:46,308
I get that you're a different person now.

391
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:50,283
You're different from when
you first gave me this ring.

392
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,509
I got it all.

393
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:53,347
Woosik...

394
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:56,350
I'm just too exhausted today.

395
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,477
Let's talk later, okay?

396
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,853
-Jooeun!
-Just stop!

397
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,751
We've repeatedly broken up.

398
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:11,942
We've fought about so much over
the past 15 years.

399
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,251
You might have forgotten this,

400
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,815
but I'm Kang Jooeun.

401
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:20,378
I'm your first love, Woosik.

402
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,177
You can't just tell me
that you want to break up.

403
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,486
We can't break up that easily.

404
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,889
Did you want to make this day
special for me?

405
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,479
Tell me, what did you do for me
in the last 15 years?

406
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:50,917
Congratulations.

407
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:58,542
Jooeun!

408
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:22,044
Is there anything in the law books...

409
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:25,534
...that could help me understand
this situation?

410
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,011
Everybody is equal before the law,

411
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:32,982
but not everyone is equal
in front of the mirror.

412
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,227
Drinking this will make you slim.

413
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,634
Did you give up on life...

414
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,702
...just because you had
a bitter case of failure?

415
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,932
Would you give up on life as a woman,

416
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,854
just because you're fat, or you've aged?

417
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,548
Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:02,109
today, I'd like to introduce to you
a woman who is reborn.

419
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,187
Reborn.

420
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:10,387
She is not the woman
who failed in her marriage...

421
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,660
...or wrecked her life
with drugs and alcohol.

422
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,638
Now, I give you...

423
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,428
...the reborn Queen of Queens.

424
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,473
Jennifer Anderson!

425
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:28,069
What could make this possible?

426
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:30,553
God created Jennifer.

427
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:33,818
John Kim completed her.

428
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:35,800
You look beautiful.

429
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:41,860
John Kim rediscovered
her lost time and smile.

430
00:28:42,837 --> 00:28:45,440
That's all we know about him.

431
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:48,070
A faceless John Kim.

432
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,244
What makes us so wild about him?

433
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:54,046
Who is this guy?

434
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:57,542
One.

435
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,112
One, two.

436
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,676
Raise your guard.

437
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:05,641
Relax your shoulders.

438
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:13,106
You're doing well.

439
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:14,669
Come on.

440
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,784
One, two.

441
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:46,759
Good!

442
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:01,148
Hi, Hyunwoo.

443
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:03,691
Are you at the airport?
Do you still have some time?

444
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,246
Can you stop by duty-free...

445
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:06,405
I'm dead.

446
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,608
You overslept, didn't you?

447
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,345
If you're going to the airport,
get me an eye cream from the duty-free...

448
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,445
Bye!

449
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,892
Eye cream. Not ice cream.

450
00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:22,710
That's what you like.

451
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,127
Hello?

452
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:29,022
Jooeun.

453
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:34,424
I wonder how her proposal went.

454
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,176
Is that why she overslept?

455
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:48,504
Lawyer Kang, we need you to go
to the States for a business trip.

456
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,791
It's over the weekend.

457
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:06,220
I'm coming! We're here.

458
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,537
Youngho.

459
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:18,743
I'm going to wash up.

460
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,123
Okay.

461
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:44,953
Youngho, the steaks are burning!

462
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,150
-Flip it over.
-Flip it over.

463
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:54,742
It's over.

464
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:58,027
Akira improved a lot.

465
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,234
Youngho.

466
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:01,337
The sweet potatoes are burning.

467
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:02,949
-Flip it over.
-Flip it over.

468
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,639
When is it?

469
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,621
It's the evening flight.

470
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,195
Oh, my God!

471
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:16,632
"Anna Sue is not denying
nor admitting to the scandal."

472
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:19,022
Romance rumor?

473
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:32,173
What should we do?

474
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,796
She's beautiful.

475
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,408
You look good together.

476
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:48,524
This is bad. If they find out...

477
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:50,732
They'll do as they please.

478
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:54,153
You have to blame the one who got caught,
not the one who caught them.

479
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,226
What do you plan to do?

480
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:01,755
Let me think about which lamp casts
the darkest shadow.

481
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,339
Anyway, it's my business, so...

482
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:08,806
No. It's not business.

483
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:10,640
It's a scandal.

484
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,309
-You punk.
-You punk.

485
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:15,546
Hello?

486
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:20,550
Yes, Korean Snake manager right here.

487
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,579
What about your things?

488
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,355
I shipped them out already.

489
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:26,992
I packed the stuff I'm bringing with me.

490
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,390
I can't believe this is happening now.

491
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:32,432
Take care of yourself.

492
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,543
You opened the gates of hell.
Worry about yourself.

493
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,079
I know.

494
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:40,022
You're not young anymore.

495
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,345
The one you're up against is young.

496
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:47,657
Won't you come visit me before the fight?

497
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,015
I sparred with you and coached you.

498
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,938
I pampered you
and made you into a champion.

499
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,376
You seem dissatisfied.

500
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:03,677
I'm being affectionate.

501
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:06,126
Come on. Let's spar.

502
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,976
"Mr. Min"

503
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:17,523
Hello, Mr Min.

504
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:19,745
What?

505
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,554
I'm okay.

506
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,219
Yes, sure.

507
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,798
He says he's just checking in,
but I have a bad feeling.

508
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,266
Did they find out about it?

509
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:37,957
If so, they would've rushed over
or kicked me out.

510
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:44,289
Try being affectionate again
and you're dead.

511
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:48,802
Does he think the States is
Gyeonggi-do or something?

512
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,231
He wants you to go and come right back?

513
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,032
Your president is really something else.

514
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,484
I still feel sick.

515
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,190
-Maybe I have indigestion.
-That's good.

516
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,192
If you don't feel well,
it'll help you lose weight.

517
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,492
That medicine is effective.

518
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,886
My stomach is turning.

519
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:07,671
I'm sick.

520
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:10,564
It's better than being chubby.

521
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:12,280
You're fine.

522
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:13,697
I'm curvy.

523
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:17,114
Then live in the States.
Everyone's curvy there.

524
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,810
Right. How did it go with Woosik?

525
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,309
Did he give you a ring?

526
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:23,793
How big is it?

527
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,707
He gave me something incredible.

528
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:29,655
I'll tell you when I'm back.

529
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:31,389
Oh, right.

530
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,357
Lawyer Kang.

531
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,269
Should I pick you up?

532
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:36,666
Forget it.

533
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:41,197
Your eye cream, Minjun's lotion,
and his grandma's scarf.

534
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,396
I won't forget to buy them.

535
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:44,955
Bye.

536
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:53,552
Are you in the States?

537
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:55,267
Call me when you get back.

538
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,641
"Are you in the States?
Call me when you get back"

539
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,722
How was Minjun's field trip?

540
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,018
You should've sent some photos.

541
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,077
It's next week.

542
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,549
Does the ex-wife care about
her ex-husband?

543
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,684
Of course. That's where
the child support comes from.

544
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:21,120
Does the ex-wife know about John Kim?

545
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,592
Don't you know that Korea
has the best internet connection?

546
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:26,807
Even the customers were talking about him.

547
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:27,918
See.

548
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,444
Identifying stories that
the public is interested in...

549
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,703
...is what a good producer does.

550
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:33,981
He knows what he's doing.

551
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:35,316
Look at that.

552
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:38,151
"Who is he?", "What is the truth?"

553
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:41,587
The story's full of fluff
and it lacks facts.

554
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:44,137
Even the news lack facts these days.

555
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:46,442
I'll be on my way.

556
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:49,016
Just wire me the money.

557
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,699
Divorce isn't something to boast about.

558
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,657
Is child support some sort of
utility bill?

559
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:04,022
"A Korean Orphan, Now The Champion!
Korean Snake!"

560
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,053
Let's go.

561
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:17,925
Who would think you went to Harvard?

562
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:21,433
I always wear this Harvard shirt.

563
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,694
Exactly.

564
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:24,464
Put that in the trunk.

565
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:25,967
No.

566
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,269
It's cold on the plane.

567
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:30,888
I'm starved.

568
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,784
Grab something on the way.

569
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:50,749
Thank you.

570
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:03,027
Hey, ma'am.
We were destined to meet.

571
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,950
-Pardon?
-Destiny.

572
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,131
Nice face.

573
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:15,655
Thank you.

574
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:17,538
My gosh.

575
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,560
It's okay. I'm a gentleman.

576
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:25,550
I feel bad making your companion give up
such an expensive seat.

577
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:27,272
It's fine. Make yourself comfortable.

578
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,058
Thank you so much.

579
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:31,970
-May I hang that up for you?
-Thank you.

580
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:47,655
Gosh, you scared me.

581
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:56,826
Korean Steak?

582
00:38:57,506 --> 00:38:58,265
No.

583
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,795
Korean Snake.

584
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,606
Jang Junseong.

585
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:05,693
He's a champion.

586
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:13,520
Korean Snake.

587
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:16,124
Are you an athlete?

588
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,329
I'm a manager and a trainer.

589
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,012
I'm embarrassed to say it myself,

590
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:29,159
but I'm pretty famous.

591
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:39,739
When are you coming back?

592
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,847
I'd like to see you.

593
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:44,639
Are you in the States?

594
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:46,981
Call me when you get back.

595
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:57,852
Excuse me.

596
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,553
Could you bring me a blanket?

597
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:02,360
Sure, I'll bring you one.

598
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:04,358
You can use this.

599
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,629
I'm okay.

600
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:06,969
I'm okay too.

601
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,796
Then, I'll use it for a while.

602
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:22,441
You know, you look cute.

603
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,800
Our aircraft
is passing through turbulence.

604
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:32,699
Since the cabin is shaking,
please go back to your seat,

605
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:34,956
and make sure to fasten your seat belt.

606
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,980
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

607
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,692
Announcement to all passengers.

608
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,644
There's an emergency patient on board.

609
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,263
If there is a doctor on board,

610
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,414
please let the flight attendants know.

611
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:03,906
I wanted to surprise people.

612
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,362
-Youngho.
-I'm glad I surprised you.

613
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:12,769
You are not supposed
to unfasten your seat belt.

614
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,065
Where is the patient?

615
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,188
Why are you heading to Korea?

616
00:41:18,662 --> 00:41:20,597
Because that's the darkest shadow.

617
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,612
Ma'am! Wake up!

618
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:26,145
-Ma'am!
-What's wrong?

619
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:29,390
Goodness. Why are you here?

620
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,002
-Did you see her eating anything?
-What?

621
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:35,039
Nothing much.
She had coffee and some medicine.

622
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:37,540
-What medicine?
-It hurts...

623
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,864
-Why are you here?
-Tell me.

624
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:40,833
Okay.

625
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:43,724
Coffee and some medicine.
I don't know the name.

626
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,277
And wine.

627
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:49,405
I don't know. Please just save her.

628
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:51,143
What should I do?
Should I bring the emergency kit...

629
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,429
And Ringer's solution, hot packs...

630
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,949
-No, bring everything you have.
-Okay.

631
00:41:55,524 --> 00:41:56,500
Does this woman...

632
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,731
Does this lady have a bag?

633
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,297
Here.

634
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:06,819
I'm in pain.

635
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:14,707
It hurts.

636
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,023
Please help me.

637
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:27,801
Help me.

638
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:32,294
We need to move her.

639
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:34,485
She is quite big.

640
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:36,210
We don't have a stretcher for her.

641
00:42:36,316 --> 00:42:38,704
-Junseong.
-Shall I carry her on my back?

642
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:40,815
It's dangerous. You'll hurt your back.

643
00:42:40,944 --> 00:42:41,844
We'll lift her together.

644
00:42:45,483 --> 00:42:47,832
-Let's lift on three, all right?
-Yes.

645
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:50,205
One, two, three.

646
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:53,903
Hold on. Let's do it again.

647
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,914
One, two.

648
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:10,158
This is as far as you can come.
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:12,188
Good luck!

650
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:15,166
Wait. Please take care of her.

651
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,205
-Be seated.
-Yes, call me when you need me.

652
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,767
We already let the captain know
there's an emergency patient.

653
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,890
-Stand there with blankets.
-Pardon me?

654
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:28,404
-We need to undress her.
-Okay.

655
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:41,921
We don't have much time.

656
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:51,234
What is this?

657
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,583
I'm going to have to hit her.

658
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,850
This is not working.

659
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,041
This will sting a little.

660
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,283
Please hold this for me.

661
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:44,890
-Junseong! Massage her left arm.
-Yes.

662
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:50,128
She seems to be in shock.

663
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:52,520
She's too cold.

664
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:24,001
Gosh!

665
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:25,649
Who are you?

666
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,924
Where am I?

667
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:32,529
Probably somewhere in the air.

668
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:34,373
Of course, we are not in heaven.

669
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,579
My gosh!

670
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:43,478
Who did this to me?

671
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:47,732
Is that how you say thank you?

672
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:49,602
Excuse me.

673
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:52,717
If you stuck this in, please pull it out.

674
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:09,466
How long do you want me to press this for?

675
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:20,735
Excuse me, what if I keep bleeding?

676
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:24,742
Contrary to your appearance,
you care a lot about your body.

677
00:46:33,107 --> 00:46:34,108
No.

678
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:35,566
Just stay there.

679
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,290
You're not wearing much.
I tore off your clothes.

680
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:39,175
What?

681
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:46,710
Don't be offended.

682
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,185
I'm just really curious.

683
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:52,449
Why did you do that?

684
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:55,230
What did I do?

685
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,579
You were drunk on board.

686
00:46:58,654 --> 00:47:01,241
You also took caffeine and sleeping pills.

687
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:04,169
Actually...

688
00:47:04,275 --> 00:47:06,600
Even dubious diet pills.

689
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:08,783
And a support belt.

690
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:10,862
You saw my body?

691
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:12,969
You searched my bag too?

692
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:15,052
Isn't that rude?

693
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:21,153
You are in first-class
because of an emergency case you caused.

694
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:25,607
Since you couldn't talk,
I looked through your bag.

695
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:27,984
You are unbelievable.

696
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,533
It's not that I don't thank you.

697
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:38,256
I wish I could get out of here.

698
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:40,952
Did I save...

699
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,648
...someone who is suicidal?

700
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:45,338
What are you talking about?

701
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,518
If you are not,

702
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:48,727
you shouldn't have done
such things to your body.

703
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:50,638
Especially on an empty stomach
and on an airplane.

704
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:55,989
If I were suicidal, I would not have taken
dubious pills to lose weight.

705
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:57,791
-Old lady.
-What did you call me?

706
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:58,957
You seem young.

707
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,560
If you want to lose weight,
exercise and sweat.

708
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:02,155
Don't starve yourself
or take suspicious pills.

709
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:03,999
And don't tighten your body
with a support belt.

710
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:07,472
Hey...

711
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,919
Thank you for saving me.

712
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,992
Please don't disrespect my privacy.

713
00:48:23,508 --> 00:48:25,418
Since you were the first woman
I've undressed,

714
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:28,023
within five minutes after we met,

715
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,609
I might have been too direct with you.

716
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,867
I put your support belt back
into your bag.

717
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:36,423
Thank you so much.

718
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,522
I won't put in a claim for damages.

719
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:39,954
You saved me anyway.

720
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:42,231
One more thing! That's not a support belt.

721
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,684
It's a corset.

722
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,039
I didn't know because I've never
ripped one off before.

723
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,533
I'm sorry.

724
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,128
You're welcome.

725
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,223
I wish to repay your kindness.

726
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,616
I wish I could do it
without looking at your face.

727
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:03,312
Hello.

728
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:05,931
Hello.

729
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,628
If you want,

730
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,500
there is a way.

731
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:16,922
What is it?

732
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:24,653
What do you mean you couldn't find him?

733
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,142
What's going on?

734
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,149
We've just heard the news.

735
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:30,408
We already double-checked
the boarding list.

736
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:32,337
Where else would a passenger exit from?

737
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:36,070
Yes, President.

738
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,652
No, sir.

739
00:49:37,843 --> 00:49:39,228
He's definitely on the boarding list.

740
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:44,168
We'll keep trying and call you back.

741
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,842
Emergency room
in Hanmaeum Hospital in Seoul.

742
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:03,306
I should have just stepped off the plane.

743
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:27,542
"Emergency"

744
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:28,837
Honey!

745
00:50:29,556 --> 00:50:30,757
Please help him!

746
00:50:44,276 --> 00:50:47,323
"Emergency"

747
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:50,648
I don't know for sure, but...

748
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:52,728
...I probably won't be able to
say this again.

749
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:55,298
For a man, his first love...

750
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:57,725
...can only come once.

751
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:01,095
Are you in the States?

752
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:02,355
Call me when you get back.

753
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:05,062
Call me as soon as you get back.

754
00:51:05,176 --> 00:51:07,211
When are you coming back?
I need to talk to you.

755
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:08,438
When are you coming back?

756
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:10,638
I need to talk to you.

757
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:14,755
Starting today, you'll be my first love.

758
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:24,988
Your baggage?

759
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:26,883
We didn't receive anything
from the airport.

760
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:29,485
Excuse me, Miss!

761
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:38,063
See you later!

762
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,005
Excuse me.

763
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,847
I was just wondering...

764
00:52:47,419 --> 00:52:49,098
Who am I talking to?

765
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:51,823
Hey!

766
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:55,543
By any chance,

767
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:58,948
do you want to go back to hospital?

768
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:07,217
If not, get in.

769
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,563
Do you want me to open the door for you?

770
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,587
You will be safer with me
than standing on the streets.

771
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,020
Where are you headed?

772
00:53:43,061 --> 00:53:44,062
Fasten your seat belt.

773
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,534
I thought the other day...

774
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:15,673
...was the worst day of my life.

775
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,013
It wasn't.

776
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:23,498
It's today.

777
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,632
Is it because you rode in the ambulance?

778
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:32,140
-It was...
-You have a reason, I know.

779
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:36,010
I don't expect you to understand,

780
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:38,926
but I have my reasons too.

781
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:41,456
-Don't think I'm so weird.
-I won't.

782
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:46,028
It doesn't have to be today,

783
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:48,355
but you should go get a check-up.

784
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:50,758
Your body temperature is too low.

785
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:52,326
For your size.

786
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:07,843
You can let me off here.

787
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:12,870
Well.

788
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,585
Saying goodbye would be
appropriate right about now.

789
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:20,441
You didn't give me the chance.

790
00:55:21,312 --> 00:55:23,829
Anyway. Thank you.

791
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:25,726
It seems this is where we part.

792
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:26,994
Goodbye.

793
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,228
It's all wet.

794
00:57:14,396 --> 00:57:20,303
I used to be able to do anything
I put my mind to.

795
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:22,768
I used to be able to.

796
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:37,455
Excuse me.

797
00:57:37,836 --> 00:57:38,893
Hold on.

798
00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:41,733
Excuse me.

799
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:50,010
Excuse me.

800
00:57:52,174 --> 00:57:53,068
Excuse me.

801
00:57:57,354 --> 00:57:58,396
Please!

802
00:57:59,006 --> 00:58:00,862
Help me.

803
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:05,285
Every time you see me,
that's what you say.

804
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:15,672
You're not even going to thank me.

805
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:53,728
"Oh My Venus"

806
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:54,815
The support belt that I
ripped yesterday...

807
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:57,243
I said it's a corset.

808
00:58:57,378 --> 00:58:59,183
Do you have a stethoscope
attached to your ears?

809
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:00,783
Give a round of applause for Soojin.

810
00:59:01,774 --> 00:59:02,989
Super Fatty.

811
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:04,616
Kang Jooeun?

812
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,074
It's really John Kim's...

813
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,166
I really...

814
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:11,944
Did you just lick my palm?

815
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:14,859
Please understand that
I am at loss here too.

816
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:16,923
Don't come!

817
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:17,927
Jooeun!

818
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:20,968
She said "Don't come."
