1
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:28,160


2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,300
I will take you there.

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,990
You're being overprotective. It might make me go astray.

4
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,330
The backseat is safer, Executive Director.

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,540
Okay. Instead, by my car.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,790
 Episode 8 

7
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,870
The outside legal team...

8
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,140
Yes.

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,390
We're only making provisions in case there are any issues, so you don't need to worry too much.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,080
Yes.

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,120
 From the time we met until now, I've always been very grateful. 

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,540
 Muscular Angel, John Kim, 

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,950
 Hyungnim Yeong Ho, Mr. Yeong Ho, Mr. Coach. 

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,010
 Where are you? 

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,620
 I'm going to be a little late tonight, so make sure to exercise even if it's alone. 

16
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,040
 Yeah, yeah, Mr. Coach. 

17
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,250
  Since I have something to say to you, call me after you are done.  

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,950
It's Kang Joo Eun.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,450
Come in.

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,830
Okay.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,410
Hello, I am the Gahong Group's Chief Secretary Min Byeong Wook.

22
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,700
This is the Medical Group Gahong's Executive Director.

23
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,410
I... Hold on.

24
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,660
 Living as well as Iron Man, as secretively as Batman...  

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,870
 It's because I am the son of a wealthy household who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 

27
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,660
 To you, being in a suite room alone with a man like me is probably out of your league. 

28
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,040
Are you going somewhere?

29
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,410
Exactly.

30
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,540
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,750
I...

32
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,080
I... I thought that ...

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,830
Calm down and breathe deeply.

34
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,040
Don't be upset and take deep, deep breaths.

35
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,500
You...

36
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,830
I see you really were out of my league.

37
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,600
♬   I didn't know it would hurt so much   ♬

38
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,870
♬   I didn't know I would miss you this much  ♬

39
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,350
♬     Little by little you came into my heart  ♬

40
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:11,970
♬     A lifetime with you  ♬

41
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,940
♬    I liked the time we had together  ♬

42
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,750
♬     I was happy when you smiled at me  ♬

43
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,080
Manager Min, please tell everyone that I am sorry. Just 10 minutes.

44
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,250
♬    Just like this   ♬

45
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,500
Breathe. Then we can talk.

46
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,950
About what?

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,950
Kang Joo Eun.

48
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,900
First, it was lie, then it was deception,

49
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
now it is betrayal.

50
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,830
What? Were you afraid if you told me you were Gahong's Executive Director, I'd feel intimidated?

51
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,950
I'm sorry. Please use the other one.

52
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,580
Didn't I tell you I don't like being deceived or being lied to?

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,830
How... How to me...

54
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,650
I'm sorry for not telling you.

55
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,000
I was worried about how to bring it up.

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,080
But... Did I give you a ring?

57
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,550
Did I ask you to marry me?

58
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,080
Or is there within a recollection that I said you were my first love?

59
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,760
Who said that was the case?

60
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,930
But why are you like this?

61
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,800
About what?

62
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Why are you mad like this?

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,290
Why are you running away already?

64
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,250
Running away?

65
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,580
Exactly.

66
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,300
It isn't like I did anything wrong. Why will I run away?

67
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,580
What I mean is that I wasn't trying to lie.

68
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,370
Dating or dieting, let's just keep doing what we were doing

69
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,100
since I feel like I've only just tasted life's sweetness.

70
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,700
Not saying things that you should say is also lying.

71
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,910
If someone feels deceived, then you lied.

72
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,450
Dating? I don't do that with liars.

73
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,160
As you said, it isn't like I received a ring.

74
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
Nor did you say, "Let's get married."

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,040
I guess I got overly worked up.

76
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,620
Let's go. Everyone is waiting.

77
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,460
You can probably see, but there shouldn't be much problem acquiring maximum shares.

78
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,220
If it doesn't affect the board members' shares,

79
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,420
it doesn't look like there should be any problem with the Executive Director taking office.

80
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,150
The paperwork for securing the shares of the subsidiaries also looks perfect.

81
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,670
Realistically, by making the process of taking office as the Executive Director gradual,

82
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,500
and then gaining control or making a drastic change to the requirement for a merger approval,

83
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,370
looks to be the best course of action.

84
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,510
Our Gahong legal team will be handling this,

85
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,290
but please prepare to handle any unexpected measures that may arise.

86
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,600
Security is—

87
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,460
Yes, I know. Director Kim Yeong Ho.

88
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,620
Let's just end it here for today.

89
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,000
We prepared a simple dinner, so please come with us.

90
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,980
That is... I have to go home.

91
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,830
Please help me say it.

92
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,200
Why don't you tell them yourself?

93
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,870
I think you two know each other well.

94
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,660
Let's talk for a moment.

95
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,300
We'll escort you, Executive Director.

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,200
I am sorry but I have some work to do so I will leave first.

97
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,690
 Did I give you a ring? 

98
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,160
 Did I ask you to marry me? 

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,750
 Or is there within a recollection that I said you were my first love? 

100
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,010
  Since I have something to say to you, call me after you are done.  

101
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,350

104
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,850
- Yeah. 
 - When will you arrive? 

105
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,100
I haven't said I've left. Why are you asking when I will arrive?

106
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,620
I am leaving now. Yeah.

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,450
Then, see you next time.

108
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,050
Please take good care of us, Director Kim.

109
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,950
As you said.

110
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,540
Don't follow me since it's my personal life, okay?

111
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,910
  Daegu Venus 

112
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,530
  The party you are calling is not answering. 

113
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:15,670


114
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,530
Hyungnim. Hyung Joon Seong is putting on makeup now. He is totally cool.

115
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,230
Ma'am? Wait a minute.

116
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,790
By chance, did Ma'am call you?

117
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,140
She said she would go home today.

118
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,620
Oh, that's right. Hometown. She went to her hometown.

119
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,900
I got it.

120
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,960
Do well and don't cause any problems. Okay.

121
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,790
  I don't like deception and lies.  

122
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,910
 No matter who it is. Even if it's the one and only, John Kim. 

123
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,700
 First it was lie, then it was deception, and now it is betrayal. 

124
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,850
 I told you I don't like being deceived or being lied to. 

125
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,130
 How could you... How could you to me... 

126
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:39,130
  I see you really are out of my league.  

127
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,350
I got punished.

128
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,330
  North Daegu 

129
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,450
Debt is a debt, but I'll be able to eat as much chicken as I want.

130
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,340
Mom! The VIP is here!

131
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,410
Please enjoy.

132
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,850
Excuse me! Can I get one fried and one roasted?

133
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,790
Excuse me. One roasted and...

134
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,430
Yes.

135
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,830
One fried and one roasted.

136
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,130
Adding one fried and one roasted!

137
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,110
Kang Jae Yeok, what would you have done without me?

138
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,420
I didn't know it would do this well. It's totally awesome!

139
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,650
Add two fried chickens!

140
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,430
Adding two fried chickens!

141
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,630
- One like this. 
 - Yes, let's do another one.

142
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,710
Again. Once more.

143
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,650
Wait a minute.

144
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,890
Okay.

145
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,990
Okay... Jump!

146
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,910
Again. One, two, three. Okay. Good.

147
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,110
Nice. Okay. That's great.

148
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,620
Hold hands. Hold hands.

149
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,610
Good. Very good.

150
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,430
Okay, good!

151
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,770
Oppa, one Jang Yi Jin's autograph. Just five minutes.

152
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,770
No to Jang Yi Jin's autograph. Girls' Generation autograph.

153
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,310
Okay.

154
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,630
Okay, deal.

155
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,830
Hey! Hey!

156
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,560
Will you eat with me or kiss me?

157
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,750
What?

158
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,440
Will you eat with me or live with me?

159
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,410
Wait a minute. I am not done yet.

160
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,890
Will you eat with me or date me?

161
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,320
Do you want to die?

162
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,450
It's not whether to go out but to die. I'm sorry. Sorry. Get out.

163
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,870
Ah! Wait a minute! I didn't hear an answer yet.

164
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,090
Do you want to have dinner with me? Please?

165
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,630
- Just once! 
 - Hey, do you want to get in trouble?

166
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,470
Just once.

167
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,210
Oppa!

168
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,610
Sorry, Hyung.

169
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,910
Ma'am isn't picking up.

170
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,390
Let's go.

171
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,110
Joo Eun...

172
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,550
Hello.

173
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,290
Your husband.

174
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,170
- She's still "Miss". 
 -   I see.  

175
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,230
Then when will you get married? I don't know why you haven't gotten married yet.

176
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,790
My Joo Eun is a lawyer.

177
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,870
My son-in-law is a manager at Gahong.

178
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,890
She can be busy after she gets married! Hurry up and get married or your child will be born too late.

179
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,750
That's not it.

180
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,350
Joo Eun, just go back home. You are tired, right?

181
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,450
Eun Bi,  Unni Joo Eun  is going back home.

182
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,170
- Have a nice time. 
 - Thank you!

183
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,940
It's tasty.

184
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,150
Ah, that's true.

185
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,190
I hear you have to be very careful in your first trimester.

186
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,070
Yes. Thank you, Unni.

187
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,790
If Kang Jae Hyeok gives you a hard time, call me.

188
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,370
Yes.

189
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,890
Because you are going on a diet.

190
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,650
You brought such a thoughtful gift for honsu (gift for when you get married).

191
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,890
No, it's not honsu.

192
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,790
Be responsible for Kang Jae Hyeok for the rest of his life. That's the best honsu for me. Work hard.

193
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,430
Mom, I am leaving.

194
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,910
Dad, I am sorry.

195
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,610
I forgot that today is my father's birthday.

196
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,930
 Heat up the soup before eating it.  

197
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,230
 Diet or whatever, you should eat real food when you're home. 

198
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,090
  Ji Woong 

199
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,450
  Ma'am, where are you? 

200
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,490
  Ma'am, you aren't coming today?  

201
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,330
  Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am?  

202
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,390
  Since I have something to say, call me after you are done.  

203
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,650
 Missed calls: Mr. Coach 

204
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,790
Just one call?

205
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,790
What effort you made.

206
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,500
 Lee Hyeon Woo: Get me some of your mother's kimchi. 

207
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,490
How come you didn't call?

208
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,230
Jerk.

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,230
What's the matter with me? Am I going through puberty? Menopause?

210
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,000
I guess I am crazy.

211
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,540
 You have a new message from Mr Coach. 

212
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,130
  Since you are a Daegu Venus, I guess you will be in Daegu.  

213
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,470
  Come out.  

214
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,580
  I hate being cold the most.  

215
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,450
♬   It's me, even if I don't know how to express it, it's me,  ♬

216
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,620
Oh my! What do I do? What do I do?

217
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,810
Oh my! What do I do? What do I do?

218
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,020
♬  Without even realizing it, you, you, you,  ♬

219
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,620
♬  Love is you.  ♬

220
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,900
♬  I'm getting this feeling 
 I'm thrilled somehow today    ♬

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,830
Car keys. 
♬  I get the feeling  ♬

222
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,540
♬  I get the feeling  ♬

223
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,790
I'll take that. Thank you.
♬   When you look at me  ♬

224
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,710
- Where to? 
 - Ayang railroad.

225
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,850
♬    Come to me   ♬

226
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,230
♬   I get the feeling you're looking at my eyes  ♬

227
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,490
♬    My thinking is fuzzy  ♬ 

228
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,680
♬  I've got the jitters thinking of you  ♬

229
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:01,010
♬   I get the feeling that I'm falling in love  ♬

230
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,700
I came all the way here from Seoul.

231
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,290
You should come here from there.

232
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,620
Tummy fat can be nice sometimes.

233
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,370
It is warm. I hate being cold the most.

234
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,500
You aren't wearing glasses.

235
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,040
Are you wearing makeup too?

236
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,250
Are you expecting something that I'm not doing?

237
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,330
My eyes aren't that bad.

238
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,650
I wore it for fashion to look more intellectual when I was young.

239
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,450
Then it became a habit.

240
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,790
Good, I can see you better.

241
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,350
I'm not usually a rash person that gets over things easily.

242
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,270
Be rash.

243
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,050
Huh?

244
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm not good at being subtle,

245
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,570
so I'm just going to say something that's difficult.

246
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,160
When I... was young, I was very sick.

247
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,160
So... I have almost no memories of walking, running, or joking around.

248
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,500
While I was that sick, my mom passed away.

249
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,290
I couldn't even bow at my mom's death ceremony so I hid myself.

250
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,330
I was scared of my dad and I felt sorry for my grandmother.

251
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,950
I was young, weak, and always in danger.

252
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:15,540
The household that gave me a silver spoon wasn't that happy or warm for me,

253
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:22,050
so I tried to avoid it as much as I could. But in the end, I am back here after taking the long way around.

254
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,080
 I am a softie towards people who are injured. 

255
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,970
 But, I am weaker towards people in danger. 

256
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,430
It's not that I wasn't going to tell you, but I just couldn't,

257
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,160
so please forgive me once. Okay?

258
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,620
Are you not sick now?

259
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,580
Are you okay?

260
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,370
It's all better.

261
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,250
Will this at least prove it?

262
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,100
It's good if it's this much.

263
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,700
Hey!

264
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,700
Let's go quickly.

265
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,760
If I date anymore, I'll get sick.

266
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,220
That expression is what? After doing everything we did, you want to date properly?

267
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,050
Well, after doing everything we did, it's hard to change my tune.

268
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,250
I want to elope, but your mom might get shocked.

269
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,030
Go carefully.

270
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,190
Rest if it's tiring on the way there.

271
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,120
Go inside.

272
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,580
Don't take this the wrong way.

273
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,330
It's not lust but out of worry that I'm saying this.

274
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,580
Do you want to sleep just holding hands?

275
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,290
Hyung Joon Seong! Hyung!

276
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,290
- Ah, why? 
- Hyung Yeong Ho  is sleeping out today.

277
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,500
What? Did something happen?

278
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,120
No, no, no, no. Hyung can't come home tonight, so don't worry and go to bed.

279
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,350
He can't come home. You know what I'm saying?

280
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,040
Hey, what's the point of being champion when you have no sense?

281
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,350
What are you saying?

282
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,140
- You really have no sense. 
- Shut up! What the heck ...

283
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:42,030
Hyung! We... haven't had ramyun for a year.

284
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,660
Ah, I thought you were being—

285
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,890
When Hyung Yeong Ho is around, we can never eat it.

286
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,540
While he's not around—

287
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,390
Huh? I'm going to make some!

288
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,620
Oh, I apologize.

289
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,250
I heard driving while sleepy is more dangerous than driving drunk.

290
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,260
I think this is more dangerous right now.

291
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,540
Are you sure that you're worrying about me?

292
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,950
Close your eyes for a moment.

293
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,250
To do this, you sent your mother to her sister's house?

294
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,660
Ah, seriously.

295
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,120
What's going on that you aren't mentioning exercise today?

296
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,250
Why would I have told you to come meet me all the way there?

297
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,950
- By any chance... 
 - Walking is the best thing for straightening out your pelvis.

298
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,700
Even though you'll still have to work on your open toed gait.

299
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,600
Seriously! How can someone be so consistent?

300
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,890
Kang Joo Eun's body is mine, since it's my heart.

301
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,740
Gahong's Executive Director,

302
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,380
is it something you really must do?

303
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,700
Why? Do you think it will be tiring

304
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,450
meeting a prince on a white horse personally?

305
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,620
If you think that way, I'm a dragon born in a stream and a princess on a white horse.

306
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,600
You saw my white car, right?

307
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,590
You don't... seem to want to do it.

308
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,840
If it was something you wanted to do, you wouldn't have taken the long way round.

309
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:17,550
Well, you seemed to like to use your body more than your mind, too.

310
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,240
I am more confident in using my body than my mind.

311
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,340
I could demonstrate it to you right now.

312
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,600
What are you saying?

313
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,250
Oh, you're going to show your back, so you want me to do a back hug?

314
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,260
Okay.

315
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,770
Ah! Coming in like this when I'm in a defenseless state is cheating!

316
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,810
Come on. I've really seen you defenseless inside that plane.

317
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,010
Oh, that waist trainer. Ugh.

318
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,450
I said it's a corset! A corset.

319
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,130
Don't be sick.

320
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,650
That's the prettiest thing for me.

321
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,210
Being healthy is the sexiest.

322
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,190
I really love this backside.

323
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,460
Makes me think other thoughts.

324
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,240
Don't turn off the light

325
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,980
or it'll become a warm and racy night.

326
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,520
This girl sleeps again

327
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,990
in the midst of this.

328
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,560
 This is the Gahong Medical Group's Executive Director. 

329
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,600
  You said you don't want to ride a time machine. 

330
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
  But, why are you riding it?  

331
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:21,400
  The party you called is not answering... 

332
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,100
 Im Woo Sik 

333
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,930
  The party you called isn't answering ...  

334
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,550
How can you do this to me?

335
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,600
I've changed this much.

336
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,710
I've...

337
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,890
changed this much.

338
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,110
Then, you can't do this to me.

339
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,850
Everything that the pretty and attractive girls used to have,

340
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,450
I should have it now.

341
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,430
I should have it.

342
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,790
Why...

343
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,730
Why is nothing changing?

344
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,190
Why?

345
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,780
John Kim could be one of our Gahong Group members? What do you mean?

346
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,560
In America, there is one reporter that crazily follows around John Kim.

347
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,960
I met that reporter when I went this time

348
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,110
and he said that the house where John Kim used to live was under a Korean name.

349
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,970
So I dug around just in case and it was Lee Hong Im.

350
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,630
It's a name you've heard many times before.

351
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,720
Gahong's President Lee Hong Im?

352
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,010
On top of that, John Kim is gone but it's still under Lee Hong Im.

353
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,000
Doesn't it mean that he's in Lee Hong Im's circle?

354
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,480
If that Lee Hong Im is the Gahong's President Lee Hong Im,

355
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,700
John Kim is definitely one of the people in Gahong.

356
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,470
PD Go, who else knows this?

357
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,130
It's only me.

358
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,960
Hold up reporting it for now.

359
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
Hey, Star Im, if I release this? It's huge.

360
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,730
It's dae to the bak. (daebak)

361
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,570
I think I can make it factual instead of a suspicion, that's why.

362
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,830
What?

363
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:32,130
And don't tell Hyeon Woo or Joo Eun either.

364
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,360
  Oh! Soo Jin 

365
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,320
  The party you are calling didn't pick up the phone... 

366
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,810
 On top of that, John Kim is gone but it's still under Lee Hong Im. 

367
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,480
 Doesn't it mean that he's in Lee Hong Im's circle? 

368
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,880
Kim Yeong Ho could be

369
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,440
John Kim?

370
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:20,390


371
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,830
Let's get your nagging over with.

372
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,910
You said it's your personal life. We're going now.

373
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,190
Thank you, Secretary Min.

374
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,720
I am late.

375
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,640
Where is CEO Choi Jin Ho?

376
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,620
I guess Chief Secretary Min found out about his slush fund.

377
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,680
He called yesterday and said he's resigning.

378
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,510
Then—

379
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,450
Kim Seong Chul will become the CEO, and Kim Yeong Ho will become the Executive Director,

380
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,300
and Yeong Gyun and I will be left in the dust.

381
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,250
You didn't get anything on Kim Yeong Ho?

382
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,180
You might have heard the name, John Kim.

383
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,970
He's a famous trainer in America and had a scandal with Anna Sue.

384
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,750
Yes. What about him?

385
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,770
If Kim Yeong Ho is John Kim, what will happen?

386
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,040
What? What did you just say?

387
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,870
What if it is the truth?

388
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,330
It will become an opportunity to win over the major shareholders who value tradition and honor.

389
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,520
Star Im, this...

390
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,230
Does this scenario make sense?

391
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,700
Until he takes office in celebration of our 61st anniversary, I will look into it quietly and swiftly.

392
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,240
Joon Seong. What's your weight?

393
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,650
I'm almost there.

394
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,760
It's been 5 o'clock since earlier.

395
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,870
Why do I feel so lazy?

396
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,850
If you work too hard, you might get hurt. Since it's the weekend, take the day off.

397
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,600
I feel like we're playing dead. Like Kang Joo Eun's day.

398
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,660
I know, huh?

399
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,530
When will Ma'am come back? Oh, it is boring.

400
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,430
I am back.

401
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,590
What have you been doing?

402
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,120
You're home?

403
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,370
I really missed you.

404
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,980
What's with acting cutesy like little kids?

405
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,040
Let's talk about the yesterday stuff later. It is embarrassing.

406
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,690
When we are together, shh...

407
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,390
Ji Woong, your ma'am has something to say.

408
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,570
Oh, say it.

409
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,260
Oh, how did Joon Seong's cover shoot go?

410
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,150
Jang Yi Jin totally fell for Hyung Joon Seong.

411
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,170
- Will you eat with me? Will you kiss me? 
 - Ji Woong.

412
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,420
- Will you eat with me? Will you sleep with me? 
 - I told you not to do it.

413
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,070
Will you eat with me? I am Jang Yi Jin.

414
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,400
That is something I've heard somewhere.

415
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,940
Jang Yi Jin has a high standard. Please put them in the fridge.

416
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,500
- Yes, sir. 
 - Please wait a minute. I will just take care of him. Come here.

417
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,890
Come here. Come here.  Come here.

418
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,050
See you a bit later.

419
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,070
I will rest for a bit.

420
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:20,370


421
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,390
 Now you aren't sick? 

422
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,360
 They said I am all better. 

423
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,410
 Meticulous Daegu Venus' medicine 

424
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,640
Kang Joo Eun, it is PT time. (personal training)

425
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,510
What time?

426
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,930
♬   One little Indian, two little Indians   ♬

427
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,410
You should keep working out during the weekend to yourself.

428
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:34,560
♬   Two little Indians. One little Indian, two little Indians   ♬

429
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,690
We aren't going to go on a date, Hyungnim Yeong Ho?

430
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:46,050
We keep public and private matters separate. And in here, I'm Mr. Coach, okay?

431
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,540
Wow, seriously. It's like you have a split personality.

432
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:56,330
You need to be healthy because I want to taste the sweetness in life for a long time.

433
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,710
I know your meaning, but...

434
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,730
Because I am a patient with hypothyroidism...

435
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,880
People are all patients in some way.

436
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,350
Whether they're born that way or became that way.

437
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,510
I am okay, but this hypothyroidism... I'm worried about it.

438
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,290
Don't worry. Patient's workout is up to the coach.

439
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,080
Yes, Mr. Coach.

440
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,860
I really lost a lot.

441
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,830
Rather than your weight, your muscular strength is more important.

442
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:34,020
That way, you can get rid of your hypothyroidism and any chances of having adult diseases.

443
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,730
Wait a minute.

444
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,800
Then... will I have muscles that pop out and everything?

445
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,960
Ah, that would be very pretty and sexy, but women don't develop muscles that easily.

446
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,060
Now, sit cross legged and stick the soles of your feet together.

447
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,270
Sit straight.

448
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,460
It's a stretching exercise for the pelvis that you can do very easily.

449
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,960
Now exhale and—

450
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,530
Ah, it hurts!

451
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,650
You deal with your own cramps.

452
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,170
If your pelvis is out of alignment, your overall posture suffers.

453
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,260
Rock side to side.

454
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,540
♬   To me the too perfect Girl  ♬

455
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,140
It is good to do this whenever you have time so don't forget.

456
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,230
Straighten your back.

457
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,000
I think it is better.

458
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,820
Your back, your back, your back.

459
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,610
Don't give up.

460
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,820
♬   In my dreams too with you by my side  ♬

461
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,030
Let's not give up.

462
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,460
It was a good morning until recently.

463
00:47:53,170 --> 00:48:00,370
If you cross your legs like that, your pelvis gets twisted and it affects the blood flow.

464
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,590
You can get cramps in your legs too.

465
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,900
We have a health conscious person here, Lawyer Kang.

466
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,750
You know Director Kim from Gahong, right?

467
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,790
At the hotel as well.

468
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,180
The person who said "She says for you not to come closer."

469
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:34,920
Oh. Are you talking about the time you and my ex-boyfriend were seen together at the hotel? Are you talking about that time?

470
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,590
As long as we are working as Gahong's external legal team, if there is a personal relationship with a client,

471
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,120
I think that I, as your superior, should know about it.

472
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,630
Telling me to report on my private life seems like an infringement of civil rights to me... yo (suffix for honorifics)

473
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,670
Private matters?

474
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:01,320
If it's Executive Director of Gahong, then he's actually the future heir to Gahong.

475
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,660
With that kind of man... a private life?

476
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,320
It is interesting.

477
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,670
Is it one of the methods for victory of mind? Or... you want to exact revenge even if through your imagination?

478
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:25,080
Revenge? You think I have that much free time?

479
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,340
Please live well as you, Vice CEO.

480
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:34,040
I will keep on living happily and sweetly, with good health and long life, and live out a dream of a hundred years.

481
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,680
Did you get the settlement for Myung Hoon Electronics?

482
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,900
Why would I get that?

483
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,060
That's for you to do, Vice CEO, who even sent a herbal tonic.

484
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,570
She's not willing to settle. I can only imagine what you advised against.

485
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,740
I didn't advise against anything. It was just an expert opinion.

486
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,830
I worked so hard to learn about the law, so I thought I should use it.

487
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,770
Then you have nothing to say, right?

488
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,100
Good morning until earlier.

489
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,420
We are ready, Executive Director Kim.

490
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,680
I am leaving now.

491
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,730
Come in.

492
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,460
Director Kim Yeong Ho came to greet you guys.

493
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,570
I am Kim Yeong Ho. The greeting is late.

494
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,200
Compared to the picture of John Kim,

495
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,460
I think he looks very different.

496
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,800
Aigo.

497
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,390
My nephew grew up like this.

498
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,970
Nice to meet you for the first time, Director Choi.

499
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,190
Am I the only one who saw him when he was little, right?

500
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:23,260
In any case, let's work hard together.

501
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,590
I am the Center General Manager Im Woo Sik.

502
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,450
Please take a good care of me.

503
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,280
Like you said, please take a good care of me.

504
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,180
Then I will see you guys at the ceremony.

505
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,640
Geondoo Lawyer Kang Joo Eun will work hard for you...

506
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,260
Joon Seong?

507
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,280
  Do you have time after you get off from work?  

508
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,050
Yes. I will be done after I finish what I am doing.

509
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,590
Ah, yes.

510
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,220
Should we have a drink?

511
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,450
I am preparing for a fight.

512
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,580
Ah, that's right. I am sorry.

513
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,520
Because I feel like it's hard for you to bring up (without a drink).

514
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,030
It isn't like that, but it isn't easy.

515
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,510
You want me to help you with finding your mother?

516
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,930
I found my mom, but

517
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,360
she said she doesn't want to meet me.

518
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,640
I can't do anything about it, but...

519
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,550
her living circumstances don't seem all that good so

520
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,030
I wonder if I have a way to help.

521
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:14,520
There is no one I can trust in Korea, other than you.

522
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,980
- Why didn't you tell Hyungnim Yeong Ho...
 - Because I don't want him to know.

523
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,180
Hyungnim will be more disappointed.

524
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,130
This...

525
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,150
If there is something I can help with, I will.

526
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,100
You are busy but I am making you do my stuff...

527
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,920
- By chance, legal fee—
 - Seriously.

528
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,570
You are saying useless stuff.

529
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,220
You've done more than enough for me.

530
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,190
Thank you for giving me a chance to pay you back.

531
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,860
This isn't the work you do, right?

532
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,900
I know, huh?

533
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,320
It would've been nice if this was the work that lawyers did.

534
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,800
Thank you. I will drive you home and go to the gym.

535
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,630
You don't have to cover yourself yet.

536
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,460
This will also be a memory.

537
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,890
I will leave the house after a week.

538
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,410
I got a house.

539
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,010
Oh, I'm disappointed.

540
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,250
No. No. Where are you going, Ma'am?

541
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,800
I am not so shameless as to live happily in someone else's house for a long long time,

542
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,550
Oh, look. Look. Snow. Snow.

543
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,030
Wow, it is the first snow.

544
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:45,420
Ma'am, by chance, did you lose 5 kilos? I really want to go camping.

545
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,960
What should I do?

546
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,420
- I didn't lose. 
 - Maybe you did.

547
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,070
I know I didn't lose.

548
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,860
Where is Hyungnim Yeong Ho now?

549
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,090
Yeah.

550
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,960
You know it will be okay as long as Hyungnim Yeong Ho doesn't see it, right?

551
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,680
Yeah. Yeah. Let's pretend we didn't see this. This isn't snow.

552
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,430
Not snow. No snow.

553
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,780
Hyungnim Yeong Ho.

554
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,800
Mr. Coach.

555
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,010
Is he sleeping?

556
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,510
Isn't he here?

557
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah. Camping is camping.

558
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,730
I should watch the first snow together with him.

559
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,270
Hyungnim Yeong Ho! Mr. Coach!

560
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,990
Is it okay for me to come in like this?

561
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeong Ho Hyungnim, are you sleeping?

562
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,520
Mr. Coach, it is snowing. Snow.

563
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,790
Because he is the owner, he sleeps on the best.

564
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,670
But where on earth did he go?

565
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:48,190


566
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,360
Mr. Coach.

567
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,270
Don't come.

568
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,420
Don't come!

569
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:08,100
♬   I will stay by your side  ♬
