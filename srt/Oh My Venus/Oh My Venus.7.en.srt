1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,794
Because your body belongs to me,

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,114
you can't say no.

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,408
Take off your jacket.

4
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,429
What?

5
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,796
Here?

6
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,379
Take it off while I'm being polite.

7
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,389
I thought you wanted to keep our
relationship pure and chaste.

8
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,829
Hurry up!

9
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:31,858
Put that down.

10
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:45,922
"Episode 7"

11
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,303
Good night.

12
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:11,932
Sweet dreams.

13
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:39,724
Don't get ahead of yourself, heart.

14
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,651
It's so hot.

15
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,819
"Symptoms of hypothyroidism"

16
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,461
"Weight gain, fatigue,
exhaustion"

17
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,265
"constipation, muscle cramps, stiffness,
hoarse voice"

18
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,083
"Decreased Heart Rate"

19
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,201
Decreased...

20
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,786
...heart rate?

21
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:10,657
But...

22
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,235
Abdominal obesity.

23
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,335
Fifty sit-ups. Right now.

24
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:06,379
Up!

25
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,097
Yes, Coach.

26
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,940
Forty-nine.

27
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,872
I can't get these thoughts out of my head.

28
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,533
Your ma'am isn't up yet.

29
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,561
Ma'am! Wake up!

30
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,477
Good morning.

31
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,667
You too.

32
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,421
Thank you for the gift yesterday.

33
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,032
It's my turn today.

34
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:25,758
Gift?

35
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,087
The sweets?

36
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:28,935
Or the kiss?

37
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,087
What is it?

38
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,763
Is this how we have to
start off our morning?

39
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:48,672
Why are you wearing perfume
in the morning?

40
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:49,952
I wonder.

41
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,318
Why am I wearing perfume in the morning?

42
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,657
I'll go take my medicine.

43
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:01,795
Should I weigh myself
on an empty stomach?

44
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,697
No, I'll take my medicine first.

45
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:06,802
Do it on an empty stomach.

46
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,326
How could...

47
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:14,562
...a human being...

48
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:17,977
...be so merciless?

49
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,552
-Merciless.
-It's "Coach".

50
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,233
Coach.

51
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,688
How could you gain
1.8 kilograms in one day?

52
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,724
I drank a lot of water yesterday.

53
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,656
People say that...

54
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:42,591
...I'll die if I lose any more weight.

55
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:43,785
You won't die.

56
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,462
That's not it.

57
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,371
-Just one day...
-Is your body disposable?

58
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,180
Will you throw it out after one day?

59
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,125
You have to use it all your life.

60
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,013
You should be healthy.

61
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:59,419
It's not like you'll live
with me for the rest of my life.

62
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,488
Stop acting like you care.

63
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,656
You never know.

64
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,518
And don't be so impolite.

65
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:08,228
I know you're weak
when it comes to the sick,

66
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,702
but do I still look like I'm sick?

67
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,242
Then what?

68
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:15,743
Does it look like I'm weak?

69
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
Fine.

70
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,692
Fine, Coach.

71
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:21,741
Go.

72
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,490
Is this...

73
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,260
...what people call a "back hug"?

74
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:50,842
Lawyer Kang.

75
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,218
The vice president is freaking out.

76
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,149
Why?

77
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:59,076
-What's wrong with her?
-What's going on?

78
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:01,199
You'll pay me off?

79
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:05,332
Rich people can hit people
and settle it with money?

80
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,519
We asked for an apology, not money!

81
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,442
My daughter did nothing wrong,
but she was insulted and assaulted.

82
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,290
The daughter of the CEO
of Myeongeun Electronics...

83
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,132
...didn't apologize once.

84
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:18,672
And you want me to make a wise decision?

85
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,885
Now that the media got involved
and things blew up?

86
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:21,970
Is that it?

87
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,215
Who are you?

88
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,673
I'm Lawyer Kang Jooeun.

89
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,858
It'll only disadvantage you
if you do this here.

90
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,879
Let's go out.

91
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,808
Wait until it cools down.

92
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:45,094
It's still hot.

93
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,404
She was dragged by her hair.

94
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:58,107
My daughter's face...

95
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,073
She had a cut across her face.

96
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:02,475
She isn't even married yet.

97
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,685
That woman threw a shoe at her.

98
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,283
I know it's a designer shop
where rich people go...

99
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:11,151
...and that she's in the service industry.

100
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:15,357
She's used to verbal abuse and insults.

101
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:16,439
But...

102
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,496
Please calm down, Ma'am.

103
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:21,896
This case.

104
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:23,972
I mean this incident...

105
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,477
...I know well what happened.

106
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,938
But that attorney just sent
10 million won...

107
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:34,354
...and a box of herbal tonic.

108
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,578
It's a lot of money.

109
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:42,615
I can't save that much in a year
no matter how hard I try.

110
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,295
But still,

111
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,217
she should apologize.

112
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,111
She did it to a fellow human being.

113
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,179
It's wrong that the rich
can do that to the poor.

114
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,594
It's wrong, isn't it?

115
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:10,877
You should...

116
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,195
...settle.

117
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:17,313
But delay it as much as you can...

118
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:19,716
...and ask for as much money as possible.

119
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,253
Look.

120
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,241
If you drag it out,

121
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,302
she'll be forced to apologize.

122
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:28,515
And they will give you more money.

123
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,833
Those people won't change.

124
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,770
Even if you need to force yourself,

125
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,741
don't allow them to beat you down.

126
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,246
Is that possible?

127
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,279
Believe that...

128
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,185
...it'll get better.

129
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,260
You can do anything
if you set your mind to it.

130
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,764
Otherwise, it's too unfair.

131
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,467
I'm sorry for saying this as an attorney.

132
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:09,869
I'm also sorry to tell you...

133
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,921
...that this is the best solution.

134
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,280
Thank you...

135
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,081
...for apologizing.

136
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,168
Honey!

137
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,104
That's enough.

138
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:46,375
Stop that and take this.

139
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,890
What are you doing?

140
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,953
I don't want your money!

141
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:53,952
-Bring me my husband back!
-Gosh.

142
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,236
Your husband was only hired temporarily...

143
00:11:56,952 --> 00:12:01,020
...and he wasn't wearing
protective gear when he fell.

144
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:03,207
So he's largely at fault.

145
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,654
What did you say?

146
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,412
How dare you say that.

147
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:11,435
To be honest, the company
is hardly at fault here.

148
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:13,933
The company is giving you this money...

149
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,178
...because they are trying
to be considerate.

150
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,761
What are you?

151
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,075
Are you even human?

152
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,051
I do feel bad for you,

153
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:27,053
but take it while the offer stands.

154
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,123
Oh, my heart.

155
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:34,520
Oh, my goodness, my poor husband.

156
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,658
Is this what happens to people
with no power or money?

157
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,764
My poor husband.

158
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:54,123
Hi Mom, it's me.

159
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:58,494
What is it? I'm busy preparing
for the grand opening.

160
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,108
Why are you getting angry?

161
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,362
Who paid for that store?

162
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:04,912
What is it?

163
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:07,823
Is something wrong?

164
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,006
No.

165
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:11,860
I'll come to the grand opening.

166
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,699
When is it?

167
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,767
It's this weekend.

168
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,784
Jaehyeok! Help her with that.

169
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,905
You should've let me do it.

170
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,186
Stop that. You're pregnant!

171
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:26,996
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,228
We got a pig's head for the sacrifice.

173
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:34,981
Why must you always use
a pig's head for that?

174
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,220
Is it your head that we're sacrificing?

175
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:39,156
Why are you getting upset?

176
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,321
But Mom, you go to church.

177
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,724
So?

178
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,388
Who says Christians
can't offer sacrifices?

179
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,474
Gosh.

180
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,391
Why are you laughing?

181
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,300
Am I a comedian?

182
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,235
You are a comedian.

183
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,013
Shut it. Hang up. I'm busy.

184
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,857
I'm no comedian.

185
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,493
Push the grand opening to this weekend.

186
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:23,181
What do you mean? Why?

187
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:25,830
Your sister only has time on the weekends.

188
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:28,364
Don't complain and do as I say.

189
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,499
What did we say before?

190
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,676
If we pass the bar exam,
we wanted to be good lawyers.

191
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:38,972
Don't you remember?

192
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,083
It's "Vice President".

193
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,390
Don't you remember, Vice President Oh?

194
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:47,553
Don't you remember?

195
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,923
I told you that if you wanted to get
in a time machine, go by yourself.

196
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:53,826
I also said....

197
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,928
...somebody has to do the job.

198
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,730
I told you that turning a blind eye...

199
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,066
...doesn't make it go away.

200
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,372
I'm assuming that you talked
to the victim's mother.

201
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,041
That's good.

202
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,546
Get her to settle.

203
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,576
What?

204
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,157
There will be a public apology...

205
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:23,189
...and this should be
sufficient compensation.

206
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,494
You...

207
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,635
Aren't you going...

208
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:34,691
...to apologize?

209
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,591
About stealing Woosik,

210
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:43,342
fine.

211
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,448
I'll pretend that I'm an angel
and forget that part.

212
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,433
-But...
-This is a personal subject, so...

213
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,364
...although our positions have switched...

214
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,689
...we should set the record straight.

215
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,291
I never stole him.

216
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,783
It was voluntary.

217
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,529
What?

218
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,564
Are you angry because you lost him?

219
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,288
Does not being loved
make you feel pathetic?

220
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:13,839
Someone else can have
what you used to have.

221
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,909
That's the reality of life.

222
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,171
Your looks aren't the only thing
that changed.

223
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:21,994
What happened to
the person you used to be?

224
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,847
You weren't this immature
and dishonorable.

225
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,561
That's life.

226
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,487
No.

227
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,824
I should say, life is simple.

228
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,013
You are either loved...

229
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,161
...or not loved.

230
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:39,865
It should be...

231
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,535
...that you love or don't love.

232
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,722
You said you didn't want
to get in a time machine,

233
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,512
so why are you in it?

234
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,067
"The Late Seo Jiyeon"

235
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:57,063
Are you still mad at me, Grandma?

236
00:17:58,747 --> 00:17:59,961
You brat.

237
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:01,880
You broke...

238
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,115
...my heart.

239
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:15,898
Grandma.

240
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,699
I don't like hospitals.

241
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,276
I know.

242
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,768
Of course, I know.

243
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,608
You lost your mom...

244
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,262
...when you were just a kid.

245
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,296
Grandma.

246
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,832
With surgery and rehabilitation,

247
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:40,514
you spent half of your life in hospitals.

248
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:47,293
You poor thing.

249
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,583
You don't have your mom...

250
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:54,533
...and I am also going to die soon.

251
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:57,502
My dear,

252
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,474
it's Grandma's wish.

253
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,442
I'll build a center
for rare cancers and...

254
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:10,370
...invest in rehabilitation centers.

255
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:14,378
You and Mom worked
so hard to build Gahong.

256
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,391
I could ruin all of that.

257
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,736
Youngho.

258
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:22,328
Grandma.

259
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:24,582
Don't come here too often.

260
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,666
It's not good for your joints.

261
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,033
I'm sorry, my child.

262
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,256
Thank you, my child.

263
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,389
Okay, let's go.

264
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,231
-One, two, three, four.
-That's good.

265
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,394
-Junseong.
-Great.

266
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,806
Stop. Stop. Stop.

267
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:07,569
Let's take a break.

268
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,668
This is too much.

269
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:14,844
You shouldn't work too hard.

270
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,461
Your shoulder isn't perfectly healed yet.

271
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:17,996
It's recovering.

272
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,636
But Youngho will be mad.

273
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,119
Snake!

274
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,777
-Wow, that's Jang Yijin!
-It's Jang Yijin!

275
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,438
Please don't take her photo.

276
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,607
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:35,561
Yijin, he is training.

278
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,905
You have a schedule to follow, too.

279
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,199
I don't care about anything right now.

280
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,470
That man rejected me twice.

281
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,377
-He did?
-That's unbelievable.

282
00:21:58,128 --> 00:21:59,602
What's this for?

283
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:01,038
Aren't you cold?

284
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:02,292
Don't you know?

285
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,605
Wearing short skirts
in the cold is fashionable.

286
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,728
Tell me.

287
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:11,663
Why did you reject me again?

288
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,252
-I didn't reject you.
-I'm Jang Yijin.

289
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:16,371
I'm the most sought-after
commercial model in the industry.

290
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,247
Do you think I'm bluffing?

291
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:21,206
It just wasn't the right time
for me to shoot a commercial.

292
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:23,929
Other guys are dying to be
in a commercial with me.

293
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:26,761
What's wrong?

294
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,102
Is there something wrong?

295
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,045
We are not close enough
to talk about such a matter.

296
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,224
I agreed on a print advertisement, though.

297
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,331
If you were offended,

298
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:50,569
I apologize.

299
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,163
What more should I do?

300
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:54,866
So what if you are a champion?

301
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,009
You're so slow.

302
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,410
Miss Jang Yijin?

303
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:05,217
Is there something wrong?

304
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,955
This is hurting my pride.

305
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:15,060
What should I do to be
close enough to you?

306
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,916
I'm such a fan of yours.

307
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,651
You're a total idiot!

308
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,607
Hey...

309
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,475
Junseong, what happened?

310
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,038
Nothing.

311
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:59,921
Hey, what are you doing?

312
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,659
"I'm such a fan of yours."

313
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:06,002
"You're a total idiot!"

314
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,542
Cut it out.

315
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,083
"Cut it out."

316
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,488
"Cut it out."

317
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:17,744
"I'm your fan. You're such an idiot!"

318
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,103
Jiwoong!

319
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:21,226
He is just overreacting.

320
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,567
Move. Out of my way. Goodness.

321
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:27,321
-Oh my...
-What's that smell?

322
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:28,303
Oh my!

323
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,507
I'm sorry, everybody.

324
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,892
I'll be done very soon.

325
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:38,557
How is it?

326
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,267
-Does is still smell that bad?
-Ma'am.

327
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,852
Did you poop in the bag?

328
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,254
What is this smell?

329
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:46,671
This smells like hell.

330
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,022
-Hell.
-Hell.

331
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:49,844
An orange...

332
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,811
...was crushed and it burst in my bag.

333
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:53,729
An orange?

334
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:56,595
This happened last year.

335
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,468
I'm sorry. Oh, man.

336
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,469
Excuse me too.

337
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,038
Why are you...

338
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:09,074
...washing your leather bag with water?

339
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:10,509
Is it expensive?

340
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:12,010
No.

341
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:14,711
I had this when I won my first case.

342
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,758
I carry this bag to important trials.

343
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,836
It didn't smell so bad last month.

344
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:44,308
Congratulations on
winning your case in advance.

345
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,815
Such a smell can beat anything.

346
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,348
You'll be invincible.

347
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,581
Are we going to put up a Christmas tree?

348
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:54,653
I'll hang this on it.

349
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:11,067
When a man jokes around with a woman,

350
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,738
he wants to do other things
with her as well.

351
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:18,781
He kissed me.

352
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:21,574
Why is he acting like nothing happened?

353
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:24,186
Since we had something,
shouldn't there be some words?

354
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:26,471
Did he lose his memory?

355
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:27,756
Am I the only one who remembers?

356
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,024
Ma'am, come out.

357
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:37,787
I know what is good for you.

358
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,165
This will make you lose
all your belly fat.

359
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:45,003
My stomach isn't that bad anymore.

360
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,945
Ma'am, do you like dancing?

361
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,315
I'm pretty good at dancing.

362
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:03,375
This is kind of like "Macarena".

363
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,323
What?

364
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,044
Macarena?

365
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:08,791
It's a song that only old people know.

366
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,856
You must be a young boy, then.

367
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,534
I'll go out and get some air.

368
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:17,142
I can't stand this smell.

369
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:22,107
He's stressing me out.

370
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:24,153
My poor thyroid.

371
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,441
-Jiwoong.
-Yes?

372
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:26,378
Go.

373
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,633
Spin. Come on.

374
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:29,718
Spin.

375
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:41,196
Up.

376
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,532
Shake, shake baby.

377
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:15,460
You really don't know
the sweetness of life.

378
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:19,450
I wanted you to rest
at a yellow light for a day.

379
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,933
I wanted you take a break
from being at a red or green light.

380
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:48,596
You poor thing.

381
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:51,877
You don't have your mom...

382
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,860
...and I am also going to die soon.

383
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:58,188
My dear,

384
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,114
it's Grandma's wish.

385
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,447
"Mr. Min"

386
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,413
Where are you?

387
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:16,251
I'm at the Garden of Gethsemane.

388
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:17,964
Have you decided...

389
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:20,462
...to accept position?

390
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,830
Since I've made up my mind to accept it,
I might as well take it bottoms up.

391
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,034
Please proceed with it.

392
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:30,577
I will do so.

393
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:22,525
Stand shoulder width apart.

394
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,827
I think I'm going to die, Coach.

395
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,263
You're fine. Move your feet.

396
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:41,147
Not my shoulder's width, yours.

397
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:43,859
They're about as broad as mine, though.

398
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,120
Was it all a dream?

399
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,191
He kissed me and now he's
making me work out?

400
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:00,865
Because I pushed you against the wall,

401
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,709
are you thinking dirty thoughts?

402
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,535
Well...

403
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,103
...I'm sure you have your own reasons,

404
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:09,738
internationally renowned Coach John Kim.

405
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:16,928
Stand in this position.

406
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:19,944
Imagine someone is pushing
your forehead, and keep your chin down.

407
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,750
Five seconds.

408
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,652
Rest for five seconds.

409
00:31:32,294 --> 00:31:33,325
Another five seconds.

410
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:38,396
Always stand up straight.

411
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,168
It's good for bad head posture.

412
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:42,061
Remember the feeling and do it often.

413
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:44,702
Simple exercises that you can do
frequently are good.

414
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,441
Since you've done cardio,
we'll work on your core next.

415
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:51,180
It'll be good for your back...

416
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,296
...as well as your stomach.

417
00:31:57,386 --> 00:31:58,383
Yes.

418
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,572
I understand, Coach.

419
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,826
Wrap up by stretching.

420
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,629
You startled me.

421
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:39,791
I thought it was a thief.

422
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,861
Does a thief give you things?

423
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:48,730
What is it?

424
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,070
It's a bag.

425
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,939
Why would...

426
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,166
I hate that there is
a smelly bag in the house.

427
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:02,680
I'll get rid of that smell one way or...

428
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:08,887
It's the smell.

429
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:13,184
I mean,

430
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,755
why are you giving me this?

431
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:19,497
Is "Help me" your catchphrase...

432
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,866
and asking questions you know
the answer to your hobby?

433
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:27,338
This is a bag.

434
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:29,774
And we kissed yesterday.

435
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,279
Gosh, I know that.

436
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:39,317
Americans exchange greetings that way.

437
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,486
The way we did?

438
00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:43,374
That can't be true.

439
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,190
My goodness.

440
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,292
This morning, you...

441
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:49,965
I forgot.

442
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,783
You have Anna Sue.

443
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,826
Do you want me to be devoted to you
since you're chaste and pure?

444
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,592
Anna Sue is just my friend.

445
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:03,613
Of course, she is.

446
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:06,256
'Friends', as in people
with mutual affections.

447
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,184
I think...

448
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,887
...I made my intentions clear last night.

449
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,161
Should I make myself clearer?

450
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:23,079
You must be crazy.

451
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,464
What were you doing?
You shouldn't eat at this hour.

452
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:30,639
I was on my way to get Rascal.

453
00:34:30,773 --> 00:34:31,803
Why?

454
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:33,638
Are you lonely at night?

455
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:36,237
No, because it's cold at night.

456
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,897
Rascal hates being cold.

457
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:48,731
Is there something wrong?

458
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:53,291
I want to tell you something,

459
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:55,096
but I can't bring myself to say it.

460
00:34:56,565 --> 00:35:00,064
Your body is not disposable.

461
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,803
Sleep and then do it tomorrow.

462
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:09,240
Good night, Venus of Daegu.

463
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:19,355
I hate to lose.

464
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,309
Thank...

465
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,049
Thank you.

466
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:38,336
Oh, no. Here she comes.
Warning! In 3, 2, 1.

467
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:41,258
This is not the one.

468
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:43,441
This is a new one.

469
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,114
Smell it.

470
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:47,298
Everybody, relax.

471
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:49,514
Jiwoong, calm down.

472
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:01,515
Junseong, you are much thinner.

473
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,358
Isn't it difficult?

474
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:05,630
What else can I do?

475
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:07,165
I make a living from my body.

476
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:11,952
You can do it!

477
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:13,171
I can do it!

478
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,859
Where is Youngho?

479
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:20,147
He'll eat later.

480
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,535
It's because you pooped
in the bag yesterday.

481
00:36:24,535 --> 00:36:25,570
Jiwoong!

482
00:36:32,075 --> 00:36:34,578
Do you think he is sick?

483
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:36,382
Don't worry.

484
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,106
Go, fight and win!

485
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:49,380
Good luck!

486
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:51,542
Have a good day.

487
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,549
"My Grandfather's Escape"

488
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,620
"Courthouse"

489
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,832
Your steps are heavy.

490
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:07,712
Try to use the stairs only when you go up.

491
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,871
Your weight strains your joints.

492
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:11,751
He's always nagging.

493
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,036
Hi, Hyunjeong.

494
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,545
I surpassed the winning rate long before.

495
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,045
All right. Thank you.

496
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:32,416
Yes, Hyunwoo.

497
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:34,878
What?

498
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:38,612
Minjun's nanny is in the emergency room.

499
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:42,093
I can't take it anymore.
I should do something for her.

500
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:45,940
Speaking of which, could you go
to Minjun's kindergarten?

501
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:48,052
I can't contact my ex-husband.

502
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,883
Whenever I need him, I can't find him.

503
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,335
It's annoying.

504
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:54,338
I understand your situation.

505
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:56,741
But a Parent's Career Day?

506
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:58,896
Hey.

507
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:00,812
How do I explain what attorneys do?

508
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:02,392
They're kindergarteners.

509
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,202
I can't even explain it to myself.

510
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,722
The father needs to attend, too?

511
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:10,279
Both parents should attend.

512
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,271
That Producer Ko, seriously.

513
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:14,952
Is there somewhere I can buy a father?

514
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,763
All right.

515
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,455
I'll take a half day off.

516
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,134
You go take care of her.

517
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:23,832
Sure.

518
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,636
Drive safely.

519
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:37,724
Junseong.

520
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:40,618
I'm sorry but...

521
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:42,987
What?

522
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:48,023
Giving hopes and dreams to young children?

523
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,839
Well, it's a good thing to do.

524
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:53,931
Kindergarten?

525
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:02,607
Everyone, what will we do today?

526
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,527
-It's Parents Career Day.
-Minjun, I'm here.

527
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:10,661
Bongkyung's parents visited us last time.

528
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,086
They told us what producers do.
Wasn't it fun?

529
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,256
I can see a resemblance between you two.

530
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,124
I think I miss how you looked in the past.

531
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,411
Are you ready?

532
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:22,513
It's because I've been
around him for a long time.

533
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,853
I heard you worried about me this morning.

534
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,289
That's because...

535
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:32,466
...if you're sick...

536
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,442
...it affects my workout schedule.

537
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:39,533
That's a pretty bag.

538
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:42,861
The person carrying it is prettier.

539
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:45,335
Did you win?

540
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,301
-Of course.
-Okay, everyone.

541
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,188
Today, we have Ko Minjun's...

542
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:53,940
Uncles.

543
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:56,093
They're his uncles.

544
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,097
Minjun's uncles,

545
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,688
will explain and demonstrate
their jobs for us.

546
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,302
Give them a round of applause.

547
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:10,643
You're a good liar, for a lawyer.

548
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:11,678
What?

549
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:14,281
If they're my friends,
they're practically his uncles.

550
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,480
'Friends' as in people having
mutual affections for...

551
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:18,282
Goodness.

552
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,151
Did you just lick my hand?

553
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,491
You did it too.

554
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:26,323
Hello, children. I am a martial artist.

555
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:28,127
He's a world champion.

556
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,999
He'll get a grand slam soon.

557
00:40:31,336 --> 00:40:32,621
In martial arts,

558
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,300
you fight with your bare body
and adhere to strict rules.

559
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,195
-It originated 648 years...
-Hey.

560
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,623
Let's just do a demonstration.

561
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:41,843
The kids are about to fall asleep.

562
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,074
Yes, let's do that.

563
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:45,829
Okay, kids. Watch carefully.

564
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,045
We'll show you.

565
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,213
Let's go.

566
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,690
You guys are going to spill it.

567
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,276
I'll wipe it up, then.

568
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:45,503
It's a precious seat.

569
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:48,089
It can't be more precious
than a growing child.

570
00:41:48,448 --> 00:41:51,110
Auntie, who is this uncle?

571
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:55,379
He may talk like that,
but he's not a bad guy.

572
00:41:57,174 --> 00:41:58,660
Where are we going?

573
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,487
To a place he's been
begging to go for a month.

574
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,659
Why am I going there?

575
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:09,760
My mom says men never grow up
even until they die.

576
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,622
So, just come with us.

577
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:14,289
Where is it?

578
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:22,421
It's Iron Man.

579
00:42:25,152 --> 00:42:27,488
Auntie, it's Iron Man.

580
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,453
Between Superman, Batman and Iron Man,

581
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:35,986
who would you want to be?

582
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:38,590
I want to live as long as Iron Man,

583
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:40,506
and be as secretive as Batman.

584
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,959
But I think...

585
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,662
...I'm better looking than Superman.

586
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:48,266
Minjun, let's go to other sections.

587
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:52,903
Where are the princesses?

588
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:11,691
Where are you going?

589
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:14,125
One, two, three.

590
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:47,339
Hi Hyunwoo.

591
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,297
How is she?

592
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:54,598
What's the use in me causing a scene?

593
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:58,836
She absolutely refuses to press charges.

594
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:01,908
I'm going crazy.

595
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:03,774
There's no one to take care of her.

596
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,687
So I was thinking...

597
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,188
I'll stay with Minjun.

598
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:14,149
But come early in tomorrow morning.

599
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:15,717
I have to go to work.

600
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:18,261
Thank you.

601
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:21,959
Bathe him and apply
the cream for him, too.

602
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:24,494
Okay, bye.

603
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:37,107
My legs. I have cramps.

604
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,311
Cramps...

605
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:45,168
Which leg?

606
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,344
Wouldn't it be better if I carried him?

607
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:04,936
Or wake him up.

608
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,438
-Your joints...
-Minjun,

609
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:09,122
is more sensitive than he looks.

610
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,225
I'll push it just for today.

611
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:15,265
Thank you...

612
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,215
...very much.

613
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,354
That's a sufficient work out,

614
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,464
so go to sleep.

615
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:28,583
Auntie, I need to pee.

616
00:45:28,837 --> 00:45:29,994
You woke up?

617
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:31,614
Do you want to walk?

618
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,059
Let's go.

619
00:45:34,144 --> 00:45:35,076
Bye.

620
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:01,194
Come to think of it,

621
00:46:02,146 --> 00:46:04,161
she's staying out tonight.

622
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,504
It should be...

623
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,221
...that you love or don't love.

624
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:47,146
You said you didn't want
to get in a time machine,

625
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:49,940
so why are you in it?

626
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,187
Is this the designated driver?

627
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,138
My apologies.

628
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:39,456
I don't have time.

629
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:41,630
I need to go after dropping you off.

630
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,870
Good night.

631
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,059
"Venus of Daegu"

632
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:07,932
I wished you good night.
Why aren't you responding?

633
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,755
"Coach"

634
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,019
I was slow to respond
because I was stripping.

635
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,432
Stop kidding.

636
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:41,085
Do you want to do a video call?

637
00:48:47,645 --> 00:48:50,472
Did you hear about
the deal I made with Jiwoong?

638
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:54,708
Stop conspiring.

639
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:57,021
You're not dieting for me.

640
00:48:57,344 --> 00:48:59,219
Health. Health. Health.

641
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:01,984
Everything I say is for your sake.

642
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,508
He's nagging.

643
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,015
If I lose five kilograms before
the first snowfall,

644
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:10,695
we will go camping.

645
00:49:15,062 --> 00:49:16,075
Whatever.

646
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:23,725
Good night.

647
00:49:36,512 --> 00:49:38,578
Ever since I first met you,

648
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,359
I've been grateful.

649
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:42,933
Thank you, Buff John Kim.

650
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,622
Big Brother Youngho.

651
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:46,303
Youngho.

652
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:47,784
Coach.

653
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:11,083
I'm doing well today,
despite how I'm feeling.

654
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,323
Good shot!

655
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:16,480
You'll tear the net!

656
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,002
I've been practicing.

657
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:19,388
Keep giving me opportunities.

658
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:26,156
Sir.

659
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,356
You're gripping it too hard.

660
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,495
Just hold it. Go with the flow.

661
00:50:31,758 --> 00:50:33,547
Hold it. Place it and...

662
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:36,547
See? Like that.

663
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:39,403
There's a saying.

664
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:44,293
If you stack paper, it becomes stronger.

665
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:47,210
You can't break straws if you
band them together.

666
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:52,140
That's why we are gathered here, Sir.

667
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:56,609
I put my trust in you.

668
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:00,937
Hearing you say that you trust me,

669
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:03,127
makes me feel responsible.

670
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,363
If we pool all our shares together,

671
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:08,432
you'll be able to keep your
position as president.

672
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:10,005
Don't be discouraged.

673
00:51:10,597 --> 00:51:14,715
We're looking into the nominee,
Kim Youngho.

674
00:51:15,691 --> 00:51:18,442
I should have something to report soon.

675
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:22,757
You're such a good worker.
Where'd you learn all this?

676
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:27,696
Then I'll have faith in you
and stand firm.

677
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:28,782
Okay.

678
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:33,687
-Okay, then.
-Goodbye.

679
00:51:33,812 --> 00:51:34,847
Excuse...

680
00:51:37,766 --> 00:51:40,462
The madam should be okay, right?

681
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:44,665
Well, Hyeran is never all right.

682
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:55,612
You should rest.

683
00:51:58,178 --> 00:51:59,569
I'm fine.

684
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,765
Hi Youngjun, it's Mom.

685
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,964
I'm out with your dad.

686
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:18,373
Just a minute.

687
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:22,302
Mr. CEO.

688
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,145
Do you need anything?

689
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,513
Always be careful of your actions.

690
00:52:36,116 --> 00:52:37,163
Okay.

691
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:40,877
I'll call you later this afternoon.

692
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:42,359
Bye.

693
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,229
Our Youngjun...

694
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:53,100
...is healthy and doing well.

695
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:55,238
I heard.

696
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:57,317
I see.

697
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:17,738
Kang Jooeun!
You're incredible!

698
00:53:20,245 --> 00:53:21,213
I'm tired now.

699
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:41,572
Lawyer Kang, come to
the Pantheon conference room.

700
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:44,112
I'm relaying the president's orders.

701
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:46,656
If you want to refuse, tell him yourself.

702
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,730
-From Vice President Oh Soojin.
-Goodness.

703
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,622
She doesn't give me a choice.

704
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:13,617
Where are you?

705
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,554
I'll be back late so make sure
to exercise alone.

706
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:21,124
Nag.

707
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,843
Yes, yes, Coach.

708
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:30,367
This is Kang Jooeun.

709
00:54:30,597 --> 00:54:31,601
Come in.

710
00:54:34,902 --> 00:54:35,736
Yes, Ma'am.

711
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:39,876
There you are, Lawyer Kang.

712
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:43,280
Hello, Sir.

713
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:50,687
We're on the same side.

714
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:57,494
That's right, Vice President Oh.

715
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:08,004
This will be a simple meeting.

716
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:13,977
I didn't know I was
so respected at the firm.

717
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:17,081
This case...

718
00:55:18,745 --> 00:55:21,081
...requires someone who can keep a secret.

719
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:25,878
I am very loyal, aren't I?

720
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,564
Hello.

721
00:55:34,872 --> 00:55:38,153
I'm Chief Secretary Min Byungwook
from Gahong Group.

722
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:42,506
Let me introduce the executive director,

723
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,133
of Gahong Medical Group.

724
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,973
Please, excuse me.

725
00:56:31,985 --> 00:56:33,059
I'm sorry.

726
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:02,065
I want to live as long as Iron Man,

727
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,533
and be as secretive as Batman.

728
00:57:03,617 --> 00:57:04,685
I was born...

729
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:09,147
...with a silver spoon in my mouth.

730
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:13,022
My grandmother and father
will be enraged if they find out.

731
00:57:13,107 --> 00:57:14,475
They will think it's a disgrace.

732
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:17,646
Being alone with a guy like me in a suite

733
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:19,769
must be something out of your league.

734
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:33,116
Where are you going?

735
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,454
Beats me.

736
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:41,558
I'm sorry.

737
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:46,696
I...

738
00:57:50,587 --> 00:57:51,435
I...

739
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:53,236
I thought...

740
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,102
Calm down...

741
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,766
...and take a deep breath.

742
00:58:01,441 --> 00:58:02,979
Don't get worked up.

743
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,115
Take a deep breath.

744
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:11,609
You...

745
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:16,323
...really are...

746
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:19,905
...out of my league.

747
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:53,563
"Oh My Venus"

748
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:54,673
Date?

749
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,753
I don't do that with
someone who lies to me.

750
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:58,789
Did I give you a ring?

751
00:58:58,899 --> 00:59:00,106
Did I ask you to marry me?

752
00:59:01,435 --> 00:59:02,639
I'm being punished.

753
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:06,550
What do you mean John Kim
may be within Gahong?

754
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:08,058
What do you mean?

755
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:11,411
Kim Youngho may be John Kim?

756
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:14,317
Don't follow me. This is a private matter.

757
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,204
If he's the executive director of Gahong,

758
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:17,718
he's the future owner.

759
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,321
Are you saying that
you have private matters,

760
00:59:19,406 --> 00:59:20,632
with a man like that?

761
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:22,459
Let's keep doing what we've been doing,

762
00:59:22,544 --> 00:59:23,845
whether it's dating or dieting.

763
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:25,231
Since I think,

764
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,594
I've finally tasted
some sweetness in life.
