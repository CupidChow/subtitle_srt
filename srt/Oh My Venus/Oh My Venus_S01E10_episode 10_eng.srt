1
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,460
I... am in a romantic relationship with Kang Joo Eun.

2
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,590
What?

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,500
- Heol! 
 - Why?

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,980
Am I the only one in a relationship?

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,990
Kang Joo Eun.

6
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,540


7
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,150
 Episode 10 

8
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,250
Your name is Kim Yeong Ho?

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,710
Yes.

10
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,410
What is this, an interrogation?

11
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,350
Shut up.

12
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,360
You might be uncomfortable, but think of it as a rite of passage,

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,610
and I ask you for a sincere response.

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,400
So... Is your house... Self... What is it? Is it under you name?

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,840
Hmm almost.

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,950
How about your occupation?

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,820
Not yet... certain.

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,310
White hand. Another name for unemployed.

19
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,850
How long has it been since you broke up with your last girlfriend?

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,560
It hasn't been that long. She was a very famous foreigner.

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay. You're in the same boat, so you're even there.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,720
Excuse me,  Hyeon Woo.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,970
Aigoo, all you have is overflowing sexiness...

24
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,750
 You can't live off of a man's looks alone.  

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,590
But with his looks, you could probably live off of it for about fifty years.

26
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,030
You wench!

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,420
Hey, ex-wife!

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,240
Ah, this guy, seriously.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,970
My ex-husband is here to hand over some child support. Excuse me.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,550
Isn't that Lawyer Kang?

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,090
Who is that next to her? Ah, he's something!

32
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,070
What are you saying? You want to die?

33
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,230
Lawyer Kang lost a lot of weight! Is she going to put a mole next to her eye and get revenge or something?

34
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey! Is putting a mole next to her eye and meeting another man revenge?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your train of thought is seriously— Hurry up and leave!

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm leaving. I'm already plenty busy because of John Kim.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,050
Ah, really. So annoying.

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,640
Ma'am and Hyungnim Yeong Ho. Wow, surprise.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,580
And you told me I have no sense.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,340
"I am in a romantic relationship with Kang Joo Eun."

41
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,270
Hyung, I think the feeling is totally different this time. Not just a girlfriend.

42
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,030
Ms. Lawyer is a really good person, so

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,410
Hyung-nim will smile a lot more often now.

44
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,860
What's this? This feeling that I feel, it's weird. It's like... How can I explain it...

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,790
Like the feeling of my mom meeting her boyfriend.

46
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,330
Why don't you just call your mom more often?

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,680
Wait a minute.

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,710
It seems like Director Choi's side has information on John Kim.

49
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,970
We can't be sure that he has enough to release to the press, but it looks like he has a definite card up his sleeve.

50
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,250
At a time like this... How can you be enjoying a private life?

51
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,190
It looks like my confession isn't over yet.

52
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,780
I will go.

53
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,030
Why are you like this, seriously?

54
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,290
You saw him last time, right? Here is my cherished Manager Alberto Min.

55
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,450
Executive Director.

56
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,890
This is the official CEO of my private affairs.

57
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,710
She is Kang Joo Eun who is in a romantic relationship with me.

58
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,060
It is cold so go inside first.

59
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,290
I think it'll take a while since he likes to nag a lot.

60
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,490
Please go inside and have a talk. I will go to my house for now.

61
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,590
Then I will go to my house.

62
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,990
He knows that you live here so just go inside.

63
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,890
And if you look at it, you two are alike in both pretending you don't know while knowing full well.

64
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,030
Go inside.

65
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,670
You'll be in a tough situation when the chairwoman finds out.

66
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,910
It will be more of a problem if Father knows rather than Grandma.

67
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,290
If you know that, why are you—

68
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,770
Because she isn't a woman who I can stop meeting just because I will be in a difficult situation.

69
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,450
For now, just watch over us.

70
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:26,550
This whole situation could be harsher for Kang Joo Eun than you.

71
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,720
So...

72
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm asking you for help, okay?

73
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,160
Can't I just pretend I didn't see anything?

74
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,440
To do that... She's too great a woman.

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,090
Where are you running off to this time?

76
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,750
What did he say? What do we do?

77
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,040
What if your family has strange ideas about us?

78
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,380
You love pretending to be modest. It wasn't too long ago that you asked me to sleep with you just holding hands.

79
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,140
I'll just go sleep at Hyeon Woo's.

80
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Don't wake up the little sprout who's growing up, and just stay.

81
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,470
You're moving out tomorrow anyway.

82
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,790
How about the kids?

83
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,080
They said they would come after working out.

84
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:58,300
How about it? Should we take this opportunity to have a properly comfortable and racy night?

85
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,190
Seriously. Where is this rascal?

86
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,880
I am a bit late.

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,210
Oh, you are here?

88
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,030
What is the matter?

89
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:38,720
What do you mean? We haven't seen each other much these days.

90
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,960
Sorry. I have an important meeting tomorrow.

91
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,580
Soo Jin. I have a lot on my mind these days, so

92
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,720
I couldn't care a lot for you. So...

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,480
So I guess you are sorry again.

94
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,270
- Soo Jin. 
 - From now on, let's say our apologies over the phone.

95
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,500
I will leave.

96
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,790
 This whole situation could be harsher for Kang Joo Eun than for you. 

97
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,840
  This is the official CEO of my private affairs.  

98
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,950
  She is Kang Joo Eun who is in a romantic relationship with me. 

99
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,010
Ma'am.

100
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,420
We are back. 
  We are coming.  

101
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,650
Sister-in-law, good night.

102
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,530
I am tired.

103
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,810
Where are the kids?

104
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,540
They've come in and they're sleeping.

105
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
That's not it.

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,820
Thinking back on it, I forgot the last part of camping.

107
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,670
Why?  A comfortable and racy night?

108
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,570
"Deng!"  (Bell Ring for WRONG!) 
 Let's talk all night.

109
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,760
Because it is the last night.

110
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,510
This woman is wicked until the very end.

111
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,150
A full grown man and woman, late at night.

112
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,210
What are we doing?

113
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,050
Our negotiation isn't over yet.

114
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,790
Including the back hug, all hugs are off limits.

115
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,060
Just the hugs are off limits?

116
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,530
Physical contact is off limits, except for hands and feet.

117
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,410
What about dimples?

118
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,090
Dimples are off limits too.

119
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,140
Just five minutes after we met, I took your clothes off and ripped off your abdominal support. This is too harsh.

120
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,330
You're going too far.

121
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,510
"Your body is mine. You can't say no."

122
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,320
I've almost lost all my weight, so I can say no.

123
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,170
The more I think about it, I'm dumbfounded.

124
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,240
How could you stick red tape on my body?

125
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,220
How about it? Call?

126
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,530
Hands... Feet...

127
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,950
Okay. Call.

128
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,250
Beeep.

129
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:03,230
Why did you become a lawyer? You don't seem like someone who likes to use her head.

130
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,800
Ah. Ah.

131
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,230
When you grow up in an ordinary household,

132
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,130
sometimes you go through sad and unfair situations.

133
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,490
 That's why moms say this kind of thing often.  

134
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,990
"This is why we need at least one doctor or a lawyer in this household." That's why.

135
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,600
That's why?

136
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,820
Yes. That's why.

137
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:35,620
No matter what job it is, you just have to be happy to do it your whole life, be bright, and confident doing it.

138
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,160
Beeep.

139
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,050
Since you were little, you were always brave and not too smart, but you also had conviction.

140
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,870
You could say it's my life's motto.

141
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,660
I think... I'm going to be busy starting tomorrow.

142
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,500
I don't think I'll be able to help you move.

143
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:09,940
"Leave it to the moving professionals!" I don't want you to come and pointlessly mess things up. Don't worry about it.

144
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,860
Ah, I'm sleepy. Let's go to sleep now.

145
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:43,580


146
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,300
-  You're 62.2 kg! You did it! 
 ♬  I didn't know that it would be so painful   ♬ 

147
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,900
♬  I didn't know I would want to see you so much  ♬

148
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,440
♬  Slowly my heart would be influenced  ♬

149
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:11,200
 This. I haven't see it before. 
 ♬  Before I knew it  you filled  it completely  ♬

150
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
  What is this? 
 ♬  I enjoyed the time  ♬

151
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,730
 I wanted the prodigal son who has returned to have a home-cooked meal. 
 ♬   I had with you  ♬ 

152
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,200
  Move.  

153
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,490
  Oh. The smell.  

154
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,290
  Kang Joo Eun day.  

155
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,250
  I am back.  

156
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:42,130
♬   After time stood still  I want to be with you  ♬

157
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
♬  I will stay with you  ♬

158
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,030
  This is a bag. What we did yesterday was a kiss.  
♬  I will say I will love you   ♬

159
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,580
 I think I gave you at least that much assurance. 

160
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,840
  How is it? Should I give it to you one more time?  

161
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,500
  You must be really crazy.  

162
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,450
♬  I'm saying I don't have a choice  ♬

163
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,670
♬  Why did I have to meet you only now?  ♬

164
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:28,740
♬  The person who would make the wounded me happy   ♬

165
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,620
♬  I will keep you with me always  ♬

166
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,490
She's completely fixed her sleeping disorder.

167
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,140
♬  I won't waver and will embrace you  ♬

168
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:54,670
♬  Because you are everything to me, because you are my love  ♬

169
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:03,000
♬   I am never letting you go  ♬

170
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,630
 I thought you might cry too much, so I left early. 

171
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,250
 Ma'am is leaving a present for the three of you. 

172
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,350
 By the way, I made the breakfast so eat everything without complaining. 

173
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,540
Ma'am told us to heat it and eat it.

174
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,120
Without complaining. All of it.

175
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,680
Let's eat.

176
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,370
I will enjoy it.

177
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,380
Ma'am.

178
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,480
Is the director home?

179
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,390
Hyung?

180
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,880
 This one. This. This wouldn't let me go. 

181
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,530
I worked too hard since early this morning.

182
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,990
You know that tomorrow is the Gahong Board of Directors Meeting, right?

183
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,170
I'm the only one going today since it's a simple meeting.

184
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:35,010
Maybe you'll be too uncomfortable because of your personal relationship with Executive Director, Kim Yeong Ho.

185
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,390
I am uncomfortable with you like this as well because we are friends.

186
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,170
By chance, are you dreaming of a Cinderella story?

187
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:55,630
I have no intention of opposing if you want to quit being a part of Gahong's external legal team.

188
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,870
You said it yourself. Someone has to do it.

189
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,970
Covering your eyes from it doesn't change anything.

190
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,910
As expected, you are Lawyer Kang.

191
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,310
Then.

192
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,050
Oh my thyroid.

193
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,750
Cinderella?

194
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,570
Cinderella... The girl's more brazen than I thought.

195
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,690
She went to the party to see the prince, even though she knew her wicked stepmother and her stepsisters would be there.

196
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,010
Cinderella of the legal field...

197
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,290
I chose the wrong concept.

198
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,330
What are you doing?

199
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,130
I'm doing so much, I'm getting fed up.

200
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,250
They're the files you requested for Mr. Jang Joon Seong, because the office manager was out of the office.

201
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,470
Thank you, Hyeon Jeong.

202
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,570
She looks like a very stubborn person.

203
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,140
 Jae Soon Ja?   Jae Soon Ja...

204
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,530
I've heard the name somewhere...

205
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,910
Ms. Lawyer, a client came for consultation.

206
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,130
Please bring him in.

207
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,120
I don't know if she's spiteful or just thick faced.

208
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,510
Even if it's Gahong, I couldn't live there like her, with the son-in-law.

209
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,530
I found out that no matter what company it is, she's going to walk away with nothing.

210
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,770
Of course, since there's a new executive director who's the grandson.

211
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,130
 - But, where did he come from? 
 - I don't know.

212
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,930
 My word. How could she— 

213
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,070
Oh, Chairwoman Lee.

214
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,570
Hello, you're here.

215
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,330
- I'ts a long time since I've seen you.
 - Have you been well?

216
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,030
Since I'm old, I don't do well in cold weather.

217
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,350
Oh, you don't say.

218
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,810
Mother-in-law, you are here?

219
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,050
I didn't know you came.

220
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,690
Then.

221
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,990
Son, I am at the art museum with your grandma.

222
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,430
Of course, I am doing well.

223
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,430
Excuse me, Madam. Chairwoman told me to prepare the meals from now on.

224
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,090
Since I will take care of it you two go inside and rest.

225
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,450
 Gahong Group 

226
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,130
Ah, I think I have to learn math all over again.

227
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,000
There's a short meeting with the board members of Gahong in an hour,

228
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,040
and after that you have a dinner meeting with the Chairwoman. Tomorrow you have a board meeting—

229
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,750
Aren't you tired of saying the same thing many times?

230
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,560
Just help me pick out a tie. A pretty one. You're so countrified.

231
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:55,790


232
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,610
 How's the move going? 

233
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,570
 Moving company ajussis are doing it! 

234
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,150
 What are you doing? 

235
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,990
 I am eating. Did you eat? 

236
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,450
 Hurry up and eat. I am on my way to the company. 

237
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,430
  I am done eating.  

238
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,530
 Should we do a video call? Finish eating first. 

239
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,190
  See you in a bit if we can.  

240
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,490
 We've seen each other every day. It won't hurt to miss one day. 

241
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,630
 Work hard. I'm tired from cooking since early this morning. 

242
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,390
We have arrived.

243
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,710
Please put your phone on silent mode.

244
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,530
You're so jealous. 
  I'm here. 

245
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,570
  Let's get out, let's fight, let's win. Yup. 
 Fighting.  

246
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,070
We can't make any judgments on whether the executive director, Kim Yeong Ho, is amicable,

247
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,750
so let's test him a bit. If he wants to take part in business management it'll be a war,

248
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,670
but if he's just going to be a figure head, we'll have to let him be. What else can we do?

249
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,510
He is the only grandchild of Chairwoman Lee after all, don't you think?

250
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,350
Go back to work then.

251
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,070
Then, let's end it.

252
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,270
Chairwoman Lee Hong Im will hand over her shares to Kim Yeong Ho in a short while.

253
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,570
Then he will become the major shareholder, and when that happens,

254
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,010
we have no basis for restricting or blocking his taking office.

255
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,930
No matter what it takes, making the best of it

256
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,070
might be the best way to take a step back for the sake of taking two steps forward.

257
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,550
Mutual aid?

258
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:34,990
Then this world would be so beautiful.

259
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,070
You have to remember that taking a step back could mean

260
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,390
that you could be pushed further back or be thrown out completely.

261
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:48,800
You know how competitive this world is. Even if we can't stop it,

262
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,850
we can make it difficult.

263
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,590
It's not easy for him to take office without approval from the board of directors.

264
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,310
Come in.

265
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,800
- Executive Director. 
- Please sit.

266
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,690
Let's sit down. Sit sit.

267
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,810
Over there.

268
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,890
I should have come to say hello first, but it's been hectic while getting adjusted.

269
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,910
It's a given that things are hectic when you're new here.

270
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,230
That person is the external legal team leader.

271
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,790
I am Lawyer Oh Soo Jin.

272
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,570
These are the VVIP examination center files that we've been working on.

273
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,690
Since you'll sign it anyway, you can just look through it first. It's all here.

274
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,790
Ah. I'm going to reexamine this proposal.

275
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,430
Pardon?

276
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,250
It's a project that has been in process for years already.

277
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,200
We've reported it to Chairman Kim Seong Cheol already.

278
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,630
We have a lot of time, so let's take our time looking through it.

279
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,830
Just because the wealthy clientele's examination center project falls a little behind, I don't foresee any problems.

280
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,430
It's an organic tea. It's supposed to be calming.

281
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,810
I didn't get anything ready. Thank you.

282
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
Excuse me.

283
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,790
Before, about Lawyer Kang and General Manager, Im Woo Sik—

284
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,730
Yes.

285
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,200
I hope you don't have any misunderstandings.

286
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,530
We've been acquaintances for a long time. I won't let it interfere with my work—

287
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,530
Lawyer Kang Joo Eun said different things.

288
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,570
Excuse me?

289
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,050
The two of you were friends. Close ones.

290
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,720
Yes, well...

291
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,480
I understand. You won't let personal business interfere with your work.

292
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,720
Do you have more to say?

293
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,400
No. Then, I will see you tomorrow.

294
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,440
Let's talk.

295
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,720
Why didn't you tell me?

296
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,320
Do I have to tell you about my work, too?

297
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,360
Are we in that kind of relationship?

298
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,410
Oh Soo Jin.

299
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:53,420
Did we do more than hug a few times and kiss a few times?

300
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,950
I don't think I have to report my business to you.

301
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,240
The same goes for you too.

302
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,660
How can you do this when you know what position Kim Young Ho and I are in?

303
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,420
Does this make sense?

304
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,980
You and Joo Eun were each other's first love and dated for 15 years.

305
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,100
But, you are here with me.

306
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,230
- Does this make sense to you? 
- Soo Jin.

307
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,810
Even with a relationship of 15 years, you guys are strangers after one day.

308
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,240
But now, why did you think we would last forever?

309
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,900
Grandma, I'm here.

310
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,740
Hello.

311
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,740
Hurry up and sit. Grandma is hungry.

312
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,740
I said I would get mad if you lied to me.

313
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,020
Enjoy your meal.

314
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,340
Have some wine too, and take your time with dinner.

315
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,510
It's hard for people to meet even once,

316
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,940
but since you guys have met three times

317
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,730
Grandma.

318
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,160
Oh, I'm not that keen on Italian food.

319
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,680
The two of you enjoy your meal.

320
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,100
Today, I think these are for me.

321
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,370
Of course,  Chairwoman.

322
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,020
Go safely.

323
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,430
You're way past your marriageable age.

324
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,860
Your grandma is going to suffocate (and die waiting for you to get married).

325
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,740
Let's have a cup of tea instead of having a meal.

326
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,730
Yes.

327
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,370
I don't expect you to be sincere from the start.

328
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,900
I am now expecting that kind of stuff.

329
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,190
Do you have someone else you want to marry?

330
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,860
I don't have any intention to marry since my circumstances will make it very difficult.

331
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,060
- To the elders... 
- Yes, we shouldn't tell them.

332
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,210
I have at least that much sense.

333
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,980
I'm very sorry.

334
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,610


335
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,990
Were you well during your business trip?

336
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,750
Would there be anything special?

337
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,450
Yeong Joon wanted me to ask his father

338
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,550
what he should major in.

339
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,320
Whatever he wants to do.

340
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,250
Kim Yeong Ho.

341
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,010
You weren't like this to your other son.

342
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,850
You didn't let him do anything he wanted.

343
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,010
Our Yeong Joon,

344
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,320
what kind of son is he to you?

345
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,570
You're saying stuff you didn't use to.

346
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,730
Of things I never used to say,

347
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,340
let me say one more thing.

348
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,760
For a year, receiving cancer treatments...

349
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,210
Since when did you know?

350
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,950
I don't need to know about the company matters.

351
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,120
But, I need to know your sickness,

352
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,340
because I'm still

353
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,740
your wife.

354
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm sorry. I don't usually complain.

355
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,820
But,

356
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,040
I wanted to do it at least once.

357
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,120
Please rest.

358
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,920
Welcome.

359
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,750
I'm sorry I couldn't help with your move, but instead, this.

360
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,180
It's good that Hyungnim Yeong Ho  is not here. We can eat this kind of stuff.

361
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,910
Ah, we went around the block a few times,

362
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,950
so stalker-like guys won't come again.

363
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,810
Sister-in-law, it's heavy.

364
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,990
Hurry up and come inside.

365
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,410
- It's heavy. 
- Go inside.

366
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,930
So heavy.

367
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,710
The way I see it, he's not very loyal.

368
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,460
It's spiteful how you don't gain weight even though you eat.

369
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,620
Sister-in-law and champion, you guys need to take care of your body, or else Hyungnim Yeong Ho will kill me.

370
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,890
Then why don't you eat all those greens with us?

371
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:42,130
No, no. When you move, you have to eat jjajangmyun.

372
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,830
Ah, I like the gift. Superwoman.

373
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,460
Wonder Woman. She's exactly my style. You're the best, Sister-in-law.

374
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,080
Sister-in-law seems too old.

375
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,290
Just "Ma'am" is better.

376
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,420
I adjusted to it  as well.

377
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,960
Hyungnim might not be able to come today.

378
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,570
Ah, I know. Today's not the only special day.

379
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,740
Faster, faster. Go.

380
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,140
Hip, hip. Butterfly, butterfly.

381
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,640
Wow, you're like a really cool dolphin.

382
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,630
Hey, how can you be afraid of the water if you're going to the marines?

383
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,700
Oh, wait. Hyung, I'm sorry.

384
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,390
Oh, okay, okay.

385
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,320
Stop.

386
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,420
Ma'am told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it. Resolve.

387
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,920
Resolve.

388
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,550
Hyung, is your shoulder okay?

389
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,460
Ah, well. It feels a little more comfortable.

390
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,650
Ji Woong!

391
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,490
Yes.

392
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,930
It is her again.

393
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,390
Jang Yi Jin. Jang Yi Jin!

394
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,680
Hyung, Yi Jin might die. Mouth to mouth.

395
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,560
One, two, three, four, five.

396
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,540
Whoa.

397
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,580
We kissed.

398
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,890
Yeah!

399
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,930
Kim Ji Woong, you bastard.  Seriously.

400
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,190
Sorry, Hyung!

401
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,170
You're doing the acting of your life here.

402
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,530
Why don't you do this in dramas?

403
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,770
I'm seriously unable to even look at you.

404
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,050
Ah, get up quickly!

405
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:47,610
At your Gahong, the director candidate Kim Yeong Ho... he's John Kim, right?

406
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,610
What are you saying? Do you have proof?

407
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,450
I got in touch with the paparazzi in the U.S.

408
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,600
Gahong must have blocked it for quite a large sum of money.

409
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,090
And well... It seems like you know something.

410
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,420
Isn't that why you told me not to do a report on suspicion, because you'd get me the facts?

411
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,430
It's not the kind of thing to be revealed easily.

412
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,250
If you don't have solid evidence, it can actually become a backlash.

413
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,810
That's right, because the other party is Gahong.

414
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:29,270
Star Im, that bullet, how much could it be worth?

415
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,970
Who is it?

416
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,720
Who is it?

417
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,690
 It's the snack shop.  You just moved here, right?  I'll give you some fliers. 

418
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,440
Just put it on the door and leave.

419
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,830
Yes, you've worked hard.

420
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,350
Who is it?

421
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,570
It is me, the guy who is in a romantic relationship with Kang Joo Eun.

422
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,830
It is late. Why did you come?

423
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,930
Because you left something.

424
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,360
Come in. How was it today?

425
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,930
You have to leave right away, huh?

426
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,990
Manager Min is downstairs.

427
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,450
Well, it's not like today is the only day.

428
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,480
You introduced Joon Seong and Ji Woong to girlfriends.

429
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,640
But I gave you a book instead.

430
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,980
"Romance Cafe?" It was so like you.

431
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,940
Why? You should have got me "Romance Restaurant," or "Romance Buffet" instead.

432
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,280
You said the board of directors meeting is tomorrow.

433
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,510
You should hurry up and leave.  You're tired.

434
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,090
It will be hard tomorrow.

435
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,890
Isn't there anyone who can do in lieu of you?

436
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,570
For you, Yeong Ho, as well as for me, our work is our life.

437
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,820
Who will do it in lieu of us?

438
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,870
As for the outside legal team,

439
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:11,650
I only have to do it until you're inaugurated as the Director, so don't worry about me.

440
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,560
Did you forget? I am Kang Joo Eun who can do anything as long as I put my mind to it?

441
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,220
That's right.

442
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,290
Since I saw your face, I will leave.

443
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:35,020
Ah, what is this Gyeon Woo and Jing Nyeo story (star crossed lovers) that wasn't in my plans?

444
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,560
Now leave.

445
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,420
Lock the door well.

446
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,850
Oh yeah, before you sleep, do three sets of planks.  Okay?

447
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,470
Yes, Mr. Coach.

448
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,110
And this... is getting confiscated.

449
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,110
I will leave.

450
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:19,260
♬   Such a woman might not exist anywhere   ♬

451
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:27,130
♬   She only knows one person.  A woman who loves that man.  ♬

452
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:34,090
♬   I'm searching for such a woman.   ♬

453
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:41,460
♬   If perhaps that love comes to me   ♬

454
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:51,150
♬   Maybe you are that love.   ♬

455
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,020
 That person is the team leader of the outside legal team. 

456
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,480
 I am Lawyer Oh Soo Jin. 

457
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,560
Yes, PD Go.

458
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,400
Star Im, I caught John Kim.

459
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,860
 Hey, that paparazzi guy does good work. 

460
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,680
As soon as I sent the money, he sent me the picture.

461
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,130
The scandal picture with Anna Sue.

462
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:42,560
If I improve the quality of the picture, it will be a jackpot. Right?

463
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,930
How long will it take?

464
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,930
You must feel anxious, Lawyer Kang.

465
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,380
It's not like I'm the Director.

466
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:21,520
  Regular Board of Directors' Meeting of Gahong Group.  

467
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,440
It seems like the directors are very busy.

468
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:08,100
Chairwoman Lee, I think it is better to reschedule the meeting. It is better to go for today.

469
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,190
Let's do that.

470
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,860
See you again.

471
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,800
Yes.

472
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,830
It's one to zero.

473
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,940
Wow, it feels like ice in here.

474
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,010
Our team should go. Vice CEO, let's go.

475
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:39,440
I guess Director Kim Yeong Ho has already dropped Cinderella's glass slipper.

476
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,910
What did you say?

477
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:47,910
If not, are you barking up the wrong tree?

478
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,850
Would you like to become the chicken that gets chased and driven out...yo? (yo is for honorific)

479
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,220
Ah, seriously.

480
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,670
  Diet 

481
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,140
I didn't know that Director Choi would influence the board directors to move that way.

482
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,230
It is all my fault.

483
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,990
Please get me the documents for the VVIP medical center.

484
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,180
Yes, I will prepare them right away.

485
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,290
I guess he is greedier than I thought.

486
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,610
  Daegu Venus 

487
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,940
How can he not call or Kakao Talk even once?

488
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,170
He must be fine.

489
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,080
 Whoa! Oh my God! 

490
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,590
 Wow! Fantastic! 

491
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,380
Fantastic!

492
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,470
Omo, omo. How can this fit so well?

493
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,870
Hold on.

494
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,750
Ah, shoes.

495
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,490
 Madam Kwon Ok Boon 

496
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,270
Mom.

497
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,750
What? What's going on?

498
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,220
Why do you ask what's wrong every day?

499
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,020
Mom, I lost a lot of weight.

500
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,590
I'm the same as I used to be. I'm totally pretty.

501
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,850
Of course. Because you are my daughter.

502
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,870
Where do you think you got your beauty gene? Did you eat?

503
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:23,110
You ask about eating every day. That's why I got fat.

504
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,130
Mom, why aren't you sleeping?

505
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,270
Aigoo, I should sleep.

506
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,450
I am trimming the anchovies to make broth.

507
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,970
Must you trim them to make broth?

508
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,540
You became overemotional about the pig last time.

509
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,050
Is this time about anchovies again? Girl, watch your temper!

510
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,340
Mom.

511
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,550
Say it.

512
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,210
Thank you for raising me this prettily.

513
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:54,750
What's wrong? Is today Mothers' Day?

514
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,540
You were originally pretty.

515
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,910
Stop saying nonsense and sleep.

516
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,030
I got it. Sleep well, Mom.

517
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:11,310
Get the treatment for your wrist. Don't just put the pain patch on it everyday.

518
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,130
All right.

519
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,490
Aigo, what on earth is this?

520
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,090
Is she psychic?

521
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,690
 Lee Hyeon Woo 

522
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,740
Yes, Hyeon Woo.

523
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,530
What do you mean?

524
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,250
I am asking if the Yeong Ho you are seeing is John Kim.

525
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,040
How did you know that?

526
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,110
Who is the executive director of Gahong?

527
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,930
How did you know?

528
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,570
It is a big commotion on the Internet. Why are you like this?

529
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,020
  Scandalous John Kim turned out to be the new successor at Gahong 

530
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,590
  Mr. Coach 

531
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,300
  The number you dialed can't be reached.  

532
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,530
  Joon Seong 

533
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,610
  The number you dialed can't be reached.  

534
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,920
  Ji Woong 

535
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:22,870
  The party you are calling can't be reached.  

536
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,270
Who is this lady?

537
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,570
Did I find the wrong house?

538
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,460
What happened?

539
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,000
You must be going somewhere nice.

540
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,280
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

541
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,000
I got shocked.

542
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,290
Are you okay?

543
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,720
How about Manager Min?

544
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,760
I think it is better to go to the hotel.

545
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,560
Because there are so many reporters waiting outside of my house

546
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:38,150
I don't want to go home. It's the same with the hotel too.

547
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,400
 I don't want to go home. 

548
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,740
Do you think I want to sleep at the hotel?

549
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,510
 You think I came to the motel because I like it? 

550
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:03,490
Even though there is only one room and one bathroom, come in.

551
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,930
To your outer space.

552
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,950
Boarding.

553
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,610
Departing.

554
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:30,400
♬  I think I love you,  ♬

555
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,760
♬  I think I like you,  ♬

556
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:45,430
♬  Though I am quite afraid of the love that's found me again,  ♬

557
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,100
♬  I can't avoid it,  ♬
