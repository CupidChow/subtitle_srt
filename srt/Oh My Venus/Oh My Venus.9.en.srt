1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,276
Your doctor called me.

2
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:13,737
He said that you have fully recovered.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,315
Congratulations.

4
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:22,856
Thank you.

5
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:24,712
This position I'm holding now...

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,762
...is yours.

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:31,496
It used to be your mother's.

8
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:35,226
This position comes with
a lot of responsibility,

9
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:39,039
and it doesn't allow
for any faults or weaknesses.

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:44,359
I'm well aware of that.

11
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,163
A lot of people will be watching you.

12
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,518
They will be talking about you, too.

13
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,730
Be careful of what you say
and how you act.

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,923
Always be alert.

15
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:58,825
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:03,553
I'm relieved.

17
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,840
Now I have a clear conscience
before your mother.

18
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,372
"Episode 9"

19
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:38,965
Sir.

20
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,179
Are you feeling ill?

21
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,903
I've had this necktie on for a while,

22
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:55,989
so I have a mild headache.

23
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,363
Thank you. You can go home now.

24
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,983
Coach... Coach.

25
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:33,947
Stay away.

26
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,806
What's wrong with you?

27
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,054
What happened?

28
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,834
Are you hurt?

29
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,799
What can I do for you?

30
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,969
What's going on?

31
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,558
Leave me alone.

32
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,242
It's not something that...

33
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:05,111
...someone can cure.

34
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:06,929
Why are you being like this?

35
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,700
Let's go see a doctor.

36
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:11,437
Let's go see a doctor. Come on.

37
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,125
Tap tap.

38
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,328
When a person taps,

39
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:23,876
you're supposed to let go.

40
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:34,853
Please.

41
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:06,324
I was very sick when I was young.

42
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:09,990
I could hardly walk, run or play as a kid.

43
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,011
I have no memories like that.

44
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,380
While I was sick,

45
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,484
my mom passed away.

46
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,054
My father was scary...

47
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:22,855
...and I felt bad for my grandma.

48
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,974
I was young, weak,

49
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,527
and always at risk.

50
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,726
I probably have a neurosis.

51
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,531
It'll probably continue
until it disappears one day.

52
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,250
Or it will continue...

53
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,249
...until the day I die.

54
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,717
It may look fine on the outside,

55
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,821
but it needs time to heal.

56
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,717
It's not healed
just because it looks fine.

57
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,739
It looks heavy.

58
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,653
I'm okay.

59
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:03,108
I'll carry this for you
until we get to your house.

60
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,909
Thank you.

61
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,601
You are such a nice, young man.

62
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,334
It's fine. Don't mention it.

63
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:18,571
It's this way.

64
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,103
Are you okay?

65
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,993
Are you really okay?

66
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,552
You caught me.

67
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,447
That must have not been sexy.

68
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,034
Why are you crying...

69
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,231
...when I'm the one in pain?

70
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,042
I was scared.

71
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:03,309
You scared me to death.

72
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,197
Have a seat.

73
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,754
I'll tell your husband later again.

74
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,648
I want your family...

75
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,596
...to move out.

76
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:40,883
Mother.

77
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:43,353
You must have heard that Youngho,

78
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,565
made his decision about being
the executive director.

79
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,107
I don't think I have to explain.

80
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,351
Since you've worked hard,

81
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:55,668
I'll provide sufficient
financial assistance.

82
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:01,567
Don't take it too personally.

83
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,204
Mother.

84
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm not asking for anything else.

85
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:12,765
I just...

86
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:16,057
Since you are also a mother,
you'll understand me.

87
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't want Youngho...

88
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,541
...to wander around anymore.

89
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:26,131
Mother, I just...

90
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,992
Because of me,

91
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:29,707
it must have...

92
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,973
...not been easy for you, all these years.

93
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,040
Mr. Min is here, ma'am.

94
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,961
Do as I say.

95
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:44,898
It may be a little late,

96
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,278
but we need to make things right.

97
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,538
Mr. Min, let's go inside.

98
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,738
How long have you been sick?

99
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,323
I can't really remember.

100
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,169
The more I think about it,

101
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:46,592
I don't think that you
went to the States,

102
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,640
to meet Anna Sue.

103
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,345
Instead you went to Daegu Gahong Hospital.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,916
You didn't spend a restful
and erotic evening.

105
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:59,051
Instead,

106
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:01,220
it was a lonely and painful one.

107
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,024
That's all I can figure out.

108
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:07,739
Did you go through...

109
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,229
...my room?

110
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,033
You're not the only one...

111
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,253
...that can do a search and seizure.

112
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,007
What's going on?

113
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,179
We've already kissed and everything.

114
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,046
Are you still going to keep it a secret?

115
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:37,557
I had bone cancer when I was young.

116
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,901
Cancer?

117
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:47,567
But...

118
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,793
...why do you have so many scars?

119
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,511
One surgery is not enough.

120
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,798
This says,

121
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,452
that recently,

122
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,135
I've fully recovered.

123
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,382
Then...

124
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,799
...if you've fully recovered,
why are you still in pain?

125
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:09,322
It's psychological.

126
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:11,292
My body still remembers it.

127
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:12,257
A human body...

128
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,660
...is smarter than you'd expect.

129
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,960
How often does it...

130
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,966
No.

131
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:22,983
Did it hurt...

132
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,709
...even after we met
or while I was staying here?

133
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,032
Did it hurt this much?

134
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,948
Sometimes the pain passes quickly.

135
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:34,769
Oh, my.

136
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,735
I didn't know that.

137
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,121
I talked behind your back.

138
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:41,700
I said that you were sexy
but nothing else.

139
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,738
I even said mean things about you
because I thought you were arrogant.

140
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:46,757
That's why...

141
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,558
...you shouldn't judge
people by their looks.

142
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:54,753
My goodness.

143
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:56,185
I'm the one in pain,

144
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,286
but you keep crying.

145
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,106
Don't you know that...

146
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,576
...it's more painful to see
your loved one in pain?

147
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,000
Because there's nothing
you can do for them.

148
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,037
Kang Jooeun,

149
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:14,894
do you care about me?

150
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,109
Didn't you know that?

151
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,793
I care about you.

152
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:19,859
A lot...

153
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,765
Come over here.

154
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,064
Taking medication...

155
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,974
...doesn't help?

156
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:47,206
If this is how much pain you're in,

157
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:50,038
what does it make
my hypothyroidism look like?

158
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,682
From when I was young,

159
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,462
to when I became a grown-up...

160
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:58,803
Even after I grew up,

161
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,419
I spent most of my time at the hospital.

162
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,423
You realize something when you do that.

163
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,356
You realize that...

164
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,033
...there are so many people
suffering in this world.

165
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,685
In the end...

166
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:23,384
...all of us are...

167
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,411
...in pain.

168
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:28,447
Whether it is just a little or a lot.

169
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:37,002
So don't cry.

170
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,143
Everybody endures it.

171
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,293
They just go on with their life.

172
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,311
Oh, my.

173
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,668
Honey.

174
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,157
I said that I recovered.

175
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:39,089
I didn't say that it didn't hurt.

176
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,018
Kang Jooeun, you hate liars.

177
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,992
But I didn't lie to you.

178
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:49,537
So, don't run away from me.

179
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,313
Even in this situation,

180
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,868
I must look pretty to you.

181
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,855
I think...

182
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:06,962
...you need to work on it a bit more.

183
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,620
How can I possibly be prettier?

184
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,817
If you become healthier,

185
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,104
you'll be prettier.

186
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:15,663
You'll be sexier, too.

187
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:17,817
So...

188
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:19,965
..don't...

189
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,381
...get sick.

190
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:24,944
Yes, Coach.

191
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:34,797
Do you want me...

192
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,247
...to stay with you?

193
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,159
That would...

194
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,850
...be great.

195
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:21,921
-Hula-Hoop.
-Hula-Hoop.

196
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:23,422
This is harder than it looks.

197
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:24,924
Don't let it phase you. Let's go.

198
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,058
Spin it.

199
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,927
-Look. I'm really good.
-Oh, wow.

200
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:30,262
-Wow.
-Did you see...

201
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,298
-I'm so...
-Wow.

202
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:36,097
Junseong.

203
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,448
Is it supposed to be this hard?

204
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:49,161
Come.

205
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:52,084
You don't have to act cool.
Let's go.

206
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,406
Let's go. Spin it like this.

207
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:57,656
Spin it.

208
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:00,140
-Watch me.
-Spin it.

209
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:01,668
Oh, no.

210
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,044
Youngho.

211
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,450
Where are Junseong and Jiwoong?

212
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,478
They already ate.
They're at the gym now.

213
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,524
When I woke up, you weren't there.
When did you leave?

214
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:19,979
Goodness.

215
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,056
They're at the gym.

216
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,533
Oh.

217
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:31,115
A little before 4 o'clock or so.

218
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:32,820
Why?

219
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:36,578
Does it not count as sleeping together
if you leave before 4?

220
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:37,836
We slept together anyway.

221
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,022
Gosh.

222
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,272
If someone heard you,

223
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,961
they would assume that we did something.

224
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,248
How would I know?

225
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:44,954
I was asleep.

226
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,641
My goodness.

227
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:50,506
Give that to me.

228
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,382
This is the same thing as yours.

229
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,935
You're so greedy when it comes to food.

230
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:59,096
This Honey, you don't know anything.

231
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,538
This is what you do
when you're in a relationship.

232
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:02,871
I see.

233
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:03,956
I unwrap things for you...

234
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:05,624
...and you unwrap things for me.

235
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,141
By the way,

236
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,876
did you call me "This Honey"?

237
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,012
Do you want me to call you
'Baby' instead?

238
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:14,658
No problem.

239
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,324
It seems like dating
is good for nothing.

240
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,416
You're familiar with the restful
and erotic night,

241
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,432
but you know nothing else about dating.

242
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,026
Should I...

243
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,481
...be your relationship coach?

244
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:31,797
What?

245
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:35,988
It seems...

246
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,700
...I can teach you a lot.

247
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,894
You are such a wicked woman.

248
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:42,962
Do it.

249
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,129
I didn't get the chance...

250
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,356
...to tell you yesterday.

251
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,904
I'll be moving out in a week.

252
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,825
Since a day passed,
I'll be moving out in six days.

253
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:03,832
To where?

254
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:04,918
Will it be safe?

255
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,166
Is it easy for guys to access?

256
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:09,891
It is close to this place.

257
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:13,372
It is a studio and also near
my friend's house.

258
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,797
It seems relatively safe.

259
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,590
You'll be busy once you
start working at Gahong.

260
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,317
And...

261
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,784
...many people will be watching you.

262
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,571
We should be careful.

263
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,052
Do you feel...

264
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,158
...uncomfortable working as
the external legal counsel?

265
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:32,584
Just because I feel uncomfortable
doesn't mean I don't have to do it.

266
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,194
I can't pick and choose what I want to do
if I work under someone.

267
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:37,817
There seems to be no problem...

268
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,732
...for you to take
the executive director position.

269
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,923
It seems that they hired external
legal counsel as a backup.

270
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:48,035
But maybe some people are
against you stepping in.

271
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:50,677
You are smart.

272
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:51,628
Gosh.

273
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:54,513
Seem like you keep forgetting.

274
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,609
I'm a lawyer with beauty and brains.

275
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,440
It's just your face
that lost all the weight.

276
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,093
I specialize in eating
and gaining weight.

277
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,448
What do you think?

278
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:10,796
Should I show you?

279
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:12,918
Goodness.

280
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:14,733
You are a dangerous woman.

281
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:24,838
I think it'll be better to
tell Junseong and Jiwoong

282
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,979
after I move out.

283
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,175
Tell them what?

284
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:32,227
Are you a seven-year-old or what?

285
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,953
I didn't tell anybody.

286
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,754
It's already demanding
enough to date John Kim.

287
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:40,055
On top of that,
Gahong's executive director?

288
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:41,887
Gosh.

289
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:44,142
It will be tiring.

290
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:46,901
So what are we going
to be telling them about?

291
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,853
About us dating.

292
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,036
Do I need to spell it out?

293
00:22:51,257 --> 00:22:52,437
I see.

294
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:55,443
We need to be careful
because we'll be working together.

295
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,509
We should separate business
and personal matters.

296
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,606
All right.

297
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:00,946
You have...

298
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,181
...abdominal obesity and I'm your coach.

299
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,236
Gosh.

300
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,905
That's pretty lame.

301
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,529
Hold it.

302
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:16,058
I can't anymore.

303
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,563
I'm exhausted.

304
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:21,893
You're so slow.

305
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,551
Oh, my.

306
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:28,502
Coach. Why don't we just kiss.

307
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:30,354
Why do we have to work out? Oh my gosh.

308
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,708
I got you!

309
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:33,793
Oh, my.

310
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,328
Business is business.

311
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,878
What's personal is personal.

312
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:41,433
What's this?

313
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:43,582
This is business.

314
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:46,949
It's a couple-exercise
that's good for the abs.

315
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:50,421
Oh my gosh.

316
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,623
So.

317
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:53,451
Where shall I take you?

318
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,697
Ma'am! Youngho! Ma'am!

319
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:57,062
-Oh, no!
-Youngho.

320
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:01,949
Why are you lying down?
Aren't you exercising?

321
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,237
Jiwoong, I'm so tired.

322
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:07,460
Up! Up!

323
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:10,512
1000021, 1000022...

324
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,999
-1000023, 1000024...
-Do you want to do it?

325
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,661
I'm hungry.

326
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:35,467
Were you teasing him?

327
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:39,037
I do this all the time.

328
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:42,779
Look here. Aren't you annoyed?

329
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:46,311
I got something in my eye.

330
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,209
Something's in my eye.

331
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,420
Jiwoong.

332
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,726
-Want me to blow on it?
-Yes.

333
00:25:57,977 --> 00:25:58,909
Blow a little harder.

334
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:03,840
Who is it?

335
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,266
Please tell Junseong to come out.

336
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,840
Jang Yijin?

337
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,634
Oh, Yijin! What's up?

338
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:11,960
I'm not Jang Yijin.

339
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:13,513
Yes, you are.

340
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,088
Junseong!

341
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:18,102
What? Jang Yijin?

342
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:35,160
Get in.

343
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:40,942
I'm Jang Yijin, the queen of commercials.

344
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,703
If people recognize me,
I can't go anywhere else.

345
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:43,789
Get in.

346
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:47,526
Hurry up!

347
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:58,686
This is rude.

348
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,819
-Are you saying you like me?
-What?

349
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,944
Do you want to go out to eat
or do you want to kiss me?

350
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,239
Do you want to...

351
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:09,114
I remember, so please stop.

352
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:13,665
What will you do?

353
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,135
-Jang Yijin, what you did...
-No.

354
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,141
Call me "Yijin".

355
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:24,190
What? Everyone calls me by my first name.

356
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,111
They say, "Isn't that Jang Yijin?"

357
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:29,097
"That's Jang Yijin. Hey, Yijin!"

358
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:32,267
I don't like speaking
informally to people.

359
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:37,235
Jang Junseong, an orphan
with a dark past, became a champion.

360
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,294
Born on April 5, 1986.

361
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:41,126
Age 29. Blood type O.

362
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:46,468
You should look me up online.
Type in "Jang Yijin".

363
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,326
The first search result is me.

364
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:51,570
All of my scandals will show up,
so run a search.

365
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:54,165
But you can't trust everything you see.

366
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,402
There are things that are made up.

367
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:01,315
I need to concentrate
on my upcoming fight.

368
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,381
-Please...
-Come on!

369
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,741
If you won't kiss me, live with me
or die with me...

370
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:12,444
...at least go out for a meal with me.

371
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:38,152
Stress-induced overeating
and loss of appetite.

372
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:43,097
Are you under a lot of stress?

373
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:48,593
A bit.

374
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,129
You should get some fresh air...

375
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,519
...and make time for your hobbies.

376
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:08,323
I'm fine.

377
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,450
Are you okay?

378
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:35,073
Where are you?

379
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,142
These are handmade chocolates.

380
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:23,828
Congratulations on your exam.

381
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,083
You know that chocolate I got you?

382
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,903
They sell them in Korea now.

383
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,338
You'll get to know about me,

384
00:30:40,862 --> 00:30:42,009
but this is how I am.

385
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:44,577
This is how I apologize.

386
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,190
Do you even know...

387
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:51,284
...what you did wrong?

388
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,219
I'm not that bad of a guy.

389
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,198
About Jooeun's stalker...

390
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,226
It's understandable.

391
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:08,700
No.

392
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:11,940
That's why I like you.

393
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:19,411
Jooeun was your first love
and you dated for 15 years.

394
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:21,697
She was in danger.

395
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,551
How could you not care overnight
just because you broke up?

396
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,576
If you were that kind of person,

397
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,692
I wouldn't like you.

398
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,871
I'm sorry for not answering your call...

399
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,699
...and I'm sorry for not
calling you back right away.

400
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,704
I think...

401
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:50,763
...Jooeun is seeing someone new.

402
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:54,758
I know.

403
00:31:57,427 --> 00:31:59,877
You seem to know who that is.

404
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,454
Yes.

405
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:02,621
Well...

406
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:05,690
I think he's joining Gahong...

407
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:09,652
...as the executive director.

408
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,101
I'll go now.

409
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:23,608
It's been a while since we've met.

410
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:26,825
Do you want to get some tea?

411
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,483
Or go for a walk? Or...

412
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,448
No.

413
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,203
I'm tired.

414
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:33,609
I walked a lot today.

415
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:36,488
Good night.

416
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:38,490
Soojin.

417
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:42,928
I'm sorry.

418
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,017
"I'm sorry."

419
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:54,906
Women hate hearing that from their man.

420
00:32:58,516 --> 00:32:59,376
Bye.

421
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,258
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:39,840
Wait!

423
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:45,761
I almost missed you.

424
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,810
Kang Jooeun, what are you doing here?

425
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:50,328
I knew it.

426
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,284
It's your first day at work.

427
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:54,502
Look at your tie. What is that?

428
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:55,702
Take that off.

429
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,777
I don't know how to tie it yet.

430
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:08,021
It feels like you're my wife.

431
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:11,015
I plan to give you a tie...

432
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,881
...when I propose.

433
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:15,957
Who says you can propose?

434
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,771
I'm Kang Jooeun.

435
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,991
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

436
00:34:20,513 --> 00:34:21,947
You'll be late. Go.

437
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,282
You look good.

438
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:26,497
Bye.

439
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:37,111
We've repeatedly broken up.

440
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:40,355
We've fought about so much in
the past 15 years.

441
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,772
I'm Kang Jooeun.

442
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,748
I'm your first love, Im Woosik.

443
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,290
Congratulations.

444
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:48,659
I plan...

445
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:50,233
...to give you a tie...

446
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:51,909
...when I propose.

447
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:02,262
Everyone.

448
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,376
Make sure you're free for dinner.

449
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:07,694
You can't complain even if it's cold.

450
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,970
What now?

451
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,040
It was the first snowfall.

452
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:16,292
We agreed to go camping if I lost
five kilograms by the first snowfall.

453
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,072
That's right. Camping.

454
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:22,287
I know it snowed,

455
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,374
but I don't know if you lost the weight.

456
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:28,036
You gained 1.8 from 62.2 kilograms,
which makes you 64 kilograms.

457
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,765
-Has your weight changed since then?
-Of course!

458
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,871
How much?

459
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:35,061
Well,

460
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:37,523
it's not about the weight.

461
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:39,553
It's about how much body fat I lost,

462
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,241
and how much muscle I gained.

463
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:42,643
That's what matters.

464
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,146
-Right?
-Right.

465
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,231
That's right.

466
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,823
Show me proof after measuring
your body fat percentage.

467
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,644
Come on.

468
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,808
Come tomorrow,
I won't be part of the family.

469
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:56,982
Let's just go.

470
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:58,156
Please?

471
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,624
You're not the type to let go of
an opportunity, huh?

472
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:10,969
You'll do anything you set your mind to.

473
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,460
Gosh.

474
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:16,529
Fine. Deal.

475
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:18,664
-What?
-Deal?

476
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:24,115
We're going camping.

477
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:26,038
We're really going, right?

478
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:30,722
Jiwoong.

479
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:34,795
An americano, please.

480
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,060
Coming right up.

481
00:36:36,982 --> 00:36:38,071
Honey.

482
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,305
Half a shot each and make that two.

483
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,391
Okay.

484
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,214
Don't stick your lips out.

485
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:50,896
It may be misinterpreted.

486
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:06,457
Yes, Coach.

487
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,647
-Just a moment, please.
-Okay.

488
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:18,806
Did you eat?

489
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:20,142
Where are you moving to?

490
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:21,472
Is it safe?

491
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:24,037
Stop asking me the same things.

492
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,961
I ate a heaping portion of grass.

493
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:29,777
It's a studio and it looks safe.

494
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:34,448
Why don't you pay me rent
and just live with us?

495
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:37,045
I just have to charge
the going rate, right?

496
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,057
The going rate?

497
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:41,194
They say the rich are stingier.

498
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,598
Even girlfriends don't get a break.

499
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:46,931
I was...

500
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:52,029
...moved around like a piece
of baggage because of you.

501
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,080
Now that you're the executive director...

502
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:59,749
I hate rumors and gossip.

503
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,835
I experienced it a lot when I was young.

504
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,238
Shu Qi?

505
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,596
No.

506
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:17,644
Me? I'm the Venus of Daegu.

507
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:22,188
That wretched dimple.

508
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:24,657
Excuse me.

509
00:39:05,868 --> 00:39:07,103
Can we talk?

510
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:11,463
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,531
Do you want me to beat him up?

512
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:17,837
Will you be my lawyer?

513
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:20,626
Just go.

514
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:24,016
Don't cheat on me.

515
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,553
I'll see you later.

516
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:47,597
You look good.

517
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:49,546
I've been working out.

518
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:51,811
You saw right, this time.

519
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:58,228
You're not losing weight
to show Soojin and me, right?

520
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:00,464
I don't want you to overdo it.

521
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,134
I'm not losing weight, I lost weight.

522
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:04,741
And you're right,

523
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,099
I'm doing it to show you guys.

524
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:12,775
But I wanted to show...

525
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,380
...myself...

526
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:16,433
...and the world, too.

527
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:22,029
Working out clears my head
and makes me feel better.

528
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,797
It's as difficult as the bar exam,

529
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:28,118
but it's equally as gratifying.

530
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:50,018
Don't you have a trash can at home?

531
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,093
I thought you should be
the one who throws it out...

532
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:56,676
...since it's meaningful.

533
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,461
Fine.

534
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,017
I'll throw it out.

535
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:08,213
I'll even make sure to recycle it.

536
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:10,001
Is that all?

537
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:30,250
Your mother texts me...

538
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,505
...early in the morning from time to time.

539
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,592
She just asks me how I'm doing.

540
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:37,589
She tells me to take care of myself.

541
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,499
I don't know why she bothers.

542
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,755
I'll tell her to stop so don't reply back.

543
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,314
You'll give her hope.

544
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:50,896
I feel bad.

545
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:54,351
The past 15 years...

546
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,869
...wasn't just about you and me.

547
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,948
It was also about your mom, Jaehyeok,

548
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:02,446
and other close friends
that we spent time with.

549
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:06,090
I didn't know...

550
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,014
...that there was a process
in breaking up.

551
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,069
I also didn't know the etiquette.

552
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,854
What do you want?

553
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:18,294
I don't regret...

554
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:20,071
...breaking up with you.

555
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:21,706
But...

556
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:23,507
...hearing that...

557
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:26,468
...my first love is happily
with another guy...

558
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:30,202
...and realizing that guy
is by your side...

559
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,883
...wasn't very pleasant.

560
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:35,021
I know I'm being selfish.

561
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,219
Im Woosik.

562
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:40,614
What is it that you want?

563
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:44,783
I'm not saying I want to go back.

564
00:42:45,618 --> 00:42:46,518
It's just that...

565
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:48,506
...there are feelings...

566
00:42:49,054 --> 00:42:50,945
...that linger even if things are over.

567
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:52,163
How should I say this?

568
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,328
There are feelings that cannot
be explained with logic.

569
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:00,378
I don't think I can ignore them.

570
00:43:02,587 --> 00:43:04,044
Because I'm sure...

571
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:08,040
...that we will eventually meet...

572
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,042
...now and then, somewhere.

573
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,829
If I didn't know you,

574
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,053
I'd think you were playing games.

575
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:18,864
But I know you.

576
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,940
I'll take back what I said,

577
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:26,337
that I couldn't wish you
a long and happy relationship.

578
00:43:28,227 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm sorry.

579
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,218
Thank you.

580
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:39,727
I think one needs to learn
how to break up.

581
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,375
We were each other's first love.

582
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:46,057
Sure.

583
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:49,341
This is our first official break up.

584
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:52,765
The present and the future,

585
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,396
and not the past.

586
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,535
I'm sure we'll get used
to thinking about it.

587
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:00,671
We already are.

588
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,824
My shoulder.

589
00:44:37,496 --> 00:44:39,153
Not that way.

590
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:41,840
Where is she?

591
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,541
Reasons why you have
forward head posture.

592
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:51,689
Prolonged use of computer
and phone with poor posture.

593
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:53,746
Get up often and stretch,

594
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:56,665
and keep good posture as if
someone is pushing your forehead.

595
00:44:56,749 --> 00:44:57,587
Got it?

596
00:45:11,764 --> 00:45:12,819
Oh my gosh.

597
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:20,727
You seem happy.

598
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,988
You were smiling.

599
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:27,978
I'm feeling joy again
after all the bad things,

600
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:29,537
that have happened to me.

601
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,689
How is the copyright case...

602
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:34,632
...coming along?

603
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:37,983
You said it wasn't urgent...

604
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:40,504
...so I've been taking my time
looking through the files.

605
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,047
Then what exactly...

606
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,305
...have you been working on?

607
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:50,084
I'm preparing the lawsuit
for Choi Museong and,

608
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:52,453
14 additional plaintiffs.

609
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:54,222
The copyright case became urgent,

610
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:56,854
so report to me as soon as possible.

611
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:01,258
And...

612
00:46:01,914 --> 00:46:03,349
...clean up a little.

613
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:06,263
Keep your desk tidy.

614
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:14,593
What's her problem?

615
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:16,607
I was in a good mood.

616
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,608
Honey.

617
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:21,352
Honey, did you leave?

618
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,957
"Im Woosik"

619
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:36,382
The number you're calling...

620
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:43,834
Hi, Producer Ko.

621
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:48,619
I got proof that John Kim's home
in the States belongs to Lee Hongim.

622
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:50,449
How should we release this?

623
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:52,779
Is that so?

624
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,183
See?

625
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,019
What did I tell you?

626
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:05,411
You and Youngjun don't mean
anything to them.

627
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:07,661
You served her for 20 years,

628
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:10,865
but she's making her grandson
the executive director.

629
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,595
Now, she's also telling you to get lost.

630
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:17,892
That conniving Chairwoman Lee
is a problem,

631
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:20,571
but your husband is at fault, too.

632
00:47:21,344 --> 00:47:22,637
He is...

633
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:24,830
...very thoughtful.

634
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:26,216
Thoughtful?

635
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:29,001
Is that why he broke your heart,

636
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:30,814
and shipped your son off
to the States in exile?

637
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:32,745
Namcheol.

638
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:37,128
I'm not here to get yelled at.

639
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,525
Gosh.

640
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:44,115
Stay quiet for now.

641
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:46,168
Goodness.

642
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:48,270
How could you get stabbed
in the back like that?

643
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:52,218
Even if she tells you
to get out, you stay put.

644
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:55,922
It's over if you leave.

645
00:48:11,618 --> 00:48:13,981
I got the documents.
I'm looking through them.

646
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,071
Your inauguration...

647
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:17,883
...is drawing near.

648
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:20,942
-You need to be prepared.
-Okay.

649
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:22,630
You're always nagging me.

650
00:48:23,255 --> 00:48:24,462
I'll nag one more time.

651
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:26,492
You must settle...

652
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:28,906
...your personal affairs and be careful.

653
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:31,575
Those around you may be hurt...

654
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:34,050
...more than you, sir.

655
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:35,913
Goodbye, then.

656
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,932
Thank you for coming.

657
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:52,211
I'll take you out for golf soon.

658
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,292
-That sounds good.
-Let's go together.

659
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:55,531
-Good night.
-Good night.

660
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:57,210
-I'll see you later.
-Good night.

661
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:08,182
Finally. All done.

662
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,568
Hi Hyunwoo. Let's go.

663
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:16,771
Right now!

664
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:22,366
I'm so tired.

665
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,038
Hey, Kang Jooeun.

666
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,836
How could you do this to me?

667
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:31,440
Who went to your son's kindergarten,

668
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:33,404
as his parents?

669
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:36,833
You and that sexy guy of yours.

670
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:39,282
Since you know, hurry up.
We don't have time.

671
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:42,447
Shouldn't the men set up the tent?

672
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:44,637
The men are coming.

673
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:46,583
Mr. Sexy Guy,

674
00:49:46,697 --> 00:49:48,276
Mr. Muscles,

675
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:50,013
and Mr. Cutie are all coming.

676
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:52,578
What's wrong with you?

677
00:49:52,678 --> 00:49:53,865
Where do I start?

678
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:58,052
Let me introduce you.

679
00:49:58,137 --> 00:49:59,734
This is my friend...

680
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,787
...of 16 years, Lee Hyunwoo.

681
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:02,933
Hello.

682
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:04,949
I'm her loyal friend, Lee Hyunwoo.

683
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:09,045
This is Kim Youngho.

684
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,178
Oh!

685
00:50:10,262 --> 00:50:12,409
So you're Mr. Sexy Guy!

686
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,152
Oh, my.

687
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:16,735
-I'm Kim Youngho.
-Yes.

688
00:50:17,204 --> 00:50:19,887
And he is the Korean Snake.

689
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:22,019
RFC Champion, Jang Junseong.

690
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:23,297
Hello.

691
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:24,977
Oh, dear.

692
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,482
You really are Mr. Muscles.

693
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:29,638
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:32,168
She's also the type that speaks
what's on her mind.

695
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:36,484
And he is Kim Jiwoong.
He's a trainer...

696
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:38,324
...and a Harvard graduate.

697
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:40,350
A future marine.

698
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:41,972
You're the second Ma'am!

699
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:44,372
Thank you.

700
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:47,376
If you're friends with Jooeun,
you're my friend, too.

701
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,791
Nice to meet you.

702
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:55,969
He's a cutie and he's also
a Harvard graduate.

703
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,518
I want to have him tutor Minjun.

704
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:01,363
Kang Jooeun.

705
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,859
Can we talk?

706
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:08,432
Ma'am!

707
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:12,358
You're good looking.

708
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:17,563
You said we're going camping.

709
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:19,533
Yes, camping.

710
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,817
Some call it a picnic or a retreat.

711
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:23,391
You can also call it a field trip.

712
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:25,204
Or Daeseongri.

713
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:27,144
Daeseongri?

714
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:31,648
You, Junseong and Jiwoong...

715
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,157
...never did anything like this.

716
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:37,376
What's the point in having
a big house and a nice body?

717
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:39,101
You have no memories.

718
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:44,268
So, you want all of us to
taste the sweetness of life?

719
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:48,138
It isn't much,

720
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:51,241
but it's nice to do
something all together.

721
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:53,735
I ask for your cooperation.

722
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:56,013
Oh, and...

723
00:51:57,629 --> 00:51:58,849
...don't make it so obvious.

724
00:51:59,928 --> 00:52:03,317
Worry about your detail-oriented
and meticulous self.

725
00:52:04,844 --> 00:52:07,819
Okay, everyone. Start the fire
and gather round.

726
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:10,799
-Let's start the fire.
-No, no.

727
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:14,220
-Let me carry you.
-What are you doing?

728
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:20,866
Why are you being nice?

729
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,073
I don't want you to whine
about being cold.

730
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:24,357
Whine?

731
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:27,630
Here.

732
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,920
Okay now.

733
00:52:32,004 --> 00:52:33,005
What's this?

734
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:39,078
"The shoulder carrying the bag..."?

735
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:40,881
It's a famous song.

736
00:52:41,013 --> 00:52:43,220
The highlight of a field trip.

737
00:52:43,315 --> 00:52:44,880
-Teacher?
-Sure.

738
00:52:46,051 --> 00:52:47,924
Field trip captain,
Lee Hyunwoo, at your service.

739
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:50,906
First, let's start clapping to the beat.

740
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,709
One, two, three, four. Faster.

741
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:55,177
One, two, three, four.

742
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:57,543

Oh, my.

746
00:53:03,362 --> 00:53:05,408
You really don't know this song, do you?

747
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:07,823
Use your shoulders.

748
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,643
Are you saving them for something?

749
00:53:10,342 --> 00:53:13,179
Those shoulders are beautiful.
Okay, Junseong?

750
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:17,028
-Yes.
-Shall we start again?

751
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:18,699
Cutie Jiwoong? Are you ready?

752
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:21,336

Here.

765
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:08,417
I believe you won't need to...

766
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:10,847
...talk or fool around
with the person next to you.

767
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:18,355
Okay, now. Close your eyes.

768
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,036
What are we doing?

769
00:54:26,986 --> 00:54:28,503
This is the highlight.

770
00:54:28,588 --> 00:54:29,790
Close your eyes.

771
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:31,135
Hush.

772
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:35,804
Even if you cry, don't wipe your tears.

773
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:37,974
Just let them flow.

774
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,078
Confession time.

775
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:42,980
I will start.

776
00:54:44,804 --> 00:54:46,068
I, Lee Hyunwoo,

777
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,220
once collected child support
twice in a single month,

778
00:54:51,744 --> 00:54:54,257
while my ex-husband was busy
chasing after celebrity scandals.

779
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:56,997
I confess.

780
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,990
Next.

781
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:01,707
Mr. Sexy Guy, it's your turn.

782
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:07,928
I asked for your cooperation.

783
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:18,115
I am...

784
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:20,546
...dating Jooeun.

785
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:23,519
What?

786
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:26,529
-Youngho!
-What?

787
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:30,347
Am I the only one...

788
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:32,062
...in this relationship?

789
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,433
I'm dating...

790
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:43,039
...Mr. Sexy Guy.

791
00:55:43,964 --> 00:55:45,232
Kang Jooeun!

792
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:49,668
Why you...

793
00:56:05,577 --> 00:56:07,528
Hyunwoo is a lot like me.

794
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,866
We're both green.

795
00:56:12,312 --> 00:56:13,613
You're green this time.

796
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,622
You were yellow last time.

797
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,684
Will it be a red light soon?

798
00:56:19,271 --> 00:56:20,272
X-rated.

799
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:23,694
Am I a traffic signal?

800
00:56:28,412 --> 00:56:30,381
It's your last night.

801
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:32,578
Should we turn on the red light?

802
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,882
What's wrong with this man?

803
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:38,480
You know you like it.

804
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:09,559
Stay here.

805
00:57:16,922 --> 00:57:18,234
I think Director Choi...

806
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:21,130
...has information on John Kim.

807
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,903
We don't know exactly what he has,

808
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:26,132
but I think it's a strong card.

809
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:27,726
At a time like this,

810
00:57:28,701 --> 00:57:30,202
how can you be engaged
in a private matters?

811
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:35,032
I guess confession time hasn't ended yet.

812
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:43,649
I'm leaving.

813
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,776
What are you doing?

814
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:01,115
You've met him, right?

815
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:02,436
He is...

816
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:05,704
...my precious Alberto, Mr. Min.

817
00:58:06,338 --> 00:58:07,439
Sir.

818
00:58:08,574 --> 00:58:11,151
This is the official boss
of my private matter.

819
00:58:19,652 --> 00:58:21,896
This is Kang Jooeun
and we're in a relationship.

820
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,065
"Oh My Venus"

821
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:57,264
I forgot the last part of camping.

822
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:59,374
A restful and erotic evening?

823
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:00,460
Wrong.

824
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:02,272
Talking all night long.

825
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,094
It's my last night.

826
00:59:04,363 --> 00:59:06,871
You are bewitching until the end.

827
00:59:08,055 --> 00:59:09,595
Lawyer Kang lost so much weight.

828
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:11,362
Who is that next to her?

829
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:13,676
He's good looking.

830
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:15,752
Executive Director nominee Kim Youngho.

831
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:17,620
He's John Kim, isn't he?

832
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:19,729
The situation...

833
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:23,061
...may be harder on Jooeun.

834
00:59:23,983 --> 00:59:25,157
I can't refuse to meet her...

835
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,364
......just because it will make
things complicated.
