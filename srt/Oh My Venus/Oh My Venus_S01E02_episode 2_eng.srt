1
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,610
Excuse me!

2
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,020
Save me.  Why are you doing this? Why are you like this?

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,880
This woman only asks me to save her whenever she sees me,

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,840
Without being grateful.

5
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,120
♬    Baby only you, there's only you   ♬

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,700
Why? Do you want to grab hold of her hair?

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,060
Excuse me?

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,800
I mean...

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,620
♬    I'm someone who didn't know love  ♬

10
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,580
♬  I'm the one who you were comfortable with  ♬

11
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,700
If not let's go.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,520
I think I might get upset if I catch a cold because someone's boyfriend cheated.

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,880
Please go.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,680
♬  Love you. Love you  ♬

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm not holding you.

16
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,740
- This, this. 
   - Save me. 

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,840
 Oh! 

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,200
♬ Baby only you, there's only you  ♬

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,140
Because this grabbed ahold.

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,860
♬  My darling, you  ♬

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,240
I know that I look like an indifferent city slicker,

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,880
but I am nicer than I look.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,210
I can't pass by someone who's drowning. I have to fetch their belongings too.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,660
From now on, I won't go anywhere near water,

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,660
so please just leave. Please.

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,700
Let's go while I'm being polite. I dislike the cold the most.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,300
 Episode  2 

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,200
Look here, I am a softie  towards people who are injured.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,180
But, I am weaker towards people in danger. So—

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,660
I'm thankful for your words, but I'll go by myself.

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,000
Put yourself in my shoes.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,060
On a late night, on the streets, and it's raining.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,260
Leaving a woman like you, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,340
With this kind of a weapon, with this kind of emotion,

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,760
late at night, on the streets,

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,120
a girl like this, self protection is a given and I think filing a charge without any settlement is even possible.

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,260
Give me what's mine and go on your way.

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm not someone who goes around losing stuff.

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,940
Okay, now that I think about it, I think I may be able to sleep after all.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm really thankful, and I suppose this will become our last greeting.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Goodbye.

42
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,010
Seriously?!

43
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,880


44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Customer, did you come here by mistake?

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
It seems so, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,520
♬  Before  ♬

47
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,380
♬  The sun goes down  ♬

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,530
♬  We better say good bye  ♬

49
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,170
♬   Knowing that you leave me high and dry  ♬

50
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,480
 I'll be leaving. 

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
 Yeong Ho. 

52
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,000
 My child, I'm sorry for sending you alone. 
♬  Let it go and it's all right  ♬

53
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,980
 Do you want to stop by and see your mother before you go? 
♬   Can't you see that I'm lonely? ♬

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,080
 After the surgery, after it's over. 

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,680
 I'll be leaving now, Grandmother.  
 ♬  Can't you feel  =♬

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,980
 Okay. 

57
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,540
♬  that I am fading out? ♬

58
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,950
♬  I want you to save me please  ♬

59
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,280
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

60
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,140
Jang Joon Seong.
 ♬  Won't you save me please   =♬

61
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,850
♬   Can't you see that I'm lonely.  ♬

62
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,170
♬  Can't you feel that I an fading out.  ♬

63
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,120
Good morning.

64
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,820
Thanks to you. Mr. Jang Joon Seong.

65
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,960
It was wishful thinking.

66
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,640
Since the country is not that big. Especially for the powerful.

67
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,610
There's no way my grandmother doesn't know that I'm back, right?

68
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,780
That's wishful thinking.

69
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,940
Take your time getting ready and come out.

70
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,420
Okay.

71
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,060
 Lee Hyeon Woo 

72
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,000
Lee Hyeon Woo?

73
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,120
 The person you called  is not answering — 

74
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,580
Min Joon. Aunt Joo Eun isn't picking up.

75
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,980
I didn't ask you to call her for me.

76
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,700
Hey, Go Min Joon, why are you talking back at me?

77
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,820
Why are you eating so little at a time?

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,440
Aren't you going to answer me?

79
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,640
Grandmother, is Min Joon hurt somewhere?

80
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,390
Yoo Na must have teased him by saying that he's fat.

81
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,040
I will be going. I'm going to go take the school bus alone today.

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,710
Hye, Go Min Joon. Break off with Yoo Na right away! This girl... I will just—

83
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,440
I will go instead, Min Joon's mom.

84
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,280
It upsets me so much.

85
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,700
Yoo Na used to think he was cute. Why is she so fickle?!

86
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,080
Ah really.

87
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,260
What is Kang Joo Eun doing that she's not picking up?

88
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,610
How did you pay for the taxi?

89
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,920
There was some cash in the house.

90
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,590
- Is everyone here already? 
 - Oh, the Vice President isn't here yet.

91
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,850
I thought the Attorney Vice President was coming tomorrow.

92
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,620
Oh, the  Attorney Vice President is coming today just to say hello. Your hair.

93
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,440
Did it start?

94
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,380
  Is that all?  Passing the bar exam is supposed to be like winning the lottery, 

95
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,880
but there will be tons of graduates from law school.

96
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,500
Is it still the lottery?

97
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,800
You're underestimating yourself, Lawyer Kang.

98
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,930
- I'm sorry, I don't feel good. 
- Aigoo...

99
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,150
You're right. It seems you feel really sick.

100
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,650
I had to fly to the U.S. over the weekend. I apologize.

101
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,970
The Attorney Vice President has arrived.

102
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,620
Everyone say hello.

103
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,920
From the world famous law firm in America, we brought her here as a team leader.

104
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Lawyer Oh Soo Jin.

105
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
Oh Soo Jin?

106
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,340
Nice to meet you, I'm Oh Soo Jin.

107
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,860
Kang Joo Eun?

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,450
 Wow that's really amazing. 

109
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,240
 The one who got into law school at the top of the class was her. 

110
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,200
 Super fatty. 

111
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,380
 Wow. Oh Soo Jin. God is so fair. 

112
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,120
 I know right! 

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,800
  Should students of law be personally attacking someone? 

114
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,940
 - What's this?
- What do you mean, what? 

115
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,640
I'm Oh Soo Jin's friend and a future prosecutor.

116
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,790
 Joo Eun. 

117
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,380
 Those kids are alive thanks to you. 

118
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,520
 But... how did you get in without a student ID? 

119
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,230
  I'll get in one day anyway. 

120
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,310
  Ah, those guys helped me. 

121
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,590
 Look at this. Look.  

122
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,430
  Oh!  

123
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,640
  What's the point of writing fan letters every day? 

124
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,530
 Only your arms will hurt. I heard you don't sleep well at night. 

125
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,440
 Soo Jin, I will help you fall into a deep sleep. 

126
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,510
 - What do you mean? 
 - Lee Ji Hoon!  

127
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,120
 - You said you were dying to see him! 
 - Oh! 

128
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,950
Hey, you're making me feel like your unwelcome superior.

129
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,470
You have the look of jealousy for some reason.

130
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh, sorry.

131
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,180
I stared at you, didn't I.

132
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,700
It's just that...

133
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm sure you can't believe it.

134
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,260
I felt the same way...

135
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,880
about you becoming a lawyer.

136
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,830
Ah... Oh.

137
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,690
Lawyer, you must be so happy.

138
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,270
Your friend came as the Attorney Vice President.

139
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,040
Friend?

140
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,660
To be honest, aren't I your senior in college and on the bar exam too?

141
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,450
Miss Hyeon Jung.

142
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,040
Ah... Yes. I'm Jo Hyeon Jung.

143
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,430
Please take care of me from now on.

144
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,010
I should be the one saying that.

145
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,990
I'm sorry, but from now on,

146
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,090
please get me an organic tea.

147
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,660
Ah. Y-Yes.

148
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,520
I will do that from now on.

149
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,250
Then...

150
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,970
Let's see.

151
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,090
I think there will be more time to chat later. Shall we end our greeting here for now?

152
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,560
Okay.

153
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,970
Okay, fine.

154
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,630
See you around.

155
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,530
"For the fights of your life" this is Lawyer Kang Joo Eun.

156
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,090
- Secretary Min. 
 - What's the matter?

157
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,840
Don't do this.

158
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,290
I came here on vacation so I don't have anything appropriate to wear.

159
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,340
You're very well prepared but it's totally not my style.

160
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,340
The President is waiting.

161
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,330
How is it? Am I pretty?

162
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,470
Am I... going to be told off?

163
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,060
I can't say.

164
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,810
Would there be a reason for it?

165
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,080
Give me some clues.

166
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,430
Okay?

167
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,390
You're pretty.

168
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,950
Right. Then...

169
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,430
I'll buy a pair of shoes and buy some presents.

170
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,240
I can't pick on it since it's totally my style.

171
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,530
I asked you what's going on.

172
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,680
She's been waiting a long time.

173
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,510
Right? It's so rude of me.

174
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,170
- Let's go in. The President— 
 - The President's joints must be all better now.

175
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,080
I see she even wears heels now.

176
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,540
It's Kim Yeong Ho. I'm going in.

177
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,610
Hello.

178
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,290
Leaving early? Working outside the office?

179
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,510
I have the afternoon off.

180
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,950
Afternoon off at 4 o'clock...

181
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,890
It's too bad. It's the end of the work day very shortly.

182
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,880
I haven't been feeling well since yesterday.

183
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,910
It's not because of me, right?

184
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm kidding! It's a joke.

185
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,690
I'm sure it makes you feel self-conscious to leave work early from the company.

186
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,030
It's not that but I don't want to cause any harm to the company.

187
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,350
By the way... Soo Jin—

188
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,220
You're a good worker, from a superior's point of view.

189
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,590
Do you know there were strange rumors

190
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,180
that you were overweight and ugly—

191
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,980
Gay, pervert, a crazy person, and he's actually a woman.

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,710
Those rumors must have embarrassed you.

193
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,650
As you know, not so much me, but the elders.

194
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,830
Since the founding member was your great-grandfather, I'm sure that was true.

195
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,500
But... Will you be staying on as the U.S. branch manager?

196
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,680
If possible, yes.

197
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,940
From what I heard, you were going into Korean medicine—

198
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh,  that's just the license. It's my family's tradition.

199
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,330
Excuse me.

200
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,770
 Anna Sue 

201
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,360
I apologize.

202
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,480
I will see you another time.

203
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,030
Yes. Take care.

204
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,350
That's what I'm talking about! Yeah.

205
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,700
Okay, mission success!

206
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,450
It's misery. Misery.

207
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,440
It's not even like we're shooting a movie or something.

208
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,380
But, where are we going?

209
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,090
To shoot a real movie.

210
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,820
♬   Baby Only you  Whoo  ♬

211
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,180
♬   You are the only one Whoo  ♬

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,260

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,390

219
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,650
 Lee Hyeon Woo 

220
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,920
 13 missed calls 

221
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,120
 You have a new message from Lee Hyeon Woo 

222
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,380
 I'm the owner of the phone. Please give me a call. 

223
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,830
 I will reward you well. 

224
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,610
H-Hello?

225
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,830
- They picked up, Hyeon Woo.
 - Ah, seriously. They wouldn't pick up like idiots.

226
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,710
Did you say hello?

227
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,530
- Yes? 
 - Oh, thank you!

228
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,450
By any chance, where did you pick up the phone?

229
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,960
From inside your bag.

230
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,130
If I had known you were a woman, I would have picked up sooner. I thought you were a man.

231
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,890
- Joo Eun. 
 -  Hello?  

232
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,910
Hey, Kang Joo Eun.

233
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,240
The person who just had to take my phone was you?

234
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,680
I looked for it at the airport and the hospital—

235
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,320
It seems that way.

236
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,420
It's true that someone on my side did it, but someone else, not me.

237
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,020
Ah.

238
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,940
I'm in the middle of shopping.

239
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,790
So?

240
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,000
Abdominal support.  Your support which I ripped yesterday. I intend to compensate you for it.

241
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,430
I told you it was a corset. Corset. Corset.

242
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,810
Corset! How can he not remember that one little thing with that doctor head of his?

243
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,770
Excuse me. I think I can hear your thoughts.

244
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,470
Omo! I guess you have a stethoscope built into your ears.

245
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,730
So you're getting a new phone since you lost your phone anyway? Okay, hanging up now—

246
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,730
I will come to where you are right now.

247
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,390
Not where I am but come to where I will be in an hour or two, okay?

248
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Here!

249
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,970
Yes.

250
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,130
Give me twenty of these. These too.

251
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,990
Ah, please wait. Let me check our stock.

252
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,090
Yes.

253
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,370
What are you going to do with all that?

254
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,570
I feel bad about sending you two back by yourselves so I want you to take some things back with you at least.

255
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,750
Ah, yes. Oh, Hyung.

256
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,650
Hello? Did you hang up by any chance?

257
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,490
I'm sorry. I totally forgot. Looks good.

258
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,070
It's okay. It's my fault for forgetting my things in the first place.

259
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,330
Yes, yes. Okay.

260
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,270
What did he say? His voice seemed sexy.

261
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,650
- He's just dripping with sexiness. 
 - Aigoo!

262
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,230
How thankful! So where did that sexy guy tell you to meet him?

263
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,970
Hotel.

264
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,630
Joo Eun, that's a very good place!

265
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,070
How embarrassing!? Why am I living this way?

266
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,570
Are you totally embarrassed?

267
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,650
Well, in life, you can sometimes end up showing your stomach to a complete stranger of a man.

268
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:16,550
Think about way back when. A doctor who had never even held a woman's hand doing this and that—

269
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,210
Ugh, I can't even think about it.

270
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,790
I should have said it was nice seeing each other again.

271
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,750
Huh?

272
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,650
Something that's so easy to say, something that's such an obvious thing to say, why did I think of it now?

273
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,610
Are you talking about Oh Soo Jin?

274
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,670
Even if I couldn't tell her that she was prettier now and looked happy, I should have told her it was nice to see her.

275
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,610
She's a friend I haven't seen in a long time.

276
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,010
Silly girl.

277
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,070
Just because she transformed like that,

278
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,770
and I've changed this way, it's not like all the times we laughed together disappeared.

279
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,870
Why am I becoming not so nice?

280
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,190
Don't look.

281
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,150
You guys don't need to get out.

282
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,710
Secretary Min. A champion is in the car. Are only babies precious?

283
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,370
For now, you're not allowed to be alone.

284
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,530
I told you I'm only here for a short time on vacation and I will be going back.

285
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,970
All your personal possessions from America are crossing the Pacific Ocean right now.

286
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,310
Secretary Min.

287
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,470
How much—

288
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,750
We paid double of what they wanted to stop the publication,

289
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,430
and your resignation from the U.S. branch office is in progress.

290
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,830
Who knows about—

291
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:17,090
Only the president and I for now. The director probably doesn't know.

292
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,350
"Probably" means he'll find out soon enough.  Grandmother isn't answering her phone.

293
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,870
The president told me to tell you she'll not call you for the time being.

294
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,710
You know it's all a misunderstanding, since I can't come forward.

295
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,950
So, just until it gets quiet again—

296
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:46,550
The media will be happy to find out about it and the president and the director will both faint from shock.

297
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,770
The villa in Nonhyeon-dong has been renovated for you to use alone.

298
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,830
Yes. Yes.

299
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,950
I will see you tomorrow. Let's go.

300
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,770
I thought it was under the darkest lamp...

301
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,390
What is?

302
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,430
Our vacation. I think it's going to get extended.

303
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,150
I will get to the point since everyone is very busy.

304
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,970
I've known all of you for over twenty years

305
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,750
so I hope that you'll be understanding  about this oldie's mistake, at least once.

306
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,610
The only son of Gahong Foundation's chairman, Kim Seong Cheol,

307
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,030
and the only grandchild of this Lee Hong Im, the president of Gahong,

308
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,110
I've decided to bring Kim Yeong Ho, the US branch manager over to the company.

309
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,990
There is an order to how the company is run and such a thing as regulations.

310
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,590
That is a little...

311
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,310
The branch manager is very young

312
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,630
and we haven't had any interactions with him.

313
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,630
How to accept a successor whose face we don't even know...

314
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,070
This situation is a little disconcerting.

315
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,150
So that's why I prefaced it earlier with "I hope you'll be understanding", Chairman Choi.

316
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:42,090
He's a well known nobody so I've been lax about it, but we don't even know his face!

317
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,550
The branch manager Kim Yeong Ho, is he definitely going to be the chief of foundation?

318
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:54,010
We're only in the stage of discussing it, but knowing President Kim's stubbornness, it's worrisome.

319
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,670
Ah!

320
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,390
It's a problem.

321
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:02,930
Don't worry too much. If he had any interest in the company, he would have made his move sooner.

322
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,410
Right? We can't let a nobody become the king.

323
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:15,590
That would be an unfortunate history. We have to turn it inside out for once to make true history.

324
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,450
 Gahong Medical Service.
VIP Body Consulting Center 

325
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,330
 Yes. This is Im Woo Sik, the manager of Gahong Medical Service center.  

326
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,470
 You're certain Kim Yeong Ho  resigned as the U.S. branch manager.

327
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,910
Find out everything. Also if he's definitely in Korea or not.

328
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,350
His recent photos, schooling, and relationships. All of it.

329
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,530
No matter what, I'm always on your side.

330
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,830
Me too. Welcome Korea.

331
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,990
Hurry up and go in or the coach will have a fit that you're late again.

332
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,730
- See you later.
- We'll go in.

333
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,550
I love Korea!

334
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,090
 - Come to Illuso Hotel by 8 o'clock. I will politely decline the rose.   
 - Ah, what is this?

335
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,470
What the heck? Why isn't he coming?

336
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,730
Are you returning right now?

337
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,350
I should have brought Hyeon Woo's cell phone.

338
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,090
Hey, I told you to meet with the buyers. Do you feel sleepy right now?!

339
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,530
Hello? Yeah, the call ended.

340
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,490
What? Again...

341
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,190
Oh. What is it exactly?

342
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,390
Don't come.

343
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,730
Joo Eun!

344
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,650
Don't come.

345
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,130
Someone... Please save me.

346
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,690
Soo Jin, one moment.

347
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,480
Joo Eun...

348
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,700
She said not to come.

349
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,510
I'm really curious.

350
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,720
Are the words to save you your mantra?

351
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,360
Please.

352
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,520
I'm sorry, but I hold a blackbelt, so I can't hit him.

353
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,360
Please take me somewhere.

354
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,910
Where to?

355
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,330
As far away as we can get.  Outside of the world, if possible.

356
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,120
Let's go.

357
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,770
Get on board.

358
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,340
Let's go.

359
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:53,150
♬   Baby only you, the one and only you   ♬

360
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:00,630
♬   You are my darling you, darling you
You are my love.   ♬

361
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,650
♬   Because I didn't know love,   ♬

362
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,070
♬   that was easier for me   ♬

363
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:17,660
♬   Without knowing it, falling you, falling you,  I fell in  ♬

364
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,610
♬   I love you, love you, love you  ♬

365
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,370
What is this place?

366
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,010
A suite. My room.

367
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,080
But, why here?

368
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,900
I thought you wanted me to take you outside of the world.
♬   Baby only you   ♬

369
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,530
To you, being in a suite room alone with a man like me is probably outside of the world.

370
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,130
- Fine.
- Oh, fine?
♬   My darling you, you are my love   ♬

371
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:53,020
Open the door.  I want to at least take a look... at what it's like outside this world.

372
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,080
♬   The one and only you   ♬

373
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,530
♬   You're only my love
My unchanging love, darling you   ♬

374
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,940
Does it hurt?

375
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,430
Yes.

376
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,340
Does it hurt a lot?

377
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,010
It does.

378
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,600
Not your heart, your shoulder.

379
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,200
I don't need to know about your heart, but I should know about your shoulder.

380
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,510
It's fine.  I'll leave quickly.

381
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,150
Since you haven't gotten the hint, this must be your first time.

382
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,710
Eh?

383
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,080
- Do you want to do it on the sofa, or should we go to the bed?
- Huh?

384
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,160
Your shoulder is dislocated.

385
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:39,710
If possible, I ask that you scream in a way  which is appropriate for the hotel.

386
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,800
We haven't even started.

387
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,120
I'm not ready yet.

388
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,520
What do you mean, ready?  It only hurts in the beginning, then it will get better.

389
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,780
But...

390
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,880
It isn't going into place  because you keep moving!  Just a minute!

391
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,430
She's going to misunderstand us needlessly.

392
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,650
All we did was eat.

393
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,560
It just happens that you and Joo Eun are at the same law firm.

394
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,870
I don't know what to do.

395
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,080
Don't do anything.

396
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,850
I'll take care of it all, so don't do anything.

397
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,720
I hurt Joo Eun enough,

398
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,980
so I shouldn't hurt you.

399
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:36,350
Feeling like I've become the biggest b*tch doesn't feel bad.

400
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,190
Your revenge was quite pointed.

401
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,370
For ripping the corset.

402
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,110
If I were going to take revenge, it should be towards my ex-boyfriend.  Why would I do that?

403
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,240
He's already become your ex-boyfriend?

404
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,850
You haven't even once pulled his hair.  You're cooler than you look.

405
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,410
There are more than a few things about me that are different from how I look.

406
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,560
I don't even know where to start telling you about it.

407
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,970
That man looked familiar.

408
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,630
Did he?

409
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,360
He seemed totally unfamiliar to me.

410
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,880
Even if you get angry or want to curse, please stop for a moment.

411
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,970
Thank you.

412
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,720
- Are you an Eastern medicine doctor?
- Shhh...

413
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,680
I don't see patients.

414
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,710
Your body temperature is too low, and so is your pulse.

415
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,690
And also...

416
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,730
In any case, you must go to the hospital.

417
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,850
Get your shoulder checked.

418
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,040
Even if you look completely fine on the outside, it takes time to heal.

419
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,930
Since injuries are different from how they look on the outside.

420
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,950
I'll get going.

421
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,630
Thank you for everything.

422
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,530
Let's do that.

423
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,250
No.

424
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,340
I know that you're a softie to injured people, and even weaker towards endangered people.

425
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,320
You know that, but...?

426
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,150
He's probably waiting.

427
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:10,820
Let's go somewhere you can yell and I can get down on my knees.

428
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,880
My shoulder was just dislocated.

429
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,860
The person who fixed it told me not to overdo it.

430
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,120
Since the conclusion has been decided, let's end it quietly and simply.

431
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,260
Water, juice, or coffee... What do you want to start with?

432
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,470
I know that I have nothing to say even if you spray them all at once,

433
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,240
- but don't misunderstand.  Today is-
- If you want to talk about misunderstanding, then I'll start.

434
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Don't misunderstand.  Even though I was in a suite with that man, we don't have any kind of relationship.

435
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,990
It wasn't the right mood for that, right?

436
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,670
Right.

437
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,220
But why are you making excuses?

438
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,870
Even if you're just in the lobby with Soo Jin, it seems like a situation to be misunderstood,

439
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,970
but if I'm in a suite room with some man, that's not the case.

440
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,840
In your eyes, that's what I'm like now.

441
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,490
I don't think we even need to say that it's over.

442
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,440
Joo Eun.

443
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,210
The long connection we had, let's end it here.

444
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,770
But, are you injured?

445
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,110
That doesn't seem like something you should be asking.

446
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,900
Go.

447
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:34,100
- Soo Jin is—
- Ah, to Soo Jin, or to whomever!

448
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,390
I said to go.

449
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:43,140
I know I'm getting dumped by you, but I'm the one throwing away the feelings.

450
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,230
But I can't tell you to be happy for a long time.  I know because I've already experienced it.

451
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,380
Thank you.

452
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,650
Kang Joo Eun, you really did a big thing today.

453
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,200
Also, if I can make a shameless request at the moment of breaking up...

454
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,890
Soo Jin didn't do anything wrong, so...

455
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,500
Does this bastard want to die?

456
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,050
At the moment of our break up?

457
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,580
If you don't want to be die from dismemberment at this  moment, then just shut up.

458
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm a lawyer. Therefore—

459
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,840
Right. I know. I know better than anyone.

460
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,220
You wanted to become an intelligent and beautiful lawyer.

461
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,980
You wanted to become the Cinderella of the law, and so you did it.

462
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,500
But you... You lost too many things, Joo Eun.

463
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,620
Is that right?  But it's really a good thing for you that I became a lawyer.

464
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,240
My beauty may have crumbled but my intellect is still in excellent health.

465
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,980
That's why I'm bearing it with all the dignity and formality that I have.

466
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,660
Don't throw a lighter into the oil can, but shut up and get lost.  If possible, to the end of the world.

467
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,240
Just know that I feel as flustered as you do in this situation.

468
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,100
Let's go. I'll drive you back.

469
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,160
You want me to endure that hellish time?

470
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,160
Where do you need to go?

471
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,140
Customer?

472
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,160
Excuse me?

473
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,940
Where should I take you?

474
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,580
Ah.

475
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,870
To the airport.

476
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,920
Ahjusshi, I'm sorry, but could you turn the heat on?

477
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,940
 Use mine. 

478
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,160
 The thing that went down the drain back then, was it just my lipstick? 

479
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,840
 It's not because of me.That we're glad to see each other after a long time, should we say it's enough now? 

480
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,860
I acted elegant for no reason.  I should have just sprayed the coffee or juice in his face.

481
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,860
 Does it hurt?  Does it hurt a lot? 

482
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,400
 Even if you look fine on the outside, it takes time to heal. 

483
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,700
 I carefully folded your abdominal support and placed it inside your bag. 

484
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,620
Why won't this come off?

485
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:25,120
♬   Baby only you. The one and only you.  ♬

486
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,960
 The dream of wanting to be the Cinderella of the field of law, 
♬   You are my darling, you   ♬

487
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,800
 I need to be satisfied with just being in the field of law. 
♬   My darling, you, you are my love   ♬

488
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,600
 Why the Cinderella of the law field?  What does Cinderella have that you don't? 

489
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,120
 You have a mom and a younger sibling, and also 

490
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,340
 you have me.  Does she have dimples? 

491
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,540
 If a person falls for your dimples, there's no getting out. 
 Who can compare? 

492
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,760
 The first children's book my dad bought me was "Cinderella". 

493
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,480
 I liked the ending. 

494
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,180
 "And they lived happily ever after." 

495
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,000
 But I want to become a lawyer. 

496
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 So, who are "they"? 

497
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,820
 Me and... 

498
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,460
 - Did you think I was going to say it was you?
- It better be. 

499
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,380
♬   You are my love, woah  ♬

500
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,940
♬   My baby only you  ♬

501
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,280
 Since you've already moved past Cinderella it's fine. 

502
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,940
 It's far to the side of the law. 

503
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,860
♬  My human-like love,  ♬

504
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,240
 You raccoons over there! Really. 

505
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,980
 Stop right there!  I saw everything! 

506
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,160
 Aren't you going to put out that cigarette?! 

507
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,320
 The truth is, if you look at the Cinderella story through the law, 

508
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,880
 it will be probably be a tale that starts at surviving assault and spreads false information.  

509
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,480
 The words, "They lived happily ever after." 

510
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,500
 In reality, those words are just unamusing dog crap. 

511
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,840
Lawyer.

512
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,810
Nine o'clock is too early.

513
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:20,160
At nine-thirty, she could have had a meeting with the CEO.

514
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,500
At ten o'clock, okay.

515
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,840
Since she's human, she could have gone to the bathroom or had something else to take care of.

516
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,520
At eleven o'clock, because she was feeling a bit sorry, she could have hesitated.

517
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,340
Lawyer.

518
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,060
But she should have been here by twelve o'clock.

519
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,920
What's going on?

520
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,920
That's what I'm saying.  What the heck is going on here?

521
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,800
You saw me that day in the restaurant bathroom, right?

522
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,980
No way, I didn't know that woman was you.

523
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,830
Hey, Oh Soo Jin.  So you're saying it was just a coincidence that had nothing to do with Woo Sik?

524
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,720
I guess a "previous engagement" would be the accurate expression, and the bathroom was just coincidence.

525
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Do you have more to say?

526
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,760
I guess you do.

527
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,180
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

528
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,140
Just make it something like this sirloin steak. 
 (Korean word for sirloin sounds similar to the word for idiot) 

529
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:44,420
It's the thickest steak in our store so I'm especially recommending it for someone with such thick skin (brazen-faced).

530
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,780
I'll just have a green salad. No dressing.

531
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,680
If you hold the dressing, what taste are you eating your food for?

532
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,340
Do you eat food for the taste?

533
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,080
I'm going to chat with Joo Eun.  If you're done taking our order, then...

534
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,960
This girl, seriously.

535
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,340
Lee Hyeon Woo, this is your place of business.

536
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,120
You should spray some water and break some dishes.

537
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,240
Isn't that the fun of running a business?  Huh?

538
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,880
Hmmm, Joo Eun?

539
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,610
Misbehavior and commotion, it's all welcome today.

540
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,880
Just... Fighting!

541
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,200
Hyeon Woo is just as fiery as ever.

542
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,440
Do you think we'll even be able to swallow our food?

543
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,240
Still, we need to swallow it.

544
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,710
The longer you're hungry, it makes you overeat.  It's not good for your body.

545
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,000
And it makes you gain weight.

546
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:03,350
Soo Jin. Oh Soo Jin.

547
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,240
Tell me.

548
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,900
Did I do something wrong to you?

549
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,900
Did you come to apologize earlier?

550
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,720
Hey, Oh Soo Jin.  I think you've forgotten,

551
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,220
spiteful talk, straight talk, hypothetical talk, and indecent talk. They are all my specialty.

552
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,480
So you should be sorry, or explain, or something.

553
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,840
Woo Sik told me not to do anything.

554
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,700
He said he would take care of it.

555
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,560
An explanation?  Let's see.

556
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,980
You should know better that it's not possible to explain why  a man and a woman's eyes meet.

557
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,340
On moral responsibility... I acknowledge.

558
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:05,100
As of yet, I haven't done anything to be sorry for, so I'm not so sure about apologizing either.

559
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,560
By any chance, if I say I'm sorry, will it be any different?

560
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,360
You, seriously.

561
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,400
After turning over a new leaf, you think this world seems funny and do I look easy?

562
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,220
Come to your senses. I'm Kang Joo Eun.

563
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,740
Did we go on a time machine?

564
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,140
Well, I do understand.

565
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,060
It's not like I don't know the Kang Joo Eun of the past.

566
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:44,700
I'm sorry to say this, but you're the one who should come to their senses.

567
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,920
What?

568
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,560
Your beauty that used to focus the attention of the world,

569
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,620
the Woo Sik that was loyal to you, and the times when you could do anything you put your mind to?

570
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,740
Everything you like was back there, but not me.  Everything I like is here.

571
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,700
So... If you want to get in a time machine, go by yourself.

572
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:11,500
Apology has ended.

573
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:17,300
Are you doing this to me

574
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,470
because of what happened with Lee Ji Hoon?

575
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,260
Who?

576
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,460
Girl, that was so long ago.

577
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,130
I'll pay the bill, since I do feel like a pirate.

578
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,250
Because of Lee Ji Hoon?

579
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,850
I was so crazy about him...

580
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,420
 Welcome to the second half of Lee Ji Hoon's "Our Beautiful Young Life." 

581
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,110
 Today's "What I want to say to you" corner will be delivered  

582
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,860
 by the youthful voice of Oh Soo Jin. Hello. 

583
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,280
 Hello. 

584
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,600
 I'm a bit on the fat side. 

585
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,280
 Why is she saying those kinds of things? You should've announced Ji Hoon is all yours to the world. 

586
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,500
 I don't have many friends. 

587
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,920
 There is a friend who first approached someone like me. 

588
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,710
 This is what that friend said,  

589
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:51,390
 the reason people gain weight is because they're lonely or in pain 

590
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,270
 or both 

591
00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:01,240
 so it seems like you're lonely or in pain  

592
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,940
 or both. 

593
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,660
 That's what I want to say to you. 

594
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,590
 Thank you for staying by my side! 

595
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,130
 Kim Dong Ryul sings, "Saying I Love You." 

596
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,330
 Good job, Soo Jin. 

597
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:31,960
 - Soo Jin!
- Soo Jin! 

598
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:01,010
 Are we on a time machine? What you like might be there, but it's not for me. 

599
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:06,100
 What I like is all here. I think you need to get your head on straight. 

600
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,170
Ma'am!

601
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,300
Omo!

602
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,070
Ms. Lawyer, should I call security?

603
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,980
He's someone I know.

604
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,500
Someone she knows.

605
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,830
But, what brings you here, Ji Woong?

606
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,150
I was worried about you and also have something to see you about.

607
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:39,740
But... Ma'am, why were you ignoring my texts?

608
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,890
 Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am, busy? Ma'am, where are you? 

609
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,340
I've been so busy, so I wasn't able to check.

610
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,310
Please do me a favor.

611
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,280
These are agent and sponsor contracts.

612
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,160
Ah, this is the kind of work you do.

613
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,470
I'll look them over. By the way.

614
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,970
Thank you so much for that day on the plane.

615
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,840
Oh, no, no, no!

616
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,230
You and I are fated. Destiny.

617
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:24,460
See? We even met today!

618
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,700
But, you came to find me.

619
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,200
It doesn't matter.

620
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:41,140
What is this? If you eat this, Ma'am, you'll hurt more.

621
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,450
Ma'am, your nice face will go away.

622
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,870
Do you know Jennifer Anderson?

623
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:59,480
Oh, the one that came out on the Stella Show and completely transformed and had her destiny unwind... No.

624
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,730
The one who found her new life...

625
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,820
You see, Jennifer Anderson became totally happy.

626
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,940
Now she's the queen of queens.

627
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,350
You can do it too. Why not?

628
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:18,670
 - Delivery!
- Anyone home?
- Your food is here! 

629
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,930
Who is it?

630
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:33,610
 It's the downstairs apartment. I'll leave the package that arrived for you here.  

631
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,600
Ah, yes. Thank you.

632
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,120
 Seoul One Heart Hospital Emergency Room 

633
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,780
Yes?

634
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,960
It's been a long time.

635
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:09,730
 For now only myself and the President. The Director will probably not know about it. 

636
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,130
Have you come as the director?

637
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,770
And if I came as your father?

638
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,740
It must be a quite urgent matter.

639
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:25,290
From seeing that you're joking around, life must be well worth living there.

640
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,790
Director Jung will go to the American Branch.

641
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:34,370
Did the President call you in?

642
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,230
I'm asking if you want me to clear the seat.

643
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:52,280
I don't really like to sit in the seat so I'm wrestling with it.

644
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,120
Aren't you too old to behave like a spoiled child?

645
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,620
 We're sending you your personal items that you left in the ambulance. 

646
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:16,020
 Wear this. You look like a chubby rabbit. 

647
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,680
 Visa

648
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,050
 Press ID Card J Kim 

649
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,530
John Kim?

650
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,290
 Are you a professional athlete? 

651
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,460
 I'm a manager and trainer. Really famous. 

652
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,250
 Stella Show
 You can forget that woman of the past. 

653
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,340
 Jennifer Anderson became totally happy. 

654
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:14,790
 In truth, he made Jennifer. John Kim, he completed her.  

655
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,760
 You can do it too. Why not? 

656
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,520
 Trainer Ji Woong 

657
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,040
Whoa!

658
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,910
Ma'am, what's up?

659
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,330
Promise me that you'll only tell me the truth.

660
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,670
John Kim, right?

661
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,970
What?

662
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,250
John Kim. Right?

663
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,670
That's right.

664
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,260
John Kim.

665
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,500
