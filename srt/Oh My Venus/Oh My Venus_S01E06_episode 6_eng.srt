1
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,860
 Episode 6 
Ah! My arms and legs!

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,580
Who doesn't at least look this pretty as a Westerner?

3
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,980
For an Asian, I'm pretty in Western looks too!

4
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,520
How many days is he going to stay?

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,740
Just go live with Anna in America.

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,340
 08:15, November 15, 2014 

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,940
Eight... Nine...

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,200
Ten...

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,800
Eleven... Asa! You're doing well.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,230
Twelve...

11
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,210
Did everyone go somewhere?

12
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,170
What is this? You scared me.

13
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,610
It's not like you're a thief. Seriously...

14
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,450
Please help me up.

15
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,070
This...

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,260
is something I haven't seen.

17
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,020
Ah! What are you doing to my cheek?

18
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,150
Ah. This, this, this. When did you get it?

19
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,900
What, did you think I picked it up off the street?

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,340


21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,330
You put on make up.

22
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,620
Do you have someone whom you want to look good for?

23
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,840
It's s-sun cream. I didn't want to get burned from the florescent lights.

24
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,800
Ow! Oh, my body!

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,090
Maybe I exercised too much. My whole body hurts.

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,890
My face became half in size.

27
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,920
The fat is usually lost from the top.

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Your belly is still...

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,790
I told you that my face became half. Did I talk about any other place?

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Hearing your bright voice after all this time is nice.

31
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,230
I guess you enjoyed your vacation in America, huh? Your face was also halved in sizel, Hyungnim Yeong Ho.

32
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,230
Well... You could say the time was meaningful and valuable for me,

33
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,520
because  the entire period was a moment I had been anticipating.

34
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,480
You rascal! Come over here!

35
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,980
Ah. His name is Rascal.

36
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,020
This Rascal.

37
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,370
I will flatten you!

38
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,940
That rascal is going to die today.

39
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,730
Keep it up.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,490
Rascal! Huh?

41
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,050
What did you do there? You aren't going to answer?

42
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,630
 My opinion on the tumor is that 

43
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,130
 you're 99.99% cured. 

44
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,690
 It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that it's a miracle. 

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,300
 The Strength In Time Spent Alone 

46
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,090
A meaningful and valuable time?

47
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,920
All the moments he's been anticipating? Hah!

48
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,570
So he did have a comfortable and racy night, huh.

49
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,240
What is this?

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,100
What is?

51
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,070
This.

52
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,840
I thought the "prodigal son" who has returned should have some home-made food.

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,530
Even though I am regretting it a bit now.

54
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,850
I don't eat carbs. Also, I eat low to no salt.

55
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,370
Home made rice is by nature like that.

56
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,860
Spicy, sweet, salty, sour, and hot.

57
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,830
That is a meal and it is delicious.

58
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,580
Who cares if you're dripping in sexiness when there's no flavor in your life?

59
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,320
But what is this?

60
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,000
This.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,920
It's a table cover. Moms use it when they don't want to set the table twice.

62
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,650
Your mom didn't do that for you?

63
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,530
You must have grown up being very catered to.

64
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,700
Today is my first time seeing this.

65
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,600
I will go wash up and get a massage.

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,250
It is good to get a massage from a guy. Then...

67
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,860
 Just a little bit lower. 

68
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,150
 Time! 

69
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,490
Don't go to the massage.

70
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,630
What?

71
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,970
What is he saying? I'm so achy.

72
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,420
Black knight. 
 (Heukgisa:  A black knight to saves a woman at the crucial moment.) 

73
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,950
Then, Hyungnim Yeong Ho will?

74
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,430
Ah. I'm in pain from head to toe.

75
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,470
Are you okay with that?

76
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
Deal.

77
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,410
Ah. I don't know if I washed my feet today.

78
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,460
Ah, this is my first time dancing with my shoulders without a drop of alcohol in me.

79
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,260
For that area, he's better than me.

80
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,140
What is this?

81
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh. The visual was somewhat mountainous,

82
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,320
and I thought it might become a comfortable and racy night again.

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,690
Please turn up the volume.

84
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,920
What is up today?

85
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,810
 Thank you for watching. 

86
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,780
Please turn this off for me.

87
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,390
There is still some time left.

88
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,210
Aigo, it feels good. Stop.

89
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,060
Stop.

90
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,640
You keep speaking to me without honorifics. To Mr. Coach who's like the heavens to you.

91
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,280
When did I?

92
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,580
Instead of a vertical, upper and lower type of a relationship,

93
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,620
how about a horizontal... equal... kind ofâ€”

94
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,490
Kind of?

95
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,830
Like a friend.

96
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,710
Chingoo? 
 (Friend) 

97
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,120
Ah.  "Chin" as in "near" and "goo" as in "mouth" kind of a chin-goo  (Near Mouth) ?

98
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,550
Mother-in-law, are you uncomfortable somewhere?

99
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,390
No.

100
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,690
Go and get some rest now.

101
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll give you a massage.

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,710
No. You don't have to worry about this kind of stuff.

103
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,410
Taking care of you is my job.

104
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,890
People outside have said to me.

105
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,220
Even though her only daughter died, all she worries about is her company.

106
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,930
She's a vicious oldie who picks at the spine (use for selfish gain) of her son-in-law by marrying him off.

107
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,320
She's a spiteful person who brought in an innocent person to wait on her hand and foot.

108
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,860
- Mother-in-law 
 - The sound of that, too,

109
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,360
whenever I hear it, gives me indigestion.

110
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeong Joon is smart and well-mannered. You raised him well.

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,260
It's... all thanks to youâ€”

112
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,860
Help Yeong Joon finish his studies well.

113
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,180
Don't think about anything else, and don't make him dream about something else.

114
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,040
 "After that, I realized I could turn the loneliness I felt in those times into a tremendous source of energy." 

115
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,240
 Gahong University Hospital 

116
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,060
Hyungnim!

117
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,160
Long time no see! Hello!

118
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,880
Hyung, I missed you!

119
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,730
I heard from Hyung Joon Seong. Now you aren't sick anymore, right?

120
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,600
You feel good, right?

121
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,380
The gods must have listened to my prayers!

122
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,550
Thank you, God! Thank you, God, for helping my Yeong Ho.

123
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,420
Yeong Ho Hyungnim.

124
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,040
By chance, did you see Ma'am?

125
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,940
Daegu Venus wasn't a lie. Now, totally...

126
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,180
But... These. These are too bad. They were cute.

127
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
Where's Joon Seong?

128
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,560
Hyung left first.

129
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,880
Hyung, the champion also has his privacy.

130
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,220
 Choi Soon Jang refused to meet. I am sorry.  

131
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,020
 Where are you now?  

132
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,300
Where have you been all this time that you're just crawling in now?!

133
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,470
You know I was working and just got home. The neighbors will complain.

134
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,640
- Complain? You're going to need a beating tonight.
 - I'm sorry.

135
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,940
Come here. You need a beating today. Come here!

136
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,600
Don't get distracted. Unless you want your hair shaved off.

137
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes. Good night, Hyung.

138
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,240
Thank you for being all better.

139
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,700
Don't be cutesy with me. Hurry up and get some sleep.

140
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,450


141
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,420
Hyung, wake up. Wake up.

142
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,300
It's not the showtime yet. What's with the weigh-in?

143
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,860
Today's Ma'am's weigh-in.

144
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,060
Ma'am, come on.

145
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,760
Ma'am?

146
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,560
Wait a minute. Restroom...Pee...

147
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,310
I went already. I didn't even drink water all day.

148
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,680
Ms. Lawyer, fighting!

149
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,320
Oh, let's see.

150
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Woah!

151
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
Wow! You're 62.2 kg! (approx 137 pounds).

152
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,600
Oh! You did it!

153
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,700
Yeah!

154
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,800
This is thanks to you all

155
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:19,320
and to the world-famous trainer, John Kim, who gave me remote support from far away during his very busy schedule.

156
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,900
What are you guys doing?

157
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Are you entering the RFC? What's with the weigh-in this early in the morning?

158
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,860
Didn't you  tell Hyungnim Yeong Ho?

159
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,900
What? What on earth is it?

160
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,840
You said you'd take responsibility for it.

161
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,840
We said if Ma'am lost 15 kilograms,

162
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,540
we would fulfill her wish.

163
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,220
Congrats. Go do it. I am going to sleep.

164
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,530
We said that all three of us would fulfill it.

165
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,360
All for one, one for all.

166
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,880
It happened like that, Hyung.

167
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,730
What is your wish?

168
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,760
Living like Kang Joo Eun for just one day.

169
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,680
Without complaining.

170
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,420
Hey.

171
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,240
HEY!

172
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,420
So. For the whole day, you want all of us to live haphazardly?

173
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,120
There's malice to your purpose.

174
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,950
What do you mean live haphazardly? Haphazardly?

175
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,570
The purpose is to add more happiness to our lives

176
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,520
and enjoy the relaxation and sweetness.

177
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,360
Eat tons of sweet and salty stuff and lie around you mean.

178
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,960
Thyroidism is a given, but obesity, fatty tissue, gastritis, and cholesterol!

179
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,760
Don't you see my face? It's become completely thin.

180
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,160
Kang Joo Eun, only your body is mine. Your face is so so.

181
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,540
I've been a wicked and dangerous woman up until now.  That, I acknowledge.

182
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,770
- So... 
- No, no, no.

183
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,830
So, Mr. Coach.

184
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,440
So,&nbsp;Mr. Coach, I knew you would do this so I prepared this.

185
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,770
Not only am I known to be meticulous, but I'm also thorough.

186
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,630
My blood test report. It is better, right?

187
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,970
The red light went off, but the green light hasn't come on.

188
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,390
In this world, there aren't just red or green lights.

189
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,510
There are yellow lights too.

190
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,770
He told me I could eat whatever I wanted for just a day.

191
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,000
I heard it loud and clear while totally awake.

192
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,660
What? Do you want me to submit a doctor's written opinion?

193
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,620
 Jung Yeong Hwa Obstetrics 

194
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,400
How did you know you can get your blood test done through an obstetrician?

195
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,900
Oh my... In-ter-net!

196
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,880
Deal?

197
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,220
Okay, deal.

198
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,580
Oh my, oh!

199
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,200
Hey! With a lot of whipping cream.

200
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Mint chocolate macchiato, single Americano, and cafe mocha.

201
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
This is the one with a lot of whipping cream.

202
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,440
- Yes. 
- Enjoy.

203
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,080
Ah. Amid all this, who's the one that's having a single Americano right now?

204
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,520
Let's not think about the body today. Just think of me. Kang Joo Eun's day.

205
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,940
Excessive thinking about the body. This is your first warning.

206
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,980
Since you've already ordered it, I'll let it slide just this once.

207
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,400
How long has it been? Oh.

208
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,760
See you guys later.

209
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,620
Just let her for once. Ms. Lawyer really tried hard.

210
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,440
It was a total human victory. She was like Rocky.

211
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,320
Ma'am deserves it.

212
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,740
As if someone would like it, she lost only the fat from her face. Seriously.

213
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,520
Kang Joo Eun's day?

214
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,840
Keep going. Keep going. It isn't here. Stop!

215
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,420
Play.

216
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,420
 As I thought, it was worth going all the way to America.  This is it!

217
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,540
Are you sure that it is John Kim's house?

218
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,240
If the Hollywood news is wrong, it's all on them.

219
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,820
What should the title be?

220
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,700
Veiled in mystery, star trainer, John Kim.

221
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,520
Will he finally be unveiled?

222
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,970
Take out the question mark. This calls for an exclamation point. 10,000 of them.

223
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,750
But, do you think it will be okay?

224
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,450
If it's not okay, then he can sue us.

225
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,420
We can at least see John Kim's face that way.

226
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,170
If he is Asian, he will be one of the three (Chinese, Korean, Japanese). I'm betting on the 33.3%.

227
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,080
When the person who knows that house comes forward, then the veil gets stripped off.

228
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,060
- Good morning, everyone. 
 - Good morning.

229
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,590
- Yes, yes. Good morning to you as well. 
- Yes, good morning.

230
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,430
It was a good morning until just a moment ago.

231
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,200
CEO, good morning.

232
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,420
- Aren't you concentrating too much only on your diet? 
 - Pardon?

233
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,000
The daughter of Myung Hoon Electronics' President, huh?

234
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,260
Oh, you know. That house call lawyer case.

235
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,560
I heard our Vice CEO was working on that case by herself.

236
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
That...

237
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,510
Anyway, I already informed her.

238
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,720
CEO, you said you have a meeting?

239
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,670
Ah, that's right. We'll discuss it further once I return from the meeting, but you'll have to make it your priority.

240
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,270
Please lead the team well.

241
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,670
- Yes. 
 - Then.

242
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,490
Vice CEO, good morning.

243
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,990
Lawyer Kang, please come to my room.

244
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,170
I guess you went on a diet.

245
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,270
Your face keeps getting more and more...

246
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,140
Well, it isn't like the face is one you haven't seen before.

247
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,040
Are you dating?

248
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,620
You are the one who is dating, Vice CEO.

249
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,220
Please have a passionate love.

250
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,240
Let's get to the point. Did the chicken come first,

251
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,190
- or did the egg come first?
- Excuse me?

252
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,880
From the chicken's perspective, the chicken must have come first.

253
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,130
And from the egg's perspective, the egg must have come first.

254
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,240
Seriously, do you go to a school for learning jokes, Vice CEO?

255
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,720
It's a lawsuit for broadcasting copyrights.

256
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,360
As much as our country lacks in the culture of origin,

257
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,480
it will become quite a difficult and tedious case.

258
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,070
Please search for precedents first and prepare.

259
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,730
If it's quite a difficult and tedious case, then it's not like we don't have time.

260
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,730
Then why did you have to call me on this good morning?

261
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,790
Because I don't have time.

262
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,700
Then work hard.

263
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,430
The room is disgustingly nice.

264
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,140
â™¬ The waters of the East Sea and Mt. Baekdu

265
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,430
â™¬ dry out

266
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,850
  Living like Kang Joo Eun for just one day.  

267
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,720
 Without complaining. 

268
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,930
â™¬ Giving all loyalty, in suffering and joy

269
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:45,910
â™¬ Love our country.

270
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,800
You haven't memorized the fourth verse yet?

271
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,740
I keep forgetting the intro to the fourth verse.

272
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,420
Give it to me.

273
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,200
 Marine Corps Questions To Be Expected 
 - Cuckoo Ji Woong! Introduce your family or brag about them. Begin!

274
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,130
Yes, sir.

275
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,550
In the Korean War, my maternal Grandfather

276
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,650
was in the Marine Corps.  Whoo!  A totally cool guy!

277
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,260
Allegiance!

278
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,060
My Mom is a Korean and totally strong.

279
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,670
She's pretty, and spanks well. But don't worry. I am good.

280
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:25,070
And I am half Korean. My father is Chinese.

281
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,500
Oh, it is My Venus. Wait a minute, sir.

282
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,590
Thank you all non-complainers.

283
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,020
Kang Joo Eun's day mission.  Mission?

284
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,290
This darned Daegu Venus, seriously.

285
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,960
To put it simply, while in the world's most comfortable position, don't do anything.

286
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,690
Also known as, playing dead.

287
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:01,700
Playing dead?  Ah!  Staying completely still?

288
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I am back.

289
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,690
Where did you come back from, Jang Joon Seong?

290
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,760
- If you get distracted.
- You'll shave my hair off.

291
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,560
Now you look like an athlete.

292
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,120
Hurry, play dead.  Hurry, hurry, play dead.

293
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,460
Okay? Okay? Okay.

294
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,700
Okay.

295
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:46,050
Okay, good. There are still no. 2, no. 3, no. 4 left.

296
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,580
 No. 2, watch a romantic movie and try to feel it as much as you can.  

297
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,780
Are you crying? I am going crazy.

298
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:15,940


299
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,000
 Hey, hey!  I told you not to go near any exercise equipment, no matter what. 

300
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,970
 Mr. Joon Seong. 

301
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,460
 Come out. 

302
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,800
 Number 3: Take a nap.  A deep sleep, like you're sleeping at night. 

303
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,140
 Deep sleep. 

304
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,280
  Kim Yeong Ho 

305
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,710
As expected, you are Star Im! Huh?

306
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,220
I wouldn't have recognized him.  He looks completely different from when he was little.

307
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,200
We have no choice other than bringing CEO Choi Jun Ho to our side.

308
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,400
That depends on the skill of the leader.  Let's get working on that gently.

309
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,020
He will probably want a large number of company shares.

310
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:43,690
In the end, life is just a 49% vs. 51% game.

311
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,200
Give away one thing you value, and gain just two back and you win.

312
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,590
Let's quietly watch how it unfolds while we try to make contact with CEO Choi.

313
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,170
Yes.

314
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,640
  Your call can't be connected.  

315
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,550
 Where are you?  

316
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,630
 Where did you learn those crappy manners?  

317
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,690
I am sorry.

318
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,580
I'm so sick and tired of the media and the reporters.

319
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,390
Why is a lawyer showing up here and stressing me out?

320
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,070
Can you please give us a minute?

321
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,480
Who are you that you told her to go?

322
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,860
What are you? You said you were a lawyer.

323
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,140
I'm Geondoo Law firm's Vice CEO,

324
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,900
Oh Soo Jin.

325
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,870
My lawyers came to see you but you told them to call the CEO.

326
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,670
Is a Vice CEO the CEO? What a joke of a law firm.

327
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,550
Because CEO has a really important meeting now.

328
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,670
Are you kidding me? I am the daughter of Myeong Hoon Electronics.

329
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,050
I heard my dad gave a lot of money to your company.

330
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,450
No matter how much money you give, you can't win against the media.

331
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,380
What are you talking about?

332
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,360
Assaulting the employees at the department store is something that's already happened, and

333
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,430
even though it is something that everyone in the world knows,

334
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,230
if you continue to frequent the spas for massage or the plastic surgeon, while being confined,

335
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,840
we have no way of blocking the media.

336
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,510
Blocking the media is your job.

337
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,180
You are a lawyer, right? You will do everything if I give you money, right?

338
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,690
Then I should get more money from your father.

339
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,200
Just because your face is acceptable, you're pretending to be so tough! Huh?

340
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,290
No matter what, in the end, you people live off my money!

341
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,370
They really did. Cute.

342
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,340
You are working overtime today as well?

343
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,100
No. Go. I will finish up and go home.

344
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,820
Yes.

345
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,980
Ms. Lawyer, please stop losing. You will die if you keep this up.

346
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,220
I feel like I'm going to die also, but I have a lot of things to be careful about because of my thyroid.

347
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,280
Oh I see.

348
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,060
At the hospital, they said I have a lot of muscle in comparison to my weight.

349
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,880
See you tomorrow.

350
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,880
How long has it been since I've had a dinner banquet?

351
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,560
 The store is in the middle of renovations. 

352
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,360
We're going to starve to death, Min Joon.

353
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,300
Eat this.

354
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Why did you do the construction today of all days?

355
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,080
Mom, give Aunt a little something at least.

356
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,820
Aunt is hungry.

357
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,000
Watch your manners. Go practice for the year-end talent show. Hurry!

358
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,340
Seriously.

359
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,500
He takes after his father, so he has no rhythm.  Seriously.

360
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,340
You just had to eat on the first day of renovation since the business started.  I don't even have anything to eat at home.

361
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,800
In any case, we're not in sync.

362
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,840
That's right.  We've been together for 16 years because we're not in sync.

363
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,780
But you... Your face has the same feel as the past.

364
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,880
My body will get better soon.

365
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,560
My passion surpasses that of when I was studying for exams.

366
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,740
Sheesh, you always failed.  What are you talking about?

367
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,420
You're raining on my parade.  Sheesh.

368
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,180
You don't even have any friends because of your nasty temper.  Just where are you staying?

369
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,580
There's a person with an even nastier temper.

370
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,420
Well... He's not a friend, but something similar?

371
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,000
 Ah. "Chin" as in "near" and "goo" as in "mouth" kind of a chin-goo  (Near Mouth) ?) 

372
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,460
Never mind, don't worry about it.  I'm worried that I'll get kicked out.

373
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,220
You, by chance, with that guy dripping in sexiness...

374
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,900
Is there something going on with that man?

375
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,920
What's the use in radiating sexiness when he exudes rudeness and bad temper.

376
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,180
There are a lot of rooms, and it's like a boarding house.  There are other men there too.

377
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,680
Guys? Wow. Someone is living with guys and someone will

378
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,520
say, "Hallelujah!" when they are told that child support will be increased.

379
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,360
Did PD Go do what he was going to do?

380
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,520
He went to America. He found out about John Kim's house.

381
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,620
- What?! 
- What's wrong?

382
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,800
Wait, how did PD Go find out?  Is he sure?  Did he see John Kim going into that house?

383
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,260
If he did then there would have been a commotion.

384
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,820
He said it is all interviews with his acquaintances. Only 30% can be true.

385
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,080
  John Kim. 

386
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,180
He really... plays in a worldly way.

387
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,340
  Ji Woong 

388
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,460
Ji Woong, put me on the speaker.

389
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,660
 Everybody, stop! 

390
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,160
 Please put down the organic veggies and unseasoned meat immediately.  

391
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,320
  Living like Kang Joo Eun. Meal mission.  

392
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,320
  Eating out. That's it. End.  

393
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,140
If eating out, restaurant?

394
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,860
Ma'am must want to become a princess.  I'm going to wear a suit.

395
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,020
Everybody, huh?  Formal style.  Ooh, ooh, formal style.

396
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,050
 Manna Flour Based Food 

397
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,160
Is this a little too much?

398
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,500
- Let go.
- It's just one day.

399
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,280
Ms. Lawyer worked really hard to lose weight.

400
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,120
Is losing weight something to brag about?  Losing weight is good for her.

401
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,540
Hyungnim, I'm totally proud of Ma'am.

402
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,220
I can't eat flour.

403
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:31,210


404
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,560
What are you doing? Eat quickly.

405
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,400
It looks delicious.

406
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,670
Hyung, it's really delicious.

407
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,430
Then I'll just have a little bit, since I've watching my weight.

408
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,150
If it were me, I would have gone up a weight class.

409
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,310
- Put it down.
- Try it.  It's incredible.

410
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,600
I am okay because I know what it tastes like.

411
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,960
You wouldn't know as much as me.

412
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,500
- Hyung, I'm sorry. 
- Sorry, because today is Kang Joo Eun day.

413
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,640
See you guys tomorrow.

414
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,720
Open your mouth.  Say, "Aaaah".

415
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,230
Goal in!

416
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,120
I don't eat carbs. Oh, salty.

417
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,620
Just eat it for one day only. How can a person live without eating carbs?

418
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,240
So you're not a princess, but the fairy of stuffing your face?

419
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,500
Well, you don't have to go as far as saying I'm a fairy.

420
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:59,440
Okay. The next step is to take a picture.

421
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,380
I guess you've prepared, huh?

422
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,700
Here, here, get together.  We're going to make one person look good.

423
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,000
Hyung, quickly, scrunch your face.  Hurry up.

424
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,320
No matter how much I scrunch it, I'll probably be much prettier.

425
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,500
Alright, ddeokbokki!

426
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,150
Im star, do you play golf?

427
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,760
I'm still a beginner.

428
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,500
Hey man, golf is fundamental to business.  Let's go play sometime.

429
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
Yes.

430
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,840
Hey man, why are you being like that?  Answer it.

431
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,560
Excuse me.

432
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,920
Yes, I am Im Woo Sik.

433
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,080
  Yes, here is the Gangnam Police.  

434
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,900
For what reason would the police call me?

435
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,660
Yes, I understand.

436
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,180
What it is?  Did you drive drunk?

437
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,840
It is nothing.

438
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:03,240
With the upcoming undertaking, you have to be careful with your body, mind, mouth, women.  Be careful with everything.

439
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,020
Yes, Director.

440
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,480
 OH!  Soo Jin 

441
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
Yes, Soo Jin.

442
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,880
Where are you?

443
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,740
I am at the office.

444
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,100
Still? When will you finish?

445
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,120
I think it will take a while. I am busy.

446
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,480
Oh yeah? Okay. Work hard.

447
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,640
  I will call you.  

448
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,680
You're here.

449
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,440
I am Lawyer Yang Gyeong Joon.

450
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,420
I am Im Woo Sik. An assault?

451
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,660
- Are you denying it right now?
- That's not it.

452
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:10,420
On the afternoon of November 17, 2014, my client received injuries that lasted three weeks.

453
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,140
Afterwards, it is said that there were threats.

454
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,240
Threat?

455
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,300
  If you trying doing that one more time to Kang Joo Eun, you will die by my hand.  

456
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,760
  Since you've watched us, you should know what kind of right I have.  

457
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,380
  Stay away from Kang Joo Eun. It isn't a warning but an order.  

458
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,400
My client recorded it with his cell phone.

459
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,160
"You will die by my hand. Get lost. It isn't a warning but an order."

460
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,500
To an ordinary citizen, it's enough to seem like a threat.

461
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,440
It's not something to just pass over.

462
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,120
Don't you have a lawyer you know?

463
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
 Here. 

464
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,000
I am Im Wook Sik's lawyer, Oh Soo Jin.

465
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,900
  Geondoo 

466
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,990
â™¬ I'm Oscar, born as a rose.

467
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,430
â™¬ In passion and glamour,

468
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,410
â™¬ I'm going to live--

469
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,720
That's right.  You need to have something stuck in your teeth to make you want to brush your teeth.

470
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:38,290
â™¬    I'm Oscar, born as a rose.  â™¬
 Geondoo Vice CEO 

471
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,690
At this hour?

472
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,750
What does she want to say to aggravate me?

473
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,690
Did I eat too much?

474
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,070
Because I have a PT tomorrow. (personal training)

475
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,960
â™¬     I'm Oscar, born as a rose.  â™¬

476
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,900
â™¬    In passion and glamour,  â™¬

477
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,800
 Geondoo Vice CEO 

478
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,710
What is it at this time?

479
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,590
At the police station?

480
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,600
The witness is here.

481
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,250
It's been 15 years...

482
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,610
Yes.

483
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,950
They were both each other's first love. When they had a romantic relationship for 15 years,

484
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,400
they wouldn't normally become strangers, just because they broke up.

485
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,360
I could  go crazy.

486
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,090
But if a man you didn't know

487
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,770
was stalking and putting your ex-girlfriend in danger,

488
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,630
it seems like a normal enough consideration.

489
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,900
Besides, the assault wasn't severe enough to be charged.

490
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,690
Of course, I request an investigation of the hospital that issued the diagnosis.

491
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,720
The thing is, since there isn't enough evidence regarding the stalking,

492
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,380
I thought it might be helpful  if the witness...

493
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,660
The one who requested the security camera footage.  You know, that person.

494
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,380
The person that is like your guardian, is it correct that you two were together?

495
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,250
It has nothing to do with him.

496
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,060
You haven't already called him, right?

497
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,470
I've arrived, the witness.

498
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,030
Hey, Soo Jin.

499
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,790
I think you two will have more to talk about than me.

500
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,390
I will go first.

501
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,400
Ah, really.

502
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,070
Your face looks good.

503
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,310
My face is half the size it was.  Does this face look good to you?

504
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,800
Why did you do it?

505
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,360
I am sorry. I went a bit overboard

506
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,460
just in case there was no one by your side.

507
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,520
It was something like sympathy.

508
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,530
The reason that there is no one by my side is all because of you.

509
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,470
How could you pity me?

510
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,300
Should I pretend not to know you just because we broke up?

511
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,930
Even if it happened to a person passing by, I would have helped them.  You shouldn't overreact.

512
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,900
I am grateful to death. Okay?

513
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,980
Do you know who that guy is?

514
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,780
What did you just say?

515
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,800
He could be someone who is much better off with higher status than you think.

516
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,890
Are you jealous? Twisted?

517
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,970
Because he is cooler than you, your belly hurts? (are you jealous?)

518
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:41,500
I think he is fooling around but I am worried that you might fall for it for real,

519
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,130
because that won't ever happen.

520
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,720
Your meddling is as big as the Pacific Ocean.  Are you not busy lately?

521
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,480
I should just kill you.

522
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,320
Watch your words.  Why do you keep getting damaged, woman?

523
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,000
Where is the woman here?

524
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:11,330
You and me both lived 15 years more than 15 years ago.

525
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,690
I, who was an aspiring lawyer, became a lawyer.

526
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,660
You, who were a national swimmer, became an executive in a major company.  That's how much time has passed.

527
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,790
Why do I keep breaking down?

528
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,060
Is gaining some weight and adding flesh becoming damaged?

529
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,070
Then or now, I am just Kang Joo Eun.

530
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,790
Think carefully about what is different about me from 15 years ago.

531
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:46,220
Soo Jin is a capable lawyer. A lot more than me.

532
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,120
Nothing big will happen. I am leaving.

533
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,890
Thank you for cooperating. You can leave now.

534
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,290
 They were both each other's first love. When they had a romantic relationship for 15 years, 

535
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,880
 they wouldn't normally become strangers, just because they broke up. 

536
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,300
 I could go crazy.  

537
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,280
Manager Min, I have a favor to ask, but it's a personal matter.

538
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,400
Wait a minute.

539
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,220
I don't know if you might already know...

540
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,610
In any case, I think I will have the circumstance to greet  you at some point.

541
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,580
I'm the Gahong Center General Manager, Im Woo Sik.

542
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,300
You haven't made a decision about me yet, right?

543
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,480
Is it because of Kang Joo Eun?

544
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,540
No. When I think about it, I don't have the right to worry.

545
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,050
Thank you for being a witness.

546
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,690
It is nothing at all.

547
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,050
Then, I can go, right?  Since Kang Joo Eun gets cold easily.

548
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,140
It's fortunate that I could help. Then...

549
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:50,250


550
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:55,600
I thought you had taken a taxi and left, since you're independent by nature.

551
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,820
We'll be going to the same place anyway. Why waste gasoline?

552
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,830
It is cold.

553
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,820
  Hi, Oh Soo Jin 

554
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,950
  Hi, Woo Sik.  

555
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,280
 They're called genius chocolates.  Congratulations on passing the bar exam. 

556
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,560
  Thank you. I will enjoy it.  

557
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,510
  He is here.  

558
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,920
  If someone looks like you, they should at least have some sense.   

559
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,450
 Don't hang around places like this.  Just hurry up and go home! 

560
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,280
 Seriously, what did she see me as?  

561
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:09,150
 You're only able to talk like that, right?  Do you want to die?  How dare you? 

562
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,930
 Woo Sik. 

563
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,660
 Im Woo Sik? 

564
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,830
 Yeah, I am Im Woo Sik, 

565
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,740
 You want to sue me? Sue me. 

566
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,520
 My friend, Oh Soo Jin,  passed the bar exam, and 

567
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,790
  my girlfriend, Kang Joo Eun, will pass soon.  

568
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,170
 So careless. 

569
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,020
 Let's go. 

570
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,840
 Woo Sik, you got hurt. 

571
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,360
 I am okay. Are you okay? 

572
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,390
 Let's go. 

573
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,960
  If you do that one more time to Kang Joo Eun, you will die by my hand.  

574
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,340
  Since you've watched us, you know what right I have.  

575
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,140
  Keep away from Kang Joo Eun. It isn't a warning but an order.  

576
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,260
Wait a minute.

577
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,740
Since there are 30 minutes left in Kang Joo Eun's day, a cup of coffee is possible, right?

578
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:51,290
Don't you know that you have a sleep disorder? If you drink coffee at this timeâ€”

579
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,570
Even if I don't drink coffee, I can't sleep today anyway

580
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,930
so just one cup.

581
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:16,520
The sweetest here is white chocolate and mint chocolate, right?

582
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,290
Yes. Which one would you like?

583
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,820
- Give me both of them please. 
 - Yes.

584
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,530
Can I pay with this?

585
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,790
Yes, of course.

586
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,520
If I had asked to borrow money from him he'd never have let me drink them.

587
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,330
  Secretary Min, I have a favor to ask you but it is personal.  

588
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,330
What is the matter?

589
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,620
I heard that there was a lawsuit filed against Im Woo Sik earlier.

590
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,710
Yes. It was settled and the lawsuit was dropped.

591
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,440
I'm a bit concerned since there are so many mouths.

592
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,750
Please talk with me for a moment.

593
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,180
Yes, I handled it.

594
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,700
Someone's personal information can become public information to someone else.

595
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,280
Please be cautious.

596
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,230
Please also be cautious of complaints and nagging, okay?

597
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,560
Wait a minute.

598
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,950
Did it break down?

599
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,470
What's wrong with the car?

600
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,620
I can't say.  I don't know.

601
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,600
Since there are10 minutes left in Kang Joo Eun's day, drink without complaining.

602
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,520
That you don't know the sweet taste of life to this extent,

603
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,140
even though people might say your body is good,

604
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,310
if you look at it in a certain way, it's a sad thing.

605
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,980
Does it feel good to live like Kang Joo Eun?

606
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,680
Because you've paid back what I did for you?

607
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,310
The truth is ... it was a gift

608
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:20,030
so you can taste the sweetness.

609
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,850
There is the right to pursue your happiness among basic human rights.

610
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:34,540
Human beings have the right and responsibility to pursue happiness

611
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,650
regardless of who they are.

612
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,020
Even though I know I should be sorry to my body, in my mind

613
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,720
this is kind of like the right to pursue happiness.

614
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:54,210
You gave me Kang Joo Eun's right to pursue happiness as a gift?

615
00:54:54,210 --> 00:55:01,030
For one day, I wish I could rest under yellow light that is neither red nor green.

616
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:06,390
I might be stepping out of line,  but there was a time you looked to be having a hard time.

617
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,340
That's why.

618
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,580
It will take some time to fix the car, right?

619
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,860
I will go get fresh air and come back because it is stuffy.

620
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:08,690
  As you know, I didn't grow up tasting much sweetness.  

621
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,990
  The truth is...it was a gift so you can taste the sweetness.  

622
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,890
  I might be stepping out of line,  but there was a time you looked to be having a hard time.  

623
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,920
Even if it's sweet it's too sweet.

624
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,150
You scared me.

625
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,440
Oh, it is sweet.

626
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,390
Why would you drink mine....

627
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:53,390
Are you having another worst day of your life again?

628
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,960
Don't fold the umbrella because it can become a weapon.

629
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,450
Please take your eyes off me. This dimple is mine.

630
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:22,070
  He might be fooling around but I am worried that you might fall for real  

631
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,470
 because that won't ever happen.  

632
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,410
Please don't fool around.

633
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,090
When will they be done fixing it?

634
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,550
What?

635
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,910
You said your car broke down, didn't you?

636
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,830
The tow truck has broken down.

637
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,370
What did you just say?

638
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,040
Wait a minute. Then why are we standing here?

639
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,780
It is nice, and because of it I got to taste the sweetness of life.

640
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,650
It is amazing.

641
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,360
Please don't fool around.

642
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,370
I guess you really don't know.

643
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:43,600
Guys want to do other things with the girl they want to fool around with.

644
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,550
Because your body is mine, Kang Joo Eun,

645
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,080
you can't say "no".

646
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:09,120
â™¬  The feeling comes, the feeling comes,   â™¬

647
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,500
â™¬  When you see me, When you call my name, I don't have the confidence not to smile,  â™¬
