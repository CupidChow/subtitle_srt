1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,104
"Episode 11"

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,106
When it comes to timing,

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,010
it's better to be early than late.

4
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,727
Producer Ko,

5
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,730
release it.

6
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,003
-I'm here waiting for him.
-It's Kim Youngho!

7
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:36,970
Kim Youngho!

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,075
Are you Kim Youngho of Gahong Group?

9
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,279
-Kim Youngho!
-Is it true that you are John Kim?

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,147
Is it true that you are John Kim?

11
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,582
Is it true about you and Anna Sue?

12
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,669
Please give us a statement.

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,584
What is it?

14
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,286
What?

15
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,454
Stop it!

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,191
I'm sorry, Sir.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,495
An article about you and Anna Sue has
been released.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,297
We should go somewhere else for now.

19
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,169
John Kim!

20
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,872
Go after him!

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,075
-Isn't this John Kim's house?
-Kim Youngho!

22
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,679
-Please calm down.
-Is it true?

23
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:41,501
Yes, Sir.

24
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,977
Anna Sue's people will

25
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,246
release their statement tomorrow.

26
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,947
They will be stating that
the scandal is not true.

27
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,883
Were you prepared for this?

28
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,488
I already decided to accept
the bitter cup.

29
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,690
But

30
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,793
people won't care

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,696
whether or not it's true.

32
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,266
People care more about...

33
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,671
...what they hear rather than the truth.

34
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,674
The more people talk about it,

35
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,144
the more they'll believe it's true.

36
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,516
It's not just your house in Nonhyeon-dong,

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,151
your grandma's house and the office are...

38
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,753
...all bombarded with reporters.

39
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:35,522
Is there somewhere quiet you can go?

40
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,124
Just for one day.

41
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,459
Just for a couple of days.

42
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,465
I can't run away like this anymore.

43
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,670
I was the one that told her...

44
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,372
...not to run away.

45
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,521
"Coach"

46
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:17,097
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message.

47
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,977
Who is this woman?

48
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,879
What's going on?

49
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,088
You must be going somewhere nice.

50
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,857
Why didn't you answer your phone?

51
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,593
I was so scared.

52
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,863
Are you all right?

53
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,169
There are too many reporters

54
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,337
in front of the house,

55
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,340
so I don't want to go home.

56
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,342
The same goes for the hotel.

57
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,144
I don't want to go home.

58
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,948
Do you think I'd want to sleep at a hotel?

59
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,851
Did you think I wanted to come here?

60
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,796
I only have one room...

61
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,998
...and only one bathroom.

62
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,200
But come in.

63
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:30,583
It's going to be a place...

64
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,573
...outside of your earth.

65
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,280
Boarding.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,054
Take off.

67
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,894
Today, it's Kang Jooeun,

68
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,497
who is sexy all over.

69
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,499
Gosh.

70
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,368
You thought you were the only one
who could be sexy?

71
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,371
Anyone can be sexy.

72
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,174
I...

73
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,877
...can't sleep unless it's a suite.

74
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,079
The bed springs...

75
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,938
You should be thankful.

76
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,319
I should have you sleep on
the floor with Rascal.

77
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,758
If you're not going to be sweet,

78
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,294
you should leave and let me sleep here.

79
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,899
Don't think about anything
and go to sleep.

80
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,069
You can worry about it tomorrow.

81
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,974
You're going to worry about it tomorrow
anyway, so don't let it bother you today.

82
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,581
I'll call you if I want to spend...

83
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,684
...a restful and erotic night.

84
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,092
I need to wash up.

85
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,160
Good night.

86
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,864
Didn't you forget something?

87
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,603
Are you happy now?

88
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,973
I am.

89
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,251
Leave me.

90
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,355
It's not something...

91
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,258
...someone can cure.

92
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,261
It's neurosis.

93
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,330
My body still remembers it.

94
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,733
A human body is smarter than you'd expect.

95
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:08,488
It'll probably continue until
it disappears one day.

96
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,625
Or it will continue until the day I die.

97
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,375
Junseong.

98
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,676
It's me.

99
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,979
I wanted to let you know that
Youngho is in my place,

100
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:35,882
so you don't need to worry.

101
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,485
Is he...

102
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,922
You know, don't you?

103
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,026
What...

104
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,729
What should I do?

105
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,133
He's in so much pain,

106
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,935
but there's nothing I can do.

107
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,239
Just...

108
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,541
...act like nothing is wrong.

109
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,942
It pains him to see people who
he cares about suffer.

110
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,446
It pains him more than his own suffering.

111
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,753
Youngho is like...

112
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,355
...a father to me.

113
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,857
Please take good care of him.

114
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,728
He is...

115
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,130
...really important to me, too.

116
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,200
Please take good care of him.

117
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,403
I will.

118
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,116
-Hurry up. He's getting away.
-Faster.

119
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,818
Shoot. Where is he?

120
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,486
Shoot.

121
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,991
-Fast. Where is he?
-Shoot.

122
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,926
-Go this way.
-Move, man!

123
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,598
Press down on it.

124
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,303
If you move, you'll destroy your leg.

125
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,721
Did you run with your leg like this?

126
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,224
I don't know if you're stupid or brave.

127
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,095
What's it to you?

128
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,932
Your leg is broken, you punk.

129
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,438
-Where is he?
-Shoot!

130
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,407
-Where is he? Where did he go?
-Shoot.

131
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,652
Your blood pressure is normal.

132
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,721
Your face shows that
you aren't lacking blood.

133
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,957
You took painkillers.

134
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,959
Who are you?

135
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,262
Is that how you say thank you?

136
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,872
Where are your parents?

137
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:48,808
Did they pass away?

138
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,913
You don't have parents, so you must
not be a student studying abroad.

139
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,182
Are you adopted?

140
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:56,783
Where are your adoptive parents?

141
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,384
Do you have anywhere to go?

142
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,787
Why you!

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,862
What's it to you?
Who are you, jerk?

144
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,365
You have a temper.

145
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,369
I'm not a jerk. I'm Youngho.

146
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,773
I'm weak when it comes to people in pain

147
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,477
and even weaker towards people
who are in danger.

148
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,316
Shut the...

149
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,286
I don't need your pity.

150
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,655
I don't need it!

151
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,560
Pity?

152
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,798
It isn't pity.

153
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,201
I can relate, that's all.

154
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,110
You're angry and want to fight.

155
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,615
If you want to fight you should,

156
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,618
but don't use guns or knives.

157
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,119
Fight where there are rules.

158
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,789
Wipe your hands, kid.

159
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,540
I'd like you...

160
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,137
...to leave me alone today.

161
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,508
Did I say anything?

162
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,811
I'll just stay quietly here.

163
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,413
Next to you.

164
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,487
It is a cold winter for lonely people.

165
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,591
Let's help the needy and share the warmth.
Be strong, everyone.

166
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,197
I'm a celebrity specializing in comforting
and cheering people on.

167
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,800
Gosh.

168
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:35,808
Isn't it comforting just to have someone
lying next to you?

169
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,312
Especially since it's me, Yijin,
the queen of commercials.

170
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,817
How can you comfort me
when you don't know anything?

171
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,519
That doesn't mean I can't comfort you.

172
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,722
Sadness is all the same.

173
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,832
We're moving pretty quickly.

174
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,135
We kissed and now we're
already sleeping together.

175
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,973
Nice weather.

176
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,576
I feel great today.

177
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,479
-Right?
-Yes, you're right.

178
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,483
I feel like nothing happened.
My shoulders feel light.

179
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,286
What are you doing here?

180
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,688
You are such bad actors.

181
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,624
Ma'am said to act normal.

182
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,692
She did.

183
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,495
You call that normal?

184
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,897
Let's eat.

185
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,301
My apartment looks smaller
since you guys are so big.

186
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,216
I don't think you needed
an apron to prepare this.

187
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,152
I did.

188
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,956
I threw in everything that was
in the fridge, so be grateful.

189
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:34,427
And a drop of sesame oil.

190
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,531
A drop...

191
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,835
How fermented is that sesame oil?

192
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,638
My mom sent it to me yesterday.

193
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,842
Open wide.

194
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,548
Ma'am, it's fantastic.

195
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,817
It tastes incredible.

196
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,119
White rice makes all the difference.

197
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,168
I'll just have one bite.

198
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:25,177
After breakfast, get your clothes
and equipment ready.

199
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,949
We need to work out.

200
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,553
Don't you always work out
rain or shine?

201
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,556
-Equipment?
-What are you talking about?

202
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:49,236
I'll show you what
Korean training is all about.

203
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:07,553
Ma'am, we look like Robocop.

204
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,455
It's strange that I can
see through this thing.

205
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,391
What are we doing here?

206
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,564
You really shouldn't be exposing
your face in public.

207
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:22,368
Here we go.

208
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,573
Please follow me while clapping your hands
as hard as possible.

209
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,107
Ma'am, wait for me.

210
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,510
-Hello.
-Good morning.

211
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,713
-Junseong.
-Yes.

212
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:35,637
What was it?

213
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,751
Let's just think of this as a warm up.

214
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,169
Why are we doing this to the tree?

215
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,372
Did it do something bad to us?

216
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,843
-It's...
-It's good for blood circulation.

217
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,145
I've been doing this for 10 years.

218
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,247
I'm so healthy that I haven't
even gotten a cold.

219
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,350
Why are you guys so weak?

220
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,386
Why don't you hit it harder?

221
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,456
The girl is doing a better job.
Do it like she's doing it.

222
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:23,062
It hurts.

223
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,718
-You want to try, young man?
-Where are you going?

224
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,628
It hurts.

225
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,448
This improves blood circulation and
eliminates wastes from the body.

226
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,459
I shouldn't because of my muscles...

227
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,272
This has nothing to do with muscles.

228
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,629
-It's all tight here.
-It hurts.

229
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,931
-You need to relax them.
-Wait.

230
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,232
Take a deep breath.

231
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,638
You'll see tomorrow. All the wastes
from your body will flush out.

232
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,440
Come over here.

233
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,444
Where are you going?

234
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:16,115
In my professional point of view,

235
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,419
I worked hard to make these abs.

236
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,721
It has nothing to do with abs.

237
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,624
You'll see tomorrow.
Your body will flush out all the wastes.

238
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,862
You'll take responsibility
if my abs are ruined?

239
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,733
Your abs belong to me.
You can't say no.

240
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,135
Hold on.

241
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:47,379
Ready, go!

242
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,150
Oh, no. Are you okay?

243
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,356
Did you bring me here
to cheer me up?

244
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,723
Why would I cheer you up?

245
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:01,527
This all happened because you're a
part of Gahong and you're John Kim.

246
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,163
-What?
-You told me before.

247
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,433
Exercising can take your
mind off of your worries.

248
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,979
What are you doing?
The boys are watching us.

249
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:20,446
Let go of me.

250
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,914
Oh, no.

251
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,754
Let's do it again.
You're making me shy. Do it again.

252
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,396
I'm glad I forced myself to study.

253
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:42,468
I will support you if you're unemployed.
You can count on me.

254
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,248
Please look after the house.
I'll go make lots of money.

255
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,452
You're going to be late.

256
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,153
Have a nice day.

257
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,754
I will.

258
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,754
As you mentioned before,

259
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,558
Anna Sue's people released a statement
that refuted the scandal.

260
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,828
This morning, I also met with
the reporters.

261
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,797
We can't prevent everything
from appearing on the news,

262
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,968
but we have controlled speculative rumors
from being reported.

263
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,338
You are not a morning person.

264
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,842
Your grandmother and father...

265
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,111
...are waiting for you.

266
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,417
I've brought some clothes that
you can change into.

267
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,219
No.

268
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,822
I'll go just as I am right now.

269
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,960
-Kim Youngho!
-Mr Kim!

270
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,063
-Show us your face.
-John Kim!

271
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:21,100
-Kim Youngho!
-John Kim!

272
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,802
-John Kim!
-Look over here.

273
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,414
Young Master...

274
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,415
...has arrived.

275
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,621
I'm relieved...

276
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,624
...now that he's finally back.

277
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,727
My baby.

278
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,033
Who was that girl?

279
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,235
Is she an attorney?

280
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,773
Why didn't you report to me?

281
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:03,208
Are you looking down
on me because I'm old?

282
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,277
I'm sorry.

283
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:09,481
Since you know Youngho's situation,
you shouldn't let this happen.

284
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:14,453
He needs a spouse who can help
strengthen his position.

285
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,308
I think the daughter of Deokseong
Pharmaceuticals'...

286
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:21,994
...is good enough for Youngho.

287
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:28,167
As soon as the construction is finished,
get him to move in.

288
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,276
Yes, Chairwoman.

289
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,481
Please bring the bell-flower root tea
instead of that.

290
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,704
Yes, Ma'am.

291
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:49,154
Please prepare green plum tea for Mother.
She isn't feeling well.

292
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:03,502
I'm sorry that I've made the elders worry.

293
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,105
You've come back.

294
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,041
I'll understand this...

295
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,227
...as your will to keep your position.

296
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,649
Stand up.

297
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:22,428
I never spanked you...

298
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,759
...because I didn't want anything to
happen to your knee.

299
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,934
You need to toughen up.

300
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,738
Defend...

301
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,608
...your position.

302
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:47,079
You may not have much time.

303
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:50,983
Yes.

304
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,485
Father.

305
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,690
Until the 61st anniversary of the company,

306
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,594
and until your inauguration,

307
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,997
keep a low profile.

308
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:29,254
Why don't you eat with us?
It's been a while since you've come.

309
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,659
No, thank you.

310
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:36,795
Please take care of...

311
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,431
...Grandmother and Father.

312
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,348
"Attorney Kim Yeonghan"

313
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:10,562
A pregnant woman killed her husband.

314
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,266
But if you look into it,

315
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:19,238
the woman had been
severely abused by her husband.

316
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,640
If I recall correctly,

317
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:24,076
I think she was trying to
protect her baby.

318
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,182
She pushed him as she was running away.

319
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:34,562
Back then, people weren't educated
on domestic violence or abused wives.

320
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,054
The judges were not interested...

321
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,432
...in her side of the story either.

322
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:48,435
She was just a woman that
killed her husband.

323
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,572
I think she has probably...

324
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,940
...served her full sentence.

325
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,046
The last thing I heard about her,

326
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,346
was that she gave birth while in prison.

327
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:34,580
Why did you leave this in
front of my house?

328
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,923
It's not that, it's just that...

329
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,818
You looked cold.

330
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,729
Why do you care?

331
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,898
Don't do this again. Never again.

332
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,811
Never...

333
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:04,443
...come here again.

334
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:39,780
Mr. Sexy!

335
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,181
Please open the door. It's me, Hyunwoo.

336
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:53,458
Jooeun is not here.

337
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:00,915
Ready and bow.

338
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,534
Hello.

339
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,503
Mom, I need to pee.

340
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,305
Go to the bathroom.

341
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,933
You're John Kim and the heir of Gahong.
You're also a sexy guy.

342
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,516
I said you were unemployed.
I didn't know you had three jobs.

343
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:19,017
It's all right.

344
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,188
I couldn't let Jooeun stay alone
with a man at home.

345
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,390
That's not quite true.

346
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:28,960
No one else could look after Minjun.
I heard you are currently unemployed.

347
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,833
Don't let the fact that Producer Ko is my
ex worry you. I can't stand him either.

348
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:39,037
Minjun, I'm leaving.
See you. Thank you.

349
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:41,640
Excuse me.

350
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,612
I can't come down from the toilet.

351
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,316
Do you have to come down?

352
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,218
Was it the big one?

353
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:57,396
That was quite a welcoming party...

354
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,125
...for the new executive director.

355
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,398
The board members didn't come to
the meeting and now this scandal.

356
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,898
You must be very worried.

357
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,969
I've been through much more.

358
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,638
The decision of the board members
remains the same,

359
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,543
but the new executive director
disagrees with us.

360
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:24,983
If you sign this before the
61st anniversary of the company,

361
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,920
it would benefit the both of us.

362
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:31,423
We would be helping each other.

363
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,991
"VVIP Medical Exam Center"

364
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:37,896
I think that's out of my jurisdiction now.

365
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:44,903
Is that right?

366
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,609
I hope our board members
will accept Youngho...

367
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:52,978
...as the new executive director.

368
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,986
I'm looking forward to
the 61st anniversary ceremony.

369
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,801
I told you to move into a house that
would be easy for guys to access.

370
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,903
And you did just as you were told.

371
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,740
Hi, Minjun!

372
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,777
When will you be home?

373
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:26,845
He's been making me work out all day.

374
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,081
That's what he does all the time.

375
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,752
Hang in there.
I'll bring you snacks.

376
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,456
You remind me of somebody.

377
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,661
She was very pretty.

378
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,761
Uncle, I need to pee.

379
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,665
I'll be right there.

380
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,973
That growing child knows how to climb up
the toilet seat but can't climb down it.

381
00:32:53,674 --> 00:32:55,674
It sounds like he has a promising future.

382
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,844
Think of this day as another
Kang Jooeun Day.

383
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,745
You're learning a different kind of
sweetness in life.

384
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,548
You're just making that up.

385
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,817
You're using me as a babysitter.

386
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:09,697
Sometimes, you need to think things over
and make the right decision.

387
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,025
Other times, holding on and wait
for time to pass is another way.

388
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,260
My unemployed man,

389
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,661
good luck!

390
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,601
Uncle.

391
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,601
Hang up. He needs me.

392
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,003
Uncle, I need to poop.

393
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,507
I thought you said it was
going to be sweet.

394
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:36,383
I feel so bad for Sunja.

395
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,786
She's working so hard.
She even supports her abusive husband.

396
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:49,396
Apparently, Sunja doesn't want
to meet her son, Junseong.

397
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,798
She gave her son up for adoption.

398
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,767
She might feel bad about that.

399
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:59,494
From my point of view,

400
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,007
I can't tell Junseong everything.

401
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,579
I can't convince Sunja either.

402
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:07,898
What if Sunja just disappears one day?

403
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:11,082
Exactly.

404
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,886
It would be bad for Mr. Muscles,
but it would also be bad for Minjun.

405
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,691
I can't raise Minjun without her.

406
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,159
Honestly,

407
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:27,766
I was worried that it would freak you out
when I told you that she had a record.

408
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,034
Are you kidding me?

409
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:32,637
Sunja raised my son
since he was one year old.

410
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,440
Not even my mom or
my mother-in-law did that.

411
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,842
I can't believe you thought that.

412
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,946
We'll wait and see for now.

413
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,548
As expected from Lee Hyunwoo!

414
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,817
I'm proud of you, my friend.

415
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,323
Here comes another friend of yours.

416
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,531
Producer Ko?

417
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,233
What is he doing here?

418
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,635
Gosh.

419
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,938
Hey, ex-husband.

420
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,810
Are you getting legal advice
from Soojin herself?

421
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,210
Ex-wife.

422
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,913
Just ignore me.

423
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,148
What are you up to?

424
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,552
I'm working now,
so you need to respect your superior.

425
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,111
Respect your superior?
Are you joking?

426
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,225
-Please don't. Let's go.
-I'm going to...

427
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,526
What are you looking at?

428
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:42,273
Minjun, I'm ho...

429
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:15,853
Did you make a lot of money?

430
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,744
You know nothing since you were born rich.

431
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,914
I'm an attorney at a firm.
I get a monthly salary.

432
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,687
When was the last time
you washed your hands?

433
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:31,790
Are you a baby?

434
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:33,992
By the way,

435
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:39,364
don't even dream about a restful
and erotic night while you're here.

436
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:43,568
That is not allowed here.

437
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:48,106
Even when Minjun is not here, think of
this place as a child-friendly zone.

438
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,112
Your world is totally
beyond my expectations.

439
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,114
I'm in a tough situation.

440
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,018
You must like rhyming your words.

441
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,672
"I'll go get the car. When the tea
comes out, bring it to the car."

442
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:04,892
"I'll go get the car. When the tea
comes out, bring it to the car."

443
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:06,291
That's a masterpiece.

444
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,163
I saw a ring on your dressing table.

445
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:19,590
Do you still have feelings for
your ex-boyfriend,

446
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:22,874
or are you keeping it
because it's expensive?

447
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,781
I once threw it away,
but I went back to pick it up.

448
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:34,152
Wooshik was the one who gave it to me, but
I was the one who wore it for 15 years.

449
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,154
It belongs to me, too.

450
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,223
But...

451
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,527
If you want me to, I'll throw it away.

452
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:49,467
If you don't want to throw it away,
you don't have to.

453
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,471
There's nothing to throw away about you.

454
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,045
I told you that this wasn't allowed.

455
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,323
Don't forget the stretches that
I taught you.

456
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,495
-The forward stretch. Got it?
-Okay!

457
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:19,731
Will Minjun become as sexy as you?

458
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,101
I can't guarantee that.

459
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,405
I see.

460
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,839
Anyway, thank you. Bye.

461
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,607
Minjun.

462
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,010
Goodbye, my little puppy.

463
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,612
We're leaving. We'll leave you alone.

464
00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:37,782
What's wrong with you? Go on. Bye.

465
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:44,287
Do you realize that because of
the John Kim news,

466
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,291
your position as executive director is
on the line?

467
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:51,796
Wanting to spend a restful and
erotic night at a time like this...

468
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,098
...isn't a good idea.

469
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,104
I'm also a chaste woman.

470
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:02,409
Anyway,
I believe the mind can control the body.

471
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,513
I hope you will control your
mind while you are here.

472
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:09,747
Okay?

473
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,250
Did I say anything?

474
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,925
The mind controls the body.

475
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:20,725
Can you guarantee that?

476
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:27,935
Yes, I can guarantee, promise,
and assure you of that.

477
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,435
Okay.

478
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:35,843
Oh, dear.

479
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,045
At least button up first.

480
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:31,396
The inauguration of the new executive
director and 61st anniversary of Gahong...

481
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:33,097
...is expected to carry on as scheduled.

482
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,850
Sources say that the executive
director's inauguration is set,

483
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:39,339
but nothing is confirmed.

484
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,207
They request that people refrain
from reporting speculative rumors.

485
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,410
"Mr. Min"

486
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,215
-Yes?
-I'm controlling the situation,

487
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:55,019
but the media and board
members aren't making it easy.

488
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,524
Consider it spilled milk,

489
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,160
and watch what happens.

490
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:01,659
Okay.

491
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,195
It may be better to dry the area,

492
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,366
rather than try to put
the milk back into the bottle.

493
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,768
By the way,

494
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,735
how long will you be
staying at Jooeun's house?

495
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,704
Don't be jealous.

496
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,038
Good night.

497
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,359
Soojin.

498
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,461
I saw your car out front.

499
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:37,874
Let me in.

500
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:42,962
I'm sorry.

501
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,371
I'm coming in.

502
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,311
Who said you could come in?

503
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:54,912
Get out.

504
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,315
If you didn't want me to come in,

505
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,984
you should've used a different passcode.

506
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,487
Did you think...

507
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,993
...that I didn't know my
girlfriend's birthday?

508
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:18,269
I heard you found out about...

509
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,073
...Producer Ko?

510
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,875
I'm the external counsel for Kim Youngho.

511
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,781
If my client has a problem,
it's my job to fix it.

512
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,188
I'm sure that he obtained
Kim Youngho's license...

513
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,588
...illegally.

514
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,192
Soojin.

515
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,403
Please leave.

516
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:52,503
Please.

517
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:37,115
Why is life...

518
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,318
...like salt water?

519
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,255
I drink and drink,

520
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,357
but...

521
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:10,982
Your desk...

522
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,087
...is still so cluttered.

523
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:20,658
You must have time to kill since
you're on the cleanliness squad too.

524
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:22,860
Right.

525
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,663
I was thinking about what to wear.

526
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:28,247
For tomorrow.

527
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,035
It's Gahong's 61st anniversary ceremony.

528
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,239
But we may not be able to go.

529
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,344
The executive director hasn't said
whether or not he will attend.

530
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,221
Did you know that Kim
Youngho was John Kim?

531
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,624
I see.

532
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:58,029
That's how you lost so much weight.

533
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,033
I'd like you to ask
your questions in writing,

534
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,238
so that I can crumple them up
and throw them out.

535
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,739
I'm the head of the external counsel team.

536
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,842
I should know that so that
I can handle the crisis.

537
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:16,380
We will be requesting Producer
Ko to certify his sources.

538
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:22,155
-That's why...
-Of course,

539
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,456
we'll be asking Im Woosik as well.

540
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:30,864
-What?
-The one who provided Kim Youngho's...

541
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,467
...license was Im Woosik.

542
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,468
He's the one who leaked
the conclusive proof that...

543
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,171
...Kim Youngho is John Kim.

544
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,273
Why would he do that?

545
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,176
I don't know.

546
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,412
I'd like to know, too.

547
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,454
I'll feel bad for you if you can't
go to the ceremony.

548
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,855
I thought...

549
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:01,161
...it would be a chance
to see the old, pretty you.

550
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,561
Okay, then.

551
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,066
What the...

552
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:14,205
What's going on?

553
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,311
Where is he?

554
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,334
I'm home.

555
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:55,946
Cleaning isn't about shoving
things somewhere, it's about...

556
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,988
What's this?

557
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,490
You have a lewd look on your face.

558
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,192
Wake up.

559
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,796
Are we done with
the child-friendly zone?

560
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,434
Why did you raise the heat so much?

561
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,135
Just because you're not paying...

562
00:48:00,454 --> 00:48:02,580
You have a bed scene tomorrow, right?

563
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,356
Did you mean to say a party scene?

564
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,659
Gahong's 61st anniversary ceremony party.

565
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,562
Are you sleeping here again tonight?

566
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:27,541
Was my sexiness too overwhelming?

567
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:30,341
This woman can't contain herself.

568
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,988
Your pulse is rushed.

569
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,854
It's not just my pulse.

570
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,758
I may jump all over you,

571
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,960
so let's decide here and now.

572
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,064
What?

573
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,464
I mean,

574
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,866
the Venus of Daegu...

575
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:59,603
...spent several days with Mr. Sexy.

576
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,706
I'm not saying I won't be chaste,

577
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:07,144
but even on children shows,
they kiss each other.

578
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,947
We're practically 80,
if we add up both of our ages.

579
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:17,588
I'm sorry, but I'm a little tired.

580
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:23,394
Go to sleep.

581
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,696
Sleep tight and look pretty tomorrow.

582
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,572
You're the one that seduced me.

583
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,774
Wasn't it mutual?

584
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,878
It's no fun if you're too aggressive.

585
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:45,483
-Pink.
-It's cute and lovely.

586
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,235
Sir.

587
00:50:17,844 --> 00:50:19,550
It's the timing for me
to leave this place,

588
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,452
that is outside of my earth.

589
00:50:22,491 --> 00:50:25,794
Mr. Min and I don't seem to get along.

590
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:30,667
Youngho,

591
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:33,364
you'll be at the ceremony tomorrow, right?

592
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:36,470
I probably

593
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:41,175
won't be able to kiss you
even if I'm glad to see you.

594
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,409
We need to be professional anyway.

595
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,414
Even if I do go, I'll be there as
part of the external counsel team.

596
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:55,075
I'll go now.

597
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:58,292
Let's have our restful and
erotic night another time.

598
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:38,829
What are they going to
do about Kim Youngho?

599
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,234
I think they'll announce him
as the executive director.

600
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,904
They'll push forward?

601
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,307
Did the board members turn
their backs on us?

602
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,982
I think the external counsel got to them.

603
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:06,323
I see.

604
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:24,066
Ma'am.

605
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:26,446
You should eat something.

606
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,465
I'm sorry I'm late.

607
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,168
Wow, Lawyer Kang.

608
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,973
You look good.

609
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,275
Thank you, I tried.

610
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:09,953
Are you nervous?

611
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:13,490
Why? You're not the executive director.

612
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,493
You're right.

613
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:21,632
The chairman is entering the hall.

614
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,412
Please take your seats.

615
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:14,251
Why aren't you here?

616
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,729
"Why aren't you here?"

617
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,151
What happened to Youngho?

618
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,152
We can't reach him.

619
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:49,853
Look into it.

620
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:56,527
I guess he isn't here.

621
00:55:51,923 --> 00:55:53,150
I'm sorry.

622
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:54,718
Coach?

623
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:44,001
What is the star of
the ceremony doing here?

624
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:47,304
What should I do?

625
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,706
I think

626
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,277
I'm going to be very late.

627
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,982
People are waiting.

628
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,485
Your father and grandmother.

629
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,654
Junseong, Jiwoong and everyone.

630
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:11,828
Get up.

631
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,031
Kang Jooeun.

632
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,135
You're still hanging in there,

633
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,337
so you haven't reached your limit yet.

634
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,641
I can still do it.

635
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,044
That means I haven't reached my limit yet.

636
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,454
Look at me.

637
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,895
If you believe it, you can do it.

638
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,894
Because you believe that you can.

639
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,033
If I believe it, I can do it.

640
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,332
I believe that I can.

641
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,973
Where is he?

642
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,443
What's happening?

643
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:09,052
Executive director, Kim Youngho has...

644
00:58:09,423 --> 00:58:10,654
...just arrived.

645
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,729
"Oh My Venus"

646
00:58:53,778 --> 00:58:55,966
It doesn't look like you're
going to be Cinderella,

647
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,169
if you take your shoes off
instead of putting them on.

648
00:59:00,047 --> 00:59:05,746
You are invited to Youngho's birthday
party and our Christmas party.

649
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:10,047
I'm very happy that you are the man
that I am dating.

650
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,050
Youngjun.

651
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,420
What am I supposed to do?

652
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:18,255
Youngjun.

653
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:19,526
Where's Youngho?

654
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:22,162
You looked pretty today.

655
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:24,461
Enough for me to dream of you every night.
