1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,474
I am...

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,976
...dating Kang Jooeun.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,980
What?

4
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:15,916
-Youngho!
-What?

5
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:19,753
Am I the only one...

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,355
...in this relationship?

7
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,143
Kang Jooeun!

8
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,115
"Episode 10"

9
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,847
Is your name Kim Youngho?

10
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,248
Yes.

11
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,905
What's with the interrogation?

12
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,841
You stay quiet.

13
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,140
It may be uncomfortable,

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,541
but consider it a rite of passage.

15
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,561
Your honest response will
be greatly appreciated.

16
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:01,711
-Okay.
-All right.

17
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,880
Do you own a house?

18
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,932
Is it under your name?

19
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,232
Well...

20
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,303
...pretty much?

21
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:10,990
I see.

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,347
What do you do?

23
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,500
It hasn't been...

24
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:16,665
...confirmed.

25
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,624
So, you don't have a job.

26
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,748
In other words, you're unemployed.

27
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,957
How long has it been since
you broke up with your last girlfriend?

28
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,314
Not very long.

29
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:29,953
She's very famous.

30
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:31,894
She's also a foreigner.

31
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,892
Okay. It's the same for you too,
so I'll let it slide.

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,242
Look, Hyunwoo...

33
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,436
He is sexy, but that's all he has.

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,230
You can't live off of a man's looks.

35
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,426
But with his looks,

36
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,413
your love may last half a century.

37
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:55,141
You lucky brat.

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,893
Hey, ex-wife.

39
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,734
He has horrible timing.

40
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:05,328
My ex is supposed to bring me
child support today.

41
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:06,681
Please excuse me.

42
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:18,706
Isn't that Lawyer Kang?

43
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:20,907
Who is that next to her?

44
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,193
He's good looking.

45
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,612
What are you babbling about?

46
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:27,881
Lawyer Kang lost so much weight.

47
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,213
Is she trying to get revenge
by losing all that weight?

48
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,224
Hey.

49
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,609
Is it revenge if you lose weight
and meet another guy?

50
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,219
You are so immature. Get going.

51
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:41,296
Bye. I'm busy because of John Kim anyway.

52
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,163
Gosh.

53
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,316
I can't stand him.

54
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,103
Ma'am and Youngho. Wow.

55
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,638
I'm surprised.

56
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,728
And you said that I was slow.

57
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:56,749
"I am dating Kang Jooeun."

58
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,746
Junseong, this feels different.

59
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:01,663
She isn't just a girlfriend.

60
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,518
She is a good person.

61
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,274
Youngho will be smiling a lot more now.

62
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,375
Yes.

63
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,479
What's this feeling that I feel?
It's weird, like...

64
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,605
How do I say this?

65
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,234
It feels like it's my mom who is dating.

66
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,692
Call your mom more often.

67
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,004
Stay here.

68
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,793
I think Director Choi...

69
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,716
...has information on John Kim.

70
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:52,442
We don't know exactly what he has,

71
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,701
but I think it's a strong card.

72
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,265
At a time like this,

73
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,739
how can you be engaged
in a private matters?

74
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,548
I guess confession time hasn't ended yet.

75
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,185
I'm leaving.

76
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,835
What are you doing?

77
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,303
You've met him, right?

78
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,505
He is...

79
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:34,841
...my precious Alberto, Mr. Min.

80
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:36,540
Sir.

81
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:40,480
This is the official boss
of my private matter.

82
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,990
This is Kang Jooeun and
we're in a relationship.

83
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,839
It's cold, so wait inside.

84
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,728
He likes to nag, so it'll be a while.

85
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,480
You should talk inside.

86
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,615
I'll go to my house.

87
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:17,717
Excuse me. I'll be on my way.

88
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,408
He already knows you're
staying here. Go on inside.

89
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,814
Come to think of it, you're both alike.

90
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,699
You act like you don't know,
when you actually do.

91
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,394
Go in.

92
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,802
It'll be bad for you
if the chairwoman finds out.

93
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:48,267
It'll be worse if Father finds out,

94
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,981
rather than Grandmother.

95
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:51,701
If you know that, why are you doing this?

96
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,753
I can't refuse to meet her...

97
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,257
...just because it will make
things complicated.

98
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:00,325
Please,

99
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,041
just let it go for now.

100
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,814
The situation...

101
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:10,270
...may be harder on Jooeun.

102
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,166
That's why

103
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,842
I'm asking you for this favor.

104
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,412
Okay?

105
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,818
Can't I just pretend...

106
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:29,796
...that I didn't see anything?

107
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,393
She is too important...

108
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,651
...for that.

109
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,417
Where are you running to this time?

110
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,286
Oh...

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,554
What did he say?

112
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,562
What are we going to do?

113
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,759
What if your family gets the wrong idea?

114
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,247
You like acting chaste, don't you?

115
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,669
You're the one who wanted
to sleep holding hands.

116
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,226
I'll just sleep at Hyunwoo's.

117
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,974
Don't wake the growing child
and stay here tonight.

118
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,809
You're moving tomorrow, anyway.

119
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:27,747
Where are the guys?

120
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,382
They went to work out.

121
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:36,822
What do you think?

122
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,225
Shall we have...

123
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:40,327
...a restful

124
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,377
...and erotic evening?

125
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,931
Stop that.

126
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,739
Where is Rascal?

127
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,022
Sorry, I'm late.

128
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,597
It's fine. You're here.

129
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,434
What is it?

130
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,330
What do you mean?

131
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,834
We haven't seen each other much lately.

132
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,770
Sorry.

133
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,441
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

134
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,146
Soojin.

135
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,716
I've been out of it lately,

136
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,413
so I haven't been attentive.

137
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,255
So...

138
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,020
So?

139
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,028
Are you going to say
that you're sorry again?

140
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,225
Soojin.

141
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,200
From now on, if you're going to apologize,

142
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,698
do it over the phone.

143
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:58,972
I'm leaving.

144
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:26,962
The situation...

145
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:31,079
...may be harder on Jooeun.

146
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,903
This is the official boss
of my private matter.

147
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,252
This is Kang Jooeun and
we're in a relationship.

148
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,098
Ma'am?

149
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,333
We're home.

150
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:01,968
We're coming.

151
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,775
Good night, Sister-in-law.

152
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,777
I'm tired.

153
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,292
What about the guys?

154
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:25,958
They went to bed.

155
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,207
That's not it.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,346
When I think about it,

157
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,302
I forgot the last part of camping.

158
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,444
What?

159
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,979
A restful and erotic evening?

160
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:48,870
Wrong.

161
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,020
Talking all night long.

162
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,087
It's my last night.

163
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,913
You are bewitching until the end.

164
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,057
We're adults here,

165
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,327
and it's late at night.

166
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,615
What are we doing?

167
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,530
We haven't finished negotiating.

168
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:21,205
All hugs, including back hugs,
are prohibited.

169
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,780
Are hugs the only thing that's prohibited?

170
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,804
All physical contact is prohibited
with the exception of hands and feet.

171
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,751
What about your dimples?

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,536
Dimples are off limits, too.

173
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,806
I took off your clothes and
ripped up your support belt,

174
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,148
five minutes after we first met.

175
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,586
This is too harsh.

176
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,831
Gosh.

177
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,754
You're so mean.

178
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,311
"Your body belongs to me."

179
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,612
"You can't say no."

180
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,017
Since I've lost most of the weight,

181
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,795
I can say no to you now.

182
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,826
Looking back, it doesn't make sense.

183
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,082
How dare you insist

184
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,658
on possession of my body?

185
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:10,432
What do you think?

186
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,898
Deal?

187
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,300
Hands.

188
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:15,868
Feet.

189
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,469
Okay...

190
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:21,522
...deal.

191
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:40,767
Beep.

192
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,672
Why did you become a lawyer?

193
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,395
You don't seem like the type
to use your head.

194
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:48,284
Testing. Testing.

195
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,672
If you grow up in an ordinary household,

196
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,718
there are times,

197
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,364
when you go through
unfair and upsetting situations.

198
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,597
So mothers often say,

199
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:04,328
"There must be an lawyer
or a doctor in the family."

200
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,065
That's why.

201
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,154
Is that the reason?

202
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,256
Yes, it is.

203
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:12,525
Well.

204
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,459
Whatever you do,

205
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,904
if it makes you happy,
bright, and confident,

206
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:19,079
that's enough.

207
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:24,623
Beep.

208
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,300
What about that song?

209
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:28,482
The ringtone.

210
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:29,675
Oh, that.

211
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:31,842
It's the theme song of
"The Rose of Versailles".

212
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,715
The character in it has high self-esteem

213
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,434
and she has a good career,

214
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,653
so I've liked that comic book
since I was a child.

215
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:49,195
You've been ignorant and brave
since you were a child.

216
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,663
On top of that, you were determined.

217
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,599
You could call it my motto.

218
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:57,770
I will...

219
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,571
...be busy starting tomorrow.

220
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,343
I don't think I can help you move out.

221
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,748
Just leave that to the professionals.

222
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,660
If you try to help,

223
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,897
you might make things worse.

224
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:19,461
I'm sleepy.

225
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,895
Let's sleep now.

226
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,724
62.2 kg!

227
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,142
-It's 62.2 kg!
-You did it!

228
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,910
-You did it.
-You weigh 62.2 kg!

229
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,245
You're 62.2 kg.

230
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:57,504
You did it.

231
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,590
You did it.

232
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,963
I haven't...

233
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,943
...seen this before.

234
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:18,000
What's this?

235
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:20,726
I wanted to cook the prodigal son...

236
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,917
...a homemade meal.

237
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,457
Move. Out of my way.

238
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,914
-Oh, my!
-What's that smell?

239
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,153
Kang Jooeun day.

240
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,221
I'm home.

241
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,623
This is a bag.

242
00:15:58,528 --> 00:15:59,962
And we kissed yesterday.

243
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,529
I made my intentions clear last night.

244
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,765
Should I make myself clearer?

245
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,404
You must be crazy.

246
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,725
Your insomnia...

247
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,393
...is gone now.

248
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,988
I'm leaving early because
I don't want to see you guys cry.

249
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,223
Your ma'am...

250
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:40,195
...has left all three of you guys gifts.

251
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,316
I hope Junseong meets his Superwoman

252
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:58,477
and I hope Jiwoong meets
his Wonder Woman.

253
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,352
Youngho already has the beauty
and brains, Venus of Daegu,

254
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,784
so just keep learning about
being in a relationship.

255
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:27,010
By the way,

256
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:30,461
I made you breakfast.
Don't complain and eat it all.

257
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,686
Ma'am told us to heat it up.

258
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,168
"Don't complain and eat it all."

259
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:51,934
Let's eat.

260
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,547
Thanks for the food.

261
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:13,585
Ma'am.

262
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,655
Is the executive director in?

263
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:21,482
Youngho?

264
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,429
This...

265
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,970
It fell off.

266
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:25,724
It was a tiring morning.

267
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,864
Did you know there will be a board meeting
at Gahong tomorrow?

268
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,166
I'll attend the preliminary meeting
without you today.

269
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,606
Will it be uncomfortable for you?

270
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:54,887
Since you have a personal relationship
with Kim Youngho.

271
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:58,380
It's also uncomfortable
being around you...

272
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,432
...because of our personal relationship.

273
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,224
Are you...

274
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:09,034
...dreaming of a Cinderella story?

275
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,937
It won't be a problem...

276
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,310
...if you decide to leave
the external legal counsel.

277
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,211
You said it yourself.

278
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,315
Somebody has to do the job.

279
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,353
You said turning a blind eye
doesn't make it go away.

280
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:26,881
You are...

281
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:28,729
...just like I expected you to be.

282
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:31,557
Bye.

283
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,423
My poor thyroid.

284
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,034
Cinderella?

285
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:45,833
Cinderella.

286
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:48,370
She is pretty audacious.

287
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,737
To meet the prince,

288
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:53,676
she ignored her stepmother and stepsisters
and went to the party.

289
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,948
Am I going to be Cinderella
in the legal field?

290
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,322
I think I chose the wrong princess.

291
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,294
What did she say?

292
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,529
Not much. I'm used to her now.

293
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:15,288
The manager asked me to give this to you.

294
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:16,954
It's labeled Jang Junseong.

295
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,760
-Thank you, Hyunjeong.
-Yes.

296
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,502
He looks mischievous.

297
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,388
"Personal Record"

298
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,488
"Birth mother
Name: Jae Sunja"

299
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:39,691
Jae Sunja?

300
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,061
Jae Sunja?

301
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,663
It sounds familiar.

302
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:48,884
Lawyer Kang, a client is here.

303
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,851
Please let him in.

304
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,392
Will she ever give up?

305
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:01,736
Or is she just thick-skinned?

306
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,375
Even if it's Gahong,

307
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,138
I wouldn't have stuck to
the family like she is.

308
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,518
As far as I heard,

309
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:11,322
there will be no share
for her and her son.

310
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:12,604
Of course.

311
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:15,479
The chairwoman's grandson
will be the executive director.

312
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:19,867
-Where did the grandson come from?
-I don't know.

313
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:21,433
Oh my goodness.

314
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,004
Hello, Chairwoman Lee.

315
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:29,870
Good to see you.

316
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:32,195
It's been a while.

317
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,169
How have you been?

318
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:35,604
I'm vulnerable to the cold since I'm old.

319
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,117
Please don't say that.

320
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:38,759
Mother, you're here.

321
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,282
I didn't know that you were here.

322
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,859
-Let's go.
-Yes, Chairwoman Lee.

323
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:07,379
Son!

324
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:11,783
I'm at the art gallery
with your grandmother.

325
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,424
Sure, I'm doing well.

326
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,456
Ma'am.

327
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,293
Chairwoman Lee told us to prepare
the meals from now on.

328
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:28,880
I'll take care of this.

329
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,936
You can go home now.

330
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,611
"Gahong Group
Quarterly Report"

331
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,339
I should study numbers again.

332
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,317
In an hour,

333
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,866
you will have a brief meeting
with the board members.

334
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:52,455
Afterward, you will have
dinner with the chairwoman.

335
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,939
Tomorrow afternoon...

336
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:56,342
Aren't you tired of repeating yourself?

337
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,967
Why don't you just pick me a nice tie?

338
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:02,586
Yours is tacky.

339
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:19,885
How's the moving going?

340
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:23,155
Movers are working on it.

341
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:26,358
What are you doing?

342
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,195
I'm eating.

343
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:32,097
Did you eat?

344
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:34,982
Finish your meal.

345
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,464
I'm going back to the office.

346
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,544
I'm done.

347
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:43,942
Do you want me to video call you?

348
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:45,944
Finish eating your meal.

349
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,216
I'll see you later if possible.

350
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:53,952
I've seen you everyday.

351
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,830
It's okay to skip a day.

352
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,423
Take care of your business.

353
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:01,202
I'm also tired since I made you
breakfast this morning.

354
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,606
We've arrived.

355
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,842
Put your phone on silent mode.

356
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,662
Please.

357
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,237
You're just jealous.

358
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,439
I've arrived.

359
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,264
Go, fight and win!

360
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:21,453
You got this.

361
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:25,101
"Unread:
Go, fight and win!"

362
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,721
"Unread:
You got this"

363
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:56,450
We don't know yet if Kim Youngho
will be amicable or not.

364
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,416
Let's just poke around.

365
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,354
There will be a war if he intends
to be involved in management.

366
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:05,507
If he only holds the title,
we'll give him a break.

367
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:08,660
He's the only grandson
of Chairwoman Lee, after all.

368
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:10,435
Don't you agree?

369
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:16,067
Fine. You can go now.

370
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,236
We'll leave then.

371
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,918
Chairwoman Lee Hongim,

372
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,112
will sign her stocks over to Kim Youngho.

373
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:30,770
Kim Youngho will be
the biggest shareholder.

374
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:32,184
When that happens,

375
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:34,104
we have no means to prevent him,

376
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:35,954
from becoming the executive director.

377
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,891
No matter how much it costs us,

378
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:42,393
we need to get him on our side.

379
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:44,423
We'll be taking a step back

380
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,598
to take two steps forward.

381
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,278
Helping each other?

382
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:52,053
If that worked,

383
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,207
the world would be a beautiful place.

384
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,773
Taking a step back...

385
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:02,814
...may drop you into a bottomless pit,
ruining everything.

386
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:06,871
You must know how cruel
the competitive world is.

387
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,015
Even if we can't prevent it,

388
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,858
we can at least make it difficult for him.

389
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,268
Without consent from the board,

390
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,562
it won't be easy for him to take office.

391
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:21,733
Come in.

392
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:27,981
There you are.

393
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:30,357
Sir.

394
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:31,943
Please have a seat.

395
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,512
Let's sit. Have a seat.

396
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,049
Go sit over there.

397
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,851
I should have come to say hello,

398
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:44,972
but I was preoccupied in catching up.

399
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,776
It's your first day.
Of course you're busy.

400
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:50,395
She is the head of
our external legal counsel.

401
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,771
I'm attorney Oh Soojin.

402
00:28:57,004 --> 00:29:00,015
This is about the VVIP medical
exam center under way.

403
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,559
Before you sign, you can take a look.

404
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,377
Everything is written here.

405
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:06,521
About that...

406
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,681
I will be re-examining this project.

407
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,091
Re-examine? What?

408
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,897
It has been under way for several years.

409
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,824
We've already reported this
to CEO Kim Sungcheol.

410
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,629
We have a lot of time to review it.

411
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:29,388
Even if this construction
were to be delayed,

412
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:30,836
it wouldn't hurt the rich.

413
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:48,355
It's organic tea.

414
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:50,522
It soothes your mind and body.

415
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,693
I haven't prepared anything for you.
Thank you.

416
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,532
Excuse me.

417
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,238
We have met before...

418
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,019
...with Lawyer Kang and
General Manager Im.

419
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,407
Yes.

420
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,842
I hope you don't get things wrong.

421
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,413
They are my old acquaintances.

422
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,472
There won't be any problem...

423
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:17,749
Lawyer Kang told me another story.

424
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:19,951
Pardon?

425
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,220
She said you used to
be very close friends.

426
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:26,458
Yes.

427
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:28,779
I get it.

428
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,064
Your personal life won't
interfere with business.

429
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:34,859
Is there anything else?

430
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:36,843
No, sir.

431
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,404
I'll see you tomorrow.

432
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,486
We need to talk.

433
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:00,859
Why didn't you tell me?

434
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:03,838
Do I have to report my work to you?

435
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,366
Is that the relationship we're in?

436
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,262
Oh Soojin.

437
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,410
We

438
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:13,564
Just hugged and kissed
a few times. That's all.

439
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:17,509
There's no reason for me to report
what I do at work to you.

440
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,311
The same goes to you.

441
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:26,217
You know the situation...

442
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,134
...between Kim Youngho and me.

443
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,281
How can you do this to me?

444
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:30,722
Does this make sense to you?

445
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,634
You and Jooeun...

446
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,399
...are each other's first love,
and you dated for 15 years.

447
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,738
But...

448
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,334
...you're here with me now.

449
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:41,365
Does that make sense?

450
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,902
-Soojin.
-Even a 15-year relationship...

451
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,234
...can end overnight.

452
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:47,672
Don't tell me...

453
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:50,229
...you thought we'd be together forever.

454
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,003
Grandma, it's me.

455
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,645
Hello.

456
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:28,379
Have a seat.

457
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:29,815
I'm hungry.

458
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:33,318
I told you I'd be upset if you lied to me.

459
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,152
Enjoy your lunch.

460
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,263
Have some wine and enjoy your meal.

461
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,592
Meeting someone once...

462
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:50,070
...is already an act of fate.

463
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,904
If a man and woman meet three times...

464
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:53,905
Grandma.

465
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,367
I'm not a fan of Italian food.

466
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,845
You two...

467
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:02,873
...enjoy your lunch.

468
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,992
I think these are for me.

469
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,658
Of course.

470
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,668
Get home safely.

471
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,037
You should've gotten married years ago.

472
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,906
I can't wait forever.

473
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,637
Why don't we have tea instead of lunch?

474
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:38,820
Sure.

475
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:42,520
I don't expect you to be sincere...

476
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:44,379
...from the start.

477
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,592
But I...

478
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:49,994
...expect things like that now.

479
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,359
Do you have someone you plan to marry?

480
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,312
I don't plan to get married.

481
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:59,370
It'll be too difficult under
the circumstance I'm in.

482
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:03,090
-Please don't say anything...
-Of course, I won't.

483
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:06,277
I know that much.

484
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:09,516
I am...

485
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,084
...very sorry.

486
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:39,143
Did your business trip go well?

487
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:42,868
It was nothing special.

488
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,131
Youngjun...

489
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,020
...asked me to ask you...

490
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:51,728
...what major he should choose.

491
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:54,113
Tell him to choose...

492
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,327
...whatever he wants.

493
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,285
Kim Youngho...

494
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:08,106
You weren't like that to your son.

495
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,886
You didn't let him do anything
he wanted to do.

496
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,152
What kind of a son is...

497
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:24,255
...our Youngjun to you?

498
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:37,094
This isn't like you.

499
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:38,440
Let me say something else...

500
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:43,234
...that is unlike me.

501
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,191
For a year,

502
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:53,833
you've been getting chemotherapy.

503
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:03,283
How long have you known?

504
00:36:07,326 --> 00:36:08,199
I don't need to know...

505
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,336
...about the company.

506
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:13,491
But if you're sick,

507
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:15,982
I need to know.

508
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,368
After all...

509
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:23,658
...I am your wife.

510
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,211
I'm sorry for...

511
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:36,564
...acting this way.

512
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:39,764
But...

513
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,241
...I wanted to act like this just once.

514
00:36:51,645 --> 00:36:53,135
Good night.

515
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:05,156
Welcome.

516
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,237
I'm sorry I couldn't help you move.
Instead...

517
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,331
...I brought these.

518
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,793
It's nice not having Youngho around.

519
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:16,038
We get to drink this.

520
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:18,281
We made a few laps around the building...

521
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:21,272
...so that no stalker will come here.

522
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,761
This is heavy.

523
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:25,765
Come in.

524
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,232
-It's heavy.
-Go in.

525
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:28,451
It's so heavy.

526
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:40,887
You know,

527
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,927
you have no loyalty.

528
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,466
He eats, but doesn't gain weight.
It's so annoying.

529
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:52,880
You two need to watch your weight.

530
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:54,612
Or Youngho will...

531
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,769
Then why don't you graze on grass with us?

532
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:59,076
No, no.

533
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:02,416
You've got to eat black bean
noodles when you move.

534
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:08,835
That's right.

535
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,565
Thank you for the gift.

536
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,793
-Superwoman.
-Oh, that.

537
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:13,837
Oh.

538
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,117
Wonder Woman. I love it.

539
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:18,300
You're the best sister-in-law.

540
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:20,949
"Sister-in-law" makes me sound old.

541
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,936
Just call me "Ma'am".

542
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:24,102
That's better.

543
00:38:24,187 --> 00:38:25,487
I'm used to it.

544
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,861
Youngho may not be able to come tonight.

545
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,018
I know.

546
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,418
There will be other days.

547
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:45,607
Faster, faster!

548
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,392
That's it.

549
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,033
Hip! Hip!

550
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,280
Butterfly.

551
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:51,365
Butterfly.

552
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,907
Wow.

553
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,339
You look like a dolphin.

554
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,827
How could someone
who wants to join the marines,

555
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,345
-be afraid of the water?
-Wait.

556
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:07,781
Junseong. Sorry. Sorry.

557
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:09,663
Okay. Okay.

558
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,341
Stop. Stop.

559
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:18,440
Ma'am said that if I put my mind to it,
I can do anything.

560
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,260
-Salute.
-Salute.

561
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,373
How's your shoulder?

562
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:24,729
It feels better.

563
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,179
Jiwoong!

564
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:42,358
Yes!

565
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:50,832
Who's this?

566
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:55,863
Jang Yijin?

567
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,038
Yijin.

568
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:58,298
Jang Yijin.

569
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,904
Junseong. She's going to die.

570
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,002
Do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

571
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:11,598
One, two, three, four, five.

572
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:25,819
We kissed.

573
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,768
Kim Jiwoong, you punk.

574
00:40:34,853 --> 00:40:36,016
Sorry!

575
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:42,030
You show your best acting here.

576
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,683
Why can't you do that
when filming dramas?

577
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,079
I don't know how to face you.

578
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:55,215
Get up!

579
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:02,174
Gahong's...

580
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,280
...executive director nominee Kim Youngho.

581
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,840
He's John Kim, isn't he?

582
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:13,558
What are you saying?

583
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,406
Do you have proof?

584
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,727
I've been in contact with
the paparazzi in the States.

585
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:21,158
Gahong spent a lot of
money to silence them.

586
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:22,545
You seem...

587
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:24,994
...to know something too.

588
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,484
Isn't that why you asked me
not to report it?

589
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,483
Saying that you'll convert it
from a hunch to a fact?

590
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,732
We shouldn't be rash in releasing it.

591
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,296
It may be counterproductive
if we don't have enough proof.

592
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:38,199
That's true.

593
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:39,864
It's Gahong, after all.

594
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:44,902
Im Star.

595
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:46,743
How far do you think...

596
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:49,474
...our bullets will set them back?

597
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,239
Who is it?

598
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,114
Who is it?

599
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:10,065
I'm from a restaurant.

600
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,229
You just moved in, right?

601
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:12,863
May I give you some fliers?

602
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:15,284
Just stick them on the door.

603
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,987
Okay, good night.

604
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:28,512
Who is it?

605
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:37,388
It's me.

606
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:41,058
The man who's dating Kang Jooeun.

607
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:58,211
It's late. Why did you come?

608
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,109
You left something behind.

609
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,056
I see.

610
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,611
Come in.

611
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:14,444
How did it go today?

612
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,302
I guess you need to go right away.

613
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,806
Mr. Min is downstairs.

614
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,844
There will be other days.

615
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,882
You introduced girls...

616
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,951
...to Junseong and Jiwoong.

617
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,954
I gave you a book, though.

618
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,689
"Relationship Cafeteria"?

619
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,602
It was so you.

620
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:50,606
You should've given me
"Relationship Restaurant"

621
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:52,330
or "Relationship Buffet" instead.

622
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,501
The board meeting is tomorrow.

623
00:43:58,238 --> 00:43:59,951
You should go. You must be tired.

624
00:44:07,455 --> 00:44:09,999
It'll be a difficult day tomorrow.

625
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,975
Can someone else do it for me?

626
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,658
For both you and me,

627
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:23,251
it's our job and our lives.

628
00:44:23,447 --> 00:44:25,194
Who could take our place?

629
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,331
I only have to work,

630
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:30,243
as the external legal counsel
until the inauguration.

631
00:44:30,328 --> 00:44:31,769
So don't worry about me.

632
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,657
Did you forget?

633
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:38,742
I'm Kang Jooeun.
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

634
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,321
You're right.

635
00:44:45,638 --> 00:44:48,369
I'll go now, since I got to see you.

636
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,357
What is this sad situation?

637
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,193
We can barely see each other.

638
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:02,081
You should go.

639
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:04,702
Lock up.

640
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:06,070
That's right.

641
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:09,562
Do three sets of plank workout
before bed, okay?

642
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:11,794
Yes, Coach.

643
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:13,370
And

644
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,413
I'm confiscating this.

645
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,050
Bye.

646
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:24,110
She is the head of our external
legal counsel.

647
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:26,517
I'm attorney Oh Soojin.

648
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:43,819
Hi, Producer Ko.

649
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:45,513
Im Star.

650
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,338
I got John Kim.

651
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:50,667
Those paparazzi are amazing.

652
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:53,377
They sent me a photo as soon as
I sent them money.

653
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,497
The photo of him and Anna Sue.

654
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,781
Once I enhance the photo,

655
00:46:57,866 --> 00:47:00,625
this will be a jackpot.

656
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:02,098
It'll be huge!

657
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:05,960
How long will it take?

658
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,908
You must be nervous, Lawyer Kang.

659
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,737
I'm not the executive director.

660
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:42,587
"Gahong Group Board Meeting"

661
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,682
The other members...

662
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,632
...must be very busy.

663
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:22,863
Chairwoman Lee.

664
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,352
Perhaps we should reschedule...

665
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,266
...and cancel the meeting.

666
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:30,938
Sure, let's.

667
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,338
I'll see you again.

668
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:35,909
Yes.

669
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:48,870
1-0.

670
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,109
That was like treading on thin ice.

671
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:13,904
Let's leave too.

672
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:15,534
Let's go, Vice President Oh.

673
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:56,425
It looks like Kim Youngho turned out
to be Cinderella.

674
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,960
He had to depart in a hurry
leaving his glass slipper.

675
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,600
What was that?

676
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:04,695
Or...

677
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:07,731
...maybe he's now in trouble
since he lost something he was chasing.

678
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:11,754
Do you want to be in trouble yourself?

679
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:12,903
Ma'am?

680
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:15,372
Gosh.

681
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,278
I didn't know Director Choi...

682
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:37,925
...had so much influence
on the other members.

683
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:40,534
I was careless.

684
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,536
Get me documents on
the VVIP medical exam center.

685
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:46,740
Yes, sir.

686
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,305
I'll prepare it immediately.

687
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,143
He's greedier than I anticipated.

688
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:11,331
"Venus of Daegu"

689
00:52:24,468 --> 00:52:27,004
How could he not call or text?

690
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,207
I guess he's fine.

691
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:35,789
Gosh.

692
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:54,642
-Oh my gosh!
-Is that Jooeun?

693
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:58,045
-Oh my gosh.
-Fantastic.

694
00:52:58,536 --> 00:53:00,135
Fantastic!

695
00:53:01,117 --> 00:53:02,118
Oh my gosh.

696
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,725
How could this fit?

697
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:06,076
Oh, my.

698
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:09,024
Hold on.

699
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:31,041
Heels.

700
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,387
"Mom"

701
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:20,023
Mom?

702
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:21,127
What?

703
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:22,592
Is something wrong?

704
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,378
You always think something is wrong.

705
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:25,962
Mom.

706
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,517
I lost a lot of weight.

707
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:30,355
I'm close to my old weight.

708
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:31,783
I look pretty.

709
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:33,424
That's all?

710
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:37,443
Of course. You're my daughter after all.

711
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:38,605
Did you eat?

712
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,041
Will you ever stop asking that?

713
00:54:41,126 --> 00:54:42,745
That's how I gained weight
in the first place.

714
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:45,250
Why aren't you sleeping?

715
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,250
I'll go to bed soon.

716
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,277
I'm cleaning anchovies for the broth.

717
00:54:51,382 --> 00:54:53,814
Must you clean them if they're
being used for broth?

718
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:56,293
You complained about
the pig head last time.

719
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:58,181
Is it the anchovies this time?

720
00:54:58,265 --> 00:55:00,097
You and your temper.

721
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:03,818
Mom.

722
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:05,379
What is it?

723
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:07,838
Thank you...

724
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:10,582
...for raising me so well.

725
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,714
Why are you saying that?

726
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:14,925
Is it Mother's Day?

727
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:18,733
You were always pretty.

728
00:55:20,143 --> 00:55:22,686
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

729
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,990
Okay.

730
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,509
Good night.

731
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:27,791
Oh.

732
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,078
Get your wrist treated.

733
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:31,901
Don't just put on pain relief patches.

734
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:33,292
Okay.

735
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:37,601
How did she know?

736
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,320
She must be psychic.

737
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:48,348
"Lee Hyunwoo"

738
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:50,680
Hi, Hyunwoo.

739
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,337
What do you mean?

740
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:58,019
Is that Kim Youngho that
you're dating John Kim?

741
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,997
How do you know that?

742
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:02,659
Who's Gahong's executive director?

743
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:04,754
How did you know that?

744
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,590
It's blowing up online.

745
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:14,390
"John Kim Leads a Double Life"

746
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:15,976
"The Next Successor of G Group..."

747
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:21,648
"Coach"

748
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:26,972
The number you're calling is not
available. Please leave a message...

749
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:29,399
"Junseong"

750
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:33,241
The number you're calling is not
available. Please leave a message...

751
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,562
"Jiwoong"

The number you're calling is not
available. Please leave a message...

753
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:04,319
Who is this woman?

754
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,682
I must have come to the wrong apartment.

755
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,532
What's going on?

756
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:19,681
You must be going somewhere nice.

757
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:22,401
Why didn't you answer your phone?

758
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:25,030
I was so scared.

759
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:28,462
Are you all right?

760
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:38,779
Where's Mr. Min?

761
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,758
You should go to the hotel.

762
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,602
There are too many reporters...

763
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,800
...in front of the house...

764
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:56,804
...so I don't want to go home.

765
00:57:57,377 --> 00:57:58,808
The same goes for the hotel.

766
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,569
I don't want to go home.

767
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:04,477
Do you think I'd want to sleep at a hotel?

768
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:07,331
Did you think I wanted to come here?

769
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:19,306
I only have one room...

770
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,382
...and only one bathroom..

771
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:23,622
...but come in.

772
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:27,067
It's going to be a place...

773
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:28,934
...outside of your league.

774
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:36,713
Boarding.

775
00:58:43,483 --> 00:58:44,568
Take off.
