00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,090
 Episode 13 

2
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,920
Why do you think Kim Seong Cheol remarried you?

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,220
If Kim Seong Cheol hadn't remarried you,

4
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,880
half of Gahong would have passed to him.

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,970
He married you in order to hand everything over to Kim Yeong Ho.

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,510
Unless something happens to Kim Yeong Ho,

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,740
it's all over for Yeong Joon.

8
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,550
Where's Kim Yeong Ho?

9
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,640
Find him right now!

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,430
- Where are you? 
 - At home

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm going to change and then go out now.

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,080
That's a relief. Don't go anywhere and stay at home.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,470
It seems that Director Choi—

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,180
What?

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,130
Joon Seong!

16
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,130
Oppa.

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,450
No Oppa! No.

18
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,490
Joon Seong...

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,940
Oppa Yeong Ho ...

20
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,560
Help me over here!

21
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,690
Is there no one?!

22
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,480
Come to your senses!

23
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,660
♬    I didn't know that it could hurt  ♬

24
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,780
- HYUNG! 
♬    Like this.  ♬

25
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,890
♬  I didn't know I would want to see you so much  ♬

26
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,560
Hyung!!

27
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,740
♬  Slowly   ♬

28
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,000
Hyung. Hyung.
 ♬  my heart would be influenced  ♬

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,850
Hyung! Hyung!!

30
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,300
HYUNG! HYUNG!!!
♬  Before I knew it only you filled it completely  ♬

31
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,420
Hyung, HYUNG!

32
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,350
♬  I enjoyed the time I had with you  ♬

33
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,560
♬  I was happy if you smiled looking at me  ♬

34
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,490
♬  Just like that  ♬

35
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,440
♬  Time stood still  ♬

36
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,130
Please save my hyung. Please save him.
♬  I want to stay with you  ♬

37
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,280
♬    I will stay by your side.   ♬

38
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,870
Come to your senses! Executive Director!

39
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,800
Are you calling them?! What are you doing?!
♬  I will say I will love you   ♬

40
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:29,520
♬  Because you are everything to me, you are my love  ♬

41
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:38,000
♬  I am never letting you go  ♬

42
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,150
 Father, please stop! 

43
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,490
  Dad, I'm really scared! 

44
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,540
  Mom! Mom! 

45
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,380
  It hurts so much, please save me! 

46
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,240
 Can't we wait until I get a little bit older to do it? 

47
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,150
 Please,  Father! 

48
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,810
Keep a tight lid on this so people don't talk and

49
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,530
so it doesn't leak to the press.

50
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,060
Yes, sir.

51
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,090
As for the chairman,

52
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,520
tell her when there's some progress.

53
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,220
Yes.

54
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,200
I'm sorry, President.

55
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,320
Everything

56
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,130
is my fault.

57
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,060
Since this is what happened,

58
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,440
somehow we have to endure it.

59
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,230
Spreader.

60
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,130
What happened to him?

61
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,610
Hyung!

62
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,880
He's going to be okay.

63
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,770
Hyung is going to be okay.

64
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,090
 Son 

65
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,490
 The customer is not answering the phone, so you will be connected to voicemail after the beep. 

66
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,940
 The person you are trying to reach... 

67
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,830
  Oh my Venus. 

68
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,870
Lawyer.

69
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,000
 Mr.Coach   

70
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,800
 The customer's phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voicemail after the beep. 

71
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,390
 Joon Seong   

72
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,010
I'm sorry that I came so late.

73
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,810
I thought... I thought

74
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,220
that something

75
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm so thankful you came unhurt.

76
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,480
M-Mom.

77
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm sorry.

78
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,950
I'm not sure if I have the right, but

79
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,040
in the future, I'll hug you a lot.

80
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:35,930


81
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,810
Due to rib fractures multiple organ damage was a major concern, but

82
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,240
fortunately, she had emergency surgery so there shouldn't be any serious complications.

83
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,020
As for the ankle and rib fractures, as long as she recovers well with rest...

84
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,210
Thank you.

85
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,510
Yes.

86
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,950
Uncle.

87
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,860
Uncle.

88
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes?

89
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,550
What about my mom?

90
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,630
Your mom?

91
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,180
She'll come soon.

92
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,390
Hey.

93
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,370
Why did you do something so idiotic?

94
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,610
At the 61st anniversary celebration,

95
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,820
I went.

96
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,250
I heard what you were talking about on the phone.

97
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,790
Because of me...

98
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I felt like problems kept on arising.

99
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,690
If I disappear,

100
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:18,440
then no one would be greedy and everything would be good.

101
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,650
What are you talking about?

102
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,410
I'm sorry, Uncle.

103
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,730
I won't ever do foolish things again.

104
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,020
No, no.

105
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,230
The person who was idiotic...

106
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,650
was your uncle.

107
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,150
I'm sorry.

108
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,550
Director.

109
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,480
What is this?

110
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,380
Star Im.

111
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,640
Are you okay?

112
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,910
I have a favor to ask.

113
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,150
It's personal business.

114
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,870
Please speak.

115
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,750
Go back carefully.

116
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,020
I really have to keep that land.

117
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,460
I ask you to take care of it.

118
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,700
Yes, I'll do my best.

119
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,070
Lawyer.

120
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,890
Vice CEO didn't come in today either.

121
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,950
- What? 
 - I heard that she wasn't feeling well yesterday and she contacted the CEO,

122
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,910
but she didn't even call today.

123
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,630
What is this? She's someone who wouldn't even come in late.

124
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,050
I know.  Sheesh, there are a ton of documents that she has to approve today.

125
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,540
Give me her address, I'll go to check on her.

126
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,820
Yes, Lawyer.

127
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,360
  Mr. Coach 

128
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,810
 The customer's phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voicemail at the sound of the beep. 

129
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,060
Ah, what is this really?

130
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,950
Fortunately, he has regained consciousness, and his life is not in danger.

131
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,660
But he has multiple fractures and even muscle damage.

132
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,340
I did my best, but I'm not sure if he'll be able to walk again.

133
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,090
As of now, there is nothing certain.

134
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,740
I ask you to do your best.

135
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,570
Inform the Chairwoman when Yeong Ho wakes up.

136
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,980
Yes.

137
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,460
As to what I found out,

138
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,630
Executive Director must have been trying to protect Athlete Jang Joon Seong.

139
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,100
It looks as if he blocked Director Choi's vehicle right away. And as for Madam,

140
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,930
she blocked Director Choi's vehicle.  Ultimately,

141
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,770
they have all become either a perpetrator or victim in this situation.

142
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,260
About Director Choi's authority,

143
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,260
a settlement must be made somehow,

144
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,270
for the situation to be resolved.

145
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,560
That's how it is done legally.

146
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,820
Wrap things up well.

147
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,690
The child who's lying in bed injured,

148
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,090
we can't make him a criminal as well, can we?

149
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,420
I apologize, President.

150
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,110
Hey, Vice CEO.

151
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,420
If you're inside, you should come out.

152
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,920
Ah, seriously.

153
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,920
Oh Soo Jin.

154
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,920
Oh Soo Jin!

155
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,330
Oh Soo Jin!

156
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,340
Hey, Oh Soo Jin!

157
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,380
Hey, get yourself together! Hey!

158
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,090
Why are you overreacting?

159
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,710
Ah, as it is I already have a bad headache.

160
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,590
Ah, you shocked me. Really.

161
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,630
I could just...

162
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,990
I didn't die, so go. Go.

163
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,510
Since there's not even a grain of rice in your place,

164
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,420
it's not like I can even make you some porridge.

165
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,550
At least eat this and get yourself together.

166
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,090
I can't understand why you are doing this.

167
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,170
Since this is a very private space, I'm officially going to speak informally.

168
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,500
Go ahead. Do it then!

169
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,960
While I'm saying it nicely, don't have alcohol and medicine together.

170
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,750
Your body isn't something that you are going to throw away after using it one day.

171
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:31,500
And change your password. 0413? You used your birthday?

172
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,090
For someone who lives alone to be so fearless ...

173
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,550
And, apologize.

174
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,630
For what?

175
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,600
Hurry up!

176
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,560
I clearly told you,

177
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,030
I didn't steal Woo Sik.

178
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,630
Apologize, while I'm asking nicely!

179
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,470
After you passed the bar exam and left for America,

180
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,840
why didn't you contact me?

181
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,210
Even when you went to America, why didn't you answer any of my emails?

182
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,630
Why did you say we were only classmates when we were friends?

183
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,170
Why did you do that? Why?

184
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,130
Kang Joo Eun.

185
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,800
My heart is like hell,

186
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,650
so please apologize.

187
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,750
Did this girl get slapped on her cheek somewhere to come here acting like this.

188
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,090
You bad bitch.

189
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,130
You're an even worse bitch.

190
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,610
What about me?

191
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,450
That top engineering student. That jerk that you introduced to me as a genuine person.

192
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,340
That jerk told me...

193
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,630
You... introduced me to him because you pitied me.

194
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,630
You stepped all over my pride.

195
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,840
He said that a girl who looks like me

196
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,670
shouldn't even be hanging around places like that.

197
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,360
What a shitty jerk.

198
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,690
And there's Lee Ji Hoon too.

199
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,250
You told me you would get us together and then you got his phone number.

200
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,900
Because you were pretty.

201
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,840
Because it was all yours.

202
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,910
Because next to you I was just

203
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,840
the fat, ugly girl receiving pity.

204
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,090
You idiot, he was going to introduce me to his manager.

205
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,130
It was his manager's number that he wrote down.

206
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,980
Forget it.

207
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,800
Till now, was it all because of just that?

208
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,770
My friend Oh Soo Jin?

209
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,280
Because of that kind of feeling?

210
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,900
Human beings are the kind of animal

211
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,400
that can even die because of that kind of feeling.

212
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,980
Feeling alone.

213
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,750
To be in pain?

214
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,760
That's what it means.

215
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,420
You bad bitch.

216
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,720
You apologize first.

217
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,150
I didn't know.

218
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,500
I didn't even know I was supposed to explain.

219
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,960
Ok, I was wrong, you jerk.

220
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,340
Woo Sik, I really didn't seduce him first.

221
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,500
I've known Woo Sik for 15 years.

222
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,300
He's not someone who will just fall for someone if they try to seduce him.

223
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,420
He must have had real feelings for you.

224
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,050
Because he felt sorry to me and he lingered,

225
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,670
it was probably just that the timing was bad.

226
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,300
What's up with you?

227
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,960
Did you fight with Gahong's executive director?

228
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,130
That love that everyone else gets to have,

229
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,300
why is it so hard for me?

230
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,000
I guess it was a good thing I didn't change my passcode.

231
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,380
Ji Woong.

232
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,800
Huh.

233
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,880
You can't cry in front of Hyung.

234
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,420
Let's not make Hyung sad, understand?

235
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,750
I'm going to go crazy.

236
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,390
I'm not going to cry, Hyung. I absolutely won't cry.

237
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:51,130
Okay, don't. Don't cry, don't cry. Never.

238
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,550
Hyung.

239
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,450
Ah, Joon Seong.

240
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,170
Yes, Hyung.

241
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,070
I'm sorry.

242
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,870
I'm sorry.

243
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
Your mom...

244
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,560
I met her.

245
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,340
She wanted me to tell you that she is grateful to you.

246
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,920
You ended up like this because of me right?

247
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,340
Because you were afraid I was in danger.

248
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,920
You're being noisy.

249
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,020
Ji Woong.

250
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,630
Hyung, I'm here. I'm Ji Woong.

251
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,960
I'll stick close to Hyung Joon Seong and make him into a champion.

252
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,610
Don't worry. Hyung, don't worry about anything.

253
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,560
Also, I brought you a present.

254
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,200
They say you can completely raise it with your feet.

255
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,450
They say you only need to water it once every 15-20 days.

256
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,130
It's really easy, so...

257
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,200
So!

258
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:31,190
Hyung you need to get out of that bed and make sure to water it.

259
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,870
And also,

260
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,560
don't let it die. Okay?

261
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,800
 Sister-in-law Lawyer Kang Joo Eun 

262
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:55,620
Hyung, what should we tell Lawyer Kang?

263
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,550
These kinds of things,

264
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,170
I don't want to show her.

265
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,650
That woman crying...

266
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,850
I don't want to see it.

267
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,510
I don't even know what will happen.

268
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,060
Yes, Hyung.

269
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,380
Hyung,

270
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,610
I'm going to pray for you okay? I'm going to pray for a miracle.

271
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,300
Okay?

272
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,730
Go.

273
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,530
Go now.

274
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,960
Get back to work.

275
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,610
Joon Seong.

276
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,210
Ji Woong...

277
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,650
Lawyer.

278
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,460
Where is Yeong Ho?

279
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,240
That is...

280
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,200
Ji Woong.

281
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,190
How much is he hurt?

282
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,760
He is hurt a lot, right?

283
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,330
He's really hurt, a lot.

284
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,120
Where is he?

285
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,410
I know that Yeong Ho is in pain too,

286
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,870
I saw how much he was hurting!

287
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,560
Did something happen?

288
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,260
Lawyer,

289
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,180
Ma'am.

290
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,140
I can search through all of Gahong Hospital.

291
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,980
And America, China, or the ends of the Earth.

292
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,920
No, even to the ends of the universe.  I'm going to find that person.

293
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,480
I will not give up,

294
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,960
So please...

295
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,740
Joon Seong.

296
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,620
Joon Seong.

297
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,340
Ji Woong.

298
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:18,700
♬   Such a man might not exist anywhere  ♬

299

301
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,460
- I am sorry. You can't go inside.
- I have to.

302
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,330
Let go of this!

303
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,320
Chief Secretary Min!

304
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,890
Please go back, the executive director doesn't want it.

305
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,470
You probably don't know. I don't listen to him very well.

306
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,010
Lawyer Kang Joo Eun.

307
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,620
Just one time. I'll just see if he's okay one time. Please?

308
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,940
Hyungnim Yeong Ho, Mr. Coach!

309
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,510
Let go!  Manager Min!

310
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,320
Hyungnim Yeong Ho!

311
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,230
Let me just see him once.  I just want to see him once to make sure he's okay.

312
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,180
Let go.

313
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,330
Chief Secretary Min, I'll just see his face and then I'll go.

314
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,030
Hyungnim!

315
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,320
Hyungnim Yeong Ho, it's me!

316
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,440
Hyungnim Yeong Ho ...

317
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,990
Mr Coach, it's me! 
   9 Missed texts from Oh My Venus. 

318
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:34,420
Hyungnim Yeong Ho!

319
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,100
 Is there something wrong? 

320
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,410
 Where are you? 

321
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,110
 Hyungnim Yeong Ho, Mr. Coach!

 Please answer me.

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,290
 Just say one word! 

325
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,420
 Are you hurt badly? 

326
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,510
 I'm going.

Please, just let me see his face!

331
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,210
I'll just see that he's okay, please?
 ♬  Is that something that's so hard for a woman    ♬

332
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,360
 Yeong Ho!  
 ♬   I want to find only her now.  ♬

333
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,220
 Coach! 
 ♬   I want to search only for  her now.  ♬

334
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,560
Hyungnim Yeong Ho!

335
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:36,550
♬  Such a woman might not exist anywhere  ♬

336
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,200
 Tap
Tap 

337
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,020
♬   The woman who loves that man.   ♬

338
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:51,340
♬    I am searching for a woman like that    ♬

339
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,820
♬   Such a woman   ♬

340
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,380
 Let's hurry and go to the hospital! 
♬   might not exist anywhere   ♬

341
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:04,490
♬   Are you the one I'm searching  for?   ♬

342
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,080
 Tap tap. When a person says 'tap tap', it means to let them go. 

343
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,600
 Tap tap 
♬   Are you the one?  Are you the one? ♬

344
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,940
♬   I can wait for you   ♬

345
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:28,070
♬   If perhaps that kind of love comes to me   ♬

346
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,160
 Tap. Tap.    

347
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,600
♬  Could you be that love? ♬

348
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,320
Step aside.

349
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,090
Hyungnim Yeong Ho?

350
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,870
Mr. Coach,

351
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,820
it's me.

352
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,280
It's really childish,

353
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,500
if you say 'tap tap', what am I supposed to do with that?!

354
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,250
Waiting...

355
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,610
I know it's hard for me.

356
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,910
I know that's why you're doing this.

357
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,570
But,

358
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,250
I'm not an easy woman.

359
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,080
Whenever you come,

360
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,630
or however you come,

361
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,660
I'll wait so

362
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,900
you have make sure to come back.

363
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,410
Prettily and

364
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,050
sexily.

365
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,080
 Don't get hurt, 

366
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,180
 because to me, that's the prettiest thing. 

367
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,550
 And being healthy is the sexiest. 

368
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,820
You have to make sure to come back.

369
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,350
Remember.

370
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,870
If you're enduring it, you're not at your limit.

371
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,230
That if you believe you can do it that you can.

372
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,940
It's okay for you to be hurt,

373
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,130
Even if you're less pretty,

374
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,210
even if you're less sexy, it's fine.

375
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,880
You   have   to come back!

376
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,900
I'm sorry.

377
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,280
That I didn't tell you earlier how much I love you.

378
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,230
♬   I think I'm in love   ♬

379
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,760
♬    I think I like you  ♬

380
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:35,610
♬   From the love that found me again,  although I'm a little bit afraid  ♬

381
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:41,980
♬   I can't escape   ♬

382
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,830
♬   So what if it hurts a little bit?   ♬

383
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:54,760
♬   It's that I love you   ♬

384
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,290
♬   On both the day when I want to see you, and on the day sometimes when I want to cry   ♬

385
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:08,010
♬    Please stay by my side!  ♬

386
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,460
♬   That's the way love is   ♬

387
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,530
♬    You came to soothe my wounds ♬

388
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,220
♬   You came to soothe my wounds  ♬

389
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:27,030
Thank you. I'll leave him to you. 
♬   That's how love is.    Please become the light on my path.  ♬

390
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:32,070
I will take care of him with all my power.

391
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,140
♬   I think I'm in love  ♬

392
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:45,950
♬   I'm going to love you.  ♬

393
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:52,340
♬   Both on the day when I want to see you   ♬ 
♬   and the day when I sometimes want to cry  ♬

394
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:58,300
♬   Please stay at my side.  ♬

395
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:05,790
♬   That's how love is dazzling.  ♬

396
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,770
Mother.

397
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,270
Stay like that.

398
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,530
I heard what happened.

399
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,810
When I think of Director Choi,

400
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,470
it wouldn't be enough even if I ripped him to pieces and killed him,

401
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:49,170
since my child is in that state.

402
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,830
I'm sorry, Mother.

403
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:03,100
I heard that it was thanks to you, my Yeong Ho was able to survive.

404
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,570
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry.

405
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:22,910
Just... as a tie that is forever gone, it's a tie that should be cut off in this life.

406
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,130
I think that's the path that's best for both of us.

407
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,680
Take care of yourself.

408
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,620
Live well.

409
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:15,940
I don't think I can go to our Yeong Ho today.

410
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,040
 Please save me.  

411
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,750
 This... this guy held me back. 

412
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,940


413
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:02,930
I took Yeong Joon to the residence for now, and you can live there with him when you're discharged.

414
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,990
I talked to Star Im, so he'll know how to take care of it.

415
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,770
Oppa.

416
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,530
It was osteosarcoma, what Executive Director Kim Yeong Ho had.

417
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:29,610
He spent half his life in the hospital receiving surgeries and rehabilitation.

418
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,200
That's how he lived.

419
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,430
Without a mother, at a young age, alone.

420
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,420
He's Yeong Joon's older brother. He's my husband's son.

421
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,190
Why did you resolve to be so vicious, Oppa?

422
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,580
In this world, there's only you and me.

423
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,590
If I don't protect you then who would, also your son.

424
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,900
My nephew, Yeong Joon, who would protect him if I don't?

425
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,170
Oppa,

426
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,580
it was a picture that didn't fit from the beginning.

427
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,040
It was a family that was broken into pieces.

428
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,380
but since there's someone I can call Mother...

429
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,700
Although he's brusque, because he's an upright husband...

430
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,590
Because I'm Yeong Joon's mother,

431
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,800
I was happy.

432
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,650
You stupid girl.

433
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:22,920
If you just sign, then Executive Director Kim Yeong Ho's mistake and Director Choi's mistake will all be taken care of with a fine.

434
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,730
 Traffic Accident Personal Injury Agreement 

435
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,310
Star Im.

436
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,820
Good work.

437
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,100
It was nothing, Director.

438
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,790
I meant to hit balls with you once.

439
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,160
I'll make sure to take you out once.

440
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,760
Good work. Go in.

441
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:22,150
Don't you hate me a little because I got a settlement from your superior?

442
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,490
We're doing what we have to do.

443
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,520
What kind of tea do you want?

444
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
I'm okay.

445
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:41,260
The VVIP medical center was something you were promoting with Director Choi, right?

446
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,290
Yeah.

447
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:50,810
Since I'm on Executive Director Kim Yeong Ho's external legal team, I was forced to look it over.

448
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,540
It's a little...

449
00:48:53,630 --> 00:49:00,300
The site selection and corporate management weren't quite clear.

450
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:07,860
So that's why you thought it looked like I had a grudge against Executive Director Kim Yeong Ho, isn't it?

451
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,540
Yeah.

452
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:20,570
The Im Woo Sik I know was a national athlete that I could be proud of, who did his best only within his lane.

453
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,630
And what happened there?

454
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:34,380
I just had the wish that the Gahong that I worked for so long to be the best in some way.

455
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,760
Even if there are some parts inside of there that aren't quite clear, then let's just gloss over it as if you didn't see it.

456
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,750
About the PD Go matter,

457
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:52,490
since the goal was so certain, beyond that everything else looked like wrong opportunity.

458
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:58,840
The parachuter that fell with a gold spoon in his mouth was annoying as well.

459
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,880
When do you get off work?

460
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,670
Let's eat dinner together.

461
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,620
I went one round with Joo Eun.

462
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,420
What?

463
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,800
Women also do that to resolve things.

464
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,750
Ah, you were so startled.

465
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,600
You are also becoming scary.

466
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,340
Joo Eun told me

467
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,880
that you probably had real feelings towards me.

468
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,490
She said something about you not being someone who would fall for someone seducing you.

469
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,620
It's a little less difficult to talk about Joo Eun now.

470
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,290
So, are you okay now?

471
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,950
Yeah!

472
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,870
Let's go eat something delicious.

473
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,590
Okay.

474
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,820
Resignation letter.

475
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:48,640
 2015 Year of the Ram, The Year of the Green Ram 

476
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,760
What's the reason for eating rice cake soup while listening to the New Year's bell?

477
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,410
It's not good to eat late at night.

478
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,420
The store closes at this time. What are we supposed to do? Starve?

479
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,290
Do you want to eat more?

480
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,800
Yes, Oppa. I mean, Bok Doongie's dad.

481
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,480
Just one second.

482
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,450
Bok Doonhgie's Dad?  Sheesh, you say all sorts of things.

483
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,480
Is there something wrong?

484
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,980
Yes, so nobody bother me.

485
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,240
Your unni always has kind of a bad temper. Just bear with her.

486
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,850
Okay.

487
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,020
Oh no, she seems to have a gentle personality.

488
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,310
Oh, what a far-fetched thing to say.

489
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,210
I don't have any memory of you being gentle.

490
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,200
Eat a lot.

491
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,900
Eat a little bit of everything evenly.

492
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,260
Why aren't you introducing me to the man you're chatting and giggling with?

493
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,500
Are you not going to get married?

494
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,190
Why wouldn't I get married?

495
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,240
He's going to appear soon. Just wait a little bit.

496
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,090
 Oh, you're showing your back to me, so I should give you a back hug? 

497
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,080
 Okay 

498
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,150
 Meticulous Daegu Venus's medicine. 

499
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:41,420
♬  I didn't know that it would be so painful   ♬

500
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,860
♬  I didn't know I would want to see you so much  ♬

501
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:51,720
 Meticulous me, often forgets to take my hypothyroid medication. 

502
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,690
 Even though I'm that forgetful... 

503
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,120
 Hyung how did you— 

504
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:03,070
 Because it feels like I just met that person yesterday. 

505
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,640
♬  I enjoyed the time I had with you  ♬

506
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,930
 Even if you get angry and you feel like cursing, stop for just a moment. 

507
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:16,140
♬  I was happy if you smiled looking at me  ♬

508
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,020
  It looks good, your leg  

509
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,060
♬  Just like that  ♬

510
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,660
 I'm remembering to exercise 

511
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:28,110
 Tighten your waist.  Straighten your back. 

512
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,760
 Look forward. 

513
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,820
 I didn't forget and avoided bad posture. 

514
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:42,320
 In this position, as if someone's pressing on your forehead, don't lift your chin.  For five seconds. 

515
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,430
 Though I eat a heap of greens frequently, 

516
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:54,200
 multiple times a day, because I am worried about that person, 

517
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,770
 often at the most ridiculous times, I burst into tears. 

518
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:07,580
♬  Why is it now that I happened to meet you?  ♬

519
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,760
I'm sorry.
 ♬  The person who would make  ♬

520
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,840
♬  wounded me happy   ♬

521
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,470
Lawyer, is something the matter?

522
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:19,560
I'm sorry! Why am I acting like this, seriously?

523
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,270
I've lived this way for 20 years.

524
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,870
It doesn't matter to me whether I get divorced tomorrow or the day after that.

525
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,800
It's okay, it's okay!

526
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,670
♬  Because you are everything to me  ♬

527
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,750
It'll be okay right?

528
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,200
It's really going to be okay, right?

529
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,880
Of course.

530
00:55:53,510 --> 00:56:00,800


531
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,960
 On January 1st 2015, the price of cigarettes went up to $2.00. 

532
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,630
 On Februrary 26th, the adultery law was abolished. 

533
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,890
 In May, the first person to contract MERS appeared. 

534
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,350
 Joon Seong, how do you feel? 
 Just give us one word to tell us how you feel. 

535
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,420
 On August 15th, Joon Seong became the RFC Champion. 

536
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,730
 Please tell us what your plans are for the future? 

537
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,880
 Even though Ji Woong has failed for the sixth time to get into the Marines, he's decided to try again. 

538
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,360
 So, don't cry. 

539
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,960
 Because everyone is living by holding on and enduring. 

540
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:11,050
 In that way, we all spent 2015 holding on. 

541
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,210
 And today is December 24th 2015. 

542
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,730
 That man continues to be 

543
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,420
 everywhere 

544
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:46,650
 and nowhere. 

545
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,930
It's been a long time, Kang Joo Eun.

546
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,220
You must be real... This person.

547
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,590
♬   Leaving only pain,   ♬

548
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:20,180
♬   It leaves.  Love is like that.   ♬

549
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:26,220
♬   It makes me come closer to you.   ♬

550
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:33,770
♬    I must be in love,   ♬

551
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,030
♬   I must like you   ♬

552
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,640
♬   Because of the love that found me again,   ♬

553
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,610
♬   I'm afraid   ♬

554
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:49,100
♬   I can't avoid it   ♬
