00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,270
 Oh My Venus 
Episode 16 

2
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,180
I want to put this ring on you. Can you come from there to here?

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,990
Really...

4
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,220
Kang Joo Eun, perhaps,

5
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,240
I might hurt you a little bit

6
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,840
and I might make it hard on you sometimes,

7
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,470
but I still want to live with Kang Joo Eun forever.

8
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,880
Kang Joo Eun is now mine.

9
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,010
♬   I think I'm in love  ♬

10
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,840
♬   I think I like only you  ♬

11
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,160
♬   Both on the day when I want to see you
And on the day when I sometimes want to cry  ♬

12
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,650
♬   Please stay at my side.  ♬

13
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,230
♬   That's how love is dazzling.  ♬

14
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,290
Stop looking at it. The ring will wear out.

15
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,260
You called me wicked, but you're more wicked.

16
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,730
How did you think of putting a scarf on a ring?

17
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,440
Eh?

18
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,100
I put the ring on the scarf.

19
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,640
Wrong. The main is the scarf.

20
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,850
The ring can be bought with money,

21
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,350
but the scarf was knitted strand-by-strand by you.

22
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,170
The ring is a separate bonus supplement that comes along with the scarf.

23
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,630
I'm leaving. Don't get out.

24
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,630
I told you not to get out.

25
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,390
- Since you're so very meticulous, 
- Ah...

26
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,290
Relay to these sexy and cute kids in here that we'll be seeing them very shortly.

27
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,320
But why Growing Sprout's place?

28
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,490
I'm going to show off my ring.

29
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,070
If you think it'll get too late, just sleep over.

30
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,230
- To Grandmother and Father, I'll—
- Aigoo

31
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,590
You're very rash.

32
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,390
Step by step. Let's take it one step at a time, slowly.

33
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,750
No matter what others say, I'm going to live with you forever

34
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,070
so that no one gets hurt.

35
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,950
Let's do it this way.

36
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,810
It must be so nice for the guy dating Kang Joo Eun.

37
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,850
He loves me so much that he says that I'm pretty enough to be featured in his dreams every night.

38
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,050
He has hearts pouring out of his eyes.

39
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,450
I'll be leaving now.

40
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,670


41
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,470
Why?

42
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,170
- Hyun Woo.
- Yeah?
- Ow, my head.

43
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,330
Ow, my head.

44
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,930
Oh my gosh.

45
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,370
I got a ring from the guy dripping with sexiness.

46
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,170
Did you come here to show off your ring to a divorcee?

47
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,400
But, Gahong's Chairwoman wants to see me.

48
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,660
His Grandmother.

49
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,420
What should we do? Is she, by chance, going to bury you in the ground?

50
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,100
Hey!

51
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,220
Get away from my grandson immediately!

52
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,690
You surprised me.

53
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,680
Hey, let's not imagine to that extent.

54
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,380
No?

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Just do it like how it was when you met your mother-in-law for the first time.

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Hey, if Go PD's grandmother was Gahong's Chairwoman, why would I have divorced?

57
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
Aigoo, really.

58
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,970
I'm really completely scared.

59
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,390
How old are you?

61
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm about the peak age of 33 years old.

62
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,930
What's your occupation? What does your father do?

63
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,870
I'm a lawyer.

64
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,870
My father passed away.

65
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't want to do this.

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,590
Why?

67
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,630
My heart is suddenly starting to hurt.

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,030
What am I going to do?

69
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,350
Just give her an allowance.

70
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,510
When I think about it, my mother-in-law was most happy when I gave her allowance.

71
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,450
Are you sick somewhere? She's Gahong Group's Chairwoman.

72
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,420
Even if I offered my entire earthly possessions, would it be enough for her allowance?

73
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,370
That's true.

74
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,740
It must be so nice for her.

75
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,280
Ah!

76
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,910
What?

77
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,600
It's totally modest.

78
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,980
The embarrassment only lasts a moment, Joo Eun.

79
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,590
What changes if I wear this?

80
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,340
The impression changes.

81
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,940
First impression is most important. This is my mother-in-law's favorite outfit. Thankfully, it was here.

82
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,590
Isn't it too old?

83
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,360
Gahong's Chairwoman is older.

84
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,210
She's the age to consider this type of thing modest.

85
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,670
That's true.

86
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,360
I don't think this is it.

87
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,090
Why?

88
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Let's have another sedative (supplement).

89
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,710
Aren't you taking too many?

90
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,720
  Hey. There's no report from you that you're going to sleep well. 

91
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,160
 Right, good night. 

92
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,130
It's too late to sleep well.

93
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,230
Ms. Lawyer, someone named Jae Soon Ja is here.

94
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,640
Escort her in.

95
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm thankful, but I don't have anything to give you.

96
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,660
It was alright, but thank you, Min Joon's Grandmother.

97
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,650
Ah, Joon Seong's Mother.

98
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,120
How is your husband?

99
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,760
I recently went to go visit him in jail,

100
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,030
and he got a lot better.

101
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,960
He says that he's sorry.

102
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,150
That's a relief.

103
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,070
More than just getting a restraining order, divorcing, and suing,

104
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,080
I thought it would be better for him to receive treatment.

105
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,300
That's right.

106
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,940
I should have thought of treatment sooner.

107
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,900
Joon Seong appears happy, and I'm happy also.

108
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,960
I have a son.

109
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,870
My son's girlfriend's cute ways are so pretty also.

110
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,120
I wonder if it's okay for me to enjoy these things.

111
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,250
You have plenty of right to do that.

112
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll use it well.

113
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,450
Yes, come in.

114
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,000
What brings you here?

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Ah, I was just passing by.

116
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,910
Can I sit down?

117
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,370
Yes.

118
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,350
I understand that you're commencing work at the beginning of next month.

119
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,060
I want to see the materials to review and the business plans.

120
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,550
I'm a gold spoon nakhasan (nepotism beneficiary). If I play around too much I'm afraid I'll be cursed at.

121
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,250
I heard that you received a lot of injuries in your athlete days.

122
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,330
Yes, and that's why I retired.

123
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,430
Where did you rehabilitate?

124
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,810
Mostly, Japan and the United States. France also. Why?

125
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,310
That's a relief.

126
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,040
What?

127
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
It's The Rehabilitation Center's annex associated with next year business plan.

128
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,410
There will be objections from the directors due to low profits.

129
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,040
That's why I came to ask you a favor.

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,410
To be on my side.

131
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,120
Do you believe in me?

132
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,040
It's not that I trust you. It's more that I trust your experience.

133
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,940
Since a person who has been broken and ripped will know.

134
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,660
That it's not that easy to

135
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,000
heal from injuries.

136
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,080
Like cancer or a major disease,

137
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,370
that it's a long and tiring battle.

138
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,280
How is Director Choi doing?

139
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,170
Wait a minute.

140
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,950
  I heard that due to a fresh new game you don't even know that the axe handle is rotting away. 

141
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,410
 Let's see each other at the company once. This is Kim Yeong Ho. 

142
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Play.

143
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,990
It's Janggi!  (br)  (Name for Korean Chess, "It's the general!") 

144
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,790
All that work for a checkmate.

145
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,040
I've learned a move well.

146
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm Kang Joo Eun.

147
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,790
Oh, no, no, no, wait.

148
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,450
Chairwoman, Kang Joo Eun has arrived.

149
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,410
Escort her in.

150
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,850
If you're trying to give me an envelope,

151
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,540
I'll give one to you first.

152
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,830
It's not money.

153
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,540
It's my blood results report.

154
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,790
I was hypothyroid until a month ago.

155
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,760
One month ago,  I was cured of it.

156
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,180
I just wanted to tell you that.

157
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,970
Whether you give me a sum of money large enough to live off of for the rest of my life,

158
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,580
or if you embarrass me.

159
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,220
Anyway, no matter how you object,

160
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:30,700
I cannot separate from Yeong Ho.

161
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,110
No matter how much you are against it,

162
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:42,200
still I will live next to Yeong Ho.

163
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,790
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,260
When you get older, you get more stubborn.

165
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Also, when you get older,

166
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,020
you have to wipe your mouth more often.

167
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,290
Chairwoman.

168
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,830
Miss Kang Joo Eun.

169
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,540
Yes?

170
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,830
Except for your clothing right now there's nothing else I'm thinking of objecting to.

171
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,260
Thank you.

172
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,700
I wanted to appear modest. I'm sorry.

173
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,370
However,

174
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,450
I have a condition.

175
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,990
A condition?

176
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,390
I want to receive a rather large wedding gift.

177
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,530
 It's okay for you to be sick so 

178
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,020
 you have to make sure to return. 

179
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,870
 Remember that if you can still bear it, 

180
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,410
 you haven't reached your limit yet. 

181
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,700
 If you believe, then you can do it. 

182
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,790
 I'm sorry. 

183
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,310
 That I didn't tell you earlier 

184
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,950
 how much I love you. 

185
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,370
Hyung, Yi Jin received an award.

186
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,890
The popular star award.

187
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,750
Also, during her award speech, she said, "I love you, JJS."

188
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,120
That is totally Jang Joon Seong. That is you.

189
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,290
I'm sorry sorry. You're a popular star's boyfriend.

190
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,750
What are you talking about? Let's go to the gym.

191
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,550
I'm your fan! You stupid fool!

192
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,830
- Please stop doing that.
 - You stupid fool!

193
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,580
Hi.

194
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,740
What is this?

195
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,370
Your handcuff.

196
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,630
Since you're locked up in jail with me.

197
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,790
There might be other people here so in the future don't come in so abruptly.

198
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,350
Did you hear my award speech?

199
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,540
From Ji Woong.

200
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,790
Until when are you going to make me a sunflower (to gaze at a you one-sidedly)?

201
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,740
Since I liked you a whole lot more I chased you around for a year like a crazy person.

202
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,610
It's not wrong to like someone.

203
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,160
Now I feel like I may be hurt.

204
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,990
Yi Jin.

205
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,120
What?

206
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,880
I normally don't usual casual speech often, and I don't easily drop people's last names when I call their names.

207
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,420
What is it?

208
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,860
When a man does something he doesn't normally do it means that he has feelings for...

209
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,370
Wait!

210
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,160
If I listen longer, I think that I'm going to faint from happiness.

211
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:38,770
 If you aren't busy, after you're done, come home. Don't rush too much. 

212
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,130
Kang Joo Eun.

213
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,450
I met your grandmother today.

214
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,940
You should've told me.

215
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,430
Are you okay?

216
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,860
Your grandmother...

217
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,410
I'll take care of it.

218
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,660
You can't take care of it.

219
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,890
Your grandmother is expecting a large wedding gift.

220
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,170
What?

221
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,260
Then, she wasn't against the marriage?

222
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,050
But, wedding gift?

223
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,040
Dad.

224
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,100
Great-grand children.

225
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,140
What?

226
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,930
♬   I’m feeling so good   ♬

227
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,890
I'm a woman who learned jujitsu for six months. I have three stripes. 
 ♬  Everything is so fine, It's like flying  ♬

228
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,980
♬  When I think of you I am again,    
  unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

229
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,340
I can't resist. 
 ♬   Thinking of her every morning, I  ♬

230
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,770
Three stripes? 
♬   even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo.  ♬

231
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,760
You have to have one more stripe to be a green belt.
♬   Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

232
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,790
So?

233
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,510
If you get 4 stripes, I'll think about it then.
♬  Yeah, I think it still shows,   ♬

234
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,150
Eh?

235
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,160
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

236
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,810
For now, I think we'd better have a different type of body dialogue.

237
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,320
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

238
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,130
♬   So beautiful, so beautiful. So beautiful, you know know know yeah~   ♬

239
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,230
Tap, tap. Okay.
♬   To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

240
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,970
Just watch what happens when I get that 4th stripe!

241
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,320
Hey, what are those two doing right now?

242
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,270
Here I come.

243
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,590
It seems like it's affection. It also seems like an action scene. Ah, whatever.

244
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,560
♬   All day every day she lingers  ♬

245
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,440
♬   Laughing like a fool, hoo hoo hoo  ♬

246
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,720
♬   Even if I act like it's nothing, yeah  ♬

247
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,870
♬   I can't hide it  ♬

248
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,740
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady. Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful  ♬

249
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,240
Awaiting that stripe.

250
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,370
You jerks! Where is your father, huh?!

251
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:56,040
♬   In my head it's always complicated   
(I'm afraid that she is leaving) ♬

252
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,000
♬   Even if I don't dislike it  ♬

253
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,950
Ah, that scared me. Kang Joo Eun, please.

254
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,900
♬   Wherever she goes,   ♬  

255
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,190
Four stripes.

256
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,220
First, let me change my clothes.

257
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,190
When you're going to take it off anyway, why bother changing?

258
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,460
Are you sure you got this officially? After I confirm it.

259
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,320
We're going to the head house tomorrow. My wedding gift!

260
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,760
♬   You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

261
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,770
For now, only a comfortable and racy night, okay?

262
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,800
♬   ​You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

263
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,130
Okay. 
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eye off  ♬

264
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,970
Welcome.

265
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,260
I'll offer my New Year's bow to you Grandmother, Father.

266
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,240
We follow the lunar calendar so let's just eat. 
   (That is, it's not new year's day) 

267
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,540
Bring her.

268
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,240
Well, are you shooting a historical drama?

269
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,450
Chief Secretary Min, did I overreact?

270
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,330
A little. Please eat.

271
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,920
Could there be anything else you need?

272
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm okay.

273
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
I'm okay. You can rest.

274
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,730
Yes.

275
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,700
- I think my stomach is a little upset.
 - Really?

276
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,910
Enough to take some medicine?

277
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,350
No, just very slightly.

278
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,970
Hand.

279
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,580
It's treatment, don't misunderstand.

280
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,220
I never said anything.

281
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,080
Are you okay?

282
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,900
It hurts.

283
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,430
However, is it normally this quiet in the house?

284
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,100
Well, almost.

285
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,640
Today there is a precious guest so it's a little on the commotion side.

286
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,940
Commotion?

287
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,030
Where is Grandmother?

288
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,600
In her room.

289
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,460
What about your father?

290
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,820
In his room?

291
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,440
This won't do. I already received the okay as the granddaughter, right?

292
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,590
You did.

293
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,610
What are you going to do?

294
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,960
Grandmother, Father, and Secretary Min. 2016.

295
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,200
I will submit this one song for your health and to wish you good fortune.

296
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,400
Um, Kang Joo Eun, please think this over just one more time...

297
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,390
Chief Secretary Min, cue.

298
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,560
♬  At age sixty if the other world came for me,

299
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,630
♬  I would still be too young,

300
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,630
♬ so tell them that I can't go,

301
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:12,270
♬ At age seventy if the other world came for me,

302
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,300
♬ There is still work left me to do

303
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,120
♬ so tell them that I can't go,

304
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:27,990
♬ At age eighty if the other world came for me,

305
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,030
♬ I'm still useful

306
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,710
♬ so tell them I can't go,

307
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,210
♬ At age ninety...

308
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,610
That's enough. Come here. Grandmother, Father. This person...

309
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,330
If they come for me tell them I can't go?!

310
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,060
I was only able to do until eighty because you cut me off in the middle.

311
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,780
You're telling me to live  that  long?

312
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,550
Yes, Grandma. Originally, this song has up to150 years.

313
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:20,620
♬ We will all live together healthily,

314
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,060
Ah, that's how it was supposed to end, but you cut me off in the middle.

315
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,280
Yeah.

316
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,780
Now, to celebrate the beginning of 2016.

317
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,210
We're going to gather our faces towards Grandmother and make her the pretty focus.

318
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,180
Father, I'm sorry, but crumple your face significantly.

319
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,140
- Secretary Min, it's not an identification photo.
 - Yes.

320
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,740
What am I supposed to do?

321
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,780
You just have to smile prettily. Now.

322
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,080
One, two, three. Got you!

323
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,010
I feel like dying.

324
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,150
Aigoo. You've worked hard, Kang Joo Eun.

325
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,600
The elders think I'm weird don't they?

326
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,330
Very strange, but in your own way you make them smile.

327
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,830
I've almost never seen Grandmother or Father laugh like that.

328
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,040
Still, it's a little...

329
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,550
The more I get to know you the more astonishing you become.

330
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,040
The thing is, Kang Joo Eun...

331
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,950
It's because of the bone cancer, right?

332
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,010
That's why you are hesitant to have a child.

333
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,200
When I was young I resented my father a lot.

334
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,100
He had to put me in surgery starting a very young age.

335
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,390
And because of the pain I cried every day.

336
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,370
And there was no going easy on me regarding rehabilitation either.

337
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,620
I won't live like my father,

338
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,830
I promised myself that every night.

339
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,040
But now I realize that it's not that I didn't want to live that way,

340
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,690
I just didn't have the confidence

341
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,290
to live that way. That's probably more accurate.

342
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:16,010
When I looked into it, there's little chance of it being passed down.

343
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,660
Even a small possibility makes me nervous and that's what an illness does.

344
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,450
Being in pain is not easy.

345
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,480
It's not just the sick kid who suffers,

346
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,830
the parents also suffer with him.

347
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,790
It would be difficult for Kang Joo Eun.

348
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,700
Not letting that stop us and giving it a try,

349
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,830
not letting that stop us and having faith,

350
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,640
and also working hard for it,

351
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,370
isn't that what living is?

352
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,830
What in life is guaranteed?

353
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,000
If you walk, there's a chance you might fall.

354
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:12,530
Just because we might be unhappy is no reason to not be happy, right?

355
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,790
I'm going crazy because of you.

356
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,000
A daughter who is fair-skinned and pretty like Hyungnim Yeong Ho,

357
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,080
a son who has a good physique like me,

358
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,370
I want to give birth to them.

359
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,020
As we watch those kids grow up,

360
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,230
"Look at what your dad is doing."

361
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,210
I want to curse about Coach-nim like that.

362
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,870
And I want to make it so that Hyungnim Yeong Ho hears himself being called dad.

363
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,060
♬  Love Is You ♬

365
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,250
In any case, you are a woman who can't be beaten, Kang Joo Eun.

368
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,430
Daughter?
♬   I'm not confident that I won't laugh  ♬

369
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,710
- Twins?
- What?

370
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,660
♬   you're looking at my eyes  ♬

371
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,840
As long as we're doing this, how about enough to make a soccer team?
♬  I get the feeling♬ 

372
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,410
That's possible for me.

♬  it's likely I will fall in love.   ♬

♬  it's likely I will fall in love.   ♬

375
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,030
 For our bright future. 

376
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,730
 I took a bit of the round about way,  

377
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,050
  but from now on, for Oh Soo Jin, I will run straight non-stop. 

378
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,410
 Getting pregnant may be very difficult for you.  

379
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,830
 Oh Soo Jin is not pregnant. 

380
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,910
 It might be very difficult for her to become pregnant. 

381
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
 I'm not pregnant. 

382
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,410
 There's no reason I would be, 

383
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,700
 and I don't want to be. 

384
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,620
Yes?

385
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,850
 Gahong Group 

386
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,160
How did you know?

387
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,170
I should know. I'm your son.

388
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,520
- Thank you.
- Yes. Then.

389
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,290
Then, I'll be going, Father.

390
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,250
Okay.

391
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,410
Thanks.

392
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,960
Come in.

393
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,830
Please take good care of Father.

394
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,620
Thank you.

395
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,950
Hello, Executive Director.

396
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,950
It's not Executive Director.

397
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,950
Hyung.

398
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,620
You should exercise a bit.

399
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,240
Yeong Joon.

400
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,250
Yes, Father.

401
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,370
Your major, make it medicine.

402
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,660
If my two sons protect the hospital,

403
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,930
I would be very assured.

404
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,660
Yes, Father.

405
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,040
What's going on when Joo Eun isn't even here?

406
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,170
The last time I saw you,

407
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,590
it look liked you had carpal tunnel syndrome.

408
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,990
Oh my. You came on purpose.

409
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,150
You must go to the hospital, and at home, you have to take care of yourself everyday.

410
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,390
I got it, I got it. I might not listen to my daughter, but I'd better listen to my son-in-law.

411
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,030
When the pain is severe,

412
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,940
wrap it up like this and give it a little pressure. You should feel less pain.

413
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,250
I heard you were very sick when you were young.

414
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,340
When you're hurt, it'll be alright to be hurting together.

415
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,200
When you're together, even when it hurts, it'll hurt less. It's like that.

416
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,000
For giving birth to Kang Joo Eun,

417
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,230
and for giving your permission, thank you, Mother.

418
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,920
Take good care of my Joo Eun, my son-in-law.

419
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,240
Yes.

420
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,780
You have to take good care of yourself.

421
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,590
I got it.

422
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,560
 Hi, Oh Soo Jin. Congratulations on passing the bar. 

423
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,960
 Let's go. 

424
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,870
 Not even an hour has passed since we've parted... 

425
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,140
 but I miss that certain woman... 

426
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,760
 and can't seem to endure the longing... 

427
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,550
 Being the worst jerk ever, seems to suit me the best right now. 

428
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,380
 To you, you see... 

429
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,160
 Even though you know I'm a jerk, yet you wait for me and shelter me... 

430
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,100
 Oh Soo Jin, you're the same as you were.  

431
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,040
♬   Now I want to search for him  ♬

432
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:43,130
 I'm sorry.
♬ Such a man might not exist anywhere.  ♬

433
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,620
 That's the phrase a woman hates to hear from a man the most. 

434
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:52,290
 So, you're sorry again, I guess.
♬  He only knows one woman  and  loves her ♬

435
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,230
 Soo Jin. 

436
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,850
 Going forward, let's say "sorry" over the phone.
♬  I'm searching for him. ♬

437
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,400
 I'm Im Woo Sik's lawyer, Oh Soo Jin.
♬  I'm searching for him. ♬

438
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,240
 Have we done anything more than embrace and kiss a couple of times? 

439
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,560
 - Soo Jin. 
 - Even with a relationship of 15 years, a man and a woman can become strangers in one morning. 

440
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,910
 You didn't think we would last forever, did you? 

441
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,850
 Then ...  

442
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,620
 Are you  

443
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,220
  coming in?  

444
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,350
 Hi, Woo Sik. 

445
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,840
 Woo Sik! You're hurt!  

446
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,910
♬   The sort of woman who just has faith only in me  ♬

447
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:44,310
♬     Is it something that's so hard for a woman  ♬

448
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:51,730
♬    I want to search for her now  ♬

449
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:59,110
♬     Such a woman might not exist anywhere  ♬

450
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:06,490
♬    A woman who only knows and loves one man  ♬

451
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:13,840
♬    I am looking for such a woman   ♬

452
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,930
♬    Do you know where she might be  ♬

453
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,060
Why are you walking by yourself when you have me?

454
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,690
Are you okay?

455
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,380
 I'm okay, are you okay? 

456
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,580
Let me say the words "I'm sorry," just one more time,

457
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,500
Since I've always been a jerk who only thinks about himself.

458
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,790
Woo Sik.

459
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,350
I love you, Soo Jin.

460
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,520
Let's get married.

461
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,890
Don't cry.

462
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,040

463
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,150

464
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,060

465
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,100


466
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,030


467
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,070


468
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,010


469
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,000


470
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,050


471
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,110


472
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,950
♬   Baby Only you  Whoo  ♬

473
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,230
♬   You are the only one Whoo  ♬

474
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,660
♬   You're mine  ♬

475
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,770
I just wanted to get rid of the bloat for tomorrow's studio shoot. 
 ♬   Darling u Whoo  ♬

476
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,090
What kind of crappy tough situation is this?

477
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,310
There's nothing better than running to get rid of the bloat.

478
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,080
Then what about my face? What about my skin?

479
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,000
Sweating while out in the cold clears out your pores and you get a lifting effect, too, okay?

480
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,470
You told me you were going to take me in matrimony and then you're treating me badly.

481
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:55,030
You said, "treating me badly" informally, and I'm not sure yet if I'm going to let you live with me.

482
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,960
Hey! 
  ♫ You. ♫ 

483
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,270
  ♫ You. ♫ 

484
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,370
♬   You will be my love forever  ♬

485
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,530
Go, go, go, go!

486
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,460
You're not going to let me live with you?

487
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,090
We'll have to see.

488
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,470
Like this, okay?

489
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,980
Whoa, ma'am!

490
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,610
Whoa!

491
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,120
The noble and pure, and modest, Miss Kang Joo Eun.

492
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,210
Doesn't a bride usually wear white on these occasions?

493
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,380
Is there a law that a bride has to wear white?

494
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,550
Shall we begin?

495
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,530
Manager Min too.

496
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,870
Let's go.

497
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:54,320
Let's go, let's go. Relax.

498
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,910
  We'll begin now.  

499
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,690
  ♫ Nobody get in my way ♫ &lt;/ 

500
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,850
Hold on, hold on.

501
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,390
♬   I’m feeling so good   ♬

502

♬   Everything is so fine  ♬

503
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:09,610
♬   It's like flying  ♬

504
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,290
♬  When I think of you  ♬

505
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,570
♬   I am again unconsciously humming La La La  ♬

506
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,930
♬  Thinking of her every morning  ♬

507
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,400
♬  I even do it in my sleep, hoo hoo hoo.  ♬

508
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,770
♬  Even If I act like it's nothing  ♬

509
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,950
♬  Yeah over and over I'm looking whether there's a flaw  ♬

510
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,900
♬  She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

511
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,450
♬  Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

512
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,570
​♬  You're my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

513

514
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,210
♬  so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

515
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,740
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

516
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,780
♬  To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

517
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,100
 Hey! 

518
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,610
  ♫ I take you. I take you down. ♫  

519
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,590
 It's Kim Yeong Ho. 

520
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,830
 Don't look.  

521
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,420
 Don't look at it. 

522
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,530
  I'll just have a green salad. No dressing.  

523
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,140
 If you hold the dressing, what taste are you eating your food for? 

524
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,120
 Do you eat food for the taste?.  

525
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,720
♬   All day every day she lingers  ♬

526
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,530
♬   Laughing like a fool, hoo hoo hoo  ♬

527
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,550
 Do you want to have dinner with me, or do you want to kiss me?  

528
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,470
 What? 

529
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,630
♬   Yeah I can't hide it  ♬

530
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:34,430
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady  ♬

♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off.  ♬

532
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,090
 I'm so hungry, Min Joon.

♬   Baby Only you  Whoo  ♬

535
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:52,190
 My nephew grew up like this. 

536
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,690
 I'm the Center General Manager, Im Woo Sik.  

537
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,060
 Please take care of me. 

538
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,970
 Did you just stick your tongue out in my palm? 

539
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,760
 Well, I was just talking and you clamped my mouth—  

540
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,960
 Excuse me. 

541
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,000
♬   I was unaware too. Falling u Whoo Falling u  ♬

542
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,420
 Well, since I'm going to lose it quickly.
 ♬   falling u I'm addicted  ♬

00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,610
♬  The words are clumsy to me  ♬

545
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:31,000
 I feel bad for our ma'am. She's the same. 
She's not losing weight. 

546
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,920
♬   You are mine  ♬

547
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,450
 Lawyer Kang. 

548
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,970
 I'm not okay, so just look ahead. 
♬   my baby only you Whoo  ♬

549
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,840
♬   You are the only one Whoo  ♬

550
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,340
 Out of the way.

 Let go.

558
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,400
 Summer 2016 

559
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,380
Yes, Grandmother.

560
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,170
Yes, I just arrived at the airport.

561
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:26,000
Yes, I'll go right away. Yes.

562
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,740
Pil Sung! (victory) Private first class, Kim Ji Woong. I am out on a 100th day leave from my unit.

563
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,100
Omo, Ji Woong!

564
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,250
Ma'am! Why did you become so pretty?

565
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,840
- I became pretty?
- Wow!

566
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,070
 Hyungnim Yeong Ho who is soft hearted toward anyone sick and is more so towards someone in danger; 

567
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,670
 the one and only coach in this world to me; 

568
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:51,450
 with the wedding set three months ahead for us, left for some flood stricken village somewhere on earth, and... 

569
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,470
Why isn't he coming?

570
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,050
Kang Joo Eun! Ji Woong!

571
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
 The day he returned. 

572
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,880
♬   You are my Venus  ♬

573
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,310
♬   My heart's Venus  ♬

574
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,380
Surprise!

575
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,020
♬   For me only you, only you, only you  ♬

576
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm three months pregnant, they said.

577
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,420
Congratulations, you two.

578
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,480
Then, we're uncles! Uncles!

579
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,950
♬   Before I knew it you approached me  ♬

580
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,700
Really?

581
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,270
♬   and are shaking up my heart  ♬

582
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,800
How many months did you say?

583
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,080
- Three months. 
 - Three months?

584
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,800
♬   for whom everyday was an uneasy day  ♬

585
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,930
How many kilograms did you gain?

586
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,880
Twenty six kilograms.

587
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,460
Because I have to eat well and rest well.

588
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,050
For the sake of our healthy ones.

589
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,130
Ones?

590
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,700
♬   Show me your feelings  ♬

591
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,410
It's twins!

592
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,030
- Twins.
- It's twins!

593
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,680
Twins. 
♬   You are my own Angels  ♬

594
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,900
♬   Why is it so bright  ♬

595
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,800
I'm really happy. I really like it, but...
♬   In my eyes only you, only you, only you  ♬

596
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,170
Let's go exercise.

597
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm not the one who's been eating, I'm telling you. Our healthy ones kept crying that they're hungry, so...

598
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:27,670
The healthy one— No, our healthy ones are not even 100 grams yet added together.

599
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,590
How are you going to fit into your wedding dress? I won't postpone the wedding.

600
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,450
Did someone say they were going to postpone it?

601
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,550
Then... you're going to wear it in this condition?

602
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,500
How Venus-like is it of me?

603
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,630
Don't you know that Venus is normally a goddess of beauty and voluptuousness?

604
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,410
How can this be accomplished in one month?

605
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,970
I can do anything I put my mind to because I'm Kang Joo Eun.

606
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:53,630
What woman makes it so hard to let a man let his guard down around her?     ♬ You are my Venus ♬

607
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,190
- Guys, get the bags.
- Yes sir!

608
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,800
Come quickly.

609
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,300
Ah, Oppa.

610
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,080
At this rate, it'll become very serious once you're full-term.

611
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,550
Ah, Honey.

612
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,630
It'll be difficult when you're giving birth. No.

613
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,030
How about a kiss because you're glad to see me?

614
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:11,990
♬   My heart's Venus  ♬

615
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,200
Cute, you are cute.
 ♬    For me only you, only you, only you.   ♬

616
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,600
But, what about my dimples?

617
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,520
Ah, they'll come back soon.

618
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,360
Since Mr. Coach has returned now.

619
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,530
Oh!

620
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,500
Let's go exercise.

621
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,340
Ah, Honey.

622
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,300
Babies are healthy?

623
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,560
 There are about 500,000 men in Korea with the last name Kim. 

624
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,310
 Amongst them, the most common name is Yeong Ho. 

625
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,420
 It seems ordinary but a special existence by your side, 

626
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,940
 with all the coaches of this world, 

627
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,890
 for all the world's Venuses who are dignified, yet wicked.  

628
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:58,050
 Now, towards the outside of all of your worlds. Boarding. Departing. 

629
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,840
♬   For me only you, only you, only you  ♬

630
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,100
 Are you in pain? 

631
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,600
 Now it won't hurt.  Believe me 

632
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,630
  How do you know? 

633
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,750
 If you believe, you can do anything. 

634
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,700
♬   That's how love is  ♬

635
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,920
♬   You left me only with pain  ♬

636
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:07,670
♬   Again, that's how love is.  ♬

637
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:16,400
♬   You are approaching with the wind silently  ♬

638
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,650
♬   To love someone  ♬

639
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,840
♬   To be going to resemble him again  ♬

640
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,780
♬   may even cause me to lose myself but  ♬

641
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,230
♬   That's how love is  ♬

642
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:39,420
♬   Crying and making you laugh  ♬
