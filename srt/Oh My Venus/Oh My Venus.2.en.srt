1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,583
Excuse me.

2
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,248
Help me.

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,970
-Help me.
-Every time you see me,

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,764
that's what you say.

5
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:19,713
You're not even going to thank me.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,513
What?

7
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,903
Do you want to start a fight with them?

8
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:34,977
What?

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,643
I mean with them...

10
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:48,632
If not, let's go.

11
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,347
If I caught a cold
because another man cheated,

12
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:53,297
I'd be upset.

13
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,977
Just leave.

14
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,522
I'm not stopping you.

15
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,046
-This...
-Help me.

16
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,950
It stopped me.

17
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:26,682
I know that
I might seem cold-hearted,

18
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,363
but I'm nicer than I look.

19
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:31,408
I can't walk past someone who's drowning.

20
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,394
I need to make sure they're okay.

21
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,145
I won't go anywhere near water.

22
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,963
So please, just leave.

23
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,823
You should come with me
when I'm asking you politely.

24
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:46,067
I hate the cold.

25
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:47,902
"Episode 2"

26
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:53,841
Look.

27
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,512
I am...

28
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:58,520
...weak when it comes to people in pain.

29
00:01:58,894 --> 00:01:59,777
But...

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,702
...I'm weaker when it comes to
people who are in danger.

31
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,644
Thank you,

32
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,736
but I can go on my own.

33
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:10,068
Put yourself in my shoes.

34
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:13,999
It's dark and it's raining.

35
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,059
Would you be able to leave
a woman alone here?

36
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,805
With a weapon like this
and with the way I'm feeling right now,

37
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,297
the dark and the rain don't scare me.

38
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:36,997
I could actually hurt someone
and go to prison for it.

39
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,886
Give me what belongs to me and leave.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,053
I'm not the type of woman
to leave things behind.

41
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:50,858
Okay.

42
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:54,898
Now that I think about it,
I think that you'll be just fine.

43
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,168
Thank you for understanding.

44
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:01,077
This is where we part ways.
Goodbye.

45
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,633
Hey!

46
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:36,175
Sir, may I help you?

47
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,466
No. Thank you.

48
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,196
"Departures"

49
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,188
I'll be back.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,210
Youngho.

51
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,524
My baby.

52
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:41,862
I'm sorry that I can't go with you.

53
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,767
Do you want to stop by
and see your mom first?

54
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:52,949
I'll see her after the surgery.

55
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:56,343
I'll be on my way now, Grandma.

56
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:57,995
Okay.

57
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,113
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

58
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,799
Yes, it's Jang Junseong.

59
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,406
Good morning.

60
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:54,790
It is, thanks to you.

61
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,395
Mr. Jang Junseong.

62
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,467
My efforts were for nothing.

63
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:02,676
Korea is still a small country,
especially for people with power.

64
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:09,024
Is there a chance that Grandma
doesn't know that I'm back?

65
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:10,612
Don't get your hopes up.

66
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,858
You may take your time getting ready.
I'll be outside.

67
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:20,245
Okay.

68
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,331
"Lee Hyunwoo"

69
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:42,631
Lee Hyunwoo?

70
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,950
The person cannot be reached.

71
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:57,930
Minjun.

72
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,869
Aunt Jooeun isn't picking up.

73
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,780
I didn't ask you to call her.

74
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:05,897
Ko Minjun.

75
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,619
Why are you being mean to me?

76
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:13,624
Why are you picking at your food?

77
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:17,346
Answer me.

78
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:22,532
Do you know what's wrong with him?

79
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:26,809
Yoona teased him for being fat.

80
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,507
I'm going to kindergarten.

81
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,662
You don't have to walk me to the bus stop.

82
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,957
Ko Minjun.
Break up with Yoona right away.

83
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,956
That girl. I'm going to...

84
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:37,917
I'll walk him to the bus stop.

85
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:39,936
I'm so upset.

86
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,888
Yoona used to say he was cute.
What's wrong with her?

87
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm so upset.

88
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:52,216
Why isn't Jooeun picking up?

89
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:02,135
How did you pay for the taxi?

90
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,635
I had some cash.

91
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,050
-Is everyone there?
-The vice president isn't here yet.

92
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:10,320
I thought he was coming tomorrow.

93
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,526
He's just coming to greet the team today.

94
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:12,778
Fix your hair.

95
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:14,609
-Did it start?
-Not yet.

96
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,147
Being an attorney doesn't mean much.

97
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,901
Passing the bar is like
winning the lottery.

98
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,282
There will be thousands of
law school graduates soon.

99
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,631
How is that like winning the lottery?

100
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:32,722
You undervalue yourself, Lawyer Kang.

101
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,357
I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well.

102
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,799
You're right.

103
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:46,515
You look very unwell.

104
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,118
It's because I went
to the U.S. over the weekend.

105
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:51,143
I apologize.

106
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,825
The vice president is here.

107
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,424
Let me introduce you.

108
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,512
She was a manager at
a world-famous law firm.

109
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:11,482
Please welcome Attorney Oh Soojin.

110
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,791
Oh Soojin?

111
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,156
Nice to meet you.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,295
My name is Oh Soojin.

113
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,712
Kang Jooeun?

114
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:34,795
Just look at her.

115
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,660
She got into law school with
the highest score.

116
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,263
Super Fatty.

117
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:43,945
At least she has the brains to
make up for her looks.

118
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,135
I know.

119
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:50,477
Is it okay for law students
to harass people like that?

120
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,240
-Who are you?
-Who else?

121
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,439
I'm Soojin's friend
and her future attorney.

122
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,412
Jooeun!

123
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,814
Those punks would be dead
if it weren't for you.

124
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:12,115
How did you get in
without a student ID card?

125
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,523
I'm going to be accepted as
a student someday.

126
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,064
They helped me get in today.

127
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,393
Look at these.

128
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:26,590
"To: Jihoon"

129
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,199
What's the point of writing fan letters?

130
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,617
You're only wearing out your hand.

131
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,929
I also heard that
you're not sleeping well.

132
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:39,016
Soojin, I'll help you sleep well.

133
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,194
What do you mean?

134
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:42,795
Lee Jihoon.

135
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,730
You said you wanted to see him.

136
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:02,429
You don't seem so happy to see me.

137
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,715
Are you jealous of me?

138
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,068
Sorry.

139
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,060
I was staring at you, wasn't I?

140
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,076
It's just that...

141
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,655
I'm sure you were shocked.

142
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,068
I was shocked too.

143
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,569
I'm talking about you becoming
an attorney.

144
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,780
Oh, I see.

145
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,091
Lawyer Kang, you must be happy...

146
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,797
...that your friend is
the new vice president.

147
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:41,996
"Friend"?

148
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:48,488
I was her senior in college.

149
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,318
Hyunjeong.

150
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,531
Yes.

151
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,497
My name is Jo Hyunjeong.

152
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,791
Nice to meet you.

153
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,474
Nice to meet you, too.

154
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:00,977
I'd like you to get me organic tea...

155
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,272
...in the future.

156
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:07,941
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,632
I'll get you organic tea in the future.

158
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:11,972
Excuse me.

159
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:17,002
Okay.

160
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,649
We'll have plenty of time to talk later.

161
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,379
I think we can wrap it up for now.

162
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:25,501
Sure.

163
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,619
Okay.

164
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:42,760
I'll see you around.

165
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:51,379
Lawyer Kang Jooeun speaking.

166
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,591
-Mr. Min.
-I'll take you there.

167
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,257
You don't need to.

168
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,095
I'm here on vacation.

169
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:14,888
I don't even have anything
appropriate to wear.

170
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:26,878
You're well-prepared,
but this isn't my style.

171
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,642
Your grandmother is waiting for you.

172
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:38,027
How is this? Do I look pretty?

173
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,911
Am I in trouble?

174
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,043
I can't say.

175
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,188
Did you do something wrong?

176
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,811
Give me a hint. Come on now.

177
00:13:57,423 --> 00:13:58,185
Okay?

178
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,180
You look pretty.

179
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,903
Fine. Then...

180
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:10,136
...I'll buy some new shoes...

181
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,386
...and get some presents, too.

182
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,150
It's exactly my style. I can't complain.

183
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,721
Tell me what's going on.

184
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,718
She's been waiting for a while.

185
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:59,118
I know. How rude of me.

186
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:01,949
Please go in. Your grandmother...

187
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,764
When did my grandmother...

188
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:06,988
...start wearing heels?

189
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:17,237
This is Kim Youngho. I'm coming in.

190
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,152
Hello.

191
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,479
Are you leaving for the day
or do you have a client meeting?

192
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:41,384
I'm taking the rest of the day off.

193
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,580
It's already four in the afternoon.

194
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:00,890
What a waste.
It's almost the end of the day.

195
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,811
Why don't you just wait a bit?

196
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,868
I haven't been feeling well
since yesterday.

197
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:12,642
It's not because of me, is it?

198
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:14,141
What?

199
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,688
I'm just kidding.

200
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,139
I understand that you can't seem
too happy to see me.

201
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,623
After all, we are at work.

202
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,172
It's not that.

203
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,725
I just don't want to mix
my personal life at work.

204
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,876
Hey, Soojin.

205
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:36,748
As your superior, it seems that
you are a good employee.

206
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,513
There were so many strange rumors
about you.

207
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,704
Some said you were very fat and ugly.

208
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:50,127
Some said I was gay,
a pervert or a psycho.

209
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:52,286
"He's actually a woman."

210
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,992
You must have been shocked
to hear such rumors.

211
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:57,001
My family was shocked...

212
00:16:57,522 --> 00:16:58,671
...more than I was.

213
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:02,128
I'm sure the rumors bothered them.
Especially since...

214
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,638
...your great-grandfather
was the founder of Gahong.

215
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:06,489
May I ask...

216
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,630
...if you are going to continue being...

217
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,377
...the regional director in
the United States?

218
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,664
I would like to.

219
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,461
I heard you're an oriental doctor.

220
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:17,834
I'm just certified.

221
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,811
It's a family tradition.

222
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,144
Excuse me.

223
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,014
"Anna Sue"

224
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,130
Sorry.

225
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:38,032
I'll see you again.

226
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:39,837
I hope so too.

227
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,450
That's what I'm talking about!

228
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,789
Okay. Mission success!

229
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,568
This is just like "Misery".

230
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,070
Are we shooting a movie or something?

231
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,308
Hey, where are we going?

232
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,016
To shoot a real movie.

233
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:09,505
"Lee Hyunwoo"

234
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:15,551
"You have 13 missed calls"

235
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,466
"A new text message from Lee Hyunwoo"

236
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:28,533
"This is the phone's owner.
Please call me. I'll repay you generously"

237
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,871
Hello?

238
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:34,104
-They answered.
-Took them long enough.

239
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,442
Hyunwoo's a woman?

240
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:37,083
Hello?

241
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,006
Thank you.

242
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:42,006
Where did you find my phone?

243
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,837
I found it in your bag.

244
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:48,805
I would've answered sooner
if I had known that...

245
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,297
...Hyunwoo was a woman.

246
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,218
I thought it was your boyfriend.

247
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:54,395
-Jooeun.
-Hello?

248
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:55,484
Jooeun.

249
00:19:56,501 --> 00:20:00,119
Did you take my cell phone?

250
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,324
I called the airport and
the emergency room looking...

251
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,802
So I've heard.

252
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,439
You are partially right,
but it wasn't me who took it.

253
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,525
I'm shopping right now...

254
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,303
And?

255
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:14,356
The support belt.

256
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,061
The one I ripped yesterday.

257
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:17,980
I am willing to reimburse you for it.

258
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:23,157
I said it's a corset. Corset.

259
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,276
Aren't you a doctor?
Why are you so stupid?

260
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,189
Hey.

261
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:28,284
I can still hear you.

262
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,088
Do you have a stethoscope attached
to your ears?

263
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:34,852
Are you just going to get
a new phone then?

264
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,125
I'm hanging up.

265
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:38,243
I can go to where you're at.

266
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,868
Don't come here.

267
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:42,787
Come to where I'm going to be
in an hour or so.

268
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,559
Excuse me.

269
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,803
-Yes.
-Give me 20 of these.

270
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:51,900
Including this one.

271
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:54,542
Let me see if we have them in stock.

272
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,360
Thank you.

273
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:56,976
What are you going to do with all these?

274
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,995
I feel bad sending you off alone.

275
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,343
-It's a small gift.
-I see.

276
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:04,628
Youngho.

277
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:08,651
Hello!

278
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,425
Are you still there?

279
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,921
I am so sorry.

280
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,261
I almost forgot about this call.

281
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,172
That looks good on you.

282
00:21:16,282 --> 00:21:17,688
That's okay.

283
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,290
It's my fault that I lost it.

284
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:23,361
Okay. Bye.

285
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:24,969
What did he say?

286
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,681
He sounds sexy.

287
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,954
He looks sexy too.

288
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,482
Thank goodness!

289
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,834
So, where does this Mr. Sexy Guy
want to see you at?

290
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:36,024
At a hotel.

291
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,752
Jooeun. That's a good place to go to.

292
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:43,440
I feel so embarrassed.

293
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:45,823
What's wrong with me?

294
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,585
Are you that embarrassed?

295
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:56,132
What's wrong with showing your belly
to a man you've never met?

296
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:57,715
Think about giving birth.

297
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:01,525
Doctors do a lot of things.

298
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,457
I don't even want to think about it.

299
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,427
I should have said that
it was nice to see her.

300
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:09,143
What?

301
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:13,093
It's a common phrase.
Everyone says it.

302
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,502
Why couldn't I think of that phrase then?

303
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:19,996
Are you talking about Soojin?

304
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:23,014
I didn't have to tell her that
she looks good,

305
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:25,105
but I should have at least said
that it was nice to see her again.

306
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,203
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

307
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,416
Hey.

308
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,585
She looks so much better,

309
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:34,272
while I've gotten fat.

310
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,311
But that doesn't change
the times we had together.

311
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,568
What is wrong with me?

312
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,184
Don't look!

313
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:10,132
You guys stay here.

314
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:19,952
Mr. Min.

315
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,807
The Champion is riding in this car.

316
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,251
You should have been careful.

317
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:27,196
From now on, you are on a tight leash.

318
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,037
I'm only staying here for a bit.
I'll be leaving soon.

319
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,743
Your belongings are being shipped...

320
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,026
...to Korea right now.

321
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:36,032
Mr. Min.

322
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,990
How much?

323
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,111
I paid double what was asked
to keep them quiet.

324
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:54,176
Also, you are relieved from your job
in the United States.

325
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:56,275
Who else knows about this?

326
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:58,080
It's just your grandmother and me
for the moment.

327
00:23:58,566 --> 00:23:59,901
Your father...

328
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:01,829
...doesn't know about it yet.

329
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:06,002
"Yet"? That means he'll find out
about it soon.

330
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:08,963
My grandma is not answering my calls.

331
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:13,615
She told me she won't be contacting you
for a while.

332
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,725
You know it was just a misunderstanding.

333
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,519
I can't do anything about it.

334
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,318
Help me out until things calm down.

335
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,379
The media would have a field day.

336
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,210
Think about your grandmother
and your father.

337
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:36,491
The building in Nonhyeon-dong
has been renovated for you to use.

338
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,802
Okay.

339
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:43,635
I will see you tomorrow.

340
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:45,730
Let's go!

341
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:53,927
I thought they wouldn't be able to
find me here.

342
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:55,331
Why?

343
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,352
I think...

344
00:24:58,476 --> 00:24:59,877
...it's going to be a long vacation.

345
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,649
Everyone is busy so...

346
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,844
...I will be brief.

347
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:15,237
I have been with you for over 20 years,

348
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,356
so I believe that you will
understand this situation.

349
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:25,189
The only son of Kim Sungcheol,

350
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,503
and my only grandson, Kim Youngho,

351
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:34,598
who was the regional director
in the United States,

352
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,939
will return to us.

353
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,137
"Gahong Medical Corporation"

354
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:47,348
We should consider procedures and morale.

355
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:49,994
Well...

356
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:52,565
...I would like to say...

357
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:58,345
...he is young and not well-known.

358
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:02,931
I don't know how
we will be able to serve...

359
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,403
...a leader we barely know.

360
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,865
That's why I said in the beginning...

361
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:12,050
...that I believed you would
understand this situation.

362
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:24,359
I thought he was sent away for good.

363
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,464
We don't know anything about him.

364
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,263
Is it confirmed that he will be...

365
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,566
...appointed as Chief Director?

366
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,072
Is that for sure?

367
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,493
It's not confirmed yet,

368
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:38,994
but it makes me nervous to see
the chairwoman acting this stubborn.

369
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:42,033
This is frustrating.

370
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:43,699
Don't worry too much.

371
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:46,300
If he was interested in the company,

372
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,533
he would have done
something about it already.

373
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:49,465
Right?

374
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:53,335
He can't take control of everything now.

375
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:55,886
It'll be a revolution.

376
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,844
Everything will change.

377
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,524
That's history.

378
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:06,891
Yes, this is Im Woosik from Gahong.

379
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,852
Are you saying that it's been
confirmed that...

380
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:11,279
...Kim Youngho resigned from
the branch in the US?

381
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,468
Find out the details.

382
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,538
See if he is really back in Korea too.

383
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:22,132
Gather any information that
you can about him.

384
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,787
I'm glad you'll be here with us.

385
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,353
Me too. Welcome to Korea.

386
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,163
Go now. It's late.

387
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,485
-See you later!
-Bye.

388
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:41,177
I love Korea!

389
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:50,652
Be at Illuso Hotel by 8 PM.

390
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:53,321
You don't have to bring me any roses.

391
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,831
What is this?

392
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:56,313
Where is he?

393
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,365
I should have brought
Hyunwoo's cell phone.

394
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:06,779
I told you to meet the buyers.

395
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:07,954
How could you fall asleep?

396
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:12,146
Hello! I lost you for a second.

397
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:32,133
Yes. That's right.

398
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:13,307
Don't come any closer.

399
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,415
Jooeun.

400
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,414
Don't come.

401
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:47,921
Please!

402
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,017
Please, help me.

403
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:10,291
Hold on, Soojin.

404
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,247
Jooeun...

405
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,695
She said, "Don't come any closer."

406
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,209
Help me.

407
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,079
I'm really curious.

408
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:39,858
Is "Help me"...

409
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,389
...your catchphrase?

410
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,161
Please.

411
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,306
I can't beat him up
because I'm a ranked fighter.

412
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,644
Please take me anywhere else.

413
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:01,838
Where?

414
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,967
Somewhere far away from here.

415
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,786
Not on this earth, if possible.

416
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,050
Let's go.

417
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,656
Ready,

418
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,443
go!

419
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,430
Where are we?

420
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,132
This is my suite.

421
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:16,600
Why am I here?

422
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,163
You asked me to take you
somewhere out of this earth.

423
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,383
Being alone
with a guy like me in a suite...

424
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:25,746
...must be out of this world for you.

425
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:30,640
All right.

426
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,219
-All right?
-Why don't you just open the door?

427
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:36,101
Let me take a look...

428
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:37,812
...what the outside of this earth
looks like.

429
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,911
Does it hurt?

430
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:38,633
Yes.

431
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,255
Does it hurt a lot?

432
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:43,785
Yes.

433
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,739
I'm talking about your shoulders,
not your feelings.

434
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,853
I'm not concerned about your feelings.

435
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,924
I'm okay.

436
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:58,449
I'll be on my way soon.

437
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:04,060
Since you are not aware of it,

438
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,653
this must be your first time.

439
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:06,609
What?

440
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,752
Shall we do it on the couch
or on the bed?

441
00:34:15,515 --> 00:34:17,127
Your shoulder is dislocated.

442
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:24,559
Please make sounds
that are appropriate in hotels.

443
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,612
I haven't even started.

444
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,519
I'm not ready yet.

445
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,109
You don't need to be ready.

446
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:37,819
It only hurts at first.
You'll feel better.

447
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,367
It doesn't fit because you keep moving.

448
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:43,938
They might misunderstand.

449
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:47,019
We just had dinner.

450
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:50,695
You and Jooeun
work in the same law firm...

451
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,468
...of all places.

452
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,331
I'm not sure what to do.

453
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:57,844
Don't do anything.

454
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:02,292
I'll take care of everything.

455
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,229
You don't have to do anything.

456
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:08,564
I've already hurt Jooeun enough.

457
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,038
So, I will never hurt you.

458
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,544
It feels good...

459
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:21,423
...being the bad girl.

460
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,138
That was some fierce revenge.

461
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,742
Is it because I tore your corset?

462
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:46,526
If I wanted to take revenge,

463
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:48,263
it would be on my ex-boyfriend.

464
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,037
Is he already your ex-boyfriend?

465
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,029
You didn't even put up a fight.

466
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:59,137
You seem laid back,
contrary to your looks.

467
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,932
A lot of things are contrary to my looks.

468
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,582
I don't know where to start.

469
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:07,534
That guy looked familiar.

470
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,569
Did he?

471
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,217
He looked very unfamiliar to me.

472
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:31,155
Please just stop being angry for a while.

473
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:33,730
Thank you.

474
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:36,936
Are you an oriental doctor?

475
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:39,542
I don't see patients though.

476
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,121
Your body temperature is too low
and your pulse is too slow.

477
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:52,192
Anyway, make sure to go see a doctor.

478
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:53,762
Have your shoulders checked out.

479
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:58,751
It may look fine on the outside,

480
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:00,850
but it needs time to heal.

481
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:04,745
It's not healed just because
it looks fine.

482
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:13,416
I should get going.

483
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:16,333
Thank you for everything.

484
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,726
Let's go.

485
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:21,142
No.

486
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:25,299
I know you are weak
in front of those who are sick,

487
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,920
and weaker to those who are in danger.

488
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:29,832
But?

489
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:31,833
He's probably...

490
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,433
...waiting for me.

491
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:51,881
Let's go to any place...

492
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:55,947
...where you can scream
and I can get down on my knees.

493
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:59,155
My shoulder was dislocated.

494
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:01,339
The guy who treated my shoulder...

495
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:02,744
...told me to take it easy.

496
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,721
Since we are already over,

497
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,824
let's make this simple and quick.

498
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,357
Water, juice, coffee.

499
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,252
Which one do you want
to throw at me first?

500
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,614
I won't complain even if you throw
all of them at once.

501
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:28,168
Please don't get me wrong.

502
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:30,415
-Today...
-As for that, let me go first.

503
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,887
Don't get me wrong.

504
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,881
I was in a suite with that guy,

505
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:35,355
but we aren't in a relationship.

506
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,217
I knew that.

507
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:42,442
I see.

508
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,037
But why are you explaining yourself?

509
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,698
You think people assume things about you,

510
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,375
but they don't assume things about me,

511
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:53,058
even if I'm in a suite with a guy.

512
00:38:53,556 --> 00:38:55,619
That's the way you see me.

513
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,694
I don't think I have to say it's over.

514
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,029
Jooeun.

515
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:04,863
So let's end our long relationship here.

516
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,297
But, are you sick?

517
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:11,370
I don't think you are entitled
to ask me that question.

518
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:13,616
Leave now.

519
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,782
-Soojin is...
-I don't care whoever she is!

520
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:22,170
Leave.

521
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:24,898
I'm being dumped by you,

522
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:27,630
but I'm the one that's letting go.

523
00:39:28,696 --> 00:39:31,386
I don't think I can wish you
a happy long relationship.

524
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,056
I already know by experience.

525
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:37,165
Thank you.

526
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,423
I did a good thing today.

527
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:48,013
And I might sound too bold if
I say this as we break up,

528
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:52,496
but Soojin did nothing wrong.

529
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,121
Should I kill this jerk?

530
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:56,345
What did you say?

531
00:39:57,253 --> 00:40:00,356
Shut it unless you want
something bad to happen to you.

532
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,554
I'm an attorney.

533
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,381
-So...
-Yes.

534
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:06,389
I know.

535
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,549
I know better than anyone else.

536
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:13,407
You wanted to be an attorney
who is both smart and beautiful.

537
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,955
You wanted to be the Cinderella
of the legal world.

538
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,582
And you did it!

539
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:19,653
But you...

540
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,480
...lost too much, Jooeun.

541
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:26,188
Did I?

542
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:30,684
It's a good thing for you
that I became an attorney.

543
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:34,464
My beauty is gone,
but my intelligence is fine.

544
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:38,472
That's why I'm using all the etiquette
that I know to stay calm.

545
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:41,557
Don't add fuel to the fire.
Shut up and leave.

546
00:40:41,717 --> 00:40:43,552
Drop off the face of the Earth.

547
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:52,240
Just know that...

548
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,189
...I'm just as stunned
by this situation as you are.

549
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,374
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

550
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:06,993
Do you want me to endure that torture?

551
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,015
Where would you like to go?

552
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:28,953
Miss?

553
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,313
Pardon?

554
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:32,958
Where would you like to go?

555
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:41,375
The airport, please.

556
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:45,710
I'm sorry, but could you
turn the heater on?

557
00:41:55,004 --> 00:41:56,217
You can use mine.

558
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,377
Was my lipstick the only thing...

559
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,475
...that fell down the drain that day?

560
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,077
It's not because of me, is it?

561
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,694
I think we can wrap it up for now.

562
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:16,176
Why was I being classy?

563
00:42:16,757 --> 00:42:19,883
I should've thrown coffee
and juice in his face.

564
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:34,378
Does it hurt?

565
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,080
Does it hurt a lot?

566
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:38,165
It may look fine on the outside,

567
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:40,343
but it needs time to heal.

568
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:45,586
I put your support belt in your bag.

569
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:02,318
Why won't it come out?

570
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:13,581
My dream was to become
Cinderella in the legal field,

571
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:16,050
but I'll have to be satisfied with just
being in the legal field.

572
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:18,146
"Cinderella in the legal field"? Why?

573
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:20,368
Cinderella isn't better than you.

574
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,228
You have a mom, a brother and...

575
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,735
...you have me.

576
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:28,138
Does she have dimples?

577
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,037
Your dimples are really beautiful.

578
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:33,292
How dare you compare yourself?

579
00:43:36,103 --> 00:43:40,144
The first book
my dad bought me was "Cinderella".

580
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,253
I loved the ending.

581
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,566
"And they lived happily ever after."

582
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:51,576
But I want to become a lawyer, too.

583
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:53,478
So?

584
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:55,523
Who are "they"?

585
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:56,624
Me and...

586
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:02,191
-You think it's you?
-It had better be me.

587
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:10,738
You got the Cinderella part.

588
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,765
The "in the legal field" is the hard part.

589
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:18,784
Hey, you smokers over there.

590
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:20,521
Gosh.

591
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:22,984
Stop right there. I saw you!

592
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,995
Put those cigarettes out!

593
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:28,875
Actually, "Cinderella"
from a legal perspective...

594
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:30,941
...would be classified as
violent acts that...

595
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:33,079
...led to the spreading
of false information.

596
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:37,059
"And they lived happily ever after" is...

597
00:44:37,198 --> 00:44:41,369
...in reality, a load of garbage.

598
00:44:53,586 --> 00:44:54,704
Lawyer Kang?

599
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,407
Nine in the morning is too early.

600
00:45:00,054 --> 00:45:01,777
-Pardon?
-Well, 9:30 is...

601
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:05,531
She may have a meeting with the president.

602
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,102
At 10...

603
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,273
Fine. She's human so she may be
in the restroom...

604
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,367
...and have other business to tend to.

605
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:18,684
At 11, she may have felt bad
and hesitated.

606
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:20,237
Lawyer Kang?

607
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:23,998
But she should've come by noon.

608
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:33,387
What is it?

609
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:34,789
That's exactly what I want to ask you.

610
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:36,757
What's going on?

611
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:41,729
You saw me in the bathroom that day,
didn't you?

612
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:49,265
Don't tell me...

613
00:45:50,052 --> 00:45:51,882
...that woman was you?

614
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:55,561
Look, Soojin.

615
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:57,470
Tell me,

616
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,207
was it pure coincidence?

617
00:45:59,347 --> 00:46:00,848
It had nothing to do with Woosik?

618
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,792
I had a prior meeting, to be exact.

619
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:08,682
The bathroom was a coincidence.

620
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:11,869
Do you have anything more to say?

621
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:15,634
You do.

622
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:18,943
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

623
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:24,440
Try the big fat steak.

624
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:26,825
It's the thickest that we have.

625
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:29,938
I recommend it
for the thick-skinned guest.

626
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:31,445
I'll just have...

627
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,624
...the Greek salad...

628
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:35,115
...without the dressing.

629
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:39,283
It won't taste good without the dressing.

630
00:46:39,387 --> 00:46:41,188
You don't eat food for the flavor.

631
00:46:43,057 --> 00:46:44,492
I need to talk with Jooeun.

632
00:46:44,592 --> 00:46:46,005
If you're done taking our order...

633
00:46:46,956 --> 00:46:48,990
Why you...

634
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:50,571
-Why I...
-Hyunwoo.

635
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,206
This is your place of business.

636
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:57,486
Throwing water and breaking some plates...

637
00:46:57,738 --> 00:47:00,341
...is the joy
of running your own business.

638
00:47:00,857 --> 00:47:02,477
Right, Jooeun?

639
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:06,712
You may throw a fit. Cause a scene.
Anything you want.

640
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,585
Just go all out.

641
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,705
Good luck.

642
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:18,063
Hyunwoo is still tough.

643
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,729
Do you really think that
we can eat right now?

644
00:47:23,064 --> 00:47:24,732
We have to.

645
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:27,700
If you don't eat on time,
you end up overeating.

646
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,567
It's not good for you
and you'll gain weight.

647
00:47:43,996 --> 00:47:44,997
Soojin.

648
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:48,154
Oh Soojin.

649
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:57,076
Go ahead.

650
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,307
Have I wronged you?

651
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:04,386
Did you come to apologize?

652
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:06,601
Hey, Soojin.

653
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,062
You must have forgotten.

654
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:12,747
I'm very direct and forward.

655
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,249
So, apologize or make excuses
or something, will you?

656
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,892
Woosik told me not to do anything.

657
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:24,516
He said he'd take care of it.

658
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:28,416
Explanation?

659
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:30,409
Let's see.

660
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,763
There's no way to explain attraction
between a man and a woman.

661
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,294
As for moral responsibility...

662
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:42,315
...I admit it.

663
00:48:46,687 --> 00:48:48,527
I haven't done anything to
apologize for yet,

664
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:50,030
so I don't feel bad.

665
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:51,608
Would anything change...

666
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:55,159
...if I did feel bad?

667
00:48:56,162 --> 00:48:57,283
Do you...

668
00:48:58,024 --> 00:49:01,682
...think the world and I
are at your feet or something?

669
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:03,311
Come to your senses.

670
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:05,064
I'm Kang Jooeun.

671
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,617
Are we traveling back in a time machine?

672
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:15,117
True.

673
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,522
I understand.

674
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:22,538
I know how you were
back in your glory days.

675
00:49:23,616 --> 00:49:25,281
I'm sad to say this, but...

676
00:49:27,563 --> 00:49:29,588
...you're the one who needs
to come to your senses.

677
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:36,055
-What?
-Everyone got attracted to your looks.

678
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:37,964
Woosik was devoted to you.

679
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,500
The days when you could do anything
if you put your mind to it.

680
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:44,497
Everything you like must be back there,
but not for me.

681
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:47,314
Everything I like is right here.

682
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,731
If you want to travel back in time,
go alone.

683
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:56,382
Are we done now?

684
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,077
Are you...

685
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:01,608
...doing this to me...

686
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,331
...because of Lee Jihoon?

687
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:07,975
Who?

688
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,811
My goodness!

689
00:50:16,128 --> 00:50:18,207
That was so long ago.

690
00:50:21,076 --> 00:50:24,683
This meal is on me
since I feel somewhat responsible.

691
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:44,390
Because of Lee Jihoon?

692
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:51,552
You wouldn't know how much I loved him.

693
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:56,917
Lee Jihoon's "Young Beautiful Days"
will start our second half.

694
00:50:57,105 --> 00:51:00,607
For today's episode,

695
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,226
Oh Soojin has been invited to our studio.

696
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:04,392
Hello.

697
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:07,821
Hello.

698
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:13,421
Actually, I'm a little big.

699
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:15,822
Why does she say that?

700
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:18,718
She should declare
that Jihoon is hers, nationwide.

701
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:21,004
I don't have many friends.

702
00:51:22,128 --> 00:51:26,532
There is a friend who came to me first.

703
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,175
That friend told me...

704
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,336
...that people get fat...

705
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,542
...because of loneliness
or because of agony.

706
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:40,139
Or both.

707
00:51:40,913 --> 00:51:42,774
She said that...

708
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,217
...I was either lonely or in agony.

709
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:49,809
Or both.

710
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:54,861
This is what I wanted to tell you.

711
00:51:56,337 --> 00:51:59,720
Thank you for being my friend!

712
00:52:02,806 --> 00:52:04,310
This is Kim Dongryul's song,

713
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:05,802
"The Words, I Love You".

714
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:08,199
Good job, Soojin.

715
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:13,414
Soojin!

716
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:15,097
Soojin!

717
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:16,325
Come on.

718
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,675
Are we traveling back in a time machine?

719
00:52:43,816 --> 00:52:46,366
Everything you like must be back there,
but not for me.

720
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,521
Everything I like is right here.

721
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:50,919
You're the one who needs to
come to your senses.

722
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:54,402
Ma'am!

723
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:00,547
Goodness!

724
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,597
Lawyer Kang, should I call security?

725
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:03,817
I know him.

726
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,507
She knows me.

727
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:09,690
Why are you here, Jiwoong?

728
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:17,777
I was worried about you.

729
00:53:17,866 --> 00:53:19,305
And I have something to do here.

730
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,257
By the way, why did you ignore my texts?

731
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,046
Ma'am. Ma'am!

732
00:53:30,225 --> 00:53:31,848
Busy? Where are you?

733
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:34,734
I was too busy to check these.

734
00:53:36,906 --> 00:53:38,349
I need to ask you something.

735
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,054
"Sports Agent Exclusive Contract"

736
00:53:46,174 --> 00:53:49,800
This is a sponsorship contract
with an agent.

737
00:53:52,144 --> 00:53:53,946
I see, this is what you do.

738
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:55,886
I'll take a look.

739
00:53:56,421 --> 00:53:57,422
By the way,

740
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:00,480
thank you so much for helping me
on the plane.

741
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,298
Oh, no.

742
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:04,989
You and I, we were destined to meet.

743
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:06,415
Destiny!

744
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,694
See? We are meeting again now.

745
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:13,255
You came to see me.

746
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,535
It doesn't matter.

747
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:21,627
What is that?

748
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:23,500
Ma'am, if you keep eating those,

749
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:25,394
you'll get sick again.

750
00:54:27,778 --> 00:54:30,868
Your nice face will disappear.

751
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:36,958
Do you know Jennifer Anderson?

752
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:41,259
The woman in the "Stella Show,"

753
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:44,644
who was transformed,

754
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:47,139
-and lives a new life?
-Yes, that's her.

755
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,067
You see?

756
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:51,271
Jennifer Anderson has become
completely happy.

757
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:54,015
She is now the Queen of Queens.

758
00:54:55,575 --> 00:54:56,758
Ma'am, you can do it too.

759
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:57,961
Why not?

760
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,202
There's a delivery.

761
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,779
-Food delivery here.
-The food is here.

762
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:15,259
Who is it?

763
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:17,059
I'm from downstairs.

764
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:18,961
I'll place your package here.

765
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:20,557
Yes.

766
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,156
Thank you.

767
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,158
"Emergency Room, Hanmaeum Hospital"

768
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,556
Yes.

769
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,117
It's been a while.

770
00:55:49,317 --> 00:55:50,875
It's just your grandmother
and me for the moment.

771
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,467
Your father doesn't know about it yet.

772
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:57,072
Are you here for business?

773
00:55:57,704 --> 00:55:59,034
What if I'm here as a father?

774
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:03,161
Then, there must be a very urgent issue.

775
00:56:06,105 --> 00:56:07,796
Since you're being sarcastic,

776
00:56:08,505 --> 00:56:09,942
it seems you're doing fine.

777
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,409
Director Jeong will fill your position in
the US branch.

778
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:18,780
Did your grandmother call you in?

779
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:28,344
I'm asking
if I need to empty a desk for you.

780
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,936
I don't like deskbound jobs.

781
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:36,826
I'm still thinking.

782
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:42,283
You are too old
to behave like a spoiled child.

783
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:54,301
We're sending the belongings you left in
the ambulance.

784
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,748
Use this.

785
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:00,450
You look like a chubby rabbit.

786
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:30,632
John Kim?

787
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:44,406
Are you an athlete?

788
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,045
I'm a manager and a trainer.
I'm very famous.

789
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,736
You can forget about how
she looked in the past.

790
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:53,723
Jennifer Anderson has become
completely happy.

791
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:56,299
God created Jennifer,

792
00:57:57,203 --> 00:58:00,250
and John Kim completed her.

793
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,484
Ma'am, you can do it too.

794
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,660
Why not?

795
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,588
"Trainer Jiwoong"

796
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:22,616
Ma'am, what brings you here?

797
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:26,926
Please swear to tell only the truth.

798
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:34,771
Are you John Kim?

799
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:36,104
What?

800
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,234
You are John Kim.

801
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:42,567
Right?

802
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,391
Right.

803
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:51,112
John Kim.
