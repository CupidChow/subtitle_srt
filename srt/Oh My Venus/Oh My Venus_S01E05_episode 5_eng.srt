1
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,240
I...

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,760
even put the flower pot that you like.

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Please save me...

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,320
Do you know this man?

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,740
Are you okay?

6
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,060
Let me go, you bastard!

7
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,160
So why didn't you answer your phone?

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
- I'm sorry...
 - Ow, let go!

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,300
Report him.

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,200
 Episode 5 

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,760
Huh? You live in Apt. #101.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
Yes.

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,200
 You live in Apt. #201, right?  

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,480
Yes.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,040
 I'm your downstairs neighbor. 

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,420
 I'll leave your package here. 

17
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,440
 - Lee Hyeon Woo. 
 - Huh?  

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,060
 Did you really not put the flower pot here? 

19
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,700
 It's me, Miss Joo Eun. 

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,480
Look. So it seems like there was a misunderstanding among neighbors—

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,180
A misunderstanding?

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,500
You're calling this situation a misunderstanding?

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,300
Well, it's not like you were assaulted, and there are no threatening texts or mail.

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,800
The fact that this is a recurrence is just your assumption.

25
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,640
To be honest, why would this person stalk you?

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't you think so?

27
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,200
Excuse me. If you're an officer, shouldn't you be obtaining evidence from the victim in this situation?

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,500
I... realize you're in shock, but the law isn't that easy.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,200
Then what about the victim? I guess I look like a pushover?

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,500
That's not what we mean. Don't be so sensitive, and—

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,620
Are you happy?

32
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,160
That's what it says over there.

33
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,440
"Our city where women are happy."

34
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,460
Excuse me... Are you her guardian?

35
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,920
If I had known she would have been 
using me this often, I should be.

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Don't you remember?

37
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,580
I remember.

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,400
 Excuse me.
Excuse me. 

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,540
 Oh! Please save me! 

40
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,860
So, this person got injured too,

41
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,040
and in the case that he hires an attorney,

42
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,060
then you could get charged for assault instead.

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,460
Being detained is difficult too.

44
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,820
The law is such that—

45
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,220
It's pretty crappy.

46
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,540
You might need sincerity when you're comforting someone,

47
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,540
but in order to understand something, I think all you need is not to misunderstand.

48
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,080
"Are you okay? I understand."

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,380
"The law is so crappy that it may be hard to punish him, but I will try my very best."

50
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,340
To all the other victims, please tell them that.

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,780
Then, work hard.

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,140
Oh, Miss Kang Joo Eun!

53
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,580
Stop right there!

54
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,080
Really, thank you so much.

55
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,300
It's a relief that you remembered his face.

56
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,780
Then...

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,940
Kang Joo Eun, what happened?

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,900
Why didn't you tell them you're an attorney? 
Was it because of me? I was acting in self-defense!

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,620
Ah.  Did you get hurt anywhere?

60
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,680
It's a relief.

61
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,220
Why did you become a lawyer 
when you can't even protect yourself?

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,860
I know.

63
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you want me to beat him senseless?
 It would be better for you to be my attorney.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,320
Wait.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,160
Just to punish that person for being a stalker,
 I can't get hurt or die.

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,940
Even if I have repeated and clear evidence,

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
at best, he'll be detained for maybe 24 hours. 
A penalty of under 100,000 won?

68
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,860
Even that fine isn't given to the victim.

69
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,360
Since I'm a lawyer, because I'm a lawyer,

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,040
I know how it works, and that's 
why I don't have any expectations.

71
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,880
It really is crappy.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,420
To one person it's a life and death situation,

73
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,520
but to another it's a trivial matter.

74
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,820
I guess that's how the law works in this world.

75
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,660
In your past life... you must have been indebted to me.

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
Thanks to you, I lived again like this.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,780
I'll give you back your clothes next time. Then...

78
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,540
Where are you going?

79
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,580
My friend's place is near here.

80
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,060
Don't worry and return to your home.

81
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,560
If I had a prior incarnation and were indebted to you, it must have been a tremendous debt.

82
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,540


83
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,520
Hyeon Woo, it's me.

84
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Is it urgent?

85
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,320
Is something wrong?

86
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,080
No... Min Joon's grandmother has a bruise on her face again.

87
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Again?

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,700
She says it was an accident this time too,

89
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,160
but it's not. It's definitely domestic violence.

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,640
Min Joon! Stop it now and go to bed.

91
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,860
Oh. Okay, I'll be right there. Yes, okay.

92
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,440
She's waiting up for me.

93
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,380
You just have to go a little further.

94
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,860
Every time, I'm upgrading my debt to you.

95
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,120
Ah! H-Here. Right behind it is my friend's home.

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,300
How much is it?

97
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,500
This time of the night you can only do overnight accommodations. It's ₩50,000.

98
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,360
By any chance, do you do account transfers?

99
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,260
It's better than a card.

100
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,140
Are you by yourself?

101
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,660
Yes.

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
How did you...

103
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,560
Your friend has a lot of rooms in her house.

104
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,640
Without a man, a woman shouldn't come to a place like this.

105
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,720
Just leave me alone!

106
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,780
Even though I've shown you all kinds of things,

107
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,340
I'm really mortified, shy, and embarrassed.

108
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm fully aware that you have a weakness for those who are hurt,

109
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,600
and even more so for those who are in danger.

110
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,800
I also know that you're nicer than you look.

111
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,330
You can't fall asleep after leaving a woman like this out on the street. I know that, but—

112
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,170
You know that, but?

113
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,830
I...

114
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,090
I don't want to go home.

115
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,030
I'm scared.

116
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't even have anywhere to go.

117
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,380
Do you think I came to a motel because I wanted to?

118
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,560
Then let's go.

119
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,750
Let's go. To the outside of your world.

120
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,080
The suite. My room. You asked me to take you outside of this world.

121
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm sure tomorrow I'll regret it.

122
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:08,130
So with me... to the hotel's suite?

123
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,810
Do you want me to take you to the suite?

124
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,770
If you want, I'll do that.

125
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,120
No, it's not that.

126
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Then, where is the outside of my world?

127
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,550
With someone like me, under that same roof, sleeping.

128
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,570
- What? 
 - I think safety is more important than something erotic. For tonight.

129
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,180
"What?"

130
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,160
Erotic?

131
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,980
He really doesn't give me a chance to be grateful.

132
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,240
I didn't plan to have a guest over, so I don't have new ones. Just use mine since you need them right now.

133
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,060
Omo. Then Yeong Ho Hyung-nim—

134
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,470
I mean, what about you, Mr. Coach?

135
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,440
No way would I have given you what I lie on and cover myself with.

136
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Get some sleep. I'll tell the kids tomorrow.

137
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,370
I've done it so much that I'm sick of it too, but thank—

138
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,210
Thank you, sorry, I'm embarrassed. Those are your buzzwords.

139
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,040
I know, so let's do without them.

140
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,580
But still, thank you.

141
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,200
Just don't say, "Save me."

142
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,950
I'm too tired, so tonight, I don't think I can save you.

143
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,400
No way would I have given you  what I lie on and cover myself with.

144
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,550
Of course not!

145
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,870
Hey there! Please save me!

146
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,210
Cramp! Cramp! Cramps in my leg!

147
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,770
Wait, wait, wait.

148
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,140
By any chance, are you doing this because you're too embarrassed to just come out?

149
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,790
No I'm not! I really have a cramp!

150
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,270
Hurry! Hurry!

151
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,500
Then why don't you say once, "Mr. Coach, you're cool."

152
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,250
Mr. Coach, you're cool. You're the best.

153
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,520
Hurry. Hurry! I even want to call a cat right now!

154
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,740
Mouse (homonym for cramp). Catch it.

155
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,870
- Ahh! 
 - It's ridiculous!

156
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,830
Why would someone even do that!?!

157
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,340
Ma'am, seriously, it's a relief.

158
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,220
Oh, stalkers like that, you have to catch them and go,  " Pow, pow pow, push push push! " And slice them.

159
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,270
You must have been really shocked.

160
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,830
Yes. A bit—

161
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,100
If it hadn't been for me, it could have been really terrible.

162
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,780
Oh! I told you to stop.

163
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,160
You just have to go and pat yourself on the back.

164
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,860
We are a bit...

165
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,840
Eat this, Ma'am.

166
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,650
I'm sorry, but don't you have any salt marinade?

167
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,650
You're not here for a get-together at a meat restaurant.

168
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh.

169
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,650
Take this first.

170
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,510
Omo. How did you—

171
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,620
Since you're known to be a meticulous person.

172
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,510
Thank you.

173
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,130
I miss soup.

174
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,770
You know, something spicy and comforting.

175
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,450
Something with some color. That kind of soup.

176
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,480
Since there's color, it'll do, right?

177
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,520
Wow! Fantastic!

178
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,990
Oh! Please keep excessive compliments to yourself!

179
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh! Is she an actress?

180
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,930
Well, that's not totally untrue.

181
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,240
I think I've seen her somewhere.

182
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,660
All of you already know.

183
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,790
Ahh!

184
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,530
Long time ago,

185
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,020
there was a Chinese actress named, Shu Qi.

186
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,860
Since she was around a long time ago, you guys wouldn't know.

187
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,650
Shu Qi?

188
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,360
Oh! I found her! Shu Qi.  I found her.

189
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,740
Ah, are you really going to act like this?

190
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,350
It's me. Me. Kang Joo Eun!

191
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,590
Right now, intelligent and beaut—

192
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,860
A lawyer with a beautiful smile, Daegu Venus.

193
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,410
Let's see...

194
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,840
You do look a little similar. Do you have proof?

195
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm telling you that it's me, since it is me. What? Proof?

196
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,590
Wow. Seriously.

197
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,240
See what happens when I lose weight. All of you will fall for me.

198
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,170
Eat up. Eat.

199
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,850
You don't believe me now.

200
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,490
Just wait and see. There will be hearts pouring out of your eyes!

201
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,250
- Excuse me. 
 - Oh! Oh! Oh!

202
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,480
Come on!

203
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,860
What? Why are they laughing?

204
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,400
It's okay, Hyeon Jung. Thank you for the shirt.

205
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,890
Let's walk as quickly as possible.

206
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,670
 I... My nickname once used to be Daegu Venus. 

207
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,030
 There was almost no boy in South and North Gyongsang, for whom I wasn't his first love. 

208
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,510
 Do you suffer from mythomania? (compulsive lying) 

209
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,330
 It's me. Me. Kang Joo Eun! 

210
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,030
 Just wait and see. There will be hearts pouring out of your eyes.  

211
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,160
Was it really true?

212
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,920
 - Yes.  
  - Oh, you startled me!

213
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,080
Are you only waiting for me?

214
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,390
Day and night. What do you need?

215
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,320
Daegu... I have to go there, but I need a guardian.

216
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,250
By any chance, is there something wrong with your leg?

217
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,650
Where are you right now?

218
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,050
I should see whether it's wrong or not after I go down there.

219
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,680
I'll call you back after setting up a doctor's appointment. Then.

220
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,980
Okay...

221
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,030
I think you've been absent from your restaurant too long.

222
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,430
Thank you. You're really...

223
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,610
It's a relief that you'd already put it on the market, but call the landlord.

224
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,240
Ask him to take  care of it as soon as possible.

225
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,330
I did it earlier.

226
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,430
These are Min Joon's dermatitis cream, and the things I bought you at the Duty Free.

227
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,110
Why should you be the one to avoid him? Ask mom to come up and have her stay with you.

228
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,140
I'm sure mom will be so happy to hear that her daughter is being stalked!

229
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,470
Well, it's true. Mom might stalk the stalker instead.

230
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,470
That's right. Don't you avoid it, and let's call your mother!

231
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,460
I'm not avoiding, but living above and below each other makes me feel really uncomfortable.

232
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,830
I don't think I can fall asleep either.

233
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,130
Oh, that's true. It's crappy.

234
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,350
Jae Hyeok! Move all her things into my house.

235
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,910
No, it's okay. You only have two rooms.

236
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,050
You have Min Joon and his grandmother there too.

237
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,810
I'll figure it out on my own, so go back to work.

238
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,690
What can you figure out on your own?

239
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,400
I told you I will! Hurry up and go.

240
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,630
Ah! Seriously...

241
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,680
Anyway, thank you so much, Ms. Lawyer.

242
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,940
Call me if anything happens. Okay?

243
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,060
Don't get married. It's a crazy thing to do.

244
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,420
Also, stop picking at your sister's spine (squeezing money out of someone)! It's all crooked now!

245
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,170
Hurry up and leave!

246
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,330
I got it. I'm leaving.

247
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,100
Thank you!

248
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,670
Hey.

249
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,370
What is this?

250
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,620
Do you want to get married with just some lustral water? (water infused with magical powers)

251
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,520
You're going to marry someone's precious daughter and just suck your thumb? What about my niece or nephew inside the belly?

252
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,780
Noona.

253
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,560
Prepare a simple ceremony and set up shop. You have to do something to make a living somehow.

254
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,440
I'll send you more money as soon as my apartment has been rented.

255
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm sorry! I'll earn a lot of money and pay you back double!

256
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,700
A lawyer isn't someone who rakes in money.

257
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,860
There won't be enough. Prepare simply.

258
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,280
We decided to do the wedding some other time. I'll look into a business first.

259
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,540
With Hyungnim Woo Sik ...

260
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,820
Ah! I told you we broke up! Why do you keep asking? Hurry up and go!

261
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,580
Work hard.

262
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,040
 Athlete Im Woo Sik! Nice to meet you. 

263
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,060
 So from a request from the man who is sort of like her guardian, 

264
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,020
 we discovered it while going through the CCTV. 

265
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,010
 What is your relationship to her? 

266
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,490
 She's someone I know well. Someone I've known for a very long time. 

267
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,830
If you appear in front of Kang Joo Eun once more, I will kill you myself.

268
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,310
What right do you have?

269
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,230
I saw everything. You breaking up with her.

270
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,470
You'll know well what right I have since you've been watching.

271
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,190
Stay away from Kang Joo Eun. It's not a warning but an order.

272
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,690
 Sorry. See you tomorrow. I have an important meeting today. 

273
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,430
Please tell Lawyer Kang Joo Eun to come to my office.

274
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,130
 Yes. 

275
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:51,430


276
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,870
 Why did you tell me to get dressed up to come see you? 

277
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,160
 You passed your bar exam! 

278
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,690
 As a second year student at that. 

279
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,690
 I'm going to give you a present in celebration. 

280
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,730
 Hello, Oh Soo Jin! 

281
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,330
 Hello, Woo Sik. 

282
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,650
 How did you get here so fast? 

283
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,280
 How do you think? 

284
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,020
 Here. 

285
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,480
 It's Soo Jin's. 

286
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,330
 Ah.  

287
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,170
 Chocolate. 

288
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,690
 It's chocolate for the brilliant mind. Congrats on passing the bar. 

289
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,100
 When will our Joo Eun graduate and pass the bar? 

290
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,080
 I will soon. Soo Jin doesn't like chocolate. 

291
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,890
  No. 

292
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,060
 Thank you. I will enjoy them. 

293
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,450
  Am I a religious person? I can't show up anywhere in this. 

294
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,090
 Look at you. Where and what are you going to show?  

295
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,970
 He's here. He's here.  

296
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,140
 I've looked into him, and he's at the top of his class at his engineering college. 

297
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,620
 He's really nice and really genuine. 

298
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,780
 You came? 

299
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,710
 Joo Eun... 

300
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,930
 This is Soo Jin, the one I told you about. Oh Soo Jin. 

301
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,930
 Then, have a nice time together. 

302
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,170
 Tell Joo Eun. I heard it loud and clear. 

303
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,250
 What? What are you... 

304
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,510
 This is her way of rejecting me.  

305
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,130
 You and me. Here. This situation.  

306
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,440
 What? 

307
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,960
 Well, I realize she's doing this because she feels sorry for you, 

308
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,650
 but there's no need to make me pitiful too! Huh?  

309
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,290
 Also, your clothes— I thought someone died. 

310
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,610
 Did Joo Eun really say that? 

311
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,580
 She said she felt sorry for me? 

312
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,210
 Do I have to tell you that aloud? 

313
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,370
 Also, when someone looks like you, 

314
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,490
 you need to be quick on the uptake. 

315
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,750
 Don't hang around in places like this, and go home!  

316
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,720
 Joo Eun... 

317
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,310
 Joo Eun... How could she... To me... 

318
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,720
 What?  

319
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,650
I won't be an attorney who makes house visits,  Vice CEO.

320
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,690
It's something I already mentioned to the CEO when I first got hired by Guntoo.

321
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,790
Working overnight, working outside the office, and staying up all night are fine, but I will never take on molester or rapist cases.

322
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,230
I don't want to make hospital visits to all the presidents of major companies who are lying in bed after doing corrupt things.

323
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,930
That's a relief then.

324
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,140
It's not the president of a major company, but it's his daughter.

325
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,160
It's that woman who assaulted an employee at a department store, isn't it?

326
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,510
Then, I really can't do it.

327
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:36,510
Our firm and Myung Hoon Electronics have a long standing relationship.

328
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,620
There seem to have been times where you've been a part of an external legal team.

329
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,790
I will give you a formal response. Vice CEO, I reject your offer.

330
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,830
I'm returning to you exactly what I got. I will give you a formal order.

331
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,350
You're in charge of it, Lawyer Kang.

332
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,370
Someone has to do it. If you don't, then someone else will.

333
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,760
If you cover your eyes and get mad, will it make a difference?

334
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,970
The CEO said it once, fulfill your dreams through mercy.

335
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,550
I'm done here. You may go.

336
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,910
 No! If you eat all that sugar, your body will curse at you. 

337
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,680
 I will too. 

338
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,390
Did I just have an ... auditory hallucination?

339
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,140
On top of stress, I'm hungry too!

340
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,600
My hypothyroidism...

341
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,560
Air fresh! Fresh!

342
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,180
Yeah!

343
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,430
Come on!

344
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,770
Yeah!

345
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,060
Go!

346
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,580
At that rate, he's has the championship title in the bag.

347
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,480
Since the welterweight division is vacant.

348
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,440
if he wins the RFC this time, he'll probably go on to the grand slam.

349
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,950
But that fool keeps lowering his weight class. To lightweight.

350
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,380
What? Why?

351
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,350
He doesn't want the title for free.

352
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,210
He wants to go after Akira who lowered his class in order to avoid him.

353
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,760
Seriously... He's the type to take the long way around even on the easy path.

354
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,640
Hurry! Hurry!

355
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,510
Good job.

356
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,710
The smell of organic grass that's healthy for my body.

357
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,760
Ah! Really...

358
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,700
 Abdominal obesity. Adult diseases. Vigilance. Danger. Alert. Requirement. 

359
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,160
 Aren't you busy? 

360
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,770
 Look at this wicked woman. 

361
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,760
 Eat this. 

362
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,430
Is this a side effect from dieting?

363
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,800
 Eat. 

364
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,130
By any chance, did you eat stir-fried marinated pork earlier?

365
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,240
Do I smell?

366
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,640
Jjamppong! You ate jjamppong!

367
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,800
You already ate earlier. Fancy grass and high protein.

368
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,900
Oh, I'm so hungry... Ah.

369
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,000
Do I have to go this far?

370
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,380
 You do look similar, but do you have proof? 

371
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,640
I am saying it's me, but insufficient evidence?

372
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,010
I won't eat! I won't!

373
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,380
Excuse me... I have something to talk to Mr. Snake about.

374
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,250
Could you please give us room?

375
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,410
Jang Yi Jin? What's up!

376
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm not Ja-Jang Yi Jin.

377
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,820
You are Jang Yi Jin.

378
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,620
Even so, you know not to post it to social media, right?

379
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,660
You need me to leave?

380
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,330
Okay. See you later!

381
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,820
I decided to do that CF.

382
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,930
Why are you donating the full amount?

383
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,120
If Mr. Snake does a good deed before I do and makes a good impression,

384
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,640
how will that make me look?

385
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,590
I will look like a star who only cares about money!

386
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,590
That is... If you want to do it, let's do it together.

387
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,510
If not, tell me ahead of time.

388
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,490
By any chance, do we know each other?

389
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,430
Really, I'm dumbfounded.

390
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,520
You're saying you don't know me?

391
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,540
I've seen you on TV once in a while.

392
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,970
Once in a while? I'm on TV a lot!

393
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:19,240
Anyway!   That donation, let's make it so that we're doing it together.

394
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,340
Don't say anything different to the reporters!

395
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,140
But I am just curious...

396
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,730
If you're an orphan, why are you donating to a charity for single mothers?

397
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,140
Shouldn't you be donating to an orphanage?

398
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,540
Are you interested in me? No, I'm sure you are. You're a man after all.

399
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,630
I'm not.

400
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,560
By any chance, are you gay?

401
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,250
Hey lassie,  why do you keep getting thin?

402
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,050
Oppa, how can you call me that in front of my son?

403
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,620
Just because you're Gahong's Ma'am,

404
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,660
are you a Ma'am to your older brother too?

405
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,060
Why isn't your husband coming?

406
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,330
I know... He said he'd definitely be here.

407
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,020
It's okay. Oh, Uncle. I have to go to the bathroom.

408
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,440
Yes. Okay.

409
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,990
I'm so upset.

410
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,160
How much did you dampen his spirits while raising him?

411
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,700
In time for the upcoming 61st anniversary,

412
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,000
I think Chairwoman Lee is  going to make Kim Yeong Ho the board president.

413
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,220
What did I tell you?

414
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,110
In that Gahong household, Yeong Joon is considered  to be someone else's son.

415
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,940
Don't say such things.

416
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,540
You're such a fool!  He's not blood related on the  family register!

417
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,990
His father, Kim Seong Cheol, is Chairman Lee's son-in-law!

418
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,510
After kicking out her only daughter, there wasn't anyone appropriate to take over the company—

419
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,530
No matter what anyone says, our Yeong Joon

420
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,230
is my husband's son, and my mother-in-law's grandchild.

421
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,060
Hey, Choi Hye Ran!

422
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,040
Wake up!

423
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Don't be caught off guard later and create drama about living or dying over it.

424
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,960
Eat a lot.  You're so thin.

425
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:58,720
Deok Seon Pharmaceutical's Miss Cha Seon Yeong is going to be a little late.

426
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,900
Are you sure she's running late and not that she is not coming?

427
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,860
Eat by yourself.

428
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,720
I got dumped, so I'm sulky.

429
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,500
Awesome! It's like heaven.

431
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,000
Did I come too early?

432
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,730
Would you like to order?

433
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,800
I... Caramel macchiato. No, no. White chocolate?

434
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,320
Give me caramel mocha with a lot of whipped cream.

435
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,370
Peppermint, please.

436
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,700
Warm.

437
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,620
What are you doing?

438
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
He's real.

439
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,490
Are you emigrating somewhere?

440
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes. To the outside of this world.

441
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,330
Did someone say they were giving you permission?

442
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,340
I already heard from Ji Woong to stay there until I find a place.

443
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,330
That the house is big and there are lots of rooms.

444
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,880
You are a lot quicker than you look.

445
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,530
Anyway, I'll pull the car around, so when you get your tea carry your tea and come out to the car. (tea is homonym for car)

446
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,460
What?

447
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,160
But... why do you want me to hold this?

448
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,350
I didn't want them to fall from the backseat, since someone precious gave them to me.

449
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,640
Do you want me to put the heat on under your butt?

450
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,770
No. It's giving off its own steam.

451
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,740
Isn't the flower pot in the backseat  from the stalker?

452
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,760
Someone must be happy to receive flowers from a precious person,

453
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,950
when someone else has a stalker who shoves a flower pot in her face.

454
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,800
How long has it been, since you had symptoms in which whatever you think comes out through your mouth?

455
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,570
I only brought it since they say that you shouldn't dislike the flowers, even if you dislike the person.

456
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,490
You're nice.

457
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,820
But why did you buy the blanket and pillow?

458
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,210
By any chance, because you didn't have any after giving me yours?

459
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,020
- Since women might come and sleep over. 
- Oh!

460
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,070
Why? Can't they sleep over?

461
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,660
Well, why not? With Anna Sue too... Hah!

462
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,610
By the way, congratulations Mr. John Kim.

463
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,160
The scandal you had with Anne Sue dropped a little in the ranking of real time searches.

464
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,230
Maybe people are starting to forget it a little.

465
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,550
But... Where are we going right now?

466
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,620
To my ideal woman.

467
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,770
Ideal woman?

468
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,160
Jiu-jitsu?  Why here?  

469
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,020
I want to introduce you to my ideal woman.

470
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,690
So, why do I have to meet your ideal woman?

471
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,920
So you can watch and learn a little.

472
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Omo. Why should I?

473
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,770
This is what's called the cross guard.

474
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:25,480
She might look like she's at a disadvantage, but actually it's not true.

475
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,590
My ideal woman.

476
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,730
My ideal woman's husband.

477
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,000
Excuse me. What about the Directors?

478
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,190
They've left work.

479
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,790
Come close.

480
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,300
Pardon?

481
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,720
There's no law saying you wouldn't run into a stalker or drunk again,

482
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,220
so if you can't deal with it through law, we should do it with our fists.

483
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,800
Ahh... That's why today...

484
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,420
Jiu-jitsu is almost the only sport where a woman can win against a man.

485
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,880
Since, through skill, you can break the joints.

486
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,480
Now, get on top of me.

487
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,790
Huh?

488
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,290
You saw the Director's position earlier, right?

489
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,700
I am Kang Joo Eun, and you're the drunk.

490
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,820
I am?

491
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,220
Attack me. As much as you'd like. As much as you wish.

492
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,760
You just said as much as I wish.

493
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,480
Here I come, you stalker bastard.

494
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,400
You saw, right? Do it again.

495
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,060
 Again. 

496
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,220
Stalker bastard.

497
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,480
♬  1-2-3-4  ♬

498
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,700
♬   That's right, why don't you come over here right  now, girl?    ♬

499
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,800
♬   Doop Doo Ah, Doop Do Ah. Nobody get in my way!  ♬

500
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,700
♬   I’m feeling so good, everything's so fine, I feel like I'm flying,   ♬

501
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,700
First warning for excessive physical contact

502
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,260
No, that's not it...

503
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,700
♬   Thinking of her every morning, I  ♬

504
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,860
♬   Even when I fall asleep, ooh hoo hoo.  ♬

505
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,480
Cross guard, close your opponent down with your leg strength.

506
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,420
♬   Yeah, I think it keeps showing,   ♬

507
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,100
Strength.

508
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,620
♬   She is my beautiful, beautiful lady   ♬

509
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,580
Don't avoid eye contact and look at your opponent.

510
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,120
Strength.

511
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,370
♬    You're my beautiful beautiful lady. .  ♬

512
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,780
Tap. 
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off.  ♬

513
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,420
♬   The inside of my head is always so complicated,  ♬

514
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,880
♬   I'm afraid that she'll leave, but still I don't dislike it,   ♬

515
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Tap tap.

516
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,880
Why, do you not want to let me go?

517
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,200
What?

518
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,680
When a person tap taps, you're supposed to let them go.

519
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,180
♬   So baby  I've got to hug you in my arms  ♬

520
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,920
♬  Beautiful, beautiful lady,  ♬

521
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,280
♬   Even seeing her again and again she's beautiful. Yeah.  ♬

522
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,420
Breathe.
 ♬   so beautiful, so beautiful lady,   ♬

523
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,240
♬   Girl whom I just can't take my eyes off  ♬

524
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,640
♬   so beautiful, so beautiful   ♬

525
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,060
♬   To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

526
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,620
♬   To me you are too perfect, Girl  ♬

527
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,140
Uh, well...

528
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,560
Is your ideal type really a martial artist?

529
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,540
A strong woman is sexy.

530
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,920
Even if you can't see her, you worry less about her.

531
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,740
For me also, I thought you liked the Anna Sue type.

532
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,680
Are you interested in my type?

533
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,620
Oh, a question related to the kiss earlier?

534
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,020
What kiss?

535
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,200
Oh. Hey, I lost 4.5 kg (approx 10 pounds).

536
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,680
I think I've become a bit skinny.

537
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,240
Earlier, from what I felt...

538
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,040
That's enough, that's enough.

539
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,380
I'll take care of my body as I see fit.

540
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,340
Have you forgotten?

541
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,820
Kang Joo Eun's body is mine.

542
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,280
Skinny?

543
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,520
My score is... Well...

544
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,120
Well, anyway, congratulations on your first digit changing.

545
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,400
Oh, Daegu Venus.

546
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,300
It's been a very long time since the first digit changed...

547
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,960
♬  Love is you,  ♬

548
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:09,660
♬   This excitement today, I am getting a good feeling for some reason ♬

549
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,820
♬   I’m getting a good feeling   ♬

550
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,100
♬  If you see me and call my name,  ♬

551
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,580
♬  I don't have the confidence not to smile,  ♬

552
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:30,940
♬  Come to me, look into my eyes,  ♬

553
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,320
♬  My heart trembles and I waver at the thought of you,  ♬

554
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,660
♬   This excitement today, I am getting a good feeling for some reason ♬

555
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:50,100
♬  When you come closer, when you you look at me,  ♬

556
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,340
♬  When you call my name,  ♬

557
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,760
♬  I feel like I've fallen   ♬

558
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,980
♬  in love,  ♬

559
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,900
Everyone come to eat.

560
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,860
Wait one minute.

561
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,020
If we're going to have to eat these roots and bland meat

562
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,400
let's at least eat it in sufficient quantities.

563
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,000
but Ma'am, why are we speaking so softly?

564
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,180
In case Hyungnim Yeong Ho makes a fuss again.

565
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,000
Don't you know that an elephant is also an animal which eats bland food?

566
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,860
Hyungnim isn't here.

567
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,940
Where did he go?

568
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,900
He had something to take care of so... a bit far.

569
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,340
He'll be a while.

570
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,720
That's good. Let's eat a lot among us.

571
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,260
Why? 
  Thyroid medication. 

572
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,140
 Anyway, since you are known to be meticulous. 

573
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,600
Just a moment.

574
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,260
What's with him? Without even saying anything?

575
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,480
The backseat will be safer.

576
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,440
I'm not the director yet.

577
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,240
I never hired a driver like you either, Manager Min.

578
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,400
About Deok Seon Pharmaceutical's Miss Cha Sun Yeong. Think about it carefully.

579
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,500
You two are well suited.

580
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,180
Think about it carefully.

581
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,680
We're better suited.

582
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,660
But why is there no flower bouquet today?

583
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,640
Starting tomorrow it'll be quite tiring. Try closing your eyes.

584
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,060
Hey, is this the sound of deliciousness right now?

585
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,320
Of course I did lose something.

586
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,820
My pants are bigger and my jacket's looser.

587
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,300
Producer Go went to the US?!

588
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,260
To find John Kim?!

589
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,580
When is he coming?

590
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,420
Hey, as his ex-wife do you not even know that?

591
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,260
No, no, no. Hang up for now.

592
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,980
What do I do?

593
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,520
Where did this man go?!

594
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,820
Did he go to America?

595
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,140
Fourteen.

596
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,540
Sixteen.

597
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:56,850


598
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,960
Mr. Coach.

599
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,400
Yes. Who is it?

600
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,320
It should be saved as Mr. Coach.

601
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh, it's Mr. Coach.

602
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,060
I heard you went somewhere.

603
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,040
I'm having a glass of wine after such a long time.

604
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,940
Hang up for now.

605
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,940
Where is there such...

606
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,260
Oh no, oh no.

607
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,740
Since not being able to lie is your strong point.

608
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,320
How much did you exercise?

609
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,700
Has it been about 30 or 40 minutes?

610
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,700
What about stretching? Did you do enough?

611
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,440
None of your business whether I do it or not.

612
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,960
Remember the 1-10 I mentioned earlier?

613
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,820
Among those 1, 4, 5.

614
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,160
Oh, the nagging, the nagging.

615
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,600
What's the point of video calling? As if it's a face I miss so much I could die.

616
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,420
What's all this fuss about missing me now?

617
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,180
Then why don't you act a little more prettily normally.

618
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,320
What?

619
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,360
Me too. Said from the heart.

620
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,540
Oh, if you just leave what am I supposed to do?!

621
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,220
One, four, five.

622
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,360
Take videos of them and send them to me. I'll give you remote support.

623
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,280
Videos?

624
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,220
Not porn. Evidence videos.

625
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,920
Since you're not in front of my eyes, can I trust you to do them?

626
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,100
And that...

627
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,960
Move your cheek since I can't see.

628
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,680
But then,  are you by chance in America?

629
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,980
And if so?

630
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,110
To see Anna Sue?

631
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,880
 If so? 

632
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,690
Take care of yourself.

633
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,540
My friend's ex-husband, Producer Go, went to America to find John Kim.

634
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,360
Oh, is that right?

635
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,540
Then shall we hang up?

636
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,790
Whatever.

637
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,570
I think Anna Sue is here.

638
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,930
Then have a comfortable and racy night.

639
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,510
This is a medical exam questionnaire.

640
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,530
I thought it would be more comfortable if I filled it in for you.

641
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,210
The head of the hospital will be here in the morning.

642
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,960
Then, please rest.

643
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,800
Manager Min.

644
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:16,230
Just... Have a comfortable and racy night.

645
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,200
 CT, MRI, PET-CT  

646
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,000
 Hyeon Woo's ex-husband, PD Go 

647
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,730
  Go PD, have you found John Kim? 

648
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,490
  PD, have you found John Kim? 

649
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,450
  One, two, three, stop. 

650
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,440
 November 21st, my last exercise for the day. 

651
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,910
 It's the number 10 

652
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,200
 Oh, it's hard! Oh. 

653
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,920
What is she doing?

654
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,310
Since it's such a rare disease,

655
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:13,160
and until you come here more often, I can't give you a definite answer since it's a special case.

656
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,780
but in my opinion, you're 99.9% free of tumors.

657
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,080
Congratulations.

658
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:32,480
By the way, you have pain periodically? How intense?

659
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,610
Probably. It seems to be a nerve issue.

660
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:40,890
Once in a while, it's hard to withstand it.

661
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:45,750
There's a chance that the  primary cause is psychological.

662
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:53,120
It's like fear. Since all those operations were probably too much for a child to handle.

663
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,190
 Father! Please stop this!  

664
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,060
  Dad, save me! 

665
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,970
  Dad, I'm really scared! 

666
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,870
  Mom. Mom. 

667
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,150
  It really hurts.  Please save me. 

668
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,950
 After I become an adult, after I get a little older, couldn't I do it then? 

669
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,420
  Please, Father. 

670
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,520
There's no cure for a nerve issue.

671
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:44,800
It'll probably disappear one day or continue until I die.

672
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,140
If you need my help,  call me at any time.

673
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,230
Yes, thank you.

674
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,560
The rehabilitation must have been painful.

675
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:58,860
Almost as if you did too much, you did very well. In today's terms, you have an awesome physique.

676
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,860
I made a desperate effort to survive.

677
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,530
You worked very hard.

678
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:09,730
To say it's a miracle wouldn't be an exaggeration.

679
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,800
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

680
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,150
Where should I take you?

681
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:42,700
Manager Min... I want to rest a little.

682
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,010
I'll take you to the closest hotel.

683
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:11,510
 Anna Sue is begging me to play a few days longer. Today is number 2, 5, and 10. 

684
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,140
Good morning, Manager Min!

685
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,780
It's good evening.

686
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,210
Let's go, okay?

687
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,800
 2014. 11. 25. 
 8:15 PM 

688
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,270
Eight... Nine...

689
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:46,440
Ten...  Eleven...

690
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,680
Yes, I'm doing it.  Twelve...

691
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,760
Did everyone go somewhere?

692
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,720
Can't you hear me?

693
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,330
This... is something I haven't seen before.

694
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:43,900
