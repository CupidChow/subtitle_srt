2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,809
Do you know why Kim Sungcheol married you?

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,880
If he hadn't married you,

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,984
he would have gotten half of
the shares for Gahong.

5
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:21,811
He married you so that he could hand down
the whole company to Youngho.

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,526
Unless something happens to Kim Youngho,

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,596
nothing will go to Youngjun.

8
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,277
Where is Youngho?

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,580
Find him right now!

10
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,182
Where are you now?

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,884
I'm home.

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,887
I was about to get dressed and leave.

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,292
Thank goodness.
Please don't go anywhere. Stay home.

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,093
I think Mr. Choi...

15
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,095
What?

16
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,736

19
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,666
No, Namcheol.

20
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,279
Please don't.

Youngho, darling.

23
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,304
No!

24
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,907
Somebody help!

25
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,009
Is anyone there? Hyeran!

26
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,845
Wake up. Hyeran.

41

44
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,311
It hurts so much.

45
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,014
Please save me.

46
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:05,258
Can we do it later when I'm older?
When I'm an adult?

47
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,161
Please, Father.

she would suffer from...

...multiple organ failures
due to her fractured ribs.

will take some time to heal.

Why did you do such a stupid thing?

98
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,531
I went to attend...

99
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,901
...the 61st anniversary ceremony.

100
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,906

everybody...

106
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,900
...wouldn't be so greedy.

I looked into it,

151
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:04,176

tried to block Mr. Choi's car...

152
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,779
to protect Jang Junseong.

153
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,080
And your wife was following...

154
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,884
...Mr. Choi to stop him.

155
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,620
Each party caused harm
and was harmed in this accident.

156
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,428
We need to reach...

157
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,399
...some kind of agreement with Mr. Choi...

158

00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,561
You're making my headache worse.

176
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,165
You scared me.

177
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,168
My goodness. You little...

178
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,573
Now that you know I'm not dead,
just go.

179
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,340
Go away.

180
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:34,193
You didn't have any rice in your house.

181
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,495
So I couldn't make you rice porridge.

182
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,898
Eat that and feel better.

183
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,471
I don't know why you're doing this.

184
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,214
Since we're not at work,

185
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,016
I'll speak casually.

186
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,351
Go ahead.

187
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,823
Take my advice.
Don't mix medication and alcohol.

188
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,758
Your body...

189
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:08,312
...isn't disposable.

190
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,595
Also,

191
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,964
change the passcode for your door.

192
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,499
It's 0413.

193
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,269
How could you use your birthday?

194
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,137
You live alone.
You should be more careful.

195
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,942
One more thing.

196
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,743
Apologize.

197
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,213
For what?

198
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,615
Do it.

199
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,016
I told you.

200
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:35,821
-I didn't steal Woosik.
-Apologize while I'm asking nicely.

201
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,627
When you passed the bar

202
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,329
and went to the States,

203
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,998
why didn't you call me?

204
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,001
When you were in the States,

205
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,503
why did you ignore my emails?

206
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,808
Why did you say we were classmates
when we were friends?

207
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,310
Why did you do that? Why?

208
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,314
Kang Jooeun.

209
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,392
I feel horrible right now,

210
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,095
so please apologize.

211
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,496
Please.

212
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,968
Why are you taking it out on me?

213
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,164
You witch.

214
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:31,744
Gosh!

215
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,547
You're worse!

216
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:37,084
What did I do?

217
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,851
The engineering student.

218
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:41,754
The jerk that you introduced me to.

219
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,193
That jerk told me that you...

220
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:52,865
...set me up because
you felt sorry for me.

221
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,037
He destroyed my self-esteem.

222
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,840
He said,

223
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,810
someone like me shouldn't
go to places like that.

224
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,612
Gosh.

225
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:10,516
-That jerk!
-You did that with Lee Jihoon, too.

226
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:13,118
You said you'd let me meet him,

227
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,321
and then you got his number.

228
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,124
Because you were pretty...

229
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,094
Because you had everything.

230
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,497
Because I was just...

231
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:30,102
...a fat loser by your side
that people felt sorry for.

232
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:33,316
You idiot.

233
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,607
That was his manager's number.

234
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,876
He wanted to introduce me to him.

235
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,080
Forget it.

236
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,185
Is that what it was...

237
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,220
...all this time?

238
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,123
You were my friend, Oh Soojin.

239
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,526
Was it because of those emotions?

240
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,198
Human beings are animals...

241
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,701
...that can die because of those emotions.

242
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,105
Being lonely?

243
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,707
Being miserable?

244
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,909
That's what it means.

245
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,480
You witch.

246
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,889
You apologize first.

247
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,394
I didn't know.

248
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,565
I didn't even know that
I needed to justify myself.

249
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,069
Fine, I'm sorry.

250
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:41,774
I really...

251
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,678
...didn't come on to Woosik first.

252
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,980
I've known him for 15 years.

253
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,450
He wouldn't fall for someone
just for flirting.

254
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,553
I'm sure he's sincere.

255
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,857
I'm sure he stalled because
he felt guilty towards me,

256
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,860
which resulted in bad timing.

257
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,372
What's going on with you?

258
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,876
Did you fight with
the executive director of Gahong?

259
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,679
Gosh.

260
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:24,383
Everyone else does it.

261
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,454
Why is it hard for me to be in love?

262
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:51,347
I'm glad I didn't change
the passcode for my door.

263
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:10,929
-Jiwoong.
-Yes?

264
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,233
Don't cry in front of Youngho.

265
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:15,327
Okay.

266
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,606
-Let's not make him sad. Okay?
-Okay.

267
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,309
I can't believe this.

268
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,845
I won't cry.

269
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,547
I won't cry. I swear.

270
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,053
Okay, don't cry.

271
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,354
Don't cry. Don't cry. Never.

272
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:01,547
Youngho.

273
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,850
Junseong.

274
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,351
Yes?

275
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,289
I'm sorry.

276
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,991
I'm sorry.

277
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,495
What about your mother?

278
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,599
I met her.

279
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,402
She told me to thank you.

280
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,176
This happened to you
because of me, didn't it?

281
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,777
You tried to save me.

282
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,179
Shut it.

283
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,249
Jiwoong.

284
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,753
Youngho, I'm here. It's me, Jiwoong.

285
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,558
I'll stick right next to Junseong
and make him a champion.

286
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:50,462
Don't worry.
You don't need to worry at all, okay?

287
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,664
Also,

288
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,167
I brought a gift.

289
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,070
They said it's easy to take care of.

290
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:03,008
You just need to water it
once every 20 days. Okay?

291
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,543
It's super easy.

292
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,711
So...

293
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:07,913
So...

294
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,217
You have to get up,

295
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,819
and water it.

296
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,020
Okay?

297
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,022
And don't...

298
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,728
Don't let it die, okay?

299
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:31,303
"Sister-in-law Lawyer Kang Jooeun"

300
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,208
Youngho.

301
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,778
What should I tell Lawyer Kang?

302
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,385
I don't...

303
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,554
...want her...

304
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,558
...to see me like this.

305
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,065
I also don't want...

306
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,971
...to see her cry.

307
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:13,178
I don't even know what will happen to me.

308
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:20,886
Okay.

309
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,089
Youngho.

310
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,692
I'm going to pray for you, okay?

311
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,894
I'm going to pray for a miracle.

312
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,295
Okay?

313
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,701
Go.

314
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,204
Go and...

315
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,573
...get to work.

316
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:03,395
Junseong.

317
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,998
Jiwoong.

318
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,435
Lawyer Kang.

319
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,339
Where is Youngho?

320
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,044
Well...

321
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:20,846
Jiwoong.

322
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,853
How bad is he?

323
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,794
It must be bad.

324
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,398
It must be very bad.

325
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,770
Where is he?

326
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,775
I know Youngho is sick.

327
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,377
I've seen how bad it is.

328
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,186
Did something happen?

329
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,322
Lawyer Kang.

330
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:05,891
Ma'am.

331
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,229
I'll just search every one of
Gahong's hospitals.

332
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:13,165
I'll search the States,

333
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,466
China,

334
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,368
and the ends of the earth.

335
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:19,671
I'll search every corner of
the universe to find him.

336
00:32:19,873 --> 00:32:21,273
I won't give up.

337
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:24,843
So please...

338
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,847
Junseong.

339
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,649
Junseong.

340
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,183
Jiwoong.

341
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,929
-I'm sorry, this area is restricted.
-I need to go in.

342
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,931
Let go of me.

343
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,234
Mr. Min.

344
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,804
Please go back.
He doesn't want to see you.

345
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,206
You must not know,

346
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,308
but I don't listen to him.

347
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,010
Lawyer Kang Jooeun.

348
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,314
Please, just once.

349
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:36,615
I just want to see if he's okay. Please.

350
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,717
Youngho.

351
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,418
Coach.

352
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,289
Let me go.

353
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,790
Mr. Min.

354
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,693
Youngho.

355
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,596
I just want to see him.

356
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,301
I just want to see if he's okay.

357
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,402
Let go.

358
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,170
Mr. Min.

359
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,439
I'll just see his face and go.

360
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:03,241
Coach.

361
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,346
Youngho, it's me.

362
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,348
Youngho.

363
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,350
"18 missed calls
Oh My Venus"

364
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,053
Coach, it's me.

365
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:17,055
Youngho!

366
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,124
"Oh My Venus"

367
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,859
Is something wrong?

368
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,261
Where are you?

369
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,564
Youngho.

370
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,367
Coach.

371
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,168
Rascal!

372
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,638
Answer me.

373
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,674
Say anything.

374
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,279
Are you in a lot of pain?

375
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,280
I'll go to you.

376
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,293
Coach, it's me.

377
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,295
Youngho.

378
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,566
Open the door.

379
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll go after I see his face.

380
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:04,002
I'll go after I see that he's okay.

381
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,705
Youngho.

382
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:09,608
Coach.

383
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,309
Youngho.

384
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:18,450
"Coach"

385
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,487
Tap.

386
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,156
Tap.

387
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,805
Let's go see a doctor.

388
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,115
Tap tap.

389
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,819
When a person taps,
you're supposed to let go.

390
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,053
"Tap Tap"

391
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:13,738
Tap.

392
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,207
Tap.

393
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:43,768
Step back.

394
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,017
Youngho.

395
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,820
Coach.

396
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,823
It's me.

397
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,028
You're horrible.

398
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,935
What can I do if you say tap tap?

399
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,037
I know...

400
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,242
...waiting will be tough for me.

401
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,744
I know that's why you're doing this.

402
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,480
But...

403
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,784
I'm not an easy woman.

404
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,927
Whenever you come,

405
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,497
however you come,

406
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,199
I'll be waiting for you.

407
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,169
So you have to come back to me.

408
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,273
Beautifully.

409
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:58,977
And sexily.

410
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,180
Please don't get sick.

411
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,750
I think you're beautiful
when you're healthy.

412
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:09,687
Being healthy

413
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,157
is the sexiest thing.

414
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,160
You have to come back.

415
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,331
Just remember this.

416
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,301
If you're hanging in there,

417
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,703
you haven't reached your limit yet.

418
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,041
If you believe it, you can do it.

419
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,645
It's okay to be sick.

420
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,717
It's okay...

421
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:40,218
...even if you're not as
beautiful or not as sexy.

422
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,325
Just please come back to me.

423
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,931
I'm sorry.

424
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:58,303
I didn't tell you sooner...

425
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,705
...just how much I love you.

426
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,372
Thank you.

427
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,557
Please take good care of him.

428
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,444
I will do all that I can...

429
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,080
...to protect him.

430
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,795
Mother.

431
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,300
Stay still.

432
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,641
I heard...

433
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,543
...what happened.

434
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:22,447
Thinking of what your brother did,

435
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,451
makes me want to tear him to pieces.

436
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:29,954
My baby...

437
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,157
...was severely injured.

438
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:37,829
I'm sorry, Mother.

439
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,899
I heard you blocked him.

440
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,904
Youngho survived...

441
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,071
...because of you.

442
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,714
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm so sorry.

443
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,415
I just hope...

444
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,218
...that we cut off all ties...

445
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:02,422
...as if we never knew each other...

446
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:07,025
until the day we die.

447
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,230
I think that's best for both of us.

448
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:17,814
Take care of yourself.

449
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:22,609
I wish you well.

450
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,238
I can't...

451
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,744
...bring myself to see Youngho today.

452
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,924
Help me.

453
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,295
This...

454
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:52,799
It fell off.

455
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:43,250
I brought Youngjun to a safe place.

456
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,051
You can stay with him when
you get out of the hospital.

457
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,122
I've asked Im Star for his help.

458
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,124
He'll take care of everything.

459
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:55,860
Namcheol.

460
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:05,503
Youngho had cancer.
He suffered from osteosarcoma.

461
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:09,507
He spent half of his life in a hospital,

462
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:13,680
receiving surgeries and treatments.

463
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,280
That was his life.

464
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,651
He lived abroad at such a young age...

465
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,454
...without his mother.

466
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,361
He is Youngjun's brother.

467
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,164
He is also my husband's son.

468
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:40,278
How could you be so cruel, Namcheol?

469
00:45:48,604 --> 00:45:50,982
We have only each other
to turn to in this world.

470
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:53,084
Who else would protect you?

471
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:54,986
Your son is not welcomed in the family.

472
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,788
Who else would protect Youngjun,
my only nephew?

473
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:06,163
Namcheol.

474
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,339
I didn't fit in with the family.

475
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,010
It had already fallen apart.

476
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,246
But I had someone I could call "mother".

477
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,785
Although gruff, I also had
a reliable husband.

478
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,555
And I became Youngjun's mom.

479
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,831
I was thankful for all of that.

480
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,604
You idiot.

481
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:00,718
If you sign this,

482
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,322
the negligence of both you
and the executive director...

483
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,291
...will be settled with a fine.

484
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:11,762
"Traffic Accident Settlement Agreement"

485
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:34,385
Im Star.

486
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,788
You did a good job.

487
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,091
I didn't do much.

488
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,895
I've been meaning to go golfing with you.

489
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,199
I'll arrange for us to go sometime.

490
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,471
Good work.

491
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,003
You can go now.

492
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,045
Director Choi...

493
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,314
...used to be your boss.

494
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,153
Are you offended that I got him
to sign the agreement?

495
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,488
You were doing your job.

496
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,691
Would you like some tea?

497
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:15,593
No, thanks.

498
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,399
You were undertaking the project
for the VVIP medical exam center...

499
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:25,302
...with Director Choi, right?

500
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:27,908
Yes.

501
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:31,612
Since I'm the external counsel team
for the executive director,

502
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,545
I had to review the project.

503
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:36,447
It was a little...

504
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,552
The way we chose the location
and the subcontractors...

505
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:44,188
...wasn't very clear.

506
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:52,163
Is that why you thought
I had a grudge against Youngho?

507
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:53,597
That's right.

508
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,269
The Im Woosik that I used to know,

509
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,772
was a swimmer on the national team.

510
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,575
He gave his best but always
stayed between the lanes.

511
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,678
Look at you now.

512
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:10,815
I don't know.

513
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,918
I wanted the company that
I've been working for...

514
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:18,088
...to be the very best in certain areas.

515
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:22,793
If you find anything that is unclear,

516
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,799
please just let it go.

517
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:29,066
As for things involving Producer Ko,

518
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,470
I was blinded by my goal.

519
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,543
Every other path seemed like
the wrong one.

520
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,045
He was born rich and rose to
a high position easily.

521
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:42,751
I hated that too.

522
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,252
When will you get off work?

523
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,757
Let's have dinner together.

524
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:54,458
That's right.

525
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,460
I had a fight with Jooeun today.

526
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,262
What?

527
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,168
Girls also fight and make up.

528
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,566
Gosh.

529
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,667
Don't be so surprised.

530
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,572
You're starting to scare me again.

531
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:12,810
Jooeun said

532
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,417
that your feelings are
sincere towards me.

533
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:20,317
She said that you aren't someone...

534
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,624
...who falls for a girl just
because she flirts with you.

535
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,063
Talking about Jooeun...

536
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:35,569
...isn't as hard as it used to be.

537
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:42,743
So are you feeling better now?

538
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:44,108
Yes, I am.

539
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:47,111
Let's go eat something delicious.

540
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,612
Okay.

541
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:13,604
"Letter of Resignation"

542
00:51:27,888 --> 00:51:30,991
-Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

543
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,424
"2015 Year of Sheep"

544
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:38,596
-Why are we having...
-Do you want some?

545
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,497
...Rice cake soup while
listening to the new year's bell?

546
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,870
It's not good to eat late at night.

547
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,973
The restaurant closes at this hour.
What choice do we have?

548
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,004
Should we just starve?

549
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,275
Do you want more?

550
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:50,674
Sure, Jaehyeok.

551
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:53,377
I mean, Bokdeong's daddy.

552
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,913
Wait a minute.

553
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,715
Bokdeong's daddy?

554
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,718
Oh my gosh. You two are too much.

555
00:52:06,086 --> 00:52:07,591
Something's wrong, isn't it?

556
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:11,128
Yes, so leave me alone.

557
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,699
She has a bad temper.

558
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:16,800
You have to be patient with her.

559
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:18,202
Yes.

560
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,172
That's not true. She's very mild-tempered.

561
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:24,908
Nonsense.

562
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,911
I don't remember giving birth to
someone mild-tempered.

563
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:30,014
Eat up.

564
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:32,583
Try the different dishes.

565
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,455
Why won't you introduce
your boyfriend to me?

566
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,725
Do you not want to get married?

567
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,128
Of course, I do.

568
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,930
He'll show up soon.

569
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:48,499
Just wait a little bit.

570
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:08,686
You are showing me your back.
You want me to give you a back hug?

571
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,187
Okay.

572
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,091
The meticulous Venus of Daegu's medicine.

573
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,609
Although I am meticulous,

574
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,315
I keep forgetting to take
thyroid medicine.

575
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,722
I keep forgetting things.

576
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:42,019
Oh my gosh. What are you...

577
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,020
but...

578
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:47,224
...it feels like yesterday that I met him.

579
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:54,965
Please just stop being angry for a while.

580
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:02,339
You're fine.

581
00:54:06,046 --> 00:54:07,925
I remember to exercise.

582
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:10,951
Flex the muscles in your back.

583
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:12,349
Straighten your back.

584
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,755
Face forward.

585
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:20,023
I remember to stand straight
to prevent turtle neck syndrome.

586
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,230
Stand in this position. Imagine that
someone is pushing your forehead.

587
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:24,628
Keep your chin down.

588
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,433
Hold for five seconds.

589
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,436
And I often eat a
heaping portion of grass,

590
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,639
but I worry about him

591
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,308
several times a day.

592
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:45,616
Sometimes, I burst into tears
at the most random moments.

593
00:54:52,478 --> 00:54:53,590
I'm sorry.

594
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,897
Lawyer Kang,
is something wrong?

595
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:01,404
I'm sorry.

596
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,134
What's wrong with me?

597
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:07,337
You poor thing.

598
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:13,410
I've been living like this for 20 years.
I can get a divorce tomorrow. It can wait.

599
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:17,648
It's okay. It's okay.

600
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:19,052
It's okay.

601
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,952
You poor thing.

602
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:23,954
It'll be okay, right?

603
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:27,391
It'll really be okay, right?

604
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,359
Of course.

605
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:39,236
"Court"

606
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:02,392
"Court"

607
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:07,197
In January of 2015, the cost of
cigarettes went up by two dollars a pack.

608
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,299
On February 26,

609
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:11,401
the adultery law was repealed.

610
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,805
In May, we had the first MERS patient.

611
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:15,973
How do you feel?

612
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,177
-How does it feel to win?
-Please look over here!

613
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:21,478
On August 15, Junseong became
the RFC Champion.

614
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,847
-How do you feel?
-What will you do next?

615
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:26,149
-What's next for you?
-Please give us a statement.

616
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:32,956
Jiwoong was rejected by the marines six
times, but he promised to apply again.

617
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,366
Don't cry.

618
00:56:43,303 --> 00:56:44,801
Everybody endures it.

619
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:47,274
They just go on with their life.

620
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,173
Like that,

621
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,745
all of us...

622
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,112
...endured and went on
with our lives in 2015.

623
00:56:56,822 --> 00:57:00,550
And today is 2015, December 24th.

624
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:03,453
He is...

625
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,360
...still everywhere.

626
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:30,981
And nowhere.

627
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,243
It's been a while.

628
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,048
Kang Jooeun.

629
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:52,796
You must be real.

630
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,598
You must be.

631
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,329
"Oh My Venus"

632
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,834
Stop staring.

633
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:02,169
You'll wear me out.

634
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,867
Stay in my sight.

635
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,237
Finish up quickly,

636
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,909
so that I can kiss you,

637
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,540
to show you that I'm happy to see you.

638
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:13,143
I don't know if you know this.

639
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:14,648
But to me,

640
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:18,148
you looking at me is a miracle.

641
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,451
Get back safely.

642
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,453
I'll see you tomorrow.

643
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,455
Tomorrow?

644
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,758
We'll see each other...

645
01:00:28,956 --> 01:00:30,260
...every day.
