The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Please dial again later.

4
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,180
Sorry.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,740
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

6
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,280
Please dial again later.

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,720
Did you get through?

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Okay, I got it.

9
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
Lin Baihui said Mai Sichong was not in the dormitory.

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Call Ding Yi and ask him.

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,080
OK.

12
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,560
Put it on speaker.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Hey, Ding Yi.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,400
Is Mai Sichong in the swimming pool?

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
He just got here.

16
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
He has gone to the locker room to find Rui

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,280
and didn't let any of us in.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,600
It's the first time I've seen Chong so angry.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,480
Fine, I got it.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,840
Weiwei

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
- They're going to the gym now. - Let's meet there too.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,600
OK.

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Nothing to say?

24
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
Don't you know all about it?

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
So you let me know on purpose?

26
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,360
Explain it.

27
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,960
I admit that

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
I went to the provincial team and told on you for cheating

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,920
and it was me who sent you

30
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
the video and pictures.

31
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Why did you do so?

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,240
Have I done anything wrong to you

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
in the time we've been training together?

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
Does it matter?

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,040
If you have a weakness

36
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,640
I can defeat you.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Actually, I already know that

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
Mei Weiwei is electriferous.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,080
Why did you do this?

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,840
Do you think there is still a need to ask?

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,400
We've been together for so long.

42
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Aren't we friends?

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
We are all here to compete

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,240
not to make friends.

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,520
I admit that

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
you have been a genius since childhood.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,000
You are better than me.

48
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,680
Even if I trained in the swimming pool for five hours

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
eight hours or ten hours

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,160
I could never exceed you.

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Is that your reason?

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Why should Mei Weiwei be involved in this?

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,840
Because she is my last bargaining chip.

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,840
Think about it.

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,200
What would people do to her

56
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,800
if others knew

57
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,760
she was an electriferous freak?

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,040
Mai Sichong

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Do you want to destroy yourself

60
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
or her?

61
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,520
You have a choice.

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,840
What are you doing?

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
What's wrong with you two, Chong?

64
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,040
Weiwei

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,520
Xia Rui

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,520
Chong

67
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,360
We are all good friends.

68
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
Why did you fight with Rui?

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,000
I treat him like a friend

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,680
and he?

71
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
He reported me to the provincial team for cheating.

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,080
Reported you?

73
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Did he get something on you?

74
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
Are you OK?

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm fine.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,760
Your speed

77
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,440
has slowed down a lot recently.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,920
What's wrong?

79
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Something's on your mind?

80
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
You have progressed

81
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
but I have been stagnant.

82
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Come on.

83
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
There are only a few people who can beat me

84
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
and you are one of them.

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
Are you giving up?

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
(Junjun: Why did you do that just now?)

87
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't you ever do that again.

88
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,480
Mai Sichong likes Weiwei

89
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
and Weiwei likes him.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
They two are a pair.

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
So what?

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
You have liked him for so long.

93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
Why should he ignore you?

94
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,440
I

95
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
don't need him to know.

96
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
Not all unrequited love

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
works out.

98
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Raise your hand

99
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
if you think Chong cheated.

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,880
Great.

101
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,800
That means there is only one truth.

102
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Xia Rui

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
seized the weakness of Chong

104
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,440
and wanted to blackmail him.

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,680
Li Daixi

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Did you know something?

107
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,160
Do I need to tell you everything?

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,600
Is it

109
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
related to Weiwei?

110
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,920
Chong

111
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,080
If you have problems, just tell us. We'll help you figure out a solution.

112
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Actually, it's me...

113
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm a little thirsty.

114
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,400
Go buy a bottle of water with me.

115
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,640
What do you want to say?

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
Why don't you let me say it?

117
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
Just tell them that I'm electriferous

118
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Xia Rui will not be able to threaten you.

119
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
Have you considered your own situation?

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,480
I know

121
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,840
you are worried about me.

122
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,640
But I really don't want you to risk because of me.

123
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Listen

124
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,040
take care of yourself first.

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,280
Then we'll go on an adventure together.

126
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
OK?

127
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Weiwei

128
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,560
What's going on?

129
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,600
Your vision is blurred.

130
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm not.

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,640
You are.

132
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not.

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
Why on earth did you do that?

134
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
Aren't we friend?

135
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Not brothers

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,320
but rivals.

137
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Rivals?

138
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Mai Sichong never saw you as a rival.

139
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,520
Xia Rui

140
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
You can never beat Mai Sichong

141
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,160
because you are despicable.

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Listen to me.

143
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
It's okay to quarrel, but do not fight.

144
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,280
Right.

145
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
I admit that I am despicable.

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,400
But I just want to be in the provincial team.

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
Mai Sichong has a bargaining chip.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
Do I have one?

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I had no choice

150
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
but to do so.

151
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,240
This is my only way out.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Sorry.

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm going with you.

154
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
I haven't changed my clothes yet.

155
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,080
Xia Rui

156
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Let's talk.

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,640
Just a few words.

158
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,280
It will not take you much time.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,400
OK.

160
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
We have known each other for quite some time.

161
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't think you're bad.

162
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,680
so I'm asking you to leave me and Mai Sichong alone.

163
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
We can't be friends

164
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
but don't be enemies.

165
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,400
Only if Mai Sichong leaves

166
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I can be in the provincial team.

167
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
That's all I want.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
What you are doing makes you

169
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,200
not only lose to him, but also to yourself.

170
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,440
You and Mai Sichong are a good match.

171
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
You two never consider others' feelings.

172
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you think Mai Sichong will give up his dream to protect you?

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
People like you have never cherished anyone, right?

174
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
I won't be manipulated by you.

175
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm off for training.

176
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Dr. Jiang

177
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,560
Come in.

178
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,480
Hello, Dr. Jiang.

179
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,200
Hello.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,320
Come in.

181
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,040
Please take a look.

182
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,680
Here are the results of her tests.

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,480
Dr. Jiang

184
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
I'd like to try the experimental therapy you mentioned before.

185
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,200
The current experimental therapy

186
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
is to apply a high voltage instrument

187
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,240
together with drugs

188
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,560
to control the heart rate of the patient

189
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
below 110 for a long period of time.

190
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,040
Does it

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
have any side effects?

192
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,040
Yeah, will it be dangerous?

193
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,600
This experimental therapy is actually still being tested.

194
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,760
There are certain risks.

195
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,240
So

196
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
We do not recommend patients try it for now.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,720
How about this?

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,120
Weiwei

199
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,960
I'll prescribe you some medicine to stabilize your heart rate.

200
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,520
After your situation is stabilized

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
we will consider

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
whether to apply experimental therapy.

203
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
If the electricity on my body vanishes

204
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,400
Xia Rui will not be able to threaten Mai Sichong.

205
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,520
Ding Yi

206
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,400
Why did Xia Rui and Mai Sichong get into such a mess recently?

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I just don't know.

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,880
I really don't know why.

209
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,480
What exactly does Xia Rui have on Chong

210
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,560
to prevent him from going for the drug test?

211
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,360
Isn't that Weiwei?

212
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,800
It's weird.

213
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
Take a look.

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Let's go.

215
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,320
Go.

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,720
Weiwei

217
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
You didn't see anything.

218
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,480
Nothing

219
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,240
happened just now.

220
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,760
Does Chong

221
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,000
know?

222
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,720
This is

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
the whole thing.

224
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,080
So Xia Rui found out about this

225
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,400
and forced Mai Sichong to quit the drug test.

226
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,840
Otherwise, he will make it public.

227
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,520
I hope everyone

228
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
can keep the secret for Weiwei.

229
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,760
Of course.

230
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Enjoy the food.

231
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
It's on me.

232
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
I know what you're going to say.

233
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
But things have come to this point.

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,280
Everyone will believe that Mai Sichong cheated.

235
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,560
Since

236
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,880
you know what I am going to say

237
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,000
it means that you feel guilty.

238
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,080
Don't you?

239
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,320
Junjun

240
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm not like Mai Sichong.

241
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,240
Even if he doesn't swim, he has a wealthy family.

242
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,880
He can also have a bright future.

243
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,480
But what about me?

244
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,800
This has nothing to do with family background.

245
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
In any case

246
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,360
you can't use such a despicable way to achieve your goal.

247
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,400
This is unfair to Mai Sichong.

248
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,560
It is also a harm

249
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,040
to you.

250
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
Are you worried about me

251
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,880
or Mai Sichong?

252
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,360
(Junjun: Leniency to those who confess,
severity to those who resist.)

253
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,720
Mai Sichong's cheating at the provincial training camp trials

254
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
spreads around the school.

255
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
I heard that Mai Sichong's cheating is related to Mei Weiwei.

256
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
Mei Weiwei is really harmful to others and herself

257
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,360
I liked Mai Sichong so much before.

258
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,600
Mai Sichong is doomed this time.

259
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,480
Mei Weiwei is really a pest.

260
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,120
Maybe his previous results are not true.

261
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
That doesn't mean he cheated all the time.

262
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,920
I suggest the school to look into him.

263
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,480
Are you all so well-informed?

264
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Where did the information come from?

265
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
Is your news reliable?

266
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
You guys know nothing, why are you talking nonsense?

267
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Weiwei

268
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
Yuxin came to work and couldn't come today.

269
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,080
And our posters were posted so late.

270
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
Will anyone come?

271
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
It's fine. Everyone counts.

272
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,040
You...

273
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
I am Lin Baihui, monitor of the Rehabilitation Class.

274
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,000
Are you

275
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,360
all here

276
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,680
for the lecture?

277
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
The two on the stage

278
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,720
which one of you is Mei Weiwei?

279
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I am Mei Weiwei.

280
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,400
What's the matter

281
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,400
please?

282
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,400
Nothing.

283
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,560
Just to see whether Mei Weiwei is beautiful or not.

284
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,080
I think Mai Sichong was exposed

285
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,640
because he was with you, right?

286
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,480
You are going too far.

288
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,880
Please get out.

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,640
Why?

290
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,480
Mai Sichong did this kind of thing

291
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
why can't we talk about it?

292
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
That's right.

293
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Such a person is really a disgrace to our university.

294
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,240
Mai Sichong would never cheat.

295
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,720
He didn't go to the drug test because...

296
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Say it!

297
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,360
Where are you going?

298
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,200
Weiwei

299
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,560
Lin Baihui has sent me a message.

300
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,800
You suffered so much

302
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,080
because of me.

303
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,560
I...

304
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Why should you be sorry?

305
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,480
- It's not your fault. - Why are you apologizing?

306
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,960
Because

307
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,680
I failed to protect you.

308
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,440
I don't necessarily need your protection.

309
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,560
I can also protect you.

310
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,120
If Xia Rui wants to make it public

311
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,600
just let him do that.

312
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
If it weren't for the fact that I'm electriferous

313
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
you wouldn't have to suffer these.

314
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,080
Mai Sichong

315
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
go for the drug test.

316
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,400
Why should you carry the burden of my life on your shoulders?

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,640
It's fine.

318
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
It will work out.

319
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,440
Give me more time.

320
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,560
All right.

321
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Don't worry about me.

322
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,320
Take care of yourself first, okay?

323
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Then promise me

324
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,640
you'll get the drug test

325
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
before the deadline.

326
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,960
Look

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
you are only this high.

328
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,440
In the future

329
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
if the sky collapses

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,160
I will bear it for you.

331
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,480
If the road breaks

332
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,960
I will pave it for you.

333
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,400
We will

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
have a beautiful life in the future.

335
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
And we will create this life together.

336
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
So, don't be afraid.

337
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm here with you.

338
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,720
Let's go.

339
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
If others know

340
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,120
that she is an electriferous freak

341
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
what will they do to her?

342
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
I didn't dare to stay with others

343
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
after I transferred school.

344
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,960
So I took the graduation photo on my own.

345
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,440
You must have suffered a lot

346
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,880
because of electricity, right?

347
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Take it easy.

348
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,320
I won't tell others.

349
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,720
If anyone else knows

350
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,520
I will protect you.

351
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,160
If someone bullies you

352
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
I will help you bully back.

353
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
To be honest

354
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
the most important thing in my life

355
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,120
is swimming.

356
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Are these medals you have won since childhood?

357
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,000
Just gold medals.

358
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
I believe you will be on the podium in the future.

359
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,840
You will definitely go a long way

360
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,520
not only in the country

361
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,400
but also in the world.

362
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,680
You know?

363
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
I have always been at the international level, OK?

364
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,360
From now on, wait for me at the finish line.

365
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
When I win

366
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,040
you will be the first therapist of the future Olympic champion.

367
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
What if you lose?

368
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,120
I won't lose.

369
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,280
I won't allow that.

370
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,680
Hello.

371
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
Dr. Jiang

372
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,280
Weiwei

373
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
Why are you here alone?

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,680
Dr. Jiang

375
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,120
I want to accept the experimental therapy now.

376
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,440
But this instrument is still in the small-scale test phase.

377
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,680
I took the medication you prescribed last time but it didn't help.

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,280
This is my last option.

379
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
So Dr. Jiang

380
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,280
please help me.

381
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,440
Do your parents

382
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,360
know about this?

383
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,840
They know.

384
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,280
And doctor

385
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,960
you know my problem is possibly human over-evolution.

386
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I'll be fine.

387
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,800
But this therapy still has some risks.

388
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,120
So you have to...

389
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Dr. Jiang

390
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
I just want to live like a normal person.

391
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,960
Dr. Jiang

392
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Please.

393
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,600
Follow me.

394
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,640
Hey.

395
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,680
Did you eat?

397
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes.

398
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,360
What's wrong?

399
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,960
Why do you sound a little upset?

400
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm not.

401
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm not upset.

402
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,120
All right.

403
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
I just told my parents

404
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
that I will go to the coach later.

405
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,040
Maybe

406
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,880
the coach can buy us more time.

407
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,200
So

408
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
you need to stop stressing out about the drug test.

409
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,160
Did you hear that?

410
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,160
Even if

411
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,320
I can't make it to the provincial team

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
I can be a coach.

413
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,920
Just like

414
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
Lao Yang.

415
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,920
I'll find a group of good swimmers like me

416
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,600
to win medals.

417
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,560
That's quite a sense of accomplishment, right?

418
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,760
Anyway

419
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,120
the most important thing

420
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,800
is that both of us

421
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,800
can be well.

422
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,520
Why don't you speak?

423
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Hmm

424
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,360
Li Daixi called me.

425
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,800
OK.

426
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,160
Go play with her.

427
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,200
Bye-bye.

428
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Bye-bye.

429
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,480
You are awake.

430
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,640
How do you feel? Any discomforts?

431
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,880
I was worried about you.

432
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,480
If it wasn't Li Daixi

433
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
I wouldn't know you fainted.

434
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What happened?

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
My electricity seems to disappear.

436
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,000
What?

437
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,800
Look.

438
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,280
It really disappeared.
