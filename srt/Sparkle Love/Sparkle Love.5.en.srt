00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,874
If the voltage can be controlled properly,

3
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,074
electricity can also
help to treat sports pains.

4
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,954
50.35´´.

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,914
Not bad!

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,834
It's only 0.4 seconds longer
than the best record in high school!

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Mai Sichong

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,594
Why do you ask me to come here?

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,736
Time the speed for me.

10
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Ready...

11
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Go!

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,994
What's the result?

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,640
51´46´´.

14
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
That's 51´´.

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,434
Why do I have to do
anything you ask me to?

16
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
Why on earth did you ask me to come here?

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,680
Mei Weiwei

18
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Please electrify me.

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,234
I say,

20
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,280
Please electrify me.

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
What a weirdo!

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
Stop!

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,394
Are you insane?

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,554
I'm not.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
I mean it.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,994
No way. I won't do it.

27
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,154
Why not?

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,634
Why not?

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,872
What if you are going to

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
do that to me?

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Do what to you?

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Like you?

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,994
Mei Weiwei

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,514
I didn't realize in the past

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,280
that you really have great imagination.

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Fine.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,760
It's my fault, okay?

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,314
How about that?

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,456
When you electrify me,

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,354
close your eyes.

41
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,074
I promise,

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,840
that the same mistake won't happen twice.

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,434
I still won't do that.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,714
I cannot guarantee the
intensity of my current.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,394
I cannot be responsible for you.

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,394
Don't worry.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
You needn't take the responsibility.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,114
Isn't he Chong?

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
Go, go, go.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,394
Okay. Stop talking.

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,728
Go back for your training.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,632
It's you who stick yourself to me.

53
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Forget it.

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,074
Anyway,

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,360
you have to electrify me.

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
Why do I have to?

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,074
Is it important for you to know it?

58
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,154
If you don't tell me why,

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,754
I'll just leave.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Fine, fine, fine.

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,314
I'm wrong.

62
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll tell you everything.

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,754
Well,

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,914
if you electrify me,

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
I can swim faster.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not sick!

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,632
Do you think I really believe you?

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,154
Hello, Monitor.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,634
Hello, Weiwei.

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,514
Where are you?

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,274
Everyone is here except you.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Okay. I'll be right there.

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,154
I'll go now.

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,194
Let me tell you. No way!

75
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,120
Ask someone else!

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
Mei Weiwei

77
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,704
Who else can I ask for help?

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Sorry, I'm late.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,994
Weiwei

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,194
You ask us to come here

81
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
to...

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,434
To make an announcement.

83
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,514
Monitor and I prepared

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,794
a big plan for you to graduate smoothly.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,120
And this plan is...

86
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,474
Physical Massage Club!

87
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Clap your hands!

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,034
Anyway,

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,394
it's a club in line with our major.

90
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,554
The club can not only rich our knowledge,

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,200
but also help our schoolmates
to recover physically after sports.

92
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
So?

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,514
So,

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,714
why don't all of us

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,440
join in the club together?

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,954
Join in it together.

97
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,634
Weiwei

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,674
You helped me in the last presentation,

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,874
and I really appreciate you,

100
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,634
but for this Physical Massage Club,

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,434
I have no time,

102
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
or no interest.

103
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,754
Yuxin

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,754
We are a little bit worried about you

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,920
for being expelled due to
absence from so many classes.

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,994
That's better.

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,960
So I won't submit the
application by my own.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,994
Anything else to say?

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,472
If no, I'll go back to sleep.

110
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,994
Yuxin

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,874
Weiwei

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,874
For the club...

113
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,834
I'll just not join in.

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,314
My post bar manager
is still waiting for me.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,194
I'll go back now.

116
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Junjun

117
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,594
Weiwei

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,034
Don't be frustrated.

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,834
That's how revolution goes.

120
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,634
A thousand turns to
meet, a long way to go.

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,394
You are right, my monitor.

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Don't worry. I won't give up.

123
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,034
Oh, right. Monitor.

124
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,834
I have something to ask you.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,674
You said in the last class

126
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,954
that electricity can help bodies recover.

127
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,834
Is it possible that

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,394
electricity can stimulate
the potential of bodies?

129
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,554
For example,

130
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,320
making people to run faster or something.

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,434
Electrotherapy is indeed the
most basic physical therapy.

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,834
As far as I know,

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,834
it can relax muscles and regulate nerves.

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,114
But as for what you said,

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,594
stimulating the potential,

136
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,720
I have never heard of it.

137
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,554
Who says I have to
ask Mei Weiwei for help?

138
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,648
I'll do it by myself.

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,794
Mei Weiwei

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,634
You take the class by yourself?

141
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,954
Yeah, by myself.

142
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,192
Don't denounce me later.

143
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
Hi, this lady.

144
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,352
Where are you from?

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,434
Hello, Professor.

146
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,554
I'm Mei Weiwei.

147
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,634
Mei Weiwei?

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,800
You look differently from last time.

149
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,554
Maybe...

150
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,514
I have my hair cut, Professor.

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,514
So...

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,704
It's hard to recognize.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Stand up.

154
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,594
I teach rehabilitation.

155
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,474
Do you think I am too old

156
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,074
to remember your figures now?

157
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,514
You are totally different in height.

158
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,354
How dare you say you are the same person?

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,194
How bold you are!

160
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,834
Tell me,

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,874
which class are you from?

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
What's your name?

163
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,914
Professor

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,314
I'm Mei Weiwei, really.

165
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,034
If you're real Mei Weiwei,

166
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,714
the last one must be the fake one.

167
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,192
Your attendance is still "F".

168
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,074
Now,

169
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
class begins.

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
Weiwei

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Weiwei

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,154
Are...

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,754
Are you okay?

174
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,754
I'm fine.

175
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,834
Quite well.

176
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,354
Only one class is missed.

177
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,514
I'll just make it up later.

178
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm so relieved if you think like that.

179
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,354
As for the grade,

180
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,474
you don't need to worry.

181
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll help you make it up with key points.

182
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,872
Thank you, Monitor.

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
I'll just leave now.

184
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,000
Weiwei

185
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Peng Pai

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Thank you.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
Thank you.

188
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,034
Peng Pai

189
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,674
I'm very sorry for what I did that day.

190
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,034
Were they unhappy?

191
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
It's nothing.

192
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,194
Is there any misunderstanding

193
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,432
between you and Sichong?

194
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,394
No.

195
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,400
He and I just...

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,240
Forget it.

197
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,794
As a good athlete like him,

198
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,514
it's really a pity that

199
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,194
he isn't in the provincial team.

200
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,114
Our company always wants to sign with him.

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,354
Sign with him?

202
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,074
Do you mean, like Xun Yang?

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

204
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,954
Weiwei

205
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,634
Did Sichong talk to you

206
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,400
why he's not in the provincial team?

207
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,760
No.

208
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,234
How can he have any reason?

209
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,314
My senior told me

210
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,120
it's because he has severe injuries

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,834
or because

212
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,514
he wants to go to a foreign club.

213
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,184
However, they were just guessing.

214
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,394
As a swimmer, how can I injure my knees?

215
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,714
If you electrify me,

216
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
I may swim faster.

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm also not aware of it.

218
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,514
Still no message.

219
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,656
Playing hide-and-seek?

220
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,600
Hi.

221
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,114
I remember,

222
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,274
you and Weiwei are in
the same class, right?

223
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,474
You are Mai Sichong.

224
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,754
Yes.

225
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,554
I'm Lin Baihui.

226
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,714
I'm her monitor.

227
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,754
Hui

228
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,394
Let me ask you something.

229
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,794
Where is Weiwei?

230
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,040
Weiwei went to the cafe in the school.

231
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay. Thank you, Hui.

232
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,960
Hui...Hui?

233
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,154
Weiwei

234
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,536
Are you available tomorrow?

235
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,274
Yes?

236
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,434
Let's watch a movie together,

237
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,274
as a remedy for the departure
without saying goodbye.

238
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
How's that?

239
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,314
Okay.

240
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,114
I'll buy the tickets.

241
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Okay.

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,394
Mei Weiwei

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,874
Why didn't you text me back?

244
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,800
I...

245
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,514
Peng Pai

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,874
Sichong

247
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm about to visit you
in the swimming team.

248
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,834
I'm having my internship in FT Sports.

249
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
It's a company specialized
in sports brokerage.

250
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,994
Do you have any interest

251
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,240
to know the world except
for training and competitions?

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,394
What do you mean?

253
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
Depending on your appearance and height,

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,754
becoming a star

255
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,320
may be the best choice apart
from being a professional athlete.

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,914
You know,

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,680
the risk of an athlete is very high.

258
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,834
I see.

259
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,394
Thank you, Peng Pai.

260
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,154
But, there is only one goal in my mind.

261
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,320
To be the number one and
join in the provincial team.

262
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,954
Compared to being a star,

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,634
I think,

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,680
being a professional
swimmer seems to fit me more.

265
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,594
Being a professional athlete

266
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,994
is indeed good.

267
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,314
But it looks like gambling.

268
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,434
If you are injured in
competitions and training,

269
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,514
you are able to have another choice.

270
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,088
You can regard it as a retreat.

271
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,994
No, thanks. Peng Pai.

272
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,634
Everything has its risk
as long as people are alive.

273
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,874
Once the risk comes, no one can avoid it.

274
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,394
Why should you worry about

275
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,016
the thing that has not happened?

276
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,232
I have training. I'll go now.

277
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Mei Weiwei

278
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
Peng Pai. I'll also go now.

279
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,074
Can you stop calling my name randomly?

280
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,074
It seems I were your servant!

281
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,514
I said nothing.

282
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,114
You yourself came with me.

283
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,736
It's a waste of time to explain.

284
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,114
As for his advice,

285
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
why you refused it without hesitation?

286
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,394
Persuading me to give up swimming

287
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
is impossible.

288
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,034
Who asked you to give up swimming?

289
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Idiot!

290
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
What did you say?

291
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,194
You said I was an idiot!

292
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,336
How dare you say that?

293
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,314
I didn't mean it!

294
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Did you

295
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,240
have anything hard to disclose?

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,954
Why do you think like that?

297
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,314
You think too much all the time!

298
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
Go.

299
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
Let me go!

300
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,834
Why did you bring me here?

301
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,034
I've made a lot of research

302
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
before I bring you here to electrify me.

303
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,834
Oh, right.

304
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
I begged Doctor Wu many times
to use the electrotherapy room.

305
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Let me do it.

306
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,754
Don't you think that you

307
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,274
are really suitable to do rehabilitation?

308
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,274
No, I'm not.

309
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,474
I do this just to change my major.

310
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,400
You...

311
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,114
You see,

312
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,194
such weak electricity

313
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,074
made my knees more relaxed.

314
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,794
If you can electrify me every day,

315
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,634
my physical ability

316
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,040
will recover even sooner.

317
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,434
Mai Sichong

318
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,200
Why didn't you get in the provincial team?

319
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,434
Well...

320
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,554
I just didn't.

321
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,552
Never ask me again.

322
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,194
What are you doing?

323
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,314
According to your personality,

324
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
your pulse will speed up if you lie.

325
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,354
Now,

326
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,834
look at my eyes, and say

327
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
your body is totally fine.

328
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
I have no problems with my heart.

329
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,154
I want you to say

330
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,880
that your body is totally fine.

331
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
My body is totally fine.

332
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,274
Don't look at it!

333
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,368
You can't look at it!

334
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
What an idiot!

335
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,640
I didn't mean it.

336
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Weiwei

337
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
Weiwei

338
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,600
I was wrong.

339
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,192
I was really wrong.

340
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,608
How about electrifying me?

341
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,960
No way!

342
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,874
Well, I...

343
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
have given that to you.

344
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,034
I didn't ask you to
take the responsibility.

345
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,368
If you mention that again,

346
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,354
I'll electrify you!

347
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,834
Okay, okay.

348
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,594
Do it.

349
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
Electrify me.

350
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
Give it to me.

351
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,112
Unless you electrify me.

352
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,434
Electrify me.

353
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:42,754
Give it to me!

354
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,634
No!

355
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:43,994
Give it to me!

356
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,920
No!

357
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,314
You stepped on one of my shoes.

358
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,994
Could you please

359
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,960
forgive me?

360
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,520
Give it to me.

361
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,594
Mai Sichong

362
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,114
You have borrowed the key
to the electrotherapy room.

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,154
You can electrify yourself.

364
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,674
Why do I have to help you?

365
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,034
Only when you electrify me

366
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,656
can I make progress in swimming.

367
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,120
Who knows only that can work.

368
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,514
But,

369
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,714
I won't do it not because I don't want to,

370
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,954
but because I've never
electrified someone continuously.

371
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,834
I electrified you for only twice

372
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,354
and your voice became so strange.

373
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,914
I can't imagine...

374
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,714
Weiwei

375
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,234
I don't need you to
take any responsibility.

376
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,874
I can take the responsibility myself.

377
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,994
Except for both of us,

378
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
nobody knows it.

379
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,674
If...

380
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,056
If something does go wrong,

381
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,520
I guarantee that no one would blame you.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,514
What will go wrong?

383
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,474
No.

384
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,434
It is a trouble already.

385
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,114
I won't.

386
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,040
Weiwei

387
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,434
When I was in senior high school,

388
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,714
I got the best grade of 50.35''.

389
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,794
If I can keep the record,

390
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,560
I will definitely go to the Olympics.

391
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,440
Seriously,

392
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,992
I, Mai Sichong, for my whole life,

393
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,800
regard swimming as
the most important thing.

394
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,680
So,

395
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,584
no matter what happens,

396
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,192
no matter what consequence occurs,

397
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,760
I'll bear it myself.

398
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,994
Trust me.

399
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
Okay?

400
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Alright.

401
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,160
Well.

402
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
Let's go.

403
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,360
Okay.

404
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,112
Nobody's here right now.

405
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,064
Let's get started.

406
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Come on.

407
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
Won't you start?

408
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,544
Okay. Let's start.

409
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,960
Do you have any feelings?

410
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
No.

411
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,080
How about now?

412
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,304
Mei Weiwei, can you do it or not?

413
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,520
Yes.

414
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,754
Yes.

415
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
I can feel it.

416
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,874
Hurry up.

417
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,914
I'll go training!

418
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,674
My bag.

419
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,600
Hurry up!

420
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,474
What do you mean?

421
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,834
To supplement electric energy for you.

422
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,114
I'm afraid your energy's deficient,

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,880
and cannot electrify me in the future.

424
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,474
You can doubt me,

425
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,240
but you cannot doubt my electricity.

426
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
Why don't you eat?

427
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,634
I'm afraid you have something to beg me,

428
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,954
so I dare not eat.

429
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,240
It's impossible!

430
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
I'll feed you.

431
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,904
I have hands. I'll eat by myself.

432
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,514
What's it this time?

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,914
Food residue is around your mouth.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
How clumsy you are!

435
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,634
I do treat you just to
express my gratitude.

436
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,560
Just eat.

437
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,714
Delicious.

438
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,680
Taste it.

439
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Who believes you!

440
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,240
Chong

441
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,194
A new released movie
is very popular recently.

442
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,834
How about watching it? Three of us.

443
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,194
What movie?

444
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,034
What's it called?

445
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,960
Check it out.

446
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,754
"The Shock"?

447
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,394
It's called "The Flash".

448
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,714
And it's not from the Marvel, by the way.

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,904
It's an American drama.

450
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,514
Chong

451
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,080
Are you booking the tickets?

452
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,274
Chong

453
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,474
Are you going to treat
us to watch the movie?

454
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,480
Oh, I feel so bad if you do that!

455
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,794
Don't mention it.

456
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,888
You don't deserve it.

457
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,034
How cruel if you watch it

458
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,834
in front of me!

459
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,954
I...

460
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm just searching for
what movie is popular!

461
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
Weiwei

462
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,954
Why are you here?

463
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,194
Don't you need training?

464
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,194
No training.

465
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,674
To express my gratitude,
I'll treat you to watch a movie.

466
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Weiwei

467
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,680
Peng Pai

468
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,074
You must be waiting for a long time.

469
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Not really.

470
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,074
Sichong

471
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,648
We'll go and watch a movie now.

472
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,954
Let's go.

473
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Wait a moment.

474
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,034
Which time slot?

475
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800
I happen to want to watch a movie, too.

476
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,600
Well...

477
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,208
Let's watch together.

478
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,754
We haven't booked tickets, anyhow.

479
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,680
Let's go.

480
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Let's go.

481
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,920
Thank you.

482
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,634
What are you doing?

483
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,874
Don't you have a good appetite?

484
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,714
Then you should eat more.

485
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
So odd!

486
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,754
Weiwei

487
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,992
I'll go to the restroom.

488
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,994
Weiwei

489
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,954
Look at the villain.

490
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,880
Isn't he stupid?

491
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
Weiwei

492
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,560
Weiwei

493
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,274
Is it over?

494
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,154
Not yet.

495
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,554
Are you sleepy?

496
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,794
No.

497
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Let's continue.

498
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,194
Well...

499
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,954
I'm so sorry, Peng Pai.

500
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,274
I fell asleep at the
second half of the movie.

501
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,514
Really?

502
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,634
You fell asleep after ten minutes
since the beginning, okay?

503
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,834
I didn't!

504
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,114
Then tell me,

505
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,320
where is the base where
the villain makes his debut?

506
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,474
Admit it, Mei Weiwei.

507
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,234
You didn't understand the movie.

508
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,674
You did!

509
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,914
At the climax of the movie,

510
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,394
you didn't stop asking questions.

511
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,434
Didn't you fall asleep?

512
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,834
Alright, Sichong.

513
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,794
Weiwei doesn't like this kind of movie.

514
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,114
She just likes that kind of atmosphere.

515
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,634
It makes her relaxed.

516
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,234
So,

517
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,594
it's inevitable if she fell asleep.

518
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,784
I hope you do not mind.

519
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,034
Alright, alright.

520
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,234
Half past six tomorrow morning.

521
