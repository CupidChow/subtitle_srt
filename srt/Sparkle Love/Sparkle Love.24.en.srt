2
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,300
Why do you have a raincoat on?

3
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,060
It'll rain today according to the weather forecast,

4
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,060
so I put on a raincoat.

5
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,660
You're cute.

6
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,500
Come on.

7
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Let me show you something.

8
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,740
Surprise.

9
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,580
I prepared these.

10
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
These are foods.

11
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,380
Here are the chairs.

12
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,580
You can eat food when hungry.

13
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,420
You can sit in the chair when tired.

14
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,140
This is a fishing rod.

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,620
This is a telescope.

16
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
You can use them for fishing and stargazing.

17
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,940
You can't stand the cold,

18
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,100
so I also prepared a thick tent for you.

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,860
I see.

20
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,100
You are so nice.

21
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,820
Dad

22
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,340
Mom

23
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,140
Hello. Aunt and Uncle.

24
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,060
Take care of yourselves.

25
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,620
Don't worry.

26
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,060
Don't worry.

27
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,260
I'll take good care of Weiwei.

28
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,540
Dad, mom, we gotta go.

29
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,500
Goodbye.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,140
Bye.

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,100
We gotta go.

32
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,340
Goodbye.

33
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,060
-Take care. -Ok.

34
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,180
Hello.

35
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,500
Sichong

36
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,980
Let me tell you about the arrangement after that.

37
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,460
OK.

38
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,540
You must step up training after you return to the team tomorrow.

39
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,500
I plan to arrange for you to participate in this year's tournament.

40
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,580
In addition,

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,020
I suggest you

42
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,540
find a place where there are fewer people

43
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,660
to stay for half a year.

44
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Tomorrow

45
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,700
we'll go to school

46
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,620
to get you suspended.

47
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,420
Have you figured out how to tell him?

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,180
Why is there rustling on your side?

49
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,540
Mai Sichong, this is our last meet.

50
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,780
I'm at the lake with my girlfriend.

51
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
So great?

52
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,020
A girlfriend?

53
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,340
If it weren't for your great grades,

54
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,220
I'd have forbidden you to fall in love.

55
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,620
I got it.

56
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,060
I assure you

57
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
it will certainly not interfere with later training.

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,180
Will you have a lot of training afterwards?

59
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,500
And the training must be stricter

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,700
after entering the provincial team.

61
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,260
Don't think too much.

62
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,180
Let's have a fun day.

63
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,180
Let's go.

64
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,540
Go for a visit.

65
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,300
Let's go.

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,900
Here are alpacas.

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,020
We can feed them.

68
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,580
It'll spit.

69
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,820
It won't. Look.

70
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,940
Let's go.

71
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,700
How cute they are.

72
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,940
All right.

73
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,140
Your turn.

74
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,940
Come on.

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,180
Take it.

76
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,580
Feed it.

77
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,780
That's right.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,540
You...

79
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,260
It's static electricity.

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,180
I just touched my hair.

81
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,500
Weiwei

82
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,740
You're really a Pikachu.

83
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Your static electricity is stronger than others.

84
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,540
But be careful next time.

85
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,900
Luckily it's me.

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,060
If it's someone else it will be...

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,700
I'll see

88
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,660
the peacocks.

89
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,740
What's wrong?

90
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,380
It's okay.

91
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
My hands just got dirty on the floor earlier.

92
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,980
Come and sit here.

93
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,020
In fact,

94
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,420
I envy you sometimes.

95
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,340
Envy what?

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,620
You can meet me

97
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,820
at just 19 years old.

98
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,740
I don't like to answer you.

99
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,980
So

100
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,980
if I didn't shock you,

101
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,420
would you still like me?

102
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,380
At that time, I really thought I liked you

103
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,300
because I was shocked by you.

104
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
But

105
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,180
to be honest,

106
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,860
it's not that.

107
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,260
Do you remember

108
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,420
our first meeting

109
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,060
at the mobilization meeting?

110
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,020
Yes.

111
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,340
At that time, I thought

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,780
this girl

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,940
was troublesome

114
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,540
but interesting.

115
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,500
I tried to get close to you.

116
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,020
So I kept letting you shock me.

117
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,660
Who would have thought

118
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,100
that I, a big star on campus,

119
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,260
pursued you

120
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,260
after all kinds of hardships?

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,260
Will you regret it?

122
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,100
I never regret anything.

123
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I won't regret

124
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,500
liking you.

125
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,860
Why don't you cover up?

126
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,620
Come on.

127
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,260
If you still feel cold,

128
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,340
there are quilts in the car,

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,180
I'll get them for you.

130
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,740
That's enough.

131
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,420
What's wrong?

132
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,620
Can't fall asleep?

133
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,940
A little bit.

134
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,980
Something on your mind?

135
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,060
Mai Sichong

136
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,660
Thank you.

137
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,380
You're welcome.

138
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,980
You'll always be the Pikachu I want to protect.

139
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,420
I like you.

140
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,420
Good night.

141
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,140
I gotta go.

142
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,780
Or I can't catch the provincial team's bus.

143
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,380
What's wrong with you?

144
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,180
You miss me now?

145
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,620
You won't stop coming

146
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
because you can't get tickets

147
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,860
to the tournament at the end of next month, will you?

148
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,580
I won't.

149
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,620
I'll be there.

150
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,980
That's good.

151
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,100
Goodbye.

152
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,740
I gotta run.

153
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,100
Goodbye.

154
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,380
Take care.

155
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,340
Mai Sichong

156
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,620
Goodbye.

157
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,700
Goodbye.

158
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,780
Many times

159
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,700
we don't wanna say goodbye.

160
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,580
Because we don't know if goodbye is meeting again

161
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,780
or never again.

162
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,260
I'll start training soon.

163
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Because I can't see you,

164
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,620
I can only miss you with the stuff.

165
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,580
It's time

166
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,300
to turn in your cell phones.

167
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,500
Please,

168
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
can I make one more call?

169
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,460
No way.

170
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,900
It's a rule set by the coach.

171
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,820
I can't help it.

172
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,420
Please hand in your phone.

173
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Just a minute.

174
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,020
Just a minute.

175
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Still calling someone.

176
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,660
Chong

177
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,060
Long time no see.

178
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,900
Where's Weiwei?

179
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Something happened at her family, so she couldn't come.

180
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,700
But she asked me to tell you

181
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,340
to fight for the game.

182
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,260
Don't let her down.

183
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,500
Chong

184
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,940
The competition is on. Let's go.

185
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,580
Let's go.

186
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,180
Let's go.

187
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,500
Athletics can only get better.

188
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,580
Mai Sichong on track 7 from Southern Sport University is far ahead.

189
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,380
It seems that the outcome of the match is no longer in doubt.

190
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,620
Congratulations to winner Mai Sichong

191
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,300
from Southern Sport University.

192
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,780
This is the seventh championship in his career.

193
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,140
Bless him to keep this level.

194
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,540
Wish him Phelps of China one day.

195
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,140
Mom

196
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,180
You've been in closed training for so long.

197
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,260
After that,

198
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,380
will you go home first, or go home first?

199
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Of course.

200
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,860
But

201
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,300
please take me somewhere before going home.

202
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,540
OK.

203
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,660
What happened to my son?

204
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
He trained for so long.

205
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,340
He hasn't been home for months.

206
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,420
After that, his girlfriend comes to his mind first.

207
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,580
You are so heartless.

208
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,980
Mom

209
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,820
That's because I haven't seen Weiwei for a long time.

210
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,580
The management of the provincial team is very strict.

211
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
I can't get my phone.

212
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,660
She didn't answer even when I called her.

213
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,580
So I have to...

214
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,100
All right. Hurry up.

215
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,860
Put your luggage in that trunk.

216
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,100
Hurry up.

217
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
Sorry.

218
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,020
The number you dialed is power off.

219
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,780
Mom

220
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,260
She...

221
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,100
Her phone is off.

222
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,940
Off?

223
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,940
Could she

224
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,860
be angry with you?

225
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,100
No.

226
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Right.

227
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,900
It's impossible for them to close the bookstore.

228
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,740
Is something wrong?

229
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,780
Mom, take it.

230
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,460
You drive, and I'll go back by myself.

231
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,140
Take care.

232
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,820
Chong, you're back?

233
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,660
What happened to Mei Weiwei?

234
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,820
Tell me.

235
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,980
Weiwei...

236
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,460
What happened?

237
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,340
Where is she?

238
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,580
I don't know.

239
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,060
I really don't know.

240
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,420
She didn't even tell me she was moving away with her parents.

241
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,540
I'm worried about her, too.

242
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,660
This is

243
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
the last message she sent me when she left.

244
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,860
She told me to pay attention to your emotions.

245
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,980
What did you say to him?

246
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,540
I...

247
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,660
In fact, before you went to the provincial team,

248
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,500
there was something wrong with Weiwei's health.

249
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,740
She didn't say anything.

250
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
She chose to endure it alone.

251
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
She didn't send me a farewell message

252
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,540
until she left.

253
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,220
Remember

254
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
to tell Mai Sichong

255
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,020
not to look for me.

256
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,700
Please tell me

257
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,020
that she must have been here later, right?

258
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,900
Right.

259
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,860
But I don't know where they live.

260
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,740
Can you

261
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,900
contact them for me?

262
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,980
I must find her.

263
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,220
They did come here

264
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
the other day.

265
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,900
Look.

266
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,140
These flowers are from them.

267
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,940
They won't come any time soon.

268
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,580
So it's no use

269
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,340
staying here,

270
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,820
isn't it?

271
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,580
In fact,

272
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,180
before you went to the provincial team,

273
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,340
there was something wrong with Weiwei's health.

274
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Why do you have a raincoat on?

275
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,140
It's static electricity.

276
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,340
I just touched my hair.

277
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,940
Weiwei

278
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
You're really a Pikachu.

279
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,140
Your static electricity is stronger than others.

280
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,580
Mai Sichong

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,700
Goodbye.

282
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,980
I visited my aunt in Nanxiao Road today.

283
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,940
I'm so sad

284
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,500
that my aunt's flower shop can't continue to open.

285
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,740
These flowers are from them.

286
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,780
Weiwei

287
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,660
Look, how beautiful the flowers are.

288
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,780
Yes.

289
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,100
The recent flowers are of good quality.

290
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,460
There're just a few orders. I'll deliver them later.

291
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,460
You? Can you?

292
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,580
Mom, dad, don't worry.

293
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
(Wait for meet again.)

294
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,740
Mei Weiwei, open the door.

295
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,820
I don't wanna see you.

296
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,620
Just leave.

297
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,180
You don't open the door?

298
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,300
So I'll break the door.

299
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,860
I'll shock you if you don't leave.

300
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,500
Come on.

301
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
It's not the first time anyway.

302
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,180
I don't like you anymore.

303
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,020
You only know swimming in the provincial team.

304
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,980
Where were you when my electricity lost control?

305
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,740
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,260
It doesn't make sense.

307
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,340
Mai Sichong, do you know

308
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,380
that I left quietly to make you feel better?

309
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,820
I don't need a boyfriend

310
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,860
who can't be with me at all.

311
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,900
Do you understand?

312
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,420
Mai Sichong

313
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,380
Let's break up.

314
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
Please leave.

315
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,620
Mai Sichong

316
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,900
Why are you still so disobedient after entering the provincial team?

317
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,020
They all call me now to look for you.

318
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,500
Do you know that you are going back to training in advance?

319
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
You already have a bad record.

320
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,620
Who can help you if you're late now?

321
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,060
They have all set off.

322
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,420
You take a taxi back

323
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,700
right now.

324
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,860
I got it, Ms. Peipei.

325
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,180
It's my fault.

326
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Sorry.

327
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,820
You...

328
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,900
Weiwei

329
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Do you remember

330
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,340
the night we were at the resort?

331
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,660
You said to me

332
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,940
that no matter how imperfect I am,

333
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
you can accept,

334
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,100
understand

335
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,620
and tolerate me.

336
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,660
I know

337
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
I

338
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,340
still have many shortcomings.

339
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
But I promise you

340
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,900
that I will be there for you

341
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,860
as long as you need me.

342
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,740
But even doctor

343
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,780
can't diagnose my constitution.

344
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,420
We can't be together at all.

345
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,260
I'm like a bomb.

346
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,420
I've had enough bad luck.

347
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,140
I don't want you to be unlucky with me.

348
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,660
You still have your own life.

349
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,900
What if

350
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,620
my electricity gets more and more out of control

351
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,780
and one day it hurts you?

352
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,820
And what if

353
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,540
my electricity can't disappear all my life?

354
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Don't think too much.

355
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,620
(Three years later.)

356
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,780
All right.

357
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,380
This is what we'll talk about in class today.

358
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,860
Let's turn the textbook to page 82.

359
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,580
Is Mr. Lin here, please?

360
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
Here is you takeout.

361
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Please preview the textbook.

362
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:16,940
Hello.

363
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,820
Why are you here?

364
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,940
To deliver to you something.

365
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
No sugar and less milk.

366
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,700
Thanks.

367
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,260
That's Mai Sichong, right?

368
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,980
Mai Sichong

369
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,380
May I ask you a question?

370
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,540
What do you wanna do most next?

371
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,700
Most wanna do...

372
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,700
Propose.

373
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,700
I heard you and your girlfriend have a very good relationship.

374
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,460
Wish you a successful proposal.

375
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,580
That must be.

376
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,780
After all, I have never failed.

377
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,540
Well, thank you for accepting our interview.

378
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,380
That's all for today's interview.

379
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm reporter Li Daixi.

380
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,260
Please sort out the materials when you go back.

381
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,820
What's wrong?

382
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,140
I gave you my first exclusive interview.

383
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,860
But you do this to me?

384
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,340
You changed the outline of the interview for no reason.

385
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,620
She may not wanna go public.

386
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,580
But I want.

387
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,180
Do you know how many girls in the school like me?

388
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
I do this to protect her, you know?

389
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,420
All right.

390
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,500
You're lovey-dovey.

391
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,420
You'd better prepare more gift money for me.

392
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,300
By the way.

393
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,660
You must remember

394
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,380
to give her this.

395
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,300
What's this?

396
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,540
It's not your business and just give it to her.

397
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,700
Five.

398
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,900
Three, two, one.

399
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,460
Zero point nine.

400
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,460
Chong

401
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,380
You're the winner again. Congratulations.

402
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,100
Daixi

403
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,380
The parents

404
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,660
who pick up their children today are late.

405
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,900
As a coach, I can't leave first.

406
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,180
Don't be angry.

407
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,940
Again?

408
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,140
Please.

409
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,060
OK.

410
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,660
Let's go.

411
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,580
Bye.

412
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,500
Let's go.

413
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,820
Take care.

414
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,340
Don't worry.

415
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,260
Don't forget to give her that.

416
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,740
OK.

417
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,260
OK.

418
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,900
Don't be so unreliable.

419
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,620
Don't move.

420
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,060
Chong

421
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,860
We gotta go.

422
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,900
Goodbye.

423
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,780
Take care.

424
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
Let's go.

425
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,180
Mai Sichong

426
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,300
Long time no see.

427
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,820
How are you?

428
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,780
Long time no see.

429
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
I was going to watch your play today.

430
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,260
But because of the lecture, I didn't go.

431
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:56,980
What's the result?

432
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,580
As usual.

433
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Still the first.

434
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,900
By the way, I forgot to tell you that I am now

435
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,580
studying medicine.

436
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,020
Then you'll be a schoolboy for a long time.

437
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,540
And

438
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,580
didn't Junjun come to see you play?

439
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,100
What's up?

440
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,500
You didn't contact her?

441
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,180
Junjun will be in charge of the company.

442
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,860
She's quite busy and she doesn't have time to watch me play.

443
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,140
Cell phone.

444
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,180
What?

445
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,300
I'm gonna see Weiwei. Goodbye.

446
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,140
Hello.

447
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Hello.

448
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
I'm Xia Rui.

449
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,940
Mai Sichong

450
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,020
Why do you ask me to be here?

451
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,220
Stop asking.

452
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,580
I will instruct you to meet me remotely.

453
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,900
OK.

454
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,100
This place is so beautiful.

455
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,980
Don't be distracted from anything else.

456
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,220
Don't you even ask me about the ranking?

457
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,900
I'll prepare for postgraduate entrance exam.

458
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,820
Anyway,

459
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,100
you won't get any other ranking except the first one.

460
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,060
I'm just so perfect that you don't even have a sense of crisis.

461
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,060
How about the reexamine?

462
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,300
The first one.

463
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,620
You'll be my exclusive rehabilitator after graduating. I'll hang up.

464
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
(See you later.)

465
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,980
So childish.

466
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,820
Mai Sichong?

467
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
You...

468
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,380
This is the one you have prepared in the water.

469
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,460
Open it.

470
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,940
I know

471
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
this may come as a surprise to you

472
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,620
when you see this.

473
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,100
But I've figured it out.

474
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,700
I've made many decisions.

475
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,740
I think

476
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
the most correct decision

477
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,740
is that I choose you.

478
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
I've wondered countless times

479
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,300
if it's too early

480
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
or too soon.

481
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,500
But I think

482
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,460
I'll always choose you

483
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,500
as long as you are by my side.

484
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,020
I...

485
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,260
If you think it's too soon,

486
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,780
that's okay.

487
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
No matter it is one year,

488
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,340
three years,

489
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
or ten years,

490
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,860
I'll always wait for you.

491
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,540
Do you wanna make me wait so long?

492
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
Mai Sichong

493
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,420
I do.

494
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,980
You're my one

495
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
in my life.

496
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,500
Pikachu

497
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,540
The end.
