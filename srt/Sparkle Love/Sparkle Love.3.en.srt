2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,954
Then

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,874
the plan B will be taken.

4
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,874
Help!

5
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
How could you drown
in such a shallow pool?

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,824
Mei Weiwei, you...

7
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,440
What have you done to me?

8
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,954
All the drugs on the
market to cure the throat

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,354
are bought for you.

10
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Have a try.

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,114
It's still useless.

12
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,514
Well.

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,040
There is only one way now.

14
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,434
Are you done yet?

15
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,528
I can barely breathe.

16
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,114
What did you do yesterday?

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,754
Why did your voice become like this?

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
I was kissed by Mei Weiwei last night...

19
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
Mei Weiwei

20
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,154
Is it you who made me like this?

21
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,776
Get me back to normal right now.

22
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,954
Have you recently been
training under high pressure

23
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
and got inflamed?

24
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Got inflamed?

25
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,074
If I were inflamed,

26
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,744
I should have been well long ago.

27
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't laugh.

28
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,274
Listen to me.

29
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
I became like this after you kissed me.

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,194
You took advantage of me,

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
so you must...

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,074
Fine.

33
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,634
I'm in charge of you, okay?

34
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,354
You can follow me all day from now on,

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,114
and I'm in charge of everything.

36
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,960
But stop talking with me.

37
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
How about getting this
for Chong to have a try?

38
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,928
Why do you follow me?

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,154
Who is following you?

40
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,834
I come here

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
to buy something.

42
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,240
I didn't expect that you would need that.

43
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,674
Damn.

44
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,034
Will he think that

45
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,608
I am a woman who needs a razor?

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
How humiliating!

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,874
Okay, today I will talk
about the second chapter,

48
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,674
industrial structure of sports.

49
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,594
First of all, you need to know
about an important concept.

50
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,114
Literally,

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,314
industrial structure can
be interpreted not only as

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,154
an issue about the corporate
relationships within an industry,

53
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,794
but also as

54
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
the structure of relationships
among industries.

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,834
In the 1970s...

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,714
I would have been seated in the first row

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,594
to make a good impression on Ms. Meiling.

58
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
But you...

59
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,834
You want to sit in the first row, right?

60
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
I got to occupy the seat.

61
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,794
Don't make others see me sitting with you.

62
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,032
Or we'll get in trouble.

63
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
No speaking.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,034
Zhang Yuxin

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,954
Here.

66
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Mei Weiwei

67
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Mei Weiwei

68
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Here.

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,434
You behave well.

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,434
And,

71
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,074
this is a theoretical course.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,074
The homework

73
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,554
is to make a PowerPoint presentation.

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,034
Your Class of Rehabilitation
will be the first one.

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,032
You are the leader.

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
Sit down.

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,896
Are you a little refreshed?

78
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Then let's continue.

79
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
Some Japanese economists...

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,834
Why are you keeping your head down?

81
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,474
I thought you didn't want others
to see that we're together, did you?

82
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
Who is together with you?

83
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,560
We'll be together one day.

84
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,234
Never mind.

85
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,952
Anyway, it's not what you thought.

86
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,394
I didn't expect that I would
have a lesson with you.

87
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,234
Let's have lunch together, okay?

88
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,794
Can I have your WeChat?

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,634
Let me have your WeChat.

90
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,674
Let me have your WeChat.

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,474
I want to have your WeChat as well.

92
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,394
So do I.

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,114
How about

94
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,034
having my WeChat first?

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,394
I'll create a group
chat and add him to it.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,394
Is that okay?

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,514
Everyone has the chance.

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
Come on. Scan it.

99
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,216
Take me to have lunch.

100
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,914
The teacher has
something to deal with him.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,160
I got to take him away.

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,914
We got to go.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
Remember...

104
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Sit there.

105
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
You are here.

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,474
Weiwei

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,080
When will Chong's voice heal?

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,200
It may heal tomorrow.

109
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,634
You...

110
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,034
You eat so much.

111
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,272
Will you be too stuffed?

112
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,576
What's wrong with you?

113
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm really fascinated.

114
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,994
Daixi

115
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,520
I don't want to talk with you.

116
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Daixi

117
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,384
What's the matter with them?

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,434
I have no idea.

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,714
Ding Yi, pass me a chicken.

120
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm so hungry.

121
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,480
Chong, your throat heals.

122
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,714
How did you heal it?

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,914
It really heals.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
I got to tell Weiwei.

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,794
Wait.

126
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Don't tell her.

127
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,154
Weiwei was just indifferent with you.

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,674
If you tell her right now,

129
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,440
will she treat you with a good temper?

130
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
You are right!

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,674
Why is she really angry?

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,754
Weiwei

133
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Peng Pai

134
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,834
Are you free now?

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,154
I want to talk with you about something.

136
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,114
Peng Pai

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,074
I'm not free.

138
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Please tell me when I'm free.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,840
Don't turn around.

140
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,274
Have you adapted to the
life pace as a freshman?

141
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,754
How do you feel?

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,080
You will have the most of
lessons when you're a freshman.

143
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,354
Peng Pai

144
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,120
I have been in the college for two months.

145
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,274
I forgot that.

146
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,874
I was busy in the internship before.

147
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,194
I didn't go back to school as well.

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,554
Actually, when I was in senior
high school, I was thinking that

149
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,234
is it possible for you to major in
athletics of Southern Sport University?

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,394
So when I applied for the college, I...

151
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,680
I don't run any longer.

152
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,354
Is it because I...

153
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Peng Pai

154
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
Can't you mention the past?

155
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Okay.

156
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,274
Well.

157
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
What's your major now?

158
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,994
Rehabilitation.

159
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,434
I would like to major in sports economics.

160
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,554
But I failed by one point.

161
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,674
I'm thinking about transferring my major.

162
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,600
To our major?

163
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,674
Why are you studying in the
Southern Sport University?

164
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,434
I heard that you were abroad.

165
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,960
Why did you change your name?

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,114
You told me not to
mention the past, right?

167
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,352
Then I won't mention it.

168
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,634
By the way.

169
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,074
We senior students are
going to have a dinner party.

170
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,314
The senior who transferred
her major will also come.

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
How about coming with me?

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,594
I'm not coming.

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,720
I have something else to do.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
You are still unwilling
to have a meal with me.

175
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,874
May I have your WeChat?

176
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,592
Come to me whenever you need help.

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,314
Daixi

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,114
Humph!

179
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,314
I'm going to move back home.

180
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,634
Anyway, someone
doesn't take me as a friend.

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,474
Daixi, let me explain to you.

182
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,074
Explain?

183
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,074
Weiwei

184
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,754
Are we really friends?

185
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,474
I don't mind your first conceal.

186
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,874
If I didn't encounter that this time,

187
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,314
how long would you conceal that to me?

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,234
Or do you like Mai Sichong?

189
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,314
If you like Mai Sichong,

190
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,314
you can tell me.

191
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,074
I will try my best to
help you to pursue him.

192
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,040
I must be crazy if I like Mai Sichong.

193
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,434
Absolutely.

194
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,074
Now you have Peng Pai.

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,994
Why not flirt with him as well?

196
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
Why not make him like you?

197
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,754
Li Daixi

198
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,954
You've gone too far!

199
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,800
How come you treated Weiwei like this?

200
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,400
I got to go.

201
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Stupid Mei Weiwei.

202
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,874
Hello.

203
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,874
Mei Weiwei

204
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,594
I know you are in the dormitory.

205
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,954
If you don't come down,

206
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,192
I will shout downstairs.

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,274
Mai Sichong

208
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
Can you stop pestering me?

209
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,560
Isn't it good to train at the moment?

210
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,074
But you can't leave me alone.

211
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
You've promised that
you would take care of me.

212
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,354
Baihui

213
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,434
Weiwei

214
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,200
I can't believe you come to the library.

215
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,554
By the way.

216
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,320
We can complete the PowerPoint
of the industrial structure together.

217
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,760
Okay.

218
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,954
Baihui

219
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,314
Do you know how to get extra credits?

220
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,520
To get extra credits...

221
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,856
Let me think about it.

222
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,834
Running a club.

223
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,114
I recently always wanted
to run a massage club.

224
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,354
But there's a regulation that

225
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,914
at least 10 members are required
to formally establish the club.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,034
If you want to join in,

227
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,800
There is only one step away from success.

228
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,314
If I join in,

229
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,080
how many members are there in the club?

230
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Two.

231
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,154
Okay.

232
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,434
I will join in.

233
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,394
Let's run a club,

234
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,536
and get extra credits.

235
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,914
Baihui

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,674
We must lose no time in doing it.

237
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,296
Let's make an investigation now.

238
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,474
Now?

239
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,400
So soon?

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,314
I just borrowed this book,
Inner Canon of Huangdi.

241
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,394
The Inner Canon of Huangdi

242
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,434
is a colored, fully annotated
and translated version.

243
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,480
It's hard to get.

244
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,520
It's very useful of this
chapter that I just read.

245
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Weiwei

246
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Mai Sichong

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,880
Slowly.

248
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,674
Why did you pull me out?

249
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,880
I can't see that you...

250
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,240
Your voice...

251
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,960
You just lied to me.

252
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,354
It really heals.

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Stop pretending.

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
Aren't you going to make an investigation?

255
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,914
It's none of your business.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,008
Because you are my...

257
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,754
You are my

258
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
someone.

259
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,200
Of course, I have to help you!

260
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,600
Fine.

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,320
Well, let me sort it out first.

262
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,474
No need to sort out.

263
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
Just follow me.

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
Come on.

265
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,394
Wait for me.

266
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,320
Come on.

267
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,594
Let's start!

268
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,520
Okay.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,554
If our college starts a club,

270
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,234
do you have any interests?

271
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
You are interested, right? Thank you!

272
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,674
Are you available for an interview?

273
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,354
Hello!

274
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,034
Can we occupy some of your time?

275
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,960
Can we?

276
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,640
Thank you!

277
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,560
Sorry. Can I bother you to...

278
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,834
Tell me what you want to say.

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,914
In front of me,

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,104
you can say everything.

281
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,554
Mai Sichong

282
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,714
How about this way?

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,080
Let's not meet for a while.

284
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,274
You go back right now.

285
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,274
Let's meet two days later.

286
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,074
What do you think?

287
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,480
Do you want to reject me?

288
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,320
Tell me.

289
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,154
You think over it carefully.

290
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,954
Your affection for me
comes all of a sudden.

291
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,514
Why do you like me?

292
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,154
And maybe when you
wake up tomorrow morning,

293
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,280
you will think you are crazy to like me.

294
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
Is that right?

295
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,754
Definitely not.

296
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,232
My affection for you is real.

297
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,584
It's all my fault.

298
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,080
Weiwei

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,834
Chong, what happened?

300
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,074
Do you have anything
weighing in your mind?

301
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,840
My confession of love was rejected.

302
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,874
By whom?

303
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
Mei Weiwei?

304
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,274
You showed your love to her,

305
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,554
but she rejected, right?

306
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,154
Stop asking.

307
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,114
It's impossible.

308
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,360
Did she miss your point?

309
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,634
I see.

310
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,000
She must think that
you've never been in love.

311
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,514
It seems that you've ever been in love.

312
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,914
You can't say that.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,794
I admit that

314
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,154
you are a swimming genius.

315
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,194
But I am a genius of playing love games.

316
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,514
If you show love directly,

317
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
the girls playing games
will also ignore you.

318
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,274
You

319
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,954
only have a handsome face.

320
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,714
What you did is all wrong.

321
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,474
You must prepare flowers and
music to create a sense of ceremony.

322
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,794
Don't be too direct.

323
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,474
You have to create an atmosphere
when showing your love. Understand?

324
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,594
Create an atmosphere.

325
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,520
Come on.

326
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,754
Superb painting!

327
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,234
Do you think Mei Weiwei

328
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,834
can find the Avatar
Square with this painting?

329
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,034
Can't you find it too?

330
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,034
I can find it

331
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,040
because I have searched it with you.

332
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,288
What are you going to tell her?

333
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,594
If she says yes to me,

334
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,114
we will have a date.

335
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,074
A car is a must when we have a date.

336
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,954
The car

337
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,354
should be decorated.

338
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,874
How about

339
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,434
loading roses in the car?

340
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,634
How can you think of
such an important matter

341
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,800
right now?

342
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,554
Fine.

343
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,240
I will help you.

344
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,114
Let's meet at this place.

345
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,592
I have something to tell you.

346
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
What is Mai Sichong doing?

347
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,920
What's this?

348
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,954
I'd like to propose a toast.

349
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,674
Come on.

350
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,674
Cheers!

351
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,960
Cheers!

352
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,994
Awesome.

353
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,954
Peng Pai

354
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,114
Didn't you say there's
a female junior coming?

355
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,954
A female junior?

356
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,754
Introduce to me.

357
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,394
Do you know who she is for Peng Pai?

358
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,354
Come off it.

359
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,954
Who is she?

360
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,624
Peng Pai, is she your girlfriend?

361
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
He is shy and blushed.

362
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,800
Good job!

363
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Weiwei

364
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Peng Pai

365
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,634
You're having dinner here?

366
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,594
Right.

367
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,072
Join us now that you're here.

368
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,114
Never mind.

369
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,234
It's no big deal.

370
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,954
The female senior who
transferred her major is here.

371
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,288
I'll introduce her to you.

372
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,234
Don't hesitate.

373
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
Let's go.

374
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,874
Let me introduce her to you.

375
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,834
This is Weiwei.

376
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,194
Hello, everyone.

377
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,994
Hello.

378
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,394
This is who I told to you.

379
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,314
The female senior who
transferred her major.

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,354
You can call her Qiaoqiao.

381
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,514
Hello, Qiaoqiao.

382
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,434
Hello.

383
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,474
You can sit next to me.

384
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,274
Okay.

385
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,234
Sit down.

386
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,880
Thank you.

387
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,554
Sit down. Drink with me.

388
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,114
I heard from Peng Pai that you
wanted to transfer your major, right?

389
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,040
Yes.

390
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,114
You have to figure it out.

391
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,874
Transferring the major

392
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,754
is to better achieve the life goals

393
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,674
instead of escaping.

394
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,074
Got it.

395
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,600
Thank you for your suggestion.

396
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Can I ask you the reason why
you want to transfer your major?

397
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,360
Because of him?

398
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,874
Definitely not.

399
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,154
Qiaoqiao, I am just a junior of Peng Pai.

400
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,834
Don't be nervous.

401
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,234
I'm just joking.

402
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,074
But

403
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,640
Peng Pai often mentions you with me.

404
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,394
Chong

405
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,394
The school official microblog says
that the small square powers off today.

406
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,680
The right vibe has gone.

407
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Weiwei still doesn't answer
your phone call, right?

408
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,274
Peng Pai's resume

409
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
is also advantageous
in the social recruitment.

410
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
Chong, Chong

411
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Mei Weiwei

412
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,954
Chong

413
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,160
Don't be impulsive.

414
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,234
Weiwei,

415
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,754
I'm telling you.

416
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,474
My bro, Peng Pai

417
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,754
is excellent in all aspects.

418
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,954
Except in the past four years,

419
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,474
nobody knows what he is thinking about.

420
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,200
He's like a simpering boy.

421
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,354
He is drunk.

422
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,354
I'm not drunk.

423
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,354
I'm conscious.

424
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,874
Today in front of everyone,

425
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,874
I will ask Weiwei...

426
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,154
Enough.

427
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,120
Mei Weiwei

428
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,154
Why did you break the appointment?

429
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,994
I didn't break the appointment.

430
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,954
It's your personal appointment.

431
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,634
And only you can understand the painting.

432
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,674
Mai Sichong

433
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,154
Take your hands off her.

434
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,536
It's none of your business.

435
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,520
Go.

436
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,800
Guys, I'm so sorry.

437
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,680
Are you okay?

438
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,754
Mai Sichong

439
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,714
What are you doing?

440
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,640
Come on.

441
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
This is what I prepared for you.

442
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Tricycle?

443
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,960
How about now?

444
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,760
Do you understand what I mean?

445
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,114
No.

446
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,234
Mai Sichong, please
listen to my explanation.

447
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
I don't need your explanation.

448
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,600
And I don't want to
listen to your explanation.

449
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,080
I've been thinking
about it for a long time.

450
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,160
But I don't know why

451
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,312
all I can think about is you.

452
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
Today I just want to ask you one thing.

453
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
Can you accept me?
