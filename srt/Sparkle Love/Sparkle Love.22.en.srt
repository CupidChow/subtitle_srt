2
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,700
Are you awake?

3
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,900
How do you feel?

4
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,060
Are you feeling all right?

5
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,780
You scared me greatly.

6
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,860
If Li Daixi hadn't contacted me,

7
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,260
I wouldn't have known that you'd fainted.

8
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,820
What happened?

9
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,700
My electricity seems to disappear.

10
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,620
Look.

11
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,580
My electricity really disappears.

12
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,260
Your electricity disappears.

13
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,340
I went to Dr. Jiang.

14
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,020
Dr. Jiang got rid of my electricity.

15
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,260
You!

16
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,900
Dr. Jiang didn't even finish testing the machine.

17
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,060
What if it's harmful to your body?

18
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,820
Then this is the test result.

19
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,940
It's really useful.

20
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,620
The electricity really disappears.

21
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,660
Wonderful!

22
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,020
Come with me.

23
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,100
I got to go.

24
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,380
I'll go for some water.

25
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,100
I'll give you a hand.

26
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,940
Sit down.

27
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,460
Name.

28
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,300
Uncle, don't you know that?

29
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,940
Cut the crap.

30
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,580
Name.

31
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,420
Mai Sichong

32
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,620
What's the relationship between

33
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,500
You and Weiwei?

34
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,380
What?

35
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,460
He's hesitating.

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,340
Can a man who hesitates be reliable?

37
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,620
I'm not hesitating.

38
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,340
I'm not.

39
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,340
I like Weiwei.

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,260
He said he liked you.

41
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,500
I think

42
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
you should pay your attention to the studies now.

43
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,060
The study now...

44
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,420
Have some water, please.

45
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,300
is so tense.

46
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,580
Come with me to the kitchen.

47
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,740
I haven't finished.

48
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Look at her.

49
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,380
Let's have a cooking competition.

50
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,020
It's not too late for you to confess.

51
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,100
Once you're found out,

52
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,500
it's hard to redeem.

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,780
A man who dives,

54
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,420
hit the water with a resounding slap.

55
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,540
What's the matter with you?

56
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,020
Speak it out if there's something between you.

57
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,780
What you do every day

58
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,220
makes us nervous during the training.

59
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,620
It's hard to explain.

60
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Extra news!

61
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,820
Weiwei has solved the problem.

62
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,060
Even if Xia Rui releases the video,

63
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,540
nobody will believe him.

64
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,620
The crisis has been lifted.

65
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Chong will soon go for a drug test.

66
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Then,

67
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
just wait and see!

68
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,260
Is that true?

69
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,980
What's going on?

70
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,020
Come on. Tell us.

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,780
Stop asking.

72
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,220
Anyway, remember

73
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,340
to focus on swimming,

74
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,540
and learn more from Chong.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,820
Doctor

76
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,740
I'm sorry. It's too late. Come here tomorrow, please.

77
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,900
Doctor

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,020
He's a member of the provincial team.

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,720
He's coming here for a drug test.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,860
Can you break the rules and allow him to do it today?

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,300
Mai Sichong?

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,420
You

83
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,500
have to apply for a drug retest from school.

84
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Apply for a drug retest?

85
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
Come back tomorrow after applying for that.

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
What do we do now?

87
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,140
Never mind.

88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,140
Maybe tomorrow.

89
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,020
Let's go.

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
The place where you do the drug test is too far away.

91
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,220
The last time we came here cost a lot of work.

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,300
We can't even get a car this time.

93
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,020
No cars.

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,700
Weiwei

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,180
Weiwei

96
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,140
Is the car coming?

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,060
Not yet.

98
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,540
You'll get a cold if you sleep like this.

99
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,820
Or else,

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,620
we find a place to stay for a night?

101
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:23,940
Let's go.

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,580
Isn't that Express Inn quite good?

103
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,900
This hotel is too luxurious.

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,380
Certainly not.

105
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,980
How can you live in so poor a condition?

106
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,980
This one is good.

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,780
Welcome. Can I help you?

108
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,660
Two rooms.

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,260
Okay.

110
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,620
I'm sorry. There's only one room left.

111
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,420
One room left?

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,260
Didn't she say it was a standard room?

113
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,500
I'll ask her.

114
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,660
Forget it. It's too late.

115
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,260
Don't ask.

116
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,380
Deal with it tomorrow.

117
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,580
I'll go wash up first.

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Let me help you.

119
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,740
Weiwei

120
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,620
I'll go to the front desk and ask if there are more rooms available.

121
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,660
Excuse me. Are there any rooms available?

122
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,580
A guest has just checked out. Please wait a moment.

123
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,900
Do you have ideas to talk with Ms. Meiling?

124
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,620
I'll come straight to the point.

125
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,620
Why are you so happy?

126
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,020
I'm happy for someone will return to the provincial swimming team.

127
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,540
Well.

128
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,820
After I enter to the provincial team,

129
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,540
and become the champion,

130
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,540
on Children's Day,

131
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,700
can you have a trip with me?

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,460
You are so old. Why do you celebrate the Children's Day?

133
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,020
Why not?

134
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,940
Are you going?

135
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
It depends on my mood.

136
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,020
No way.

137
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,500
You have to go.

138
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,780
Ms. Meiling

139
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,740
I would like to apply for a drug retest to school.

140
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,500
I really didn't cheat.

141
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,300
So,

142
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,500
no matter how strict the drug test is,

143
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,980
I can do it.

144
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,940
Mai Sichong

145
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,140
Didn't your coach talk with you?

146
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,140
What?

147
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,460
The drug test has expired.

148
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,380
Besides,

149
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,660
you are removed by the provincial team.

150
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,060
But your coach trusts you.

151
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,500
She doesn't believe you cheated.

152
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,700
That's why our school has been discussing for a long time.

153
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,940
Finally, we decided

154
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,860
to give you a criticism discipline.

155
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Okay.

156
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,740
I got you, Ms. Meiling.

157
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,900
We got to go.

158
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,060
Let's go.

159
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,780
What's wrong, Ms. Peipei.

160
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,460
As for this matter,

161
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,380
I haven't figured out how to tell Mai Sichong yet.

162
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,820
But there is no more delay.

163
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,060
Is this to be notified today?

164
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,580
Tomorrow.

165
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,300
It will be posted together with the provincial team list.

166
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,140
You are roommates?

167
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,380
Reassure him.

168
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,700
At least you are recruited to the provincial team this year.

169
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,780
In the coming days,

170
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,540
pay attention to balance the training and rest.

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
After all, training in the provincial team

172
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,100
is not as easy as at school.

173
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,020
Do your best!

174
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:45,940
Forget it.

175
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,860
Stop thinking about that.

176
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
I just didn't enter the provincial team.

177
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,300
How about

178
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,060
breaking the record next year?

179
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Let's see if they will recruit me.

180
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,540
But you didn't go for a drug test due to protecting me.

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,660
You should have entered the provincial team.

182
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,260
Weiwei

183
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,380
I have told you.

184
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,700
In my previous life,

185
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,460
swimming was indeed the most important thing for me.

186
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,700
But after encountering you,

187
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,300
I find

188
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,420
there are so many possibilities in my life.

189
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,060
There are so many wonderful things.

190
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,100
There are so many exciting moments.

191
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,860
So,

192
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
whether you have electricity or not,

193
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,020
you are my cutest,

194
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
and happiest Pikachu.

195
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,180
Don't be sad.

196
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,540
Smile.

197
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,980
Not enough.

198
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,220
Come on.

199
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:03,660
Let's go.

200
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,620
Let's go.

201
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,060
Where's Weiwei?

202
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,860
She was called away by Yuxin.

203
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,500
I just didn't enter the provincial team.

204
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,420
What you behave

205
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,700
feels like you are visiting my grave.

206
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,540
Isn't it the grave of a dream?

207
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,060
Rui

208
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,340
Rui

209
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,460
Why don't you go to training this afternoon?

210
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,820
You're silly!

211
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,900
Rui is going to the provincial team,

212
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,100
so he asked for leave to transfer his files.

213
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
Rui

214
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,700
Please take a seat.

215
00:14:59,620 --> 00:14:59,980
Chong

216
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:00,940
Rui

217
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,220
We are all friends of the same team.

218
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,900
Why can't you have a peaceful talk?

219
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,420
Don't you know there's a saying in the cross talk?

220
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,500
If someone persuades you to be magnanimous,

221
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,540
you'd better stay away from him.

222
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,500
Or else when the lightning strikes,

223
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,260
you will also be involved.

224
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,380
Why do you say that about Rui?

225
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,820
What are you yelling at her for?

226
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,460
Enough.

227
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,980
Xia Rui

228
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
You don't want to tell me something, right?

229
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,860
I've said all I need to say.

230
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,220
Rui

231
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,260
Dad

232
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,420
Yuxin

233
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,020
You're coming?

234
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,700
Hello, uncle.

235
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,780
You are Weiwei, right?

236
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,740
Nice to meet to you.

237
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,460
Dad, why are you so polite?

238
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,660
Weiwei is not a stranger.

239
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,020
Come on, Weiwei.

240
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,140
Help yourself.

241
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,620
We'll have whatever there is.

242
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,420
Let's get to the point.

243
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,420
Does Weiwei want to know

244
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,100
about Mai Sichong?

245
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:01,900
Right.

246
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,900
I've inquired about it.

247
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,140
Leaders of the provincial team

248
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,660
are anxious about

249
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,380
Mai Sichong's

250
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,140
misconduct.

251
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,220
But as long as someone can prove that

252
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,140
he's capable,

253
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,140
the problem will be solved.

254
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,500
That's why we came to see you.

255
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,660
Do you know any leaders

256
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,020
who are on friendly terms with you in the past few years? Dad?

257
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,300
Silly!

258
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,980
Think about it!

259
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,260
If I ask someone to fix it for him,

260
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,140
others will think that

261
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,380
Mai Sichong

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,540
deals with it in an unfair way.

263
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,220
Well.

264
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,340
What shall we do?

265
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,180
You have to find a lobbyist.

266
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,340
Besides,

267
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,780
the lobbyist

268
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,940
shall have public credibility.

269
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,660
And,

270
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,740
there should not be any interpersonal relationship

271
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,020
with Mai Sichong.

272
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,420
Xun Yang?

273
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,580
Xia Rui

274
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,700
You might as well admit your mistake.

275
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,140
Everyone will forgive you.

276
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,420
Xia Rui

277
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,300
Hello?

278
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,900
Is this to be notified today?

279
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,180
Tomorrow.

280
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,860
It will be posted together with the provincial team list.

281
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,060
How come it's not posted?

282
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,060
Hello.

283
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,620
Ms. Peipei

284
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Nice to meet you.

285
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,140
Welcome.

286
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,200
Please.

287
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,740
I don't need to say much more about the importance of

288
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,500
this provincial team extra trial.

289
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,620
To be fair,

290
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,820
you are requested to have a drug test before the race.

291
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,860
Hope you later

292
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,180
can perform at your highest level.

293
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,860
Take the chance.

294
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,980
Be prepared.

295
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,300
How about having a meal after the race?

296
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,420
Definitely.

297
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,140
Thank you for your help, Mr. Xun Yang.

298
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,980
Not at all.

299
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,860
You've got to make some preparations.

300
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,100
I bet Chong will win.

301
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,500
What if Rui wins?

302
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,060
Impossible.

303
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
If he wins,

304
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,620
I'll drink the water of the pool for a month.

305
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,140
Where's Xia Rui?

306
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,580
It's almost time. He still doesn't turn up.

307
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,140
I'll look for him in the dressing room.

308
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
Mai Sichong

309
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,100
I admit

310
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,660
you are an excellent swimmer.

311
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,820
Because of my jealousy,

312
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,860
I have done so many things that hurt you and Mei Weiwei.

313
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,500
I lose the race between us

314
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,180
from the beginning.

315
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,980
So, it's meaningless to hold the race.

316
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
I owe you an apology.

317
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,300
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,900
What are you doing? Just read the message.

319
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,860
Why it's always me?

320
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,580
This is definitely a piece of good news of Xiaomai.

321
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm generous.

322
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,420
Allow you to read it first,

323
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,180
and share the joy.

324
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,980
Why are you so serious?

325
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,100
Don't scare me.

326
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,860
In this extra trial, Mai Sichong

327
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,180
got a good score of 50.35 seconds.

328
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,620
and was successfully admitted by the provincial team.

329
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,580
Congratulations!

330
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Bastard!

331
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,700
You fool me.

332
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,180
Unbelievable!

333
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,940
So many people applied for the club
only one week after this term begins.

334
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,020
Our massage club will start to flourish,

335
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
because there are two screams in our class.

336
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,220
Hello, everybody.

337
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Welcome to my live room.

338
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,060
I didn't expect the physical massage club would be so popular.

339
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,060
Now Chief Lin Baihui is teaching us to play shadowboxing.

340
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,700
Say hello to everyone.

341
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Don't shoot me. I'm not photogenic.

342
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,860
Alright.

343
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,940
Where's Weiwei?

344
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,100
They look so alike.

345
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,780
Alike what?

346
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,020
You only need to spend 199 yuan

347
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,780
bringing Mei Weiwei, the electric eel back home.

348
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
It's too cheap.

349
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,500
An electric eel is more expensive than her.

350
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,900
How come Weiwei

351
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,980
only is worth such a low price?

352
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,580
Why are you here?

353
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,180
Where's Ding Yi?

354
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,260
I have no idea.

355
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
He left after the class was over.

356
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,180
Why are you so happy?

357
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,220
I see.

358
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,780
After all, your boyfriend is so handsome.

359
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,300
You are admired by others.

360
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:05,860
Right?

361
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,540
I got to go.

362
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,820
Why are you still wearing it?

363
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,700
It's useless, isn't it?

364
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,380
I'm used to wearing it anyway.

365
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,180
I feel secure when wearing it.

366
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,100
Alright!

367
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,140
Is there anything you wanted to do before but were afraid to do?

368
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,900
I haven't swum yet.

369
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,900
Swim?

370
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,100
Your boyfriend is a swimming top-notch player.

371
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:27,900
How about this?

372
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,620
I teach you.

373
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,460
Let's go.

374
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
How about

375
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,460
letting it go?

376
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,900
I...

377
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,300
It's okay.

378
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,980
During the training period,

379
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,020
there won't be many people.

380
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,540
Come on.

381
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,220
But

382
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,580
I haven't swum yet.

383
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,060
Weiwei

384
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,180
You shall not be scared when I'm with you.

385
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,220
Trust me.

386
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:56,860
Let's go.

387
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,860
Come on.

388
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,700
You have ever fallen down before. What are you afraid of?

389
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,180
Come on.

390
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,580
But...

391
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,580
How brazen you are to mention the last time.

392
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,660
I almost choked to death because of you last time.

393
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,420
Be careful.

394
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,580
Then you can't let go of me!

395
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,380
Okay, I won't.

396
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,300
I'm with you.

397
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,380
You're not going to take advantage of me, are you?

398
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,780
Why I take advantage of you?

399
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,980
It's you who take advantage of me.

400
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,260
It's okay.

401
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,140
Come on. Pull this. Let's try.

402
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,820
Don't worry. I'm with you.

403
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,780
You must hold my hand.

404
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,420
I never thought I would swim in the pool.

405
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,300
How do you feel?

406
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,260
Without the electricity,

407
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,180
are you happy?

408
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
I used to

409
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,540
worry about the electricity on me.

410
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,620
So, I dared not to think about these things.

411
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,580
I have never thought about my future as well.

412
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,660
From now on,

413
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,540
you can plan for your future,

414
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,460
and,

415
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,500
our future.
