00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,774
Recently there are bad
guys in the university.

3
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,054
Caution!

4
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,494
In case of stalkers,

5
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,260
please call the police for rescue in time.

6
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,588
I must keep an eye on you.

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,174
Why are you so concerned about Weiwei?

8
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,494
You envy?

9
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,574
If you need someone to
protect you, you can call me.

10
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,934
I can give you 20% off.

11
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,414
Don't make me laugh.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,254
I'll be thankful if you don't follow me.

13
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,454
I follow you?

14
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,654
There are so many
beautiful girls in school,

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,894
so why do I choose you?

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,294
Behave yourself.

17
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,694
Why?

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,894
What's wrong if I speak like this?

19
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,734
You...

20
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,660
Weiwei

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,700
Do you think...

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,974
Do you think I was seen
by someone last night?

23
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,094
Don't worry.

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,614
Even if you are seen by someone,

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,494
he will think he is wrong.

26
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,420
Don't worry.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,140
I'll go to class.

28
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,214
Then

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,692
I'll come to you after class.

30
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,100
Why?

31
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,294
So much has happened at school recently.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,220
I'll protect you.

33
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,654
I don't need to be protected

34
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,036
because of my constitution.

35
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,774
You're right.

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,660
It's the pervert who
needs to be protected.

37
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,300
This is for you.

38
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,334
Ding Yi told me

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,054
that he would eat a lollipop

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,614
every time after being
scolded by Ms. Peipei.

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,934
You should take one too.

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,028
You might be happier.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:23,974
OK.

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,814
I'm leaving.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,292
I'll come to you after class.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,534
Junjun

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,500
Let's play on Saturday.

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,654
Ask him out, too.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,054
You both get into the same college,

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,134
so how fated you are.

51
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,974
Don't be a coward.

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,214
You just send him a text message.

53
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
If he doesn't have time, forget it.

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,054
I would like to invite you to join
me for afternoon tea next Saturday.

55
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,094
Do you have time for this?

56
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,020
By Junjun.

57
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Junjun

58
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,214
Why are you still in the dorm?

59
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,054
What are you going to do?

60
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm gonna see if there's
a monitor on that road.

61
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,814
Maybe the monitors caught the guy.

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,254
I'll go with you.

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
Let's go.

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,814
Weiwei

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
There is really a monitor here.

66
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,574
Yes.

67
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,014
Maybe I was caught by the monitor.

68
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,460
Let's hurry to the monitor room to check.

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,774
Let's go.

70
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,294
We have a class later.

71
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,220
Let's go.

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,820
Come in please.

73
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,174
What can I do for you?

74
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,094
Hello.

75
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,254
We

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,174
want to see

77
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,974
the monitor of Zhixing Road last night.

78
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,334
Let me help you.

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
Thank you.

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,620
Zhixing Road

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,414
Yesterday's monitor on Zhixing
Road was a bit problematic.

82
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,094
It was being maintained.

83
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,188
So it might not work.

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,134
Then

85
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,014
when will it work?

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,534
I'm not sure about that.

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,252
I need to apply to the university.

88
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,814
It's getting late.

89
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,694
After you, please.

90
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,214
I'll patrol later.

91
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,694
But

92
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,014
this is a really important thing for us.

93
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,774
Goodbye.

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,694
We just want to see it.

95
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,620
I'm really busy.

96
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,180
Let's go.

97
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,060
Anything else?

98
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
Let's go.

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,574
Weiwei

100
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,614
Did you just

101
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,020
find something?

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,420
Junjun

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,100
Why are you so scared?

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,974
I think I just

105
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,660
saw the guy last night.

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,734
So

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,694
that security guard is...

108
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,654
I just suspect him.

109
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,134
Because his size and his legs

110
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,460
are very similar to that of
the person we met last night.

111
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,614
Mei Weiwei

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,894
What's wrong with you?

113
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,014
It's safe

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,820
for two girls to
investigate during the day?

115
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,894
All right, I get it, and please stop it.

116
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,334
What do you get?

117
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,974
Be careful.

118
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,374
I mean, call me if
something happens to you.

119
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,140
I don't want to bother you every time.

120
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,332
Give me your phone.

121
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,374
Remember to call me

122
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,804
if something happens to you.

123
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,734
Weiwei

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,014
It suddenly occurs to me

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,614
that I have a Comic-Con with my friends,

126
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,494
so I have to go.

127
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,374
You can send me a message
if something happens to you.

128
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
These are bought for
you and you do not eat?

129
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
I'm full.

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,420
Remember to come to
the swimming pool tonight.

131
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,414
Weiwei

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,774
Can you be serious?

133
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,820
The grade in Team Match the
day after tomorrow relies on efforts.

134
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,620
Try again.

135
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,500
Mai Sichong

136
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,774
What's wrong with you?

137
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,854
Do you have a sore throat?

138
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,814
Is the current too high?

139
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,494
It doesn't

140
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
seem to.

141
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,774
My fault.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,254
Just kidding.

143
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,180
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,654
Now I don't know if it's useful for you,

145
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,934
but you are still joking.

146
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,860
What if I lose control and you get hurt?

147
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,094
You controlled it well before.

148
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,020
It's okay.

149
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,420
All right.

150
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,620
Please time.

151
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,054
Ready.

152
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,980
Go.

153
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,620
Fighting.

154
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
Fighting.

155
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,054
How long?

156
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,134
51.09 seconds.

157
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,334
You swim faster again.

158
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,414
I've always been at the
international level, okay?

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,054
Wait for me at the finish line

160
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,214
in the future.

161
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,174
If I win,

162
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,974
you'll be the first physical therapist
of the future Olympic champion.

163
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,614
So what if you lose?

164
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,694
I won't lose.

165
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
I don't allow it.

166
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,254
Weiwei

167
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,740
What are you going to do about
that perverted security guard?

168
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,534
How about calling the police?

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,300
But what if the wrong person is arrested?

170
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,620
Just try it.

171
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,814
The only way

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,094
is to lure the bad guys to be exposed.

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,574
Chong

174
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,974
Can you say a few words that
the athletes can understand?

175
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,374
But would he, a school security guard,

176
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,934
steal the property he is guarding?

177
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,854
Why do you also say idioms?

178
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,574
Why do you talk so much?

179
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,974
Can you two talk about
your own business later?

180
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,500
I don't want to talk to him.

181
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,414
Junjun

182
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,774
There is something
that may need your help.

183
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,700
What?

184
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,294
We can use a honey trap

185
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,134
to seduce him.

186
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
No way.

187
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,860
I don't mean to let Junjun do it.

188
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,300
What do you mean?

189
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,468
What do you want me to do?

190
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,614
You have a good figure.

191
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,734
Don't make fun of me.

192
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,734
Please smile.

193
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,660
Don't shoot.

194
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,734
I think

195
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,116
there is something missing.

196
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,860
What?

197
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,604
Please choose one.

198
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,054
Stop it.

199
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Come on.

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,054
All right, stop it.

201
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,934
We also have to think about

202
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,700
where to set a trap for this pervert next.

203
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,620
It is certainly the place where
he appears most frequently.

204
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,254
Chong, stop it.

205
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,134
Stop it.

206
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,060
Get in.

207
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,814
Chong

208
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,694
Xia Rui

209
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,734
Li Daixi

210
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,334
Let me out.

211
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,134
Ding Yi

212
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,420
Be a man.

213
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,020
Let's go.

214
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,214
Chong

215
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,740
We can't only wait.

216
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,020
You become literate.

217
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,334
Ding Yi

218
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,614
You just have to be patient now.

219
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,254
When you catch the pervert
you will become a hero.

220
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,734
Li Daixi

221
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,860
I'll teach you a lesson
when I catch that pervert.

222
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,980
Pervert, stop.

223
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,380
Stop.

224
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,492
Get out of the way.

225
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,534
It's this security guard.

226
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,134
I am a first offender.

227
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,174
Please leave me alone.

228
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,934
I am a first offender.

229
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,494
I'll never do it again.

230
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,054
Whether you are a first offender or not,

231
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,934
let's call the police to take him away.

232
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,574
Please.

233
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,500
Please let me go.

234
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,188
It's a big sacrifice.

235
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,974
But don't deal with the wrongdoers
by yourself because you're a man.

236
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,308
Now men are also not safe.

237
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,894
Please remember

238
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,134
that it is a good thing to
act bravely for a just cause,

239
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,374
but we should inform the police

240
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,974
as soon as possible in case of danger,

241
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,900
okay?

242
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,220
Goodbye.

243
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,694
Did the monitor

244
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,540
capture the crime at the time?

245
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,414
I've seen the monitor video.

246
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,174
It didn't capture anything substantial.

247
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,614
Don't think about that.

248
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,374
Let's

249
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,300
celebrate?

250
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,254
Of course.

251
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,694
I made such a big sacrifice.

252
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,460
This is a credit to everyone, okay?

253
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,134
A credit to everyone?

254
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,574
Not a credit to me?

255
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,500
Let's go.

256
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,574
Don't worry.

257
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,294
Monitor video have a time limit.

258
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,220
It will be automatically
deleted if it expires.

259
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,820
Let's go.

260
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,860
Cheers.

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,894
We've done a great job today.

262
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,774
Shouldn't the university
send us a silk banner?

263
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,334
Right.

264
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,620
It should do.

265
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,134
In fact,

266
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,614
I really have a silk banner

267
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,374
for everyone.

268
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,014
Really?

269
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,854
Really?

270
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,934
Put it in our dorm.

271
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,980
Why?

272
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,700
517 in Building B?

273
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,454
Our dorm?

274
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,380
Right.

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,460
A love letter, right?

276
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,574
It must not be you two.

277
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,494
Junjun

278
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
You like me?

279
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,054
Nonsense.

280
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,094
Like you?

281
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,374
Don't talk nonsense.

282
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,020
Does anyone like you, Li Daixi?

283
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,614
Junjun

284
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,188
Which of the three do you like?

285
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,900
Nobody.

286
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,014
Tell me.

287
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,940
I'll help you.

288
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,228
You like Mai Sichong?

289
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,574
Cheers, you two.

290
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,974
Why?

291
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,054
Everyone is here to celebrate.

292
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,774
Let's toast.

293
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Cheers.

294
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,654
Li Daixi

295
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,814
You are so heavy that
no one can support you.

296
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,694
You like me,

297
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,534
so you can't let me lose weight.

298
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,334
You should train

299
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,534
the physical strength.

300
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,494
What?

301
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,934
Physical stress?

302
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,814
Physical strength.

303
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,654
She said there is something
wrong with your waist.

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,580
Come on.

305
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,294
Weiwei

306
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,060
Why does she always say I like her?

307
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,860
Li Daixi

308
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,654
You actually like me.

309
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm actually the kind of girl you like.

310
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,974
Help me, Junjun.

311
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,254
Junjun

312
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,180
Come on.

313
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,340
We have to go.

314
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,980
Be careful.

315
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,014
Xia Rui

316
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,854
I have been friends with
Junjun since childhood.

317
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,254
Please take good care of her.

318
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,094
I never let anyone down.

319
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,020
I believe you.

320
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,214
All right.

321
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,614
Another one in love.

322
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
Let's go.

323
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,900
What are you watching?

324
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,494
This is just a warm-up match

325
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,974
to test everyone's strength.

326
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
You can all relax.

327
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,020
Except for Ding Yi,

328
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,854
none of you

329
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,134
need to have any pressure.

330
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,060
Ms. Peipei

331
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
Start training.

332
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,494
Don't be lazy.

333
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,894
I have a race tomorrow.

334
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Do you come?

335
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,774
Sorry to keep you waiting.

336
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,814
It doesn't matter.

337
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,214
Are you okay?

338
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,934
Yes.

339
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,860
It's all over.

340
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,854
Although the pervert was caught,

341
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,814
you must be careful when
walking at night, do you know?

342
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,294
I see.

343
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,974
Thanks for caring.

344
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,774
Why do you have time today?

345
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,294
I was too busy some time ago.

346
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,614
I'm taking a break from work,

347
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,054
so I can relax.

348
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,614
It's my birthday tomorrow.

349
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
You haven't forgotten
our agreement, have you?

350
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,820
Tomorrow?

351
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,414
Not the day after tomorrow?

352
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,214
You misremember the date of my birthday.

353
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,788
Do you have something tomorrow?

354
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,774
I have a race tomorrow and do you come?

355
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,420
The grade in Team Match the
day after tomorrow relies on efforts.

356
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,934
I book a restaurant that
can cook very delicious food.

357
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,300
You can't stand me up.

358
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,100
OK.

359
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,780
Are you hungry?

360
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,134
I ordered your favorite strawberry cake
when you weren't here.

361
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,140
Thank you.

362
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,172
The competition is about to begin.

363
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,494
Please enter one by one.

364
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,934
Please check each track

365
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,260
to ensure the smooth running of the race.

366
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,214
You're so attentive,

367
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
so Weiwei must be very happy to see this.

368
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,694
We'll leave after helping you.

369
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,820
Good luck.

370
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,260
Thank you.

371
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll go keep an eye
on the outside for you.

372
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,548
How's the windowsill?

373
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,700
Junjun

374
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,294
Why are you here?

375
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,454
For you guys.

376
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,454
Why are you so nervous?

377
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,534
You are the last one anyway.

378
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,774
Don't make fun of me.

379
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,254
If I am the last one again this time,

380
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,854
Ms. Peipei will kill me.

381
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,780
Fighting.

382
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,300
Where's Weiwei?

383
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,414
She went out early in the morning.

384
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,214
She probably went to
Peng Pai's birthday party.

385
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,294
But she asked me to tell you

386
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,220
fighting.

387
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,084
The competition begins.

388
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
On your marks.

389
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,620
Set.

390
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,020
Is he late?

391
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,734
Let's watch the live broadcast
of swimming in our university.

392
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,054
This is Mai Sichong.

393
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,980
Right.

394
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,334
The man in the back
is going to overtake him.

395
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,428
What happened to him?

396
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,374
Come on.

397
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,774
Fighting.

398
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,774
Come on.

399
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,868
What happened to him?

400
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,694
Come on.

401
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,620
Fighting.

402
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,014
What happened to him?

403
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,454
What's wrong with him?

404
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,094
What's up with him?

405
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,734
He wasn't like this before.

406
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,940
He's about to lose.

407
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,020
Cheer up, Maxi Chong.

408
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,260
Weiwei

409
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,614
Qiaoqiao

410
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,334
You didn't go to Peng
Pai's birthday party?

411
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,894
My friend from the swim
team has an accident.

412
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,974
I must come for him.

413
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,374
Weiwei

414
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,334
What's wrong?

415
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,764
Do you know that Peng Pai...

416
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,588
What happened to him?

417
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,476
What's wrong with him?

418
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,820
Chong

419
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,260
Chong

420
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,340
Chong

421
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,134
Ms. Peipei

422
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,054
I'll see what happens.

423
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
Go for it.

424
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,374
Peng Pai

425
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,140
wants to confess his love to you today.

426
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,140
Confess his love?

427
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,974
Hello.

428
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,454
Hello.

429
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,134
Hello, Mr. Peng.

430
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,334
Miss Mei Weiwei's gift
for you is still on its way.

431
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,668
I'll be there in a moment.

432
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,254
Peng Pai

433
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,494
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,574
I really have something
important to do today.

435
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,854
I may not be able to make the appointment.

436
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,174
You don't need to wait for me.

437
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,854
Enjoy yourself.

438
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,996
Happy birthday to you.

439
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,294
Weiwei

440
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,694
You...

441
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,460
Didn't you go to the birthday party?

442
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,374
Did Mai Sichong win?

443
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,254
He

444
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,214
lost.

445
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,294
Not only did he lose,

446
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,374
but he had his lowest
grade since joining the team.

447
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
54.57 seconds.

448
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,814
Where's Weiwei?

449
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,700
She probably went to
Peng Pai's birthday party.

450
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,780
Mai Sichong

451
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,014
What's wrong with you?

452
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,974
Weiwei doesn't come to see
Chong's competition recently,

453
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,254
so Chong doesn't concentrate on training.

454
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,414
Is there anything you want to tell me

455
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,180
about hiding the medical report secretly?

456
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,134
I hear it is because he doesn't want
his injury to be known by teacher.

457
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,654
Isn't he a good athlete?

458
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,734
He's screwed.

459
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,260
Is his sports career in ruins?

460
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,534
Mai Sichong

461
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Please wake up.
