2
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,420
Did you really promise me?

3
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,900
Will you regret?

4
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
My electricity...

5
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,580
It's okay.

6
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
Whether you have electricity or not,

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,100
both are okay to me.

8
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,500
Alright. Won't there be a competition tomorrow?

9
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Go back now.

10
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,980
I don't want to.

11
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
If you stay here, it will be too late.

12
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,380
Do you really want me to leave?

13
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,180
No, I won't go.

14
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,980
Go back now,

15
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,580
or you'll get a cold.

16
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
I'll go back to my dormitory.

17
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,100
You are awake.

18
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,020
Drink some water?

19
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,180
Thank you.

20
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,580
Where are Weiwei and the other one?

21
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,140
She's chatting with Mai Sichong outside.

22
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,580
They two today really made

23
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,220
a scene in our university!

24
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,820
Junjun

25
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,820
I always want to ask you a question.

26
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,220
The man you like

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,180
is not Xia Rui,

28
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,900
right?

29
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,740
You are both here.

30
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,740
Junjun

31
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,660
this is for you.

32
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,420
Thank you today.

33
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:51,660
Thank you.

34
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,020
Enjoy it.

35
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,300
This is for Yuxin.

36
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,020
Thank you.

37
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,340
You can get anything you want.

38
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,700
Anyway,

39
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,780
it's Mai's treat.

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,300
After a while,

41
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,780
show up your real condition,

42
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,180
and get the best record.

43
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,020
Are you clear?

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,860
Yes, madam!

45
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
But it's a competition.

46
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
How can it be the same as usual?

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
Ding Yi

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
You are even not qualified to compete,

49
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,340
how dare you speak too much?

50
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,460
Fighting!

51
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,820
Get on the bus.

52
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
The duplicate check rate of your thesis

53
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,220
is only 1.2 percent.

54
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
It's very good.

55
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,380
But my tutor asked me to revise it again.

56
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,780
It's just a pre-check. There is still a lot of time.

57
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,420
Weiwei

58
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Hello.

59
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,540
Where are you hurrying?

60
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,020
I have something to do outside of the school.

61
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,780
Qiaoqiao

62
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,500
Let's ask the tutor to check our results again.

63
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,340
Let's go.

64
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,780
Okay.

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,980
We'll go now.

66
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,980
Bye-bye.

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,900
You two...

68
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,980
It's already past.

70
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,500
Bro, I've known you for four years.

71
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,860
Although I don't know you thoroughly,

72
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,540
I can tell whether you are happy or not.

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,700
I know you have an affection for Mei Weiwei.

74
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,140
But she may not know it.

75
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I think,

76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,340
you should tell her.

77
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
Mr. Zhang is going to resign?

78
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,740
Fighting, fighting!

79
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,220
SSU is winning!

80
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,820
Fighting, fighting!

81
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,060
SSU is winning!

82
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,180
Why do you come here?

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,140
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,180
Can't you see?

85
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
To cheer you on.

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,300
And we've got you this.

87
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,620
A silk banner?

88
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,260
So exaggerated!

89
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,380
What if we fail in the competition?

90
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,420
Nonsense! It's impossible!

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,820
Right.

92
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
Why haven't you entered yet?

93
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,340
Alright.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,460
The provincial team allows friends to watch,

95
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,340
but you should keep order.

96
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,860
Okay?

97
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,740
Okay!

98
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,020
Time for admission.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,620
Yeah! Let's go!

100
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,620
Like an idiot!

101
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,180
Nothing to say to me?

102
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,460
Fighting!

103
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,180
Only that?

104
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,540
Wait for me.

105
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,420
I must be the champion.

106
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,260
Let's go.

107
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,740
Does Chong's former injury recur?

108
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,340
It's fine. He must be okay.

109
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,940
Are you okay?

110
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,700
I'm okay.

111
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,540
Recently, I've been giving him rehabilitation.

112
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,020
He told me he had nothing wrong. Don't worry.

113
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,500
Weiwei

114
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,100
Uncle, Aunt.

115
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Mai. Hurry up.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,180
Don't worry. Mai Sichong will certainly win.

117
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,340
Of course he'll win with you here.

118
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,460
Where is he?

119
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,020
Come on!

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,980
Fighting! Mai Sichong!

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,780
Fighting! Mai Sichong, fighting!

122
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,980
Fighting!

123
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,140
Fighting!

124
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,220
I'm no longer your boss.

125
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
Don't be so polite.

126
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
As for the resignation,

127
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,940
I intended to tell you after you got hired.

128
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,140
At least,

129
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,260
I could guarantee your employment.

130
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,260
But now...

131
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,740
Mr. Zhang has been so nice to me.

132
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,700
I feel so grateful that I can follow you

133
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,580
during the internship.

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
FT

135
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,100
never keeps useless people.

136
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,140
You have the capability and ambition,

137
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,260
and you can try again.

138
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Don't you want to have a try?

139
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,860
I should find an easier job.

140
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,420
I want to spare more time

141
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,580
to accompany my daughter.

142
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,300
I thought

143
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,060
if a child was tired,

144
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,940
she could eventually go through it.

145
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,260
But now, looking back,

146
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,900
the years when she needed my hugs most

147
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,980
were all cast by me.

148
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,020
Peng Pai

149
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,260
I'm here

150
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,220
to wish you

151
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,180
a bright future!

152
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,140
Am I marvelous or not?

153
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
We won the first battle!

154
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,460
What a good prophet I am!

155
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,700
My mom told me before she left today

156
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,180
that I should treat you to relax.

157
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,260
Guys,

158
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,700
Chong wants us to stay out all night!

159
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,780
Why are you so excited?

160
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,100
Of course I am.

161
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,940
Chong and Rui ranked first and second.

162
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,820
I also feel honored, okay?

163
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,500
In order to celebrate Chong and Rui,

164
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,060
who succeeded in getting in the training camp because I quitted,

165
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,180
I announce:

166
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Let Chong treat us!

167
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,780
How about that?

168
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,860
I'll treat you a bath in the hot spring.

169
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,700
One person, one pool.

170
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,820
VVIP. What do you think?

171
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Yes!

172
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,820
Yeah!

173
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,180
I've never bathed in a hot spring.

174
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,140
Really?

175
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,300
Chong

176
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,580
I want to marry you.

177
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Nonsense!

178
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,020
The head of Li Daixi

179
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,940
looks like a ball!

180
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,340
You...

181
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,260
Say that again!

182
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,500
What games can we play here?

183
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,100
KING OF FIGHT. How about that?

184
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,740
Can we watch the video-on-demand?

185
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,740
Professor Lin held a very nice lecture recently...

186
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Give it to me!

187
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,580
You choose, Junjun.

188
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,220
What do you want to watch?

189
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,340
BLEACH.

190
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,260
BLEACH?

191
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,020
Well,

192
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
how about going around?

193
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,700
Let's go.

194
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm a little bit nervous.

195
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,700
Sorry.

196
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,780
It's okay.

197
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,860
You should be used to it.

198
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,660
In the future,

199
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,700
I'll always hold your hand like this.

200
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,940
Hard the first time,

201
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,780
easy the second time.

202
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
Holding for times

203
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,620
will make it easier.

204
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,060
So many mosquitoes.

205
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,460
Mosquitoes are too many.

206
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,220
I'll go now.

207
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,740
Mosquitoes?

208
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,540
Where?

209
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
You came back?

210
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,380
You came back finally!

211
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Oh, madam.

212
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,980
What is it for?

213
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,140
It's called Lovers' Card.

214
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,900
Write down the name of whom you like,

215
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,580
and hang it there.

216
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,300
You'll be together!

217
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,340
Really?

218
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,660
Draw from the lots.

219
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,380
What are they?

220
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,020
Lady, our lots are very accurate.

221
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,420
Really?

222
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,380
Am I going to meet my

223
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,540
Mr. Right?

224
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Seven hands and eight feet.

225
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,580
Three heads and two faces.

226
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,100
What does it read?

227
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,580
Quarrelsome lovers.

228
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,300
They meet every day.

229
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,380
Nothing.

230
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,340
-Let's go. -What did you draw?

231
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,860
Go!

232
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,060
What lot did you draw?

233
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,020
If you have any wish, I can achieve it for you.

234
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,620
I...

235
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,940
I was thinking about changing my major.

236
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,220
I wanted to know about the future.

237
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,460
Why?

238
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,180
You don't want to leave?

239
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm still hesitating.

240
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,660
Don't worry.

241
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,700
Anyway,

242
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,780
wherever you go,

243
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,820
I'll support you.

244
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,340
Weiwei

245
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,460
This is for you.

246
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,900
Why did you fetch so much strange food?

247
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,620
Just eat it.

248
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,060
Why did you hide the character "Xiao" (Little)?

249
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,820
Just eat it.

250
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,180
Wo Ju (Lettuce).

251
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,820
Xi Gua (Watermelon).

252
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,740
Huan Xiong (Raccoon). Ni Qiu (Loach).

253
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,020
Wo Xi Huan Ni (I like you)!

254
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,540
What a nerd you are, Mai Sichong!

255
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Chong

256
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
You are so silly!

257
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
So gross!

258
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
Where did you learn all of these?

259
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Well... Help Spade Four and Heart Four

260
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,060
to make up!

261
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,500
Kiss!

262
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,500
Fine, fine, fine.

263
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,860
Turn around.

264
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,860
You've already kissed secretly!

265
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
No peeking! Turn around!

266
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,380
Okay, okay.

267
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,980
No peeking!

268
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,460
Don't turn around

269
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,340
until I say "stop".

270
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,420
I don't want to kiss because of the game...

271
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,820
As usual,

272
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,980
be serious while we kiss.

273
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,740
Chong

274
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
I just said

275
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,100
you could kiss.

276
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,620
But I didn't ask you to kiss the mouth!

277
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Kiss one more time!

278
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
What a person you are!

279
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,900
Next round.

280
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,660
I'll send out cards this time.

281
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Okay. You send out cards.

282
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
In this round,

283
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,220
I'm the King.

284
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,660
And then...

285
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,660
Heart Ace and Spade Ace

286
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,060
hug each other.

287
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,660
Junjun

288
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,140
Who's the other one?

289
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,140
Not me.

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,420
Wei

291
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,140
Will you be mad?

292
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,940
It's just a hug.

293
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,700
Go on!

294
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,300
That's it.

295
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,620
We're friends.

296
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,860
If you need help from Xia Rui and me,

297
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,780
we'll help you.

298
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,900
Next round.

299
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Well. I'll send out cards in this round.

300
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,380
Okay, you send them out.

301
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,300
Next round.

302
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,020
I'll go to the restroom.

303
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,660
Well,

304
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I've got a call.

305
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,860
Hurry up.

306
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,380
Come on.

307
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,340
Wipe the table.

308
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,820
Junjun

309
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,020
Are you okay?

310
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,700
I'm fine.

311
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,260
Don't do that anymore.

312
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,820
Mai Sichong likes Weiwei.

313
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,940
Weiwei also likes him.

314
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,620
They are a couple.

315
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,980
So what?

316
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,420
You've been liking him for so long.

317
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,060
Why he never cares about you?

318
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,740
I...

319
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
don't need him to know it.

320
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,420
That's not true. You're just afraid to tell him.

321
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,540
Waiting for him for such a long time,

322
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,140
only you yourself are touched.

323
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,220
Do you think it's funny?

324
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,900
But I'm just that kind of person.

325
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,780
It's a truth that

326
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,300
not all affections

327
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,340
have good results.

328
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,580
You are just so coward.

329
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,980
Anyway, I hope you do not do that again.

330
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,420
Otherwise,

331
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,180
I'll be embarrassed.

332
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Okay, I see.

333
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,380
I won't do it anymore.

334
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,460
I cannot get in the water with electricity.

335
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:41,900
Weiwei

336
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,980
How was the

337
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,340
first kiss?

338
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,700
First kiss?

339
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,220
It was just like artificial respiration.

340
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,380
You've also done artificial respiration?

341
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,940
Mai Sichong was ill that time.

342
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,300
He fainted in the swimming pool.

343
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,220
Then I...

344
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,140
So it was not your first kiss!

345
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,900
Do you want to play with us?

346
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,100
Well, no!

347
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,780
Weiwei

348
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,980
wants to be alone with me!

349
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,140
Okay, enjoy your time!

350
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,500
Junjun and I will also enjoy our own time!

351
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,580
I've never expected that

352
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,100
I can make so many good friends like you in the college!

353
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I've also never expected it!

354
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
In our dormitory,

355
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,020
Junjun and you are both weirdoes!

356
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,980
No one talked

357
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
before I moved in!

358
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,900
Actually,

359
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,180
I really like to talk.

360
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,620
Are you Junjun?

361
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Are you fake?

362
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,180
After a while,

363
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,820
let's meet at the little garden.

364
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:54,940
Alright.

365
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,220
Do as you like.

366
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,340
Good luck!

367
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,100
How's that?

368
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,940
Did you have fun today?

369
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,820
It's really comfortable in the hot spring.

370
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,140
Why do you ask me to come here?

371
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,940
I have something for you.

372
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,580
What is it?

373
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,500
So?

374
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,420
I...

375
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,980
I really wanted to buy larger fireworks.

376
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,020
But,

377
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,020
that's all I can buy nearby.

378
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,300
But it's really beautiful!

379
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,260
Ding Yi told me

380
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,740
you girls like this kind of

381
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,940
bright

382
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
and sparkling things, right?

383
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,060
I'll ignite it for you.

384
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,140
How's that?

385
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,380
Is it beautiful?

386
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,460
You don't like it?

387
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,540
Weiwei

388
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Actually,

389
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,620
I just want to give you a special memory.

390
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
But I really

391
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,900
don't know how to make you happy.

392
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
Before I met you,

393
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,700
swimming took up all my routine.

394
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,500
My world was full of blue.

395
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,900
But after I met you,

396
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,420
my world became more colorful.

397
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,700
You're just like the firework.

398
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,700
You're bright and shiny.

399
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,540
In the pool,

400
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,740
no matter how strong my competitors are,

401
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm still fearless.

402
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,180
But in front of you,

403
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm afraid to mess up everything.

404
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,660
You know,

405
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,100
this's my first relationship.

406
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,500
There are many problems

407
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,380
that I don't know how to handle.

408
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,700
I don't know

409
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,260
whether you can

410
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,620
accept a boyfriend like me.

411
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,780
Mai Sichong

412
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,100
I like you.
