Weiwei

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,034
Why do you come so late?

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,714
We have finished the exam.

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,754
Where's your partner?

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,136
He was delayed on the road.

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
I'll wait him.

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,114
How about

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,496
letting my friend help you?

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,314
No, thanks.

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,674
You go first.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,634
I'll wait him.

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Well, good luck.

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,234
Bye-bye.

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Bye-bye.

Examination is about to start.

Mei Weiwei

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Why does that person look so familiar?

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,640
He's the Kurosaki-kun you've
been talking about, isn't he?

21
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Let's go.

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,234
Why you are so late?

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,274
All your classmates have finished.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,114
Where's your partner?

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,354
My partner must have
been delayed on the road.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,394
Could you please wait for a minute?

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,394
Look at what time it is!

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,634
Please...

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,112
Here's my partner, professor.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Quickly!

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,848
Please give us one more chance.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,114
The examination will begin now.

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,832
Athletes are under great pressure.

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,954
You try

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
the head and face easing technique first.

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
Ok.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,920
Itch.

38
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,600
Hold on.

Ok.

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
Pass.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360

Why did you disappear after your exams?

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,754
Can I help you?

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,834
No need.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,674
Can you do that? You are so skinny.

104
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,994
Don't look down on me.

105
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,674
I'm the kind of person who looks skinny

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
but strong enough.

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,154
Why do you carry so many things?

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,834
Are you moving?

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,760
Right.

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm moving.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
I moved out of my home.

112
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,080
Alright.

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,760
But do you have your
parents' permission to move?

114
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,874
My own permission is enough.

115
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,834
Right.

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,120
You can save the cost of
travelling home and back.

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,634
You are able to spend
less time on part-time job.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,208
You won't have to work so hard.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,954
By the way,

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,794
how's your club going?

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,354
Our healthy disco has
hit across the campus.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,592
Are you available later?

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,154
Well.

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,234
Could you come with me
to the department later?

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,234
For what?

126
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,240
You can witness the moment of
our massage club's regularization.

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,034
Okay.

128
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,594
Really?

129
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,354
Yes.

130
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,354
Go!

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,554
Where is your dormitory?

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,720
Walk slowly.

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,328
Why don't you choose something?

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,794
You helped me pass the exam today.

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,714
To express my thanks

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,754
you can choose anything here.

137
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
My treat.

138
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,720
You just choose what you like.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,434
My treat.

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,640
You have helped me for the
exam and you buy me things?

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,976
What's wrong with you?

142
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,034
Nothing.

143
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
There are mosquitoes.

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,256
I am going to pay the bill.

145
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,874
Why you are so strange today?

146
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
What?

147
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

148
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,314
It's too windy.

149
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
I'll protect you from it.

150
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,584
Sichong, what are you doing?

151
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Mr. Peng

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,954
Weiwei.

153
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,034
I bought you snacks.

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,984
It's all you like.

155
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,072
Thank you, Mr. Peng

156
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,434
You still remember what I like.

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
I have bought you the same.

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,074
Well.

159
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,400
I can share with my roommates.

160
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,074
I have something to do.

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Goodbye.

162
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,114
Sorry, Mr. Peng

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,954
I have something to do, too.

164
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,000
I have to leave.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,576
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,480
I remember you got good
grade in training today.

167
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,632
Do you fall out of love?

168
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,874
You fall out of love.

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,434
Nonsense!

170
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
All I have in mind now
is the team competition.

171
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,568
You fall out of love.

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,194
Don't eat anymore?

173
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,120
Yes.

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,792
I've been tricked again.

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,754
Hi, mom.

176
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
What's up? I'm busy.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,514
You are busy?

178
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,274
What are you busy with?

179
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,674
It is difficult yesterday to arrange
an in-country consultation with Peter.

180
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,074
You missed it.

181
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,914
What are you going to do about your knee?

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,354
Peter has gone back to America.

183
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
There's something about
Weiwei yesterday. I can't leave.

184
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,674
What thing can be important than your...

185
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,720
Is Weiwei all right?

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,314
All right. All right.

187
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,312
I'm hanging up now.

188
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,114
Hi, Weiwei.

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,514
What are you doing?

190
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,088
Do electric shock training now.

191
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,194
Hi, Weiwei.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,994
I'm hungry now.

193
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,760
Aren't you going to treat me? How about...

194
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
How can you talk with Peng Pei so well?

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,400
Ms. Meiling.

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,114
This is our club's proposal.

197
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
Please read it.

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,994
It is not done by me only.

199
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,714
This is the result of our
whole class working together.

200
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,714
Especially Weiwei.

201
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,808
She has helped a lot.

202
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,554
Mei Weiwei?

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,394
Yeah.

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,714
Isn't she going to change her major?

205
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,274
Why is she suddenly so
interested in rehabilitation activities?

206
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,794
Change her major?

207
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,234
Right.

208
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
She came to me in the
first week of the term.

209
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,280
She's running a club to gain her GPA.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,914
Ms. Meiling told me

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,714
you will change your major.

212
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Are you serious?

213
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,314
Monitor

214
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
I should tell you this sooner.

215
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,994
But I'm afraid that you
won't let me join the club

216
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
after I telling you this.

217
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,874
Don't worry.

218
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,354
Even if I change my major

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,914
I won't miss out on the club's work.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,634
It's not what I care about, Weiwei.

221
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,714
I have always thought

222
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,314
you were a good fit for our major.

223
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,594
All of us get along very well.

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,234
I thought you like Rehabilitation.

225
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,040
So you run the club with me.

226
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,394
Weiwei

227
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,914
Tell him the reason for changing major.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,040
You should give him a
chance to understand you.

229
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,394
I...

230
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,074
Weiwei

231
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,914
Is there something you're struggling with?

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
We all can help you.

233
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,674
I really hope

234
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,800
you can stay.

235
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,954
Monitor

236
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,674
Can we talk about this next time?

237
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,954
I'm in a hurry, I have to go now.

238
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Weiwei

239
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Weiwei

240
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,434
Mai Sichong

241
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,634
You have called me hundred times.

242
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,074
Are you the phone?

243
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,234
I'd like to do so.

244
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,760
Why don't you answer my calls?

245
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,714
Our monitor knows that I wanna
change my major and is angry with me.

246
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,144
How can I answer your calls?

247
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
So you were with Baihui.

248
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,544
What are you laughing about?

249
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,000
Nothing.

250
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,594
Come on.

251
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,160
Do electric shock training.

252
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,394
I don't run today.

253
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,074
Having finished exam just now,

254
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,408
I'll take you out to play.

255
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,312
Where are we going?

256
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
You just bring me out to shop?

257
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,354
I don't have much
experience with dating girls.

258
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
I don't know what I should do.

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,474
Bro.

260
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,794
We're not a dateable
relationship, you know?

261
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Mind your words.

262
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,560
Then what relationship are we?

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
We...

264
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
Not a dateable relationship anyway.

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,434
Weiwei

266
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,994
I don't think this cloth suit you.

267
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,400
You should buy something
with your features?

268
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,034
What are my features do you think?

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
Small.

270
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,954
What small?

271
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,354
Small figure.

272
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
Or what?

273
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,994
I'm not short.

274
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,194
Come with me.

275
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,274
I know a shop that would
be especially suitable for you.

276
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Come on.

277
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,432
It looks good, isn't it?

278
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,074
The moment I see you

279
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,840
I feel like I saw myself.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,394
It looks bad.

281
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,354
You don't know.

282
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,474
It is called BF style.

283
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,568
Wear what your boy...

284
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,714
Wear what your male friends

285
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,640
wear

286
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,904
I think you are cheating me.

287
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Wait.

288
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
Wear this, you'll be more handsome.

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,034
Why do you shock me again?

290
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,960
No, I don't.

291
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,114
If you want me to like you, just say so.

292
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,496
Why make electricity on me?

293
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,594
I haven't made electricity.

294
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,034
I haven't made electricity the whole day.

295
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,704
That was just static electricity.

296
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,600
The whole day?

297
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,080
It means you haven't made electricity

298
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,594
during the exam today?

299
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
No, I haven't.

300
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,480
You don't eat?

301
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,754
You are really strange today.

302
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,274
You either stare at me all the time

303
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,994
or you don't look at me at all.

304
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Do you have a fever?

305
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,034
Are you sure you haven't
shocked me the whole day?

306
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm sure.

307
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
Eat.

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Thanks.

309
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,794
If you're tired, take a
break in the meeting room.

310
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,120
No, thanks. Work now.

311
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,994
You went back to school
during lunch break today

312
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
to see Weiwei, right?

313
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,520
No wonder all the work
has been saved for tonight.

314
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,154
Well.

315
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,914
Just stay with me and work late.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,354
Well, I want to leave work early tomorrow.

317
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,360
So I have to finish
Mr. Zhang's assignment early.

318
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,240
I really envy you guys
who have girlfriends.

319
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,712
She is not my girlfriend yet.

320
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,960
You haven't told her yet?

321
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,034
As your friend, I have to warn you.

322
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,954
The past does not same as the present.

323
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,834
Although you have waited her for years,

324
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,520
she may not wait for you.

325
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,776
Alright, I understand.

326
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,480
Work now.

327
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,474
I overslept in this morning.
Why don't you wake me?

328
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,474
You came back too late yesterday.

329
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,074
I want you to sleep longer.

330
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,000
Weiwei

331
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,194
This is the breakfast Peng
Pai asked me to bring you.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,114
Thanks.

333
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,674
Bye-bye.

334
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,600
Bye-bye.

335
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,800
The young man really knows some tricks.

336
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,754
Hi, Mr. Peng

337
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,954
Weiwei

338
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,528
Are you available this weekend?

339
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,474
What's wrong?

340
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,021
I heard that a new
restaurant has opened near

341
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:21,754
our former high school
which is very good.

342
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,514
If you are available this weekend,

343
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,896
let's have dinner together.

344
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,514
Ok.

345
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,440
Bye-bye.

346
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,016
What does he tell you?

347
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,154
Let it go. Go to the class.

348
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,634
Does he ask you to meet him?

349
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
No.

350
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,194
Mai Sichong

351
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,154
Xia Rui

352
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,680
Good. Your grades are stable.

353
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,794
You are here today, Ding Yi?

354
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
I thought you were going
to swim until I retired.

355
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,634
Alright.

356
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,880
Have a rest here.

357
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,314
Chong

358
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,434
You haven't trained much lately.

359
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,314
And you hang out with others every day.

360
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,674
How did you progress so quickly?

361
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,554
I used to think I need extra effort

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,674
to swim faster.

363
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,794
But in fact, I don't need it.

364
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm a genius.

365
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,954
Don't believe him.

366
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,914
He's one of those good students
who stays up all night revising

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,360
and pretending he never tried.

368
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,754
Did he really train secretly?

369
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,394
Don't believe his nonsense.

370
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,714
He hangs out with Mei Weiwei everyday

371
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,074
and falls deeply in love.

372
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,114
So he is full of beans.

373
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,954
Didn't you hear the love song
he sang all night last night?

374
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,048
I can't believe that.

375
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,640
Weiwei

376
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,674
Why do you come?

377
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,994
Peng Pai just bought you a breakfast.

378
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,434
Then you become so obsessive.

379
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,360
Look at you!

380
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,800
He invited me to dinner.

381
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,480
Really?

382
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,674
I told you he must like you.

383
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,594
No way.

384
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
You think too much.

385
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,634
How could you think in this way?

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,794
Honey

387
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,274
He's been sending you
messages for four years.

388
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,634
If he doesn't like you,

389
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,034
why does he send you
little essays every day?

390
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,800
Don't tell me he wants to be a writer?

391
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,616
What's wrong with you?

392
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,720
Do you know the name of international
film star Zhang Ziyi's daughter?

393
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,714
What's her name?

394
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,634
Her name is Xingxing, which means wake up.

395
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,034
If you miss Peng Pai,

396
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,194
you may never meet

397
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,474
such a good and devoted man again.

398
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,120
There was nothing between us.

399
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,674
I mean

400
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,754
you just make sure you don't regret it.

401
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,954
If you have regrets,

402
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,634
give it a try

403
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,728
before it's too late!

404
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,440
Journalist

405
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,794
Do you and Ding Yi both
have memory problems?

406
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,114
My name is Li Daixi,

407
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,208
not named journalist.

408
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,514
There's something I'd like to trouble you.

409
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,394
Could you please call Weiwei?

410
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,394
She seems to be ill.

411
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
Weiwei is ill?

412
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,234
She has the disease of

413
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,424
not answering my calls.

414
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,856
Why are you coming for her?

415
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,480
Show your care?

416
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,600
You don't need to do so.
Peng Pai can company her.

417
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,674
Are they in a relationship?

418
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
Not now.

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,314
Maybe in the future.

420
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Bye.

421
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,234
Weiwei

422
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,034
This is their specialty.

423
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,960
Try it.

424
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,560
Ok.

425
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,154
Has anything happened at your school

426
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,080
recently?

427
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,594
Nothing new.

428
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,994
But there's a rumor that

429
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,160
a pervert has been stalking
girls at school recently.

430
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,074
How about

431
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,194
I pick you up later?

432
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,912
It's not safe for you to be alone.

433
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,074
No, thanks.

434
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,234
You have work to do.

435
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,434
And you are busy.

436
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,360
Don't do this.

437
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,760
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

438
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,314
Could you pick me up at the school gate?

439
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,714
I seem to be being followed.

440
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,920
Mr. Peng, I have something
in hurry, I have to go now.

441
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Weiwei

442
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,554
Hi.

443
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,714
Are you back at school,
Weiwei? I'll pick you up.

444
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,394
No. I'm out looking for Junjun.

445
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,314
She seems to be followed.

446
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
But I don't know where she is.

447
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,394
Jin Jun

448
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,194
It's me.

449
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,874
Xia Rui

450
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,208
A roommate of Mai Sichong.

451
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Why are you here?

452
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,234
You stalk me?

453
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,754
No no no.

454
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,394
Don't misunderstand me.

455
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,074
Here's the thing...

456
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,794
There was a psycho stalker at our school.

457
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,634
So I thought it was not safe for you

458
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,394
to go back to the dormitory alone.

459
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,968
I just want to escort you back.

460
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,634
But

461
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,240
I don't know you.

462
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,680
We have met before at
a Massage Club activity.

463
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,034
I know you are Weiwei's roommate.

464
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,034
And you are friends.

465
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,834
So

466
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,216
I just want to protect you.

467
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,480
But you take me as a bad guy.

468
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,274
Weiwei

469
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,914
Where are you now?

470
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,194
Tell me.

471
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,714
Then wait for me where you are.

472
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Don't run around!

473
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,594
Weiwei

474
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,194
Oh no.

475
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,800
Weiwei

476
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,240
Weiwei, say something!

477
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,474
Weiwei

478
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,400
Weiwei

479
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,554
Are you

480
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
all right?

481
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,954
It's not safe here.

482
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,674
Let's go.

483
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,434
Ok.

484
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,074
Let's go back.

485
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
Go.

486
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,154
I have a general idea

487
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,354
of the situation.

488
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,874
You saw this pervert

489
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,040
get beaten away.

490
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,514
Young girl,

491
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
you are pretty good.

492
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,554
How did you

493
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,594
beat this pervert

494
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
away?

495
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,600
I gave her an electric
baton for self-defense.
