2
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,480
He won't give up

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
until he recovers his level in high school.

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,520
How long?

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,440
0.4 seconds faster than that in last week.

6
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,520
Are you overtrained again?

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,320
The damage done to your legs could be permanent

8
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
if you don't rehabilitate them.

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,400
How can I join the provincial team next year

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,880
if the team leader knows I'm injured?

11
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Mei Weiwei

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,680
Please electrify me.

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
In fact,

14
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,120
I swim faster

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
not because of your electricity,

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
but because of you.

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,520
If you stay by my side,

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,160
I'll have more energy.

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,920
Someone reports that you take stimulants to resist the pain of injury.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
I can take a drug test at any time.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,720
Mom

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you so slow?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm so worried.

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,520
Mai

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Come on.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
What did leaders say?

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
Just ask me some basic questions.

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
Did they ask about your knee injury?

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
My knees recovered long ago.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
They allow good athletes to have had injuries.

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
What will the leaders do next?

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
What?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
Should be as usual.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
My son is fine.

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,640
Anyway, a drug test

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
will make everything clear.

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Mom, your thinking is exactly the same as Mr. Cai's.

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
It's a pity that you are not a leader.

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
Don't please me.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,560
I just wanna be the leader of you and your dad.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,640
Let's go.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,720
Let's take our son to dinner.

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
I don't go to the dinner.

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll be back to school.

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,560
Weiwei is waiting for me.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Bye.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
Our son goes to accompany his girlfriend.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you miss me?

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
No.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,080
All right.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
I didn't reply to your message

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,880
because I had something to do with the provincial team.

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't be angry, okay?

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,840
What happened to the provincial team?

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,360
Nothing.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,080
Just a trifle.

58
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Then you didn't reply?

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,080
You have some secrets?

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,240
It is impossible.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Forget it.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,200
I promise you

63
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
that I will reply to your message immediately.

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,720
I will reply even in my dream.

65
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
Blandishments.

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,560
All right.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Let's go to dinner.

68
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Buy you your favorite milk tea.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,360
Let's go.

70
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,360
Ding Yi

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
When will you tell them about our relationship?

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,360
What?

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,800
What do you mean?

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
Why do you say this all of a sudden?

75
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
We are not celebrities.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm quite shy.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,880
I heard that...

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Why are you shy?

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,520
Just tell them!

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,720
Or

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
you think it's humiliating to be with me?

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,880
What's humiliating?

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Chong, you back!

85
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
I heard from the provincial team that you...

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,800
Enjoy yourselves.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm full.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,760
I can't say clearly.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Go ahead and I'll talk to you later.

91
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,840
What is it?

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,000
Nothing.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Someone reported that

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
I used stimulants in the trials.

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,600
Report?

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Why do you tell me so late about such a serious matter?

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
I wanna say it while you're all there.

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Don't worry.

99
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
A drug test will make everything clear.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
Is it really that simple?

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Who is it?

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,120
Spam.

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Alright.

104
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,920
Don't worry and let's have dinner.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
I'll accompany you to the drug test.

106
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Weiwei

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,320
After the drug test,

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
how about going to the skating rink?

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,800
OK.

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
Then let's eat seafood

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,480
after skating.

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,920
Would you like shrimp or crab?

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,600
Both are good.

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
Then let's go to the cinema tonight.

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,160
I don't want that.

116
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm afraid I'll sleep again.

117
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,440
OK.

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,600
Why do you laugh?

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,280
I remind the last time we watched a movie with Peng Pai,

120
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,000
but you fell asleep.

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
I remind, too.

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Tell me honestly,

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
did you make trouble on purpose last time?

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,880
Of course.

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't let my future girlfriend go to the movies with another boy.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
I won't let it happen.

127
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,080
All right.

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,920
Behave yourself.

129
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,040
That's ok.

130
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
I'll go to the bathroom.

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,080
Is it your turn soon?

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,800
Weiwei

133
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
I won't take a drug test today.

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Why?

135
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,640
The leader of the provincial team just called me

136
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,160
to go to another hospital for drug test.

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
So suddenly!

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
Let's wait for the notice.

139
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,840
Where are we going now?

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Let's go out first.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
Weiwei

142
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,840
Why do you suddenly bring me to your home?

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
Your parents aren't at home?

144
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I just asked you where we went and you didn't answer me.

145
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,680
I saw you thinking about something

146
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
so I didn't bother you.

147
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
It just so happens that my parents aren't at home.

148
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
So I bring you here.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,640
You mean...

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,280
Maybe it's not a good idea for me to your home now?

151
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Don't think too much.

152
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
You're about to join the provincial team,

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,760
and you definitely don't eat well.

154
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,760
I just wanna cook you a meal.

155
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,920
You can read the books here.

156
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,640
Just a moment, I'll cook.

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,760
OK.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,960
If you don't want this video to be made public, don't take drug test.

159
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
Coming.

160
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,120
Mei Weiwei

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,480
I can't believe you can cook.

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
That's what my dad teaches me.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,440
Try it.

164
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,240
Is it delicious?

165
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,600
It's so delicious.

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,560
Really? Then eat more.

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
I must eat it all.

168
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Really?

169
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,720
Just a moment.

170
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,840
These are all yours, too.

171
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
So many dishes!

172
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,880
I think athletes should eat more,

173
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,240
so I did more.

174
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
These are all yours.

175
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,240
Try them.

176
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,080
OK.

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080
This one tastes better.

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
This is better than that.

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,880
Really?

180
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,200
Wait, I'll give you another surprise.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,480
Weiwei

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
Can I pack these dishes away?

183
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,680
Pack?

184
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,080
They are so delicious that I can't bear to eat them.

185
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll cook for you next time if you like it.

186
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
These are all yours.

187
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,480
It tastes better while it is hot.

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Please.

189
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I will watch you eating.

190
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,280
OK.

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
-So delicious. -Really?

192
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
Then finish it all.

193
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,000
These are all yours.

194
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,400
OK.

195
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,800
My mom says women are made of water.

196
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,600
I think women are made of salt water.

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,840
Forget it.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
It seems that I still have to learn how to cook.

199
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,200
Or we'll both starve to death sooner or later.

200
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,800
When I accidentally electrified others,

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,120
they would like me.

202
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Then this leads to misunderstandings.

203
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,560
But everyone thinks I deliberately seduce boys.

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
So they always point fingers at me.

205
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,960
Then I transferred to another school.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,920
Then I met Li Daixi.

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
So I can't let others know my secret under any circumstances.

208
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,280
Can you understand?

209
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,480
Give it back to me.

210
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Give it back to me.

211
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
Let me see where you are.

212
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Why is it so strange?

213
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,560
Why do you take graduation photos

214
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,760
by yourself?

215
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,040
I didn't dare to stay with others

216
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,240
after I changed the school.

217
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
So the graduation photo was taken by me.

218
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
You have suffered a lot because of electricity, right?

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,160
I used to find it quite disturbing.

220
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
But I feel okay now.

221
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,000
Because I meet you because of electricity.

222
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,400
Got it

223
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,640
What?

224
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I'll be better to you in the future.

225
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,840
By the way,

226
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,680
why were you suddenly notified to change hospital for drug test?

227
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,360
Didn't they inform you which hospital to go to next for drug test?

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Not yet.

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,600
But

230
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,680
they just look for a place where more items could be tested.

231
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,800
So don't worry about it.

232
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,040
Would you like some cake? There's more in the refrigerator.

233
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,960
Let me cut a piece for you.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
(Ms. Peipei is calling.)

235
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Daixi

236
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,760
Crabs.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,680
I don't eat.

238
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,200
Please go away.

239
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,800
Daixi

240
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,000
Can we have a word?

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,440
Ding Yi

242
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,000
Do we have a relationship?

243
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
Is there anything to say?

244
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,800
You're my girlfriend.

245
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
We certainly have something to say.

246
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,320
All right.

247
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,560
Please tell me

248
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,240
why don't you disclose our relationship?

249
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,640
Is it because I'm not good looking so I embarrass you?

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,120
No, absolutely not.

251
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,920
So you like someone else.

252
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,440
It's impossible.

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm not capable enough.

254
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,120
You are

255
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,920
Behave yourself.

256
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,480
my only girlfriend.

257
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,480
All right.

258
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,800
If you can give me a reason for that,

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
we'll continue to date.

260
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
I just feel...

261
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,320
I just feel I'm not good enough for you.

262
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,120
Chong

263
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,160
is the pride of the swim team.

264
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,720
Huihui is a master of health care.

265
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
Xia Rui is the best man.

266
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Only I

267
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
can't do anything.

268
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
All I know is eating.

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm last on the swim team.

270
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,600
I can't play the game well.

271
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm sure you don't like me.

272
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,520
Just

273
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
because of this?

274
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,320
That's not enough?

275
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,600
I think it's good to like to eat.

276
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
I also like to eat.

277
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,200
I already know you're last on the swim team.

278
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,160
I don't care.

279
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,080
Swimming slowly is better for body.

280
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
And you do

281
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
play the game badly.

282
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
But you're willing to play with me.

283
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I think you're especially good.

284
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Daixi

285
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,240
You do

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,760
have a bad taste.

287
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,560
Ding Yi

288
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,840
I try my best to compliment you.

289
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,760
How dare you say that?

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,760
Do you eat crab?

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,640
You shell the crab for me.

292
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
Taste it, too.

293
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,920
Is it delicious?

294
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Yes.

295
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,280
I glanced at her at the playground later,

296
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,520
and power resumed.

297
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,720
Power resumed?

298
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
What's wrong with you?

299
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Why didn't you tell me when coming back?

300
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,480
How is the test?

301
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
When will the result come out?

302
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,960
It'll take a while.

303
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,080
Not that fast.

304
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,960
You're right.

305
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,800
What about Weiwei?

306
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,320
Where did you go afterwards?

307
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,320
Why don't you bring her home for a meal?

308
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,080
I haven't seen her in over two months.

309
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,200
I really miss her.

310
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,480
Mom

311
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm tired. Good night.

312
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm gonna sleep.

313
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
You eat before you go to sleep.

314
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
You're the one who reports me anonymously, right?

315
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,400
Your purpose is to frame me,

316
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,080
so please don't hurt Weiwei.

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
(Ms. Peipei is calling.)

318
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,200
Who is it at this late hour?

319
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,440
Ms. Peipei?

320
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,000
Ms. Peipei

321
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
What's up?

322
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,880
Hello.

323
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
Is Mai Sichong there, please?

324
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,840
Yes.

325
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
I called him several times, but he didn't answer.

326
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,600
Mai Sichong didn't take a drug test.

327
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,920
He may

328
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,080
be expelled from school.

329
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,280
What?

330
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,360
What are you talking about?

331
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,920
Have you heard?

332
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
What happened to Chong?

333
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
My friend in the provincial team tells me

334
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,560
that Chong might not be able to join the provincial team.

335
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,320
I heard that he's reported cheating in the trials.

336
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
His ranking is false.

337
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,400
What?

338
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
You believe this kind of gossip?

339
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,520
Don't you know

340
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,560
Chong's ability in the team?

341
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,080
Does he need to cheat?

342
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,880
You're right.

343
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,240
But my friend said that Chong was absent from the drug test

344
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
for no reason.

345
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,560
The provincial team deems Chong guilty of cheating.

346
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,120
This is impossible.

347
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
This is true.

348
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,200
They all say that Chong is gonna be removed.

349
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,520
It's impossible.

350
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
Chong must be slandered.

351
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,800
Rui, do you hear that?

352
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
Please tell them that Chong is slandered.

353
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
I don't think this kind of news

354
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,760
can be believed, so don't spread rumors.

355
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Right.

356
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,320
Mai Sichong hasn't replied to your message yet?

357
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I always think he's a little strange recently.

358
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,520
Chong doesn't come to train today.

359
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,080
There's a rumor that he cheats.

360
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Others say he didn't take drug test.

361
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,720
He didn't answer my phone.

362
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
Something may have happened to him.

363
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,320
But don't tell Mei Weiwei about it yet.

364
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,760
I feel that Chong also has many things to deal with.

365
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,680
What's the matter?

366
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,280
Nothing.

367
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,320
That is, there are many rumors about Mai Sichong now.

368
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Don't think too much.

369
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,080
There are already rumors about him?

370
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Weiwei

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,760
When you and Mai Sichong went to a drug test,

372
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,520
he said the hospital was changed?

373
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,520
What's the matter?

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,360
Nothing.

375
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
I think there must be someone jealous of Mai Sichong.

376
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,560
But Ding Yi says that Mai Sichong will definitely be fine.

377
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
Don't worry too much.

378
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Please eat this steamed bun.

379
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
All right.

380
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,440
Ms. Peipei called me last night.

381
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Did you go to the hospital?

382
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,400
Yes.

383
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Did you get a drug test?

384
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,440
No.

385
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Mai Sichong

386
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,240
Do you know your situation?

387
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
The provincial team suspects you of cheating.

388
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,480
Doesn't it matter?

389
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Mom

390
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,040
I have my reason.

391
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
Can you stop asking?

392
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,720
How could you?

393
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,720
Dear

394
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,160
Your mother and I didn't take the drug test seriously

395
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,240
because we believed you.

396
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,760
But today your coach says you don't get the test.

397
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,000
So we don't understand.

398
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
Honey, I must ask you very seriously.

399
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Do you eat something?

400
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,080
It's impossible.

401
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,920
So why don't you get a drug test?

402
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
If you do take stimulants,

403
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,760
don't hide it from us and don't lie.

404
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
It doesn't matter if you do something wrong.

405
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,520
As long as you correct your mistakes, you are a good boy.

406
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
Swimming has always been my dream.

407
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
How could I possibly joke about it?

408
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
But as for the reason why I don't take the drug test,

409
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
I can't explain it now.

410
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
I have a clear conscience anyway.

411
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,240
There's nothing else to say.

412
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,960
Sichong

413
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,280
Your mother was a little angry just now.

414
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,520
Something she said is wrong.

415
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,800
Please forgive her.

416
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,280
Indeed.

417
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
We both trust you.

418
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,280
But it's useless for only us to believe you.

419
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,280
You need the trust of the provincial team.

420
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,520
The coach says it's a serious matter.

421
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
You may get a demerit

422
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,800
or even be fired. Do you know?

423
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,160
Anyway,

424
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
you just need to believe that I don't cheat.

425
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm full and I have to go.

426
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,120
Sichong

427
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Yang, your coffee, please.

428
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,440
Peng Pai

429
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,640
Has the matter about Mai Sichong been solved?

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,360
Mai Sichong?

431
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,040
What matter?

432
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,680
I met Mr. Cai at an activity the day before yesterday.

433
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
He told me that someone reported that Mai Sichong

434
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,640
cheated on doping in the trials.

435
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,920
You don't know?

436
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,880
Mai Sichong promised to do a drug test this Wednesday,

437
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,640
but he stood up for no reason.

438
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
This should be impossible, right?

439
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,520
I don't believe Mai Sichong would do such a thing.

440
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,200
He should just be stubborn.

441
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,520
You are his senior, so you should persuade him.

442
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,960
Okay, I'll ask him when I get back.

443
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,200
OK, I'll let you go.

444
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,520
Peng Pai, someone is waiting for you at the reception.
