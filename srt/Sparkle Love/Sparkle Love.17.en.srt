2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Vigorous boys.

3
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Nice

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
We should come here more often.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,480
It benefits for body circulation.

6
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,080
We didn't even take a picture.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,880
Let's take a picture!

8
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,440
Right.

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,360
Let's take a picture.

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,080
-Ok. -Ok.

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,960
Here

12
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,280
Rui

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,920
Go

14
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
You stand in front.

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,480
Your face is smaller.

16
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm not good at that.

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Come

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Am I in the picture?

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,080
What's this? I'll do it.

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Okay.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
One, two, three

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Cheese

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:23,800
Ok

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I seem to have closed my eyes.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Well

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Where shall we go next?

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm not going.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,080
Well, I

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,640
want to go home first.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,040
Have you bought the ticket?

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,720
I'll leave now.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,480
Ok, bye.

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,760
Bye

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
I'll also leave.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
I had a Comic-Con appointment with my friends.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, I'm leaving too.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm busy at the cafe.

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,560
Bye-bye.

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,440
Bye-bye.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,920
Then

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll go.

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Just say you want to go with her.

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,960
Right

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
They all leave?

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,520
Well

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,040
Daixi

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
Let's go to the mall.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,320
Let's go.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,080
Follow them.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Well

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
What is your wish?

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,560
I...

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
had a wish.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,760
Now...

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,520
What about you?

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,040
I...

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,360
didn't have before,

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,360
but now I have one.

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,120
Well

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,680
It seems quite a long way from the station.

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,120
How about I take a taxi home

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,200
and drop you off?

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm ok.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
I can walk there myself.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
And

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,320
don't worry.

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,280
I

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
will never meddle again.

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,800
You shall deal with Mai Sichong

71
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
on your own.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,320
I...

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,640
Do you need more pairs of shoes when you go to the provincial team?

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,360
Will one pair be enough?

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm going to leave.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't you want to

77
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
spend more time with me alone?

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,240
Your mind is dangerous now.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
I can't be alone with you.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,840
Or you always want to...

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
What does he want?

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,960
Eat!

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,520
He wants to eat.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,800
He's hungry.

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,000
Go find your Daixi.

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,760
Let's go.

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,480
How's it going?

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,680
Weiwei

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
Last night, you and Mai Sichong,

90
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,200
say,

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,200
what did you do?

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
Nothing, actually.

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,880
Then why are you blushing like that?

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,200
Mei Weiwei

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
You and Mai Sichong

96
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
How long have you been dating?

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
What?

98
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Does it take a long relationship to do

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,920
something like that?

100
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,800
That?

101
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
You guys!

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,920
You have to keep an eye on Mai Sichong for me.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,200
He is so...

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
He is Weiwei's first love.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,160
First love!

106
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Can't see?

107
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
People in love are just different.

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,280
Scram!

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,200
What do you think about all day?

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,560
What progress are you making with Mei Weiwei?

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,520
Daixi said you were so...

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Did you?

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Mei Weiwei

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,200
You two are so hurry.

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
How can you let him lead you by the nose?

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
You have to learn to control the pace yourself.

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
How do I control the pace of my relationship, Miss Li?

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,200
The most important point is that

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,720
if a girl says no, she means no.

121
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,280
You can't believe

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,200
all he says.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
But I'd love to.

124
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,960
You are obsessed with his good look so let him fool you around.

125
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Our Weiwei

126
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,360
was still a little girl whose underwear didn't fit yesterday.

127
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
He made you take off them today.

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,280
What?

129
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,920
It's not what you said. We didn't.

130
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,200
What were you thinking with Li Daixi?

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Come

132
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Come

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,440
-I and Mai Sichong -I and Mei Weiwei

134
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
just held hands

135
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,280
and nothing else.

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,800
just kissed.

137
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Only this?

138
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,640
What else?

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,240
It made you so happy

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
so I thought you two have done something.

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,120
What could we do?

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,320
Why Li Daixi asked me to keep an eye on you?

143
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,360
Didn't you two hold hands every day at school?

144
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,040
Too sweet.

145
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm not going to talk this with you. I'm going to find Ms. Meiling.

146
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,560
This winter vacation you and Rui will go to the provincial team to train.

147
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Huihui also moved out.

148
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,960
I don't even have an online game partner.

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll be left alone.

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Thank you.

151
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
You

152
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
Why are you working overtime with me?

153
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,160
I just want to find a place

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,240
to read a book.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,040
Yuxin

156
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,480
Do you have time?

157
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,880
Hello, Uncle.

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm Yuxin's classmate

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
and her monitor.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,560
I don't know what you're doing here today,

161
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,240
but

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
this is a public place.

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,640
Please

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,960
don't hit people

165
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,080
and don't swear.

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,760
Don't worry.

167
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
She is my daughter.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
I'll stay here.

169
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you doing here?

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,600
You haven't been home all winter vacation.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,680
I miss you.

172
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,600
I come to see you.

173
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,480
I've been so busy these years

174
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
and didn't take good care of you.

175
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,760
But it's all right now.

176
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,120
I resigned.

177
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Resigned?

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
I decided to leave the FT

179
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
and set up a cafe.

180
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll be free to take care of you.

181
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Yuxin

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
I was too impulsive that day.

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I am very regretful.

184
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
I am really regretful.

185
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
These days,

186
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
I thought about it for a long time at home.

187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
I didn't spend enough time with you.

188
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Even an independent girl

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
needs to be cared for

190
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,760
and looked after.

191
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,040
There is no remedy for the past.

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,400
But I vow

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
from now on

194
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I will try to be a good father.

195
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
Dad welcomes you home any time.

196
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm going to go.

197
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll come over to see you often.

198
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:09,960
Are you okay?

199
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Why are you going for so long?

200
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
Excuse me, manager.

201
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm still a little sick.

202
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,240
This is also the work.

203
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,960
You need to fight.

204
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,560
This project must be finalized tonight.

205
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
Manager, I've thrown up three times.

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I can't drink any more.

207
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,640
I don't understand that

208
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,080
you have followed Mr. Zhang for such a long time

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,960
and what have you learned?

210
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll only persuade you once that

211
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,800
don't end up like him,

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,120
being eliminated by this age.

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,520
This opportunity

214
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,560
is not available to everyone.

215
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,280
Mr. Li thinks so much of you.

216
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
You make him happy this time

217
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
and you only need to drink for one time.

218
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,400
Otherwise,

219
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,520
there's a second meal.

220
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Come on, cheers.

221
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
That's a nice guy.

222
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,720
Right.

223
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,680
You've done a good job this semester.

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I have asked teaching secretary.

225
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,840
Your GPA meets the requirements to change your major.

226
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Fill out the form and give it to me.

227
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,560
When is this due, teacher?

228
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,640
As soon as possible.

229
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,160
Weiwei

230
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
Have you determined which major to change?

231
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,640
No.

232
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,800
Why?

233
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,080
Don't want to change your major?

234
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,360
Mai Sichong is a swimmer.

235
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,920
You're his personal rehabilitator.

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,560
You can follow him wherever he goes to play games.

237
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,600
Isn't it very happy?

238
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,560
Thanks.

239
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,360
This is my personal rehabilitator Mei Weiwei

240
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,880
and she is the best rehabilitator in the world.

241
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,880
Of course,

242
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
she is also my favorite person.

243
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,680
Stop dreaming.

244
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
Don't you worry the fact that you are electriferous

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,480
been found out?

246
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,800
That's not true.

247
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,200
You are back.

248
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
Change major?

249
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,920
Weiwei, actually, I don't understand

250
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,560
why do you want to change your major while you are doing well in this major?

251
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,840
Do you think our major

252
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,440
is low?

253
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,120
No, no, no.

254
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I have other reasons.

255
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,760
Does Mei Weiwei live here?

256
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Someone is looking for you downstairs.

257
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,800
I'll go check it out then.

258
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,160
Auntie, I'm looking for Weiwei.

259
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,920
What grade are you in?

260
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,280
Such a heavy smell of alcohol.

261
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,720
No.

262
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,160
It's too late today.

263
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,480
I must see Weiwei today.

264
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Go back and talk it later.

265
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,640
Go back, come here tomorrow.

266
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,360
No matter anything.

267
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,480
Auntie

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Sorry, he is my friend.

269
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,200
He is drunk.

270
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,440
You are students now.

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
You can't drink so much wine.

272
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
So sorry.

273
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,400
All right, all right, take him back.

274
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Ok.

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,160
Why did you drink so much?

276
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,480
Walk slowly.

277
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,880
Are you going to find Weiwei again?

278
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
You are so sweet.

279
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
She will be angry if she feels hungry at night.

280
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
Slow down.

281
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Steps! Be careful!

282
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,160
Why did you drink so much?

283
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,520
It doesn't matter.

284
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,400
Is anyone in your dorm?

285
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,680
I'll ask them to pick you up.

286
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,400
Are you okay?

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,720
Hello. Weiwei.

288
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,600
Hello

289
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,720
Mai Sichong

290
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Pengpai got drunk, now I am...

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm telling you

292
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,560
Weiwei is mine.

293
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,200
You are nobody.

294
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
Do you know that?

295
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,480
What are you doing?

296
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
Hold it.

297
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
Here's the key chain you gave me.

298
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,680
I've been saving it.

299
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Take it!

300
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Fine.

301
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,960
I'll take it back.

302
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,840
I don't need you to take it back.

303
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,080
I need you to stay with me

304
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,960
You are drunk.

305
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,080
I'll buy you a bottle of water to cool off.

306
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
You clearly like me.

307
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,640
Why has you changed now?

308
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
Why can't we be together?

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Weiwei

310
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,880
Only I am true to you.

311
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
Mai Sichong just focuses on swimming.

312
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Let me go.

313
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,400
Forget it!

314
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Mai Sichong

315
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,560
Don't let me see you again.

316
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,200
Just now...

317
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,480
Do you feel hurt now?

318
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,160
It's okay.

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
Mai Sichong

320
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,520
Are you angry

321
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
for my meddling?

322
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
I am angry

323
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,880
but not because of you.

324
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,040
I am angry

325
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,120
why can't I run faster.

326
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,640
I am angry

327
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
why can't I always be by your side.

328
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
I am angry, as your boyfriend,

329
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
why do I still let you feel miserable?

330
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Weiwei

331
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,560
I'm about to leave for the provincial team.

332
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,280
I hope that

333
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,000
you can tell me all your emotions.

334
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,480
I am your strongest support.

335
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,080
What?

336
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
You come to my company specially to hit me.

337
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
Don't use any reason to approach Mei Weiwei.

338
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
Otherwise, I will not spare you!

339
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
I would do anything for her.

340
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,280
As you know,

341
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I have a lot of memories with her that you don't know.

342
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,680
I didn't come here to listen to your bullshit.

343
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,360
I just want to tell you

344
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
from now on

345
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
to stay away from Mei Weiwei.

346
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Do you hear me?

347
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,080
Who says I can't like her?

348
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,280
Like

349
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
What is like?

350
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,440
You don't need a junior to teach you, do you?

351
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Mai

352
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,760
When you get to the provincial team,

353
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
you need control your temper.

354
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,960
You're new there, so try to get along well with people.

355
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Do you know that?

356
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,960
Yes, I do.

357
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
And at night,

358
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
after lights out,

359
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,720
you just sleep well and don't play the phone secretly.

360
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,440
Got it. Got it.

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
Your mother's trying to move the whole family to you.

362
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
Okay, mom, that's enough.

363
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
I don't want this, either.

364
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,400
When the classmates see it, they will laugh at me again.

365
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
Why?

366
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
All right, all right, that's it.

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,360
I'm leaving.

368
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Don't you dislike durian candy?

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,000
Now I actually think

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,840
it's okay.

371
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,360
Get out of you.

372
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
Go, go

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Go

374
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,240
Then I'm leaving.

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Be careful on the way.

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,560
Bye-bye.

377
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
How did you know I was here?

378
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,080
You are childish. How could I not hear such a loud noise?

379
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,960
Some people are so old but still eat durian candy.

380
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't you childish?

381
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
I know you like it.

382
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,120
Don't you like it?

383
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,480
Right

384
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
Such delicious durian candy,

385
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,920
it's a pity to give you to eat.

386
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm the right one to eat.

387
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
You are childish, okay?

388
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,240
I am leaving.

389
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,760
Go.

390
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,200
What？

391
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,400
Remember to give me a video call every day when you get there.

392
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
Report your daily schedule to me.

393
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,240
Got it.

394
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
Eating well.

395
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,600
Sleeping well.

396
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,040
Training well.

397
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,760
You youngsters. Are you still going?

398
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay.

399
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,880
Just go.

400
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,960
Bye-bye.

401
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
Don't worry.

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll be back soon.

403
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,920
I am leaving.

404
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,120
Just go.

405
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
Bye-bye.

406
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
I tell you on behalf of the coach

407
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
during the closed training

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
communication equipment must be handed in uniformly.

409
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
At the end of each day's training

410
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
we will give out cell phones.

411
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,720
There will be an hour

412
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to contact

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
your family and girlfriend.

414
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
The rest of the time,

415
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,320
no distraction.

416
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,600
Hand over your phones.

417
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,800
Your phone?

418
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
I don't have my phone with me.

419
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,240
Don't have your phone?

420
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Give me your phone.

421
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,200
Give me.

422
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,680
Everyone

423
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,800
goes back to bed early.

424
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,840
Fall out.

425
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,360
Have you been to the provincial team?

426
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,840
How about your teammates?

427
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
Does Xia Rui share the dormitory with you?
