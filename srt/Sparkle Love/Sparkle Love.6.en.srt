2
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,374
Weiwei isn't really
into that kind of movie.

3
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,694
So it's natural for her to fall asleep.

4
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,734
At 6:30 tomorrow morning.

5
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,660
Don't forget.

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,574
You have plans tomorrow?

7
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,854
We have class tomorrow.

8
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,894
Why don't I walk you back?

9
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,820
No, thank you.

10
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,260
Mai Sichong

11
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,654
Pikachu

12
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,614
You are late.

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,054
I'm only a little late.

14
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,494
You shouldn't have set the time so early.

15
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,260
Look at the dark circles around my eyes.

16
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,054
Are you sleepy?

17
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,436
Play basketball to wake up.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,254
I won't play basketball with you.

19
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,934
Give you electricity, quickly.

20
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm gonna go.

21
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,740
Pikachu, are you broken down?

22
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,254
Who's broken down?

23
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,214
Maybe another time.

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,220
I'm really sleepy.

25
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,500
Wait a minute.

26
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,780
What's up?

27
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,614
If you can grab the ball from me,

28
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,660
I'll let you go.

29
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
I won't do that.

30
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,180
Peng Pai

31
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,294
Mei Weiwei

32
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,134
You carry so much

33
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,140
static electricity.

34
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,860
I have to go.

35
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,334
Why are you calling me now?

36
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,260
Chong

37
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,094
Mr. Fan in Students' Association
Union is a teammate's fellow townsman.

38
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,254
I have an appointment
with him this afternoon

39
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,374
in the lounge.

40
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,300
I got it.

41
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,300
There you are.

42
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,654
In my view,

43
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,854
your teammate

44
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,454
likes to put on airs, right?

45
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,900
Then why are you here today?

46
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,574
Xiang

47
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,374
It is only you that can find a solution.

48
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,814
My friend wants to start an association

49
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,436
and needs you to sign the paper.

50
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,774
Sign the paper?

51
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,700
I can do this.

52
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,756
But you have to apologize first.

53
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,254
He's got a sore throat.

54
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,934
I'll apologize for him.

55
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,460
It has nothing to do with you.

56
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,420
This is this and that is that.

57
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,014
I'm a person who

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,780
always separates
private affairs from work.

59
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,300
An apology will get your signature?

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,814
I have

61
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,334
a bad temper.

62
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,774
In case I lose out and
can't get the signature.

63
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,012
And I'll accidentally...

64
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,894
Xiang

65
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,134
Calm down.

66
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,094
Chong means that

67
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,814
he hopes you directly
say what you want to do.

68
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,374
Let's make friends.

69
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,300
Make friends.

70
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,940
Okay.

71
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,894
Recently, the Students' Association Union

72
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,574
hasn't been able to find sponsors.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,974
So there is a gap of twenty thousand yuan.

74
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,660
I heard that Sichong lives in a
villa at the foot of the mountain.

75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,614
So this matter will depend on you.

76
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,454
You're way out of line, aren't you?

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,380
Okay.

78
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,254
OK.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,454
If you help me,

80
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,174
our conflict

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,054
will get past.

82
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,980
OK?

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,294
So

84
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,724
You have already known that.

85
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,374
When we were in high school,

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,414
I walked by your class once

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,380
and saw you charging your video game.

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,534
Mai Sichong knows that?

89
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,534
He does.

90
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,294
But he won't tell anyone.

91
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,628
Is he worthy of your trust

92
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,100
just because he has feelings for you?

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,820
I accidentally get him electrified.

94
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,054
My electricity

95
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,260
can create the illusion
of love at first sight.

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,140
So he will...

97
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,694
Anyway, when he gets sober,

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,932
he'll figure it all out.

99
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,534
So that's why other students

100
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,580
misunderstood you in high school.

101
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,934
But that's okay.

102
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,860
It's all over.

103
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,374
Peng Pai

104
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,374
You have work to do, right?

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,374
You're so busy.

106
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,374
I also have some things to do,

107
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,614
so I'm going back.

108
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,540
Bye.

109
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,374
You tell your senior all about it.

110
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,014
He already knew.

111
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,454
He pays so much attention to you.

112
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,174
He and I were in the
same middle school before.

113
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,654
He's my senior.

114
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,494
But

115
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,020
we never saw each other again.

116
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,814
Think about it,

117
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,494
is it possible that only you
think you keep your secrets well?

118
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,734
Actually, everyone

119
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,614
knows you're a Pikachu.

120
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,414
Come on.

121
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,894
Do you think everyone is just like you?

122
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,660
You spread the word about
my electricity everywhere.

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,134
Don't worry.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,774
I won't tell anyone.

125
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
If anyone else finds
out, I'll protect you.

126
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,654
If someone dares to bully you,

127
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
I'll bully him back.

128
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,814
We are not familiar with each other.

129
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,740
What's wrong?

130
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,414
Have you guys been asleep?

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,254
Not yet.

132
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,654
No.

133
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,460
I have one thing to ask you.

134
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,254
Many years ago,

135
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,494
I had some conflicts with a senior.

136
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,180
We met again recently.

137
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,294
I don't know what kind of
attitude should be used to face him.

138
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,374
Weiwei

139
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,260
I'm not very good at this either.

140
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
Do you like him?

141
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,054
No.

142
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,014
Well, if you don't
like him, just tell him.

143
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,734
The longer this thing
goes on, the worse it gets.

144
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,620
And you won't know
what to say at that time.

145
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,534
Here.

146
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,854
Drink it.

147
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,774
Mom

148
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,534
Why do you enter my room without knocking?

149
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,654
You didn't tell me when you came back.

150
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,574
Let me ask you something.

151
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,900
Does your knee hurt?

152
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,654
It's okay.

153
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,748
You can rest assured.

154
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Come on, drink it.

155
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,454
Mom

156
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,534
What about

157
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,300
you teaching me how to read account book?

158
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,934
Previously,

159
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,134
I suspected the chairman of Students'
Association Union misreported money,

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,614
so I asked my roommate to
get an account book of the Union.

161
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,500
I can't read it. You
take a look at it for me.

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,574
When did my son start being so nosy?

163
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,020
Is it related to Weiwei?

164
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,494
No.

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,894
Just for the sake of

166
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
justice

167
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,054
For justice.

168
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,334
Learn by yourself.

169
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,260
Mom

170
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,214
Yes.

171
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,454
I told you.

172
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,380
You lie to me.

173
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,134
Mai Sichong

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,276
What's wrong with you?

175
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,356
Why are you doing so badly?

176
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,820
Look at the dark circles around your eyes.

177
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,414
What did you do last night?

178
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,614
You all did not follow

179
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,214
the schedule.

180
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,174
Coach

181
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,140
Chong didn't return to
the dormitory last night.

182
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,934
Play.

183
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,974
Still play?

184
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,454
Cheer up, all of you.

185
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,414
You two,

186
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,134
today,

187
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,894
twenty laps.

188
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,734
You can't eat

189
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,254
until you finish swimming.

190
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,094
Coach

191
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,428
What's the matter with me?

192
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,540
I'll swim.

193
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll do that.

194
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,374
Rui

195
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,334
Coach punished us. Why
do you swim twenty laps?

196
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,374
I don't do as well as Chong,
so I have to work harder.

197
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,654
Chong

198
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,094
Why do you ask me to check
the account book of the Union?

199
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,860
Is there something wrong with Mr. Fan?

200
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,694
I studied with my
mother all night last night.

201
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,694
Fan Zengxiang

202
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,180
must have embezzled the money
of Students' Association Union.

203
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,380
You stayed up all night for this?

204
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,854
But it is true that

205
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,934
Fan Zengxiang is such an asshole.

206
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,214
What's wrong with Mr. Fan?
Did he ask you for money?

207
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,894
He harms the collective
interests. I can't bear him.

208
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,294
Well, you have a good sense of justice.

209
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,574
That's not true.

210
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,334
Chong

211
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,260
does this for women.

212
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,014
Ms. Meiling

213
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,054
Would you please

214
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,340
have the paper stamped?

215
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,374
I can't do this.

216
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,054
You must ask the chairman of Students'
Association Union to sign it first.

217
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,700
I won't stamp until he signs it.

218
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,614
Ms. Meiling

219
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,734
Just help us.

220
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,854
We have already contacted

221
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,294
the Students' Association Union.

222
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,374
Then contact again.

223
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,254
Communicate and coordinate with them.

224
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,900
I have delegated power to the
Student Affairs Office of the Union

225
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,454
But we have already
communicated with them...

226
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,654
OK.

227
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,894
If you don't have any other questions,

228
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,820
I'll go for class

229
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,524
What should we do?

230
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,894
That's OK.

231
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,454
I will

232
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,454
contact the chairman of the Union again.

233
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,380
Leave it to me.

234
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,700
Move a little to the right. It's crooked.

235
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,214
Hello.

236
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,414
Why don't I help you?

237
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,574
What's the matter with you two?

238
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,860
Can't you do this trifle?

239
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,700
What happened that day was my fault.

240
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,334
Why don't you...

241
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,374
Why is a fly here?

242
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,700
Get the buzzing fly away.

243
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,934
Please approve my application form.

244
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,414
I don't want to...

245
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,036
The poster is up, and I'm going.

246
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,374
What?

247
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,934
What are you doing?

248
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,734
I'm sorry, Mr. Fan.

249
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,054
Are you all right?

250
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,254
Xixi

251
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,014
I'm okay.

252
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,494
Are you scalded?

253
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,374
No.

254
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,094
Are you really okay?

255
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,214
It's all right.

256
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,334
It's okay if you aren't scalded.

257
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,014
I'm leaving.

258
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Bye bye.

259
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,780
You shouldn't have bullied Mei Weiwei.

260
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,894
Foolish Mei Weiwei

261
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,214
is so coward.

262
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,254
Fool.

263
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,180
Li Daixi

264
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,254
You did that on purpose.

265
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,396
None of your business.

266
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,254
It's not surprising.

267
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,894
The way the senior
with glasses stares at you

268
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,420
makes me want to kick his ass.

269
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,454
But why do you fall out with him?

270
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,014
Did you do this

271
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,494
for Weiwei, just like Chong?

272
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,020
What's wrong with Mai Sichong?

273
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,814
The senior with glasses bullied
Weiwei for applying for association.

274
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,454
Chong even fought for that.

275
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,854
A man in love.

276
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Hold on, wait.

277
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,414
Mei Weiwei wants to run an association?

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,540
You share a dormitory
with her. Don't you know it?

279
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,774
Interesting.

280
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,174
Li Daixi

281
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,294
Have you not eaten yet?

282
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,654
Let's go.

283
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,854
I'll take you to dinner.

284
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,414
No.

285
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,700
I want to lose my weight.

286
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,974
Weiwei

287
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,740
What's going on with you and Li Daixi?

288
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,174
She avenged you today.

289
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,214
She followed the senior like a pervert,

290
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,014
just to splash him with water.

291
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,534
you two just make up.

292
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,140
She looks sad.

293
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,214
Weiwei

294
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,308
Yuxin, there you are.

295
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,454
I'd like to order a
strawberry cake for someone.

296
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,014
Okay.

297
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,574
You write the name and phone
number of the person here.

298
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,500
OK.

299
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,220
Give it to me.

300
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,134
What's the matter?

301
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,820
Come to Avatar Square.

302
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,894
Mom

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,254
Look at the mural.

304
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,734
This is also the work of the chairman
of the Students' Association Union.

305
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,614
It won't cost much, right?

306
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,814
You regard your mother
as Baidu, don't you?

307
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,094
It looks very cheap.

308
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,374
This kind of acrylic paint is cheap.

309
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,300
Mai Sichong

310
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,004
Why are you sneaking around?

311
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,174
Just do something big for you.

312
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,774
But

313
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,156
you don't have to thank me.

314
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,254
Why did you call me out?

315
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,180
Oh.

316
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,540
This is for you.

317
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,014
How do you get this?

318
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,854
There is no this near our university.

319
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,054
Never mind how I get it.

320
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,254
Try it.

321
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,180
Thanks.

322
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,054
Why are you looking at me?

323
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,148
No, I didn't do that.

324
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,460
Do you want to drink milk tea?

325
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,180
No, I don't.

326
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,254
This milk tea

327
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,254
is sweet and tasty.

328
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,734
But someone

329
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,774
is an athlete.

330
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,134
So he can't drink it.

331
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,774
What if he needs to rush
to the pool after drinking it?

332
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,620
What if his grades
decline after drinking it?

333
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,134
I just drink it. What's the matter?

334
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,534
I'll show you today that

335
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,700
I can still break the record
after drinking milk tea.

336
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,134
Why don't you lift the lid?

337
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,540
How can I drink it?

338
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,860
Weiwei

339
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,254
Can you buy your own
milk tea if you want to drink?

340
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,260
Don't drink mine.

341
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,734
Why do you eat something
that tastes strange like durian?

342
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Don't bother me.

343
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,734
All right, I'm wrong.

344
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,974
You win.

345
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,614
Good, you admit you are
wrong. Don't come to me later.

346
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm very busy.

347
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,974
Why can't I look for you?

348
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,540
Aren't we friends?

349
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,980
Friends?

350
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,734
But what we eat

351
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,454
and play

352
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,534
is different.

353
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,900
How can we be friends?

354
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,020
Now we are friends.

355
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,340
If you say so.

356
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,734
Okay.

357
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,254
Drink milk tea with me next time.

358
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm leaving.

359
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,494
Hello.

360
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,972
I'm here to pick up the cake.

361
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Wait a moment.

362
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,734
Your cake.

363
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,660
Thank you.

364
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,294
May I ask

365
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,854
who ordered it for me?

366
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,894
I'm sorry.

367
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,100
The customer didn't leave
the reservation information.

368
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,460
The cake is tasty.

369
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,454
Ding Yi

370
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,534
Giving girl cakes

371
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,460
is old-fashioned.

372
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,334
But since you cater to my likes,

373
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,260
I accept it.

374
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:17,814
What?

375
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,454
Stop.

376
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,134
What are you talking about?

377
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,974
The cake.

378
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Didn't you buy it for me?

379
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,614
I,

380
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,374
Ding Yi,

381
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,414
buy you a cake?

382
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,294
Why should I do that?

383
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,734
If the cake tastes
bad, I'll buy it for you.

384
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,454
Stop acting.

385
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,694
I know

386
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,214
I must look dreamy and beautiful

387
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,854
to you right now.

388
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,620
But you'd better restrain yourself.

389
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,774
What? Li Daixi.

390
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,254
How can you talk nonsense?

391
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,134
You look dreamy?

392
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,334
I think you must sleep too much.

393
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:46,934
You...

394
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,774
In my opinion,

395
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,814
you buy this cake yourself

396
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,294
and want me to be the scapegoat.

397
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm not foolish.

398
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,014
Daixi

399
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,014
You come for the cake.

400
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,734
Yuxin

401
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,334
I don't want this cake.
You can throw it away.

402
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,774
Are you still mad at Mei Weiwei?

403
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,854
You even throw the cake
that she bought for you?

404
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,294
She always sighs in the dormitory.

405
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,060
You should be reconciled with her quickly.

406
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,414
Did Weiwei

407
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,934
buy this cake for me?

408
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,814
Yeah.

409
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
Do you still want to throw it away?

410
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,654
Throw what?

411
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
It's a shame.

412
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,780
Your cake.

413
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,974
Fan Zengxiang

414
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,900
It's done.

415
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,094
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,134
I'm careless

417
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,254
and drop it on the floor.

418
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,014
Maybe

419
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,734
you can sweep the floor again.

420
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,374
Fan Zengxiang

421
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,254
The university appoints you
chairman to serve everyone,

422
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,060
not to give you a reason to
domineer here and enjoy yourself.

423
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,534
Is it your turn to tell me what to do?

424
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,460
What do you mean?

425
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
What do you mean?

426
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,140
Peng Pai

427
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,894
Mei Weiwei

428
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,614
You are the same as the rumor outside.

429
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,134
So many men back you up.

430
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,340
The former chairman of the
Student Union is also here.

431
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,356
You are Fan Zengxiang.

432
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,614
How long do you think you can
stay in Students' Association Union?

433
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,454
You are just a former chairman.

434
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,694
Can you take charge of
the Association Union?

435
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,364
Your business is out of my hands.

436
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,054
But I'm going to

437
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,004
mind her business.

438
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,140
All right.

439
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,860
You'll see.

440
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,180
Weiwei

441
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,054
Why are you mad at him?

442
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,436
There's no need to do that.

443
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,934
It's okay.

444
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,854
That's the way he is.

445
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm used to it.

446
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,436
Your favorite pineapple flavour.

447
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,980
Thank you.

448
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,100
You got a minute?

449
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,894
I mean,

450
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,214
if you got a sec

451
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,980
can you accompany me to the library?

452
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,454
Sure.

453
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,380
Let's go.

454
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,220
Ms. Meiling

455
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,660
Take a look at this.

456
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,214
What is this?

457
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,100
It's the account book of Students'
Association Union that I sorted out.

458
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,140
How can there be such
a terrible book account?

459
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,494
The university is a place
for students to study.

460
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,854
How could they make such a mess?

461
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,494
I don't expect the chairman
of Students' Association Union

462
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
to do such a thing.

463
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,454
Mai Sichong

464
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,054
Thank you for reporting this.

465
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,340
I will take it seriously.

466
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,814
Hello, Weiwei.

467
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,534
I have a piece of good news for you.

468
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,014
Sichong

469
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,174
I'm Peng Pai.

470
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,294
Weiwei falls asleep.

471
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
Or I'll...

472
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,734
Peng Pai

473
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,734
Thank you for today.

474
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,174
I'll go back.

475
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,100
Wait a minute.

476
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,580
This is for you.

477
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,214
You have helped me...

478
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,220
Open it.

479
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,894
I buy this especially for you.

480
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,694
I don't know whether you like it or not.

481
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,734
Actually, I bought a pair
of gloves in high school.

482
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,654
But I lost them and
didn't deliver them to you.

483
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,174
I finally found gloves of the same color.

484
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,940
It seems that I find my lost gloves.

485
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460
Mei Weiwei

486
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,934
Why are you here?

487
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,094
I'm waiting for you.

488
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,188
I almost fall asleep.

489
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,694
Pikachu

490
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,620
It's time for you

491
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,140
to see me.

492
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,380
See you?

493
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,134
Right.

494
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,134
It's time.

495
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,900
We have something to do. We have to go.

496
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,500
Where did you go with Peng Pai today?

497
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,588
Why did he say you were asleep?

498
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,094
In the library.

499
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,334
I felt sleepy then fell asleep.

500
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,620
Library?

501
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,180
You didn't tell him our secret, did you?

502
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,660
How can I tell others your secret?

503
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,774
Yeah.

504
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,614
I have something to tell you.

505
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,948
The senior with glasses...

506
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,100
What?

507
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,940
Give me back.

508
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,894
Don't be naive.

509
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,254
Give it back to me.

510
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,180
I won't.

511
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,740
Peng Pai wouldn't be so petty as you.

512
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,780
Would you grow up?

513
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,276
Is it raining outside?

514
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,854
Peng Pai wouldn't be so petty as you.

515
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,140
Would you grow up?

516
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
What are you doing?

517
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,454
It was your left knee that

518
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,734
got injured, right?

519
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,094
How do you know that?

520
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,534
I tried to save a child.

521
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,134
It was an accident.

522
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,774
Do you have any secret?

523
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,174
In fact, it's not really a secret.

524
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,892
I saved a man with my electricity.

525
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,940
After that, I find it's actually
cool to have electricity.
