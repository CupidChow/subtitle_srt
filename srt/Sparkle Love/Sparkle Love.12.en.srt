2
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,340
Give me back

3
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,900
Why did you steal the
medical examination report?

4
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,094
Keep your voice down.

5
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,094
It's not stealing.

6
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,734
I just borrow it.

7
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,940
You call it borrowing?

8
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,220
Don't mind the details.

9
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,900
If it wasn't for you, I would
have already returned it.

10
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,934
Tell me honestly,

11
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
why did you do this?

12
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't want people to see my report.

13
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,094
What if the school,

14
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,854
and especially the provincial
team, knew about my knee problem

15
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
and dropped me?

16
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,940
Your knee...

17
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,780
It's ok now, don't worry.

18
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,054
Come on with me.

19
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,974
What are you doing?

20
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,014
Return the medical report first anyway.

21
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,654
Go!

22
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm still sick.

23
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,940
Return it anyway.

24
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,894
Does it have to be now?

25
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,614
Of course.

26
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,574
Don't you know how serious it is?

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,494
I don't have the key.

28
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,894
And Ding Yi is not here.

29
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,036
Tell me how to get in?

30
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,500
Open it.

31
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,420
You can do this!

32
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,094
What if you break it?

33
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,614
No problem.

34
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,996
Someone fixed it last time.

35
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,100
Last time?

36
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,340
It's not your first time here?

37
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,014
Well.

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,654
I heard it from others in
Students' Association Union.

39
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,580
I promise.

40
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,756
The guy seems to have gone.

41
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,060
That was scaring.

42
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,140
Let's hurry up and put
the medical report back.

43
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,980
Were you in the information room that day?

44
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,614
No.

45
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,140
Luckily it wasn't anyone else.

46
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,334
Your porridge.

47
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,260
Thanks.

48
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,654
Why are you looking at me?

49
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,580
Eat.

50
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,374
Mai Sichong

51
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,174
You really don't want to know

52
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,580
why I followed you before?

53
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,134
Will you expose me
after knowing my secret?

54
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,214
Of course not.

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,574
Done.

56
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,894
You chose to trust me

57
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,614
and told me your secret
that you have electricity.

58
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,020
Now I choose to trust you.

59
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,174
Alright, let's

60
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,494
make this thing done here.

61
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,260
Don't think about it anymore, okay?

62
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,180
Eat.

63
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,220
It tastes great.

64
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,174
By the way,

65
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,374
we are two weeks away
from the school sports day.

66
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,334
There are only four
players from our class.

67
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,854
So there are not many group
events we can participate in.

68
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,654
So the only event we could participate
in was the 4*100m mixed relay.

69
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,614
All of you will be attending, right?

70
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,494
I...

71
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,860
Of course not.

72
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,380
This is a great opportunity
to show our class power.

73
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,774
Weiwei

74
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,094
Say something.

75
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,020
I won't go.

76
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,054
Baihui

77
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,196
Do you have free time?

78
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,820
What's up?

79
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,894
Could you give me some extra lessons?

80
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,414
I want to learn something
about rehabilitation.

81
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,534
Especially something about the meniscus.

82
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,814
But...

83
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,800
The knee meniscus is something we
won't be learning about until next term.

84
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,694
I just wanted to get a brief overview.

85
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,694
Then I'll put together
a lesson plan later.

86
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,374
All of us can take a tutorial.

87
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,694
And we can talk about the sports day.

88
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,334
I'm not interested in the sports day.

89
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,974
But I can buy everyone coffee.

90
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,020
Thank you, Yuxin.

91
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,660
Eat. Eat.

92
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
Thank you, Yuxin.

93
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,540
I know. No sugar.

94
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,934
What's this?

95
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,614
This?

96
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,374
Don't you want to learn
about knee rehabilitation?

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,894
So we're going to start
with the basics today.

98
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,174
I'll give you a few acupoints that
can help with knee rehabilitation today.

99
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,334
The Weizhong acupoint and Weiyang acupoint

100
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,414
are very helpful for knee rehabilitation.

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,054
Besides these... Let me see.

102
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,814
This one.

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,334
Chengjiang acupoint.

104
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,174
It is not located in the knee,

105
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,614
but

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,940
acupuncture at these three acupoints...

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,380
Shaochong acupoint.

108
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,420
Here.

109
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,060
No. No.

110
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,054
Oh my god.

111
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,054
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,094
You are learning more
seriously than before.

113
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,134
I have to learn it sooner or later.

114
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,574
But you said you'll change your major.

115
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,380
Why are you so devoted now?

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,620
Whatever.

117
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,294
In my view,

118
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,694
this major has gone to your head.

119
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,854
Isn't it good to be a sports agent

120
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,948
with Senior Peng Pai?

121
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,894
I don't think I can handle this.

122
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,534
I have gone to their company.

123
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,694
All the women in their company

124
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,134
are like this.

125
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,134
I can't do that.

126
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,454
I think it's good to learn massage.

127
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,574
For example, our monitor Lin Baihui.

128
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,052
He is also very accomplished.

129
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,934
However,

130
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,460
I'm not sure if I can do well.

131
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,780
Your class monitor is
too good at brainwashing.

132
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,134
Hello!

133
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,774
It is not brainwashing!

134
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,094
It is good to have a dream.

135
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,214
By the way,

136
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,334
the future of the rehabilitation
is quite promising.

137
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,380
It's just that there are
fewer of us in our major.

138
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,934
Oh my god.

139
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,774
Lin Baihui is awesome.

140
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,494
No one wanted to study at
the beginning of the school year.

141
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,454
But now,

142
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,860
you're all competing to be a
member of the study committee.

143
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,254
As for me, I'm just going
to do sports journalism.

144
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,374
It's what I've been doing and
I get chance to see cute guys.

145
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,174
And I can watch different kinds of games.

146
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Three in one.

147
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,414
How about Junjun?

148
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,180
What do you want to do in the future?

149
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,614
Me?

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,814
I haven't considered about it.

151
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,574
I may follow my parents' arrangement.

152
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,340
I won't follow my parents' arrangement.

153
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,334
Anyway, we are only in our first year.

154
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,654
It's too early to think about this.

155
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,134
Sleep now.

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,534
Right.

157
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,500
Otherwise we'll all have
swollen faces tomorrow.

158
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,494
Good night.

159
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
Good night.

160
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,814
What's wrong with you lately?

161
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,148
Look at your dark circles.

162
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,988
Drink this. Get some nutrition.

163
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,580
Do you generate a lot of
electricity and consume too much?

164
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,854
To treat your leg,

165
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,620
I've been reading until midnight recently.

166
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,300
I'm also studying acupuncture.

167
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,100
Nonsense.

168
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,974
It's true.

169
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,164
Look at these pinholes.

170
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,934
Trick you!

171
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,900
Childish!

172
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,774
Although I haven't learn acupuncture,

173
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,980
it's true that I read
until midnight for you.

174
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,700
However, it's not enough to help you.

175
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
I know you can't.

176
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,894
I can't?

177
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,494
But I know one can help you.

178
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,614
My monitor, Lin Baihui.

179
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,934
He comes from a family of rehabilitators.

180
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,268
He can certainly help you.

181
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,260
No.

182
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,940
What if he gives me a
massage and knows I'm hurt?

183
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,740
You are right.

184
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,694
Hi?

185
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,134
Chong, where are you?

186
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,454
Convenience store. What's up?

187
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,500
Things went wrong.

188
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,820
Xia Rui

189
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,694
What do you do

190
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,094
for calling me here?

191
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,094
I

192
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,054
ran into this on the way here

193
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,614
Then

194
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,694
I want to give you.

195
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,620
No, thanks.

196
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,534
It's not an expensive gift.

197
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
Then you can just buy me dinner.

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Thanks.

199
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,454
Junjun

200
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:08,974
Hello aunt.

201
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,214
It's good to see you here.

202
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,614
Help me find Mai.

203
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,194
I have an appointment with
him to go to your mother's.

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,294
He didn't go last time.

205
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,934
And he doesn't answer my call today.

206
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,654
I'm desperate, help me find him!

207
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,454
Take it easy, Aunt.

208
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,700
I heard Ding Yi say that
Mai Sichong is in the office.

209
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,374
Come on with me.

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,734
Why does he go to the office?

211
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,740
I don't know.

212
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,894
I'll go in first.

213
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,820
Wait for me here.

214
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,220
Ms. Meiling

215
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,054
Is there anything you
would like to say to me

216
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,820
about your hiding of medical reports?

217
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,580
The school didn't check the surveillance

218
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,294
because they still want
to give you a chance.

219
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,134
Don't you want to explain yet?

220
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Ms. Meiling

221
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,780
I know I did the wrong thing.

222
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,534
But I have a requirement.

223
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,156
Could you not disclose my injury

224
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,694
when you punish me.

225
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Mai Sichong

226
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,934
I want you to tell me the whole story

227
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,574
from beginning to end now.

228
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,894
You should understand
that this is no small matter.

229
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,054
If it's found serious enough,

230
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,214
the school will give
you disciplinary action.

231
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Are you clear?

232
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,420
Mai Sichong

233
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,780
You are really disappointing.

234
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,574
Why do you come here?

235
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,974
As soon as the kids
told me, I rushed over.

236
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,452
Where's Mai? What's going on?

237
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,220
This kid is pissing me off.

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,614
You all...

239
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,814
Mom? Why are you here?

240
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,174
Silly boy! How dare you?

241
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,120
How dare you did something so serious?

242
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,100
So you knew.

243
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,356
Well, what did teacher say?

244
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,094
Not a big deal.

245
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,654
It seems that I can't
escape a disciplinary action.

246
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,134
Chong

247
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,934
You asked me to borrow the key
so you could hide the medical report?

248
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,334
Why did you keep such a
big thing from me for so long?

249
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,494
Alright. Alright. It's not the
right time to talk about this.

250
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,774
Come with me to the hospital.

251
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,340
It took me a long time to get
an appointment for this check-up.

252
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,700
Thank you.

253
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,894
Weiwei

254
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,820
Come with me.

255
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,980
He'll feel more secure with you around.

256
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,734
Let's go.

257
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,940
Go!

258
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,820
Go!

259
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
What's going on?

260
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
How do you feel?

261
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,094
Mom

262
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,367
Didn't you say we were
here to see the results?

263
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,814
Why is the treatment starting again?

264
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,574
Don't move.

265
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,134
You're always so busy these days.

266
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,694
We've managed to catch you this time,

267
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,460
so I must give you a good treatment!

268
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,294
I'll have to show your dad

269
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,214
your shining image.

270
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,134
There's nothing worth
taking. You are so childish.

271
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,854
Don't move.

272
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,254
Don't take photos.

273
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,660
What! Don't move!

274
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,940
Okay.

275
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,220
Doctor, how am I doing?

276
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,174
Based on the results over this period,

277
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,254
the situation is really not positive.

278
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,574
It would be difficult

279
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,974
to the level of play before the injury.

280
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,174
But don't worry.

281
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,774
We...

282
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,734
It's okay.

283
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,614
You don't have to comfort me.

284
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I know my condition.

285
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,374
How about

286
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,854
you treat him first.

287
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,254
We'll go first.

288
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,854
Ok.

289
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,574
Weiwei

290
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,014
Let's leave here.

291
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,060
Obey doctor's words.

292
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,414
Let's go.

293
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,892
We add a few more treatments.

294
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,574
Pay attention.

295
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,340
Let me know if you feel uncomfortable.

296
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,300
Drink some water, auntie.

297
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,414
Tell you something.

298
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,614
The American specialist
is here for only one day.

299
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,334
I managed to get an appointment for him.

300
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,334
However, I couldn't get in touch with him.

301
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,334
He told me he went to the
meet-and-greet of Xun Yang.

302
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm so angry.

303
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,340
If you don't want me to call
the police, behave yourself.

304
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,934
Auntie

305
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,534
Is it hard to heal Mai Sichong's injuries?

306
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,340
Things don't look positive right now.

307
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,294
He is particularly afraid of
people knowing about his injuries.

308
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,375
He said the more people knew about his
injuries the more pressure he was under.

309
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,214
Weiwei, the fact that he
told you the truth about it

310
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,900
proves that he trusts you.

311
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,780
My poor son

312
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,914
grows in the swimming pool.

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,334
If he really can't be an athlete...

314
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,534
It won't happen.

315
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,574
Auntie, I major in rehabilitation.

316
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,774
My monitor said that

317
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,694
knee injuries can be healed

318
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,194
with proper rehab.

319
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,294
Really? Weiwei.

320
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,294
That's great.

321
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,974
This provincial team
will soon be recruiting.

322
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,654
You keep an eye on him for me.

323
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,654
Don't let his injuries get worse.

324
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,060
Okay, don't worry auntie.

325
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,414
Son

326
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,814
Follow the doctor's instructions.
No more overtraining.

327
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,054
And remember to drink the
nutrient solution you brought.

328
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,774
Okay.

329
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,916
You'd better get going

330
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,774
or there will be traffic jams.

331
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,700
Bye.

332
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,580
What did my mom tell you?

333
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,460
It's a secret.

334
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,084
Whatever. I don't care.

335
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,220
If you have something to say, just say it.

336
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,236
Aren't you suffocated?

337
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,054
You didn't go to the hospital that day

338
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,460
because you rushed to Peng
Pai's company to save me, right?

339
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,094
Not a big deal.

340
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,620
Anyway, the matter is settled.

341
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,294
Why did my electricity work before

342
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,964
and then suddenly it didn't work?

343
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,460
It's a secret.

344
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,820
What are you going to do?

345
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,540
Anyway,

346
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,740
I won't give up swimming.

347
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,620
Are you sure?

348
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,540
I have to be sure.

349
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,580
Your cake.

350
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,054
What did Mai Sichong think?

351
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,774
He stole the medical report.

352
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,014
How could I know what does he think?

353
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,414
He didn't even tell me.

354
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,334
I'm so angry.

355
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,254
But

356
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,054
no one is perfect.

357
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,174
When God opens a window,

358
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,700
he closes the door behind you.

359
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,900
So your house is a
basement, without a door?

360
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,580
What do you mean?

361
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,354
This round doesn't count.

362
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,534
Let's play another one.

363
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,174
Hello?

364
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,940
We agreed that whoever lost would buy.

365
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,860
Chong comes back.

366
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,734
I can't play.

367
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,876
I have to comfort him.

368
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,716
Weren't you just angry with him?

369
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,054
You think I'm a girl?

370
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
Get angry anytime.

371
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,940
You pay the bill.

372
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,300
Hey!

373
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,860
Bastard.

374
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,974
I can't understand.

375
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,940
What is he up to?

376
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,174
What does he think?

377
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,374
I was told he didn't want
teachers to know about his injury.

378
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,374
He was afraid that the provincial
team would not want him.

379
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,054
But wasn't he the school's seeded player?

380
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,980
Right.

381
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,374
Weiwei, where are you?

382
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,940
Then he would be all over.

383
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,500
Thank you.

384
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,220
Never mind.

385
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,694
I came here today mainly to ask

386
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,268
what' wrong with Sichong's leg?

387
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,934
You should have known that already, right?

388
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,254
I was just guessing at the time.

389
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,214
I don't really know the details.

390
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,780
He didn't tell me anything.

391
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,414
He is crazy about swimming.

392
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,974
And he has a gift.

393
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,420
I feel it's a pity.

394
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,534
Right.

395
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,334
At his age,

396
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,716
the blow is quite hard one.

397
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,292
Will you still sign him, Peng Pai?

398
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,260
I'm not sure.

399
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,114
If he signs directly without
taking the provincial exam,

400
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,880
there must not be much of a problem.

401
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,820
But if he falls in advance,

402
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,060
his value is not so high.

403
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,014
What's wrong?

404
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,220
It's realistic, right?

405
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,934
If you were him,

406
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,028
how would you choose?

407
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I don't like risk.

408
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,660
How about you?

409
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,100
I have no idea.

410
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,860
I have a class to attend,
I have to leave now.

411
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,300
Weiwei

412
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,334
You tell Sichong to reconsider.

413
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,100
After all, there's only one month left.

414
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,220
Thank you, Peng Pai.

415
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,734
Baihui

416
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,574
I am starting to learn massage now.

417
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,340
When can I start to
give massage to others?

418
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,734
At least three years.

419
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,660
Such a long time.

420
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,174
What do you think?

421
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,294
I started learning massage
from my dad at the age of five,

422
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,814
and only had my first
practice at thirteen.

423
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,054
It took another four or five years before
my dad let me treat my first patient.

424
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,214
This thing

425
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
can't be rushed.

426
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,374
Alright.

427
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
Baihui

428
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,294
I want to ask you a favor.

429
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,260
What?

430
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,074
Could you transfer to Mai Sichong's dorm?

431
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
Why?

432
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,900
I'd like you to have time to give
him a rehabilitation massage.

433
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Massage for Mai Sichong?

434
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,014
Great!

435
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,534
I've recently been researching
a new massage program.

436
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,214
And I was worried about
finding someone to study.

437
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,940
If Mai Sichong can do it,
that would be a big help!

438
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,940
Weiwei

439
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,174
Can Mai Sichong do it?

440
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,014
Yes.

441
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,334
Of course he can.

442
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,414
I'll take care of it.

443
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,014
Really?

444
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
Of course!

445
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,534
And I want to ask you a favor.

446
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,374
What?

447
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,140
Join us for the athletics competition.

448
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,734
Okay.

449
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,574
I join you.

450
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes!

451
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,534
Weiwei

452
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,534
I've already thought about it.

453
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,054
I'll run first.

454
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,934
No. No.

455
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,734
You can run first.

456
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,854
Or Junjun runs first.

457
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,140
Then I run fourth.

458
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,614
What's wrong?

459
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,540
Are you ok?

460
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,274
I just got a call from Coach
Li of the provincial team.

461
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,752
Ask me what's wrong with you.

462
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,374
I was confused there.

463
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,740
They are very unsure of you
now. What are you going to do?

464
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,254
Mai Sichong

465
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,534
If you had shown more trust in me

466
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,014
and in others.

467
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,174
And tell us the truth.

468
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,340
The thing wouldn't be like that.

469
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,477
There are a limited
number of places available

470
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:57,814
of our school to attend the competition.

471
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,468
If they're not satisfied
with you and don't

472
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,354
let you participate in the competition,

473
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,454
I can do nothing to help you then.

474
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,614
Ms. Peipei

475
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,540
He...

476
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,620
Mai Sichong

477
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,020
You're still capricious now aren't you?

478
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,134
I know what you're thinking.

479
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,174
You are thinking that the
less people know about it,

480
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,094
the less pressure you have.

481
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,300
And you can just not care
about it or even ignore it.

482
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
What are you doing?

483
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,894
You're doing what cowards do.

484
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,174
You are escaping.

485
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,100
You...

486
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,580
Think about it.

487
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,294
Sichong

488
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,654
I don't know if it's the right
time to talk to you about this.

489
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,734
But perhaps what I'm about to say

490
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,894
will comfort you.

491
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,614
First, I can promise that

492
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,254
we will still sign you as promised.

493
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,334
We won't give up on you.

494
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,174
Second, if you drop out of
the provincial team selection.

495
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,774
And sign us directly.

496
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,254
I was sure to convince the leader

497
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,854
to raise the price by five points.

498
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,694
I know your feelings.

499
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,500
But it's all what I can do for you.

500
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,860
Hope this can comfort you.

501
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,374
Think about it.

502
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,900
It's your own life.
