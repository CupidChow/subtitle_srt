00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,060
Peng Pai

3
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,540
Someone comes for you.

4
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,780
Weiwei

5
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,700
Stop jabbing it.

6
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,740
Would you like to eat it or not?

7
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,700
I neither have the appetite

8
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,620
nor the mood.

9
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,500
Because of Mai Sichong?

10
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,700
He's been weird recently.

11
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,260
Do you think this is how people end

12
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,420
when friends become a couple?

13
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
I don't think so.

14
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,380
At least I won't.

15
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,220
Okay.

16
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,820
I know you are head over heels in love.

17
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,380
Managed to keep it from me so long.

18
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,500
I wanted to tell you in the first place

19
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,620
but Ding Yi didn't.

20
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,620
Um,

21
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,540
it's been one hour since he texted me.

22
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,420
Hey.

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,740
In Sichong's eyes, his girlfriend is more important than us.

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,020
I've hardly seen him since he came back from the provincial team.

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,020
Rui

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,340
If you two enter the provincial team,

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
I'll be lonely.

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,380
Why are you sure I can enter the provincial team?

29
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,660
Of course you can.

30
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,980
You've won the offer of the training camp.

31
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,460
Sichong must be the fastest.

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,340
You're only one second slower than him.

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,980
The chance of being recruited is 50%.

34
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,020
You'll definitely make it.

35
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Well, his trouble of doping test

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,980
is so ridiculous.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
(Mother is calling.)

38
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Mai Sichong

39
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,900
What are you doing?

40
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,820
Why don't you take the doping test?

41
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,180
Ms. Peipei

42
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,540
Trust me.

43
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,580
I'll explain it to you.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,380
Now I'm on

45
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,700
the way to school.

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,300
You'd better explain it.

47
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,780
When arriving at school,

48
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,340
you come to Ms. Meiling's office.

49
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,780
Okay.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
(Mai Sichong)

51
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,000
(Mai Sichong)

52
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Who are you texting to?

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,980
Why did you not answer my calls?

54
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,020
And you didn't respond to my messages.

55
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,580
Are you

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,460
tracing down my schedules?

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,180
Yes,

58
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,820
can't I?

59
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,980
Okay.

60
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,020
Drink it.

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
Have you solved

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,620
yesterday's trouble?

63
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I'll have

64
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
another doping test in a few days.

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,100
Are you sure?

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,220
I feel that you're keeping something from me.

67
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,340
You silly girl.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
Can you think over something important?

69
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,580
This is the most important thing.

70
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,260
Okay, don't worry.

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,780
You have to take your lesson now.

72
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,740
Hello, auntie.

73
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,900
Okay,

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm coming to you now.

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,060
Weiwei

76
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,500
Why are you eating alone?

77
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,180
You're right on time.

78
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,620
Please tell Professor Chen

79
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,500
that I'll be a little late.

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,540
I have a matter of urgency.

81
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,540
I have to go.

82
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,580
Does Weiwei have troubles?

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,300
I don't think so.

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,060
If she needs help,

85
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,060
she will tell us.

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,780
It's customized for you.

87
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,340
It may be hot.

88
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,780
Thank you.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,860
It's bitter.

90
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
I can remake it.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,140
Don't bother.

92
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,580
Uh,

93
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,700
now I savour it carefully,

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
it's a bit sweet.

95
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm glad you like it.

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,660
Auntie

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,380
Weiwei, take a seat.

98
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,020
Have I bothered you?

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,940
It doesn't matter.

100
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,460
Thank you.

101
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,420
Xiaomai always follows what you say.

102
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Can I ask you a favor?

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,620
Okay.

104
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,700
Can you persuade him to take the doping test?

105
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,140
The doping test?

106
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,420
I accompanied him to take the test last time,

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,740
but he said the testing place was changed.

108
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,060
As expected

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
he didn't tell you the truth.

110
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,980
Ms. Peipei called me yesterday,

111
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,100
said she didn't change the testing place.

112
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,060
He didn't go take the test.

113
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
I don't know what to do now.

114
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
He tells me. nothing even when I ask him.

115
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,300
You see,

116
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,940
he said he could handle it.

117
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,100
But how can he handle it by himself?

118
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,500
The deadline of the doping test is approaching,

119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,500
but I can't reach him.

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
He neither answered my calls nor came back home.

121
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,140
Weiwei

122
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,260
What's in your mind?

123
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,580
Nothing.

124
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,980
Don't worry, auntie.

125
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,940
I'll talk to him.

126
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,460
Persuade him for me.

127
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,500
Okay.

128
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,260
I have something to do.

129
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
I have to go now.

130
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,820
Okay.

131
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,540
Thank you.

132
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,700
Sorry,

133
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,980
the subscriber you dialed is power off.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
(Mai Sichong)

135
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Sorry,

136
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
the subscriber you dialed is power off.

137
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,780
Ding Yi

138
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,860
Is Mai Sichong with you?

139
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,580
He's not here.

140
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,660
He went to visit Peng Pai.

141
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,740
May he have something to ask Mr. Peng.

142
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,060
What did she say?

143
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,540
It seems that I put my foot in my mouth.

144
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,540
Should I have to say that he is with us?

145
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,340
What?

146
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,220
Are you

147
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,740
keeping some secrets for him?

148
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,060
Of course not.

149
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,060
But as I see it,

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,700
Weiwei is not glad.

151
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,380
Did I sell him out?

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
(Weiwei)

153
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:46,940
Weiwei

154
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,580
Long time no see.

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,420
I want to ask you what Mai Sichong told you.

156
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
He didn't tell you?

157
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,060
I think

158
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,940
he should tell you that in person.

159
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,180
Why are you here?

160
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,340
The man who sent me the video

161
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,940
is you?

162
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,860
What video?

163
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,420
You'd better stop making threats.

164
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,180
If you ruin my opportunity,

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,900
I won't let you off.

166
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,340
Mai Sichong

167
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't know what you are saying.

168
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,700
You refused the doping test for that?

169
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,980
We knew each other at senior high school.

170
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,220
If I want to disclose her secret,

171
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,420
I'll have other options to do that instead of sending you the video.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,140
Though I don't like you,

173
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,300
I'll never hurt Weiwei.

174
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,140
Did Weiwei know that?

175
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,300
I didn't tell her.

176
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,220
When is the deadline?

177
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,140
Three days later.

178
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,780
It's obvious that

179
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,460
he wants to ruin you.

180
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Even if you know who did that

181
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
he won't stop.

182
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,060
If the video is disclosed,

183
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,660
I have no idea what will happen to Weiwei.

184
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,180
I got it.

185
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,620
What's your plan?

186
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,540
I won't swim.

187
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,700
I have other options.

188
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,100
If her secret is disclosed,

189
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,420
her life will be ruined.

190
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,660
Though

191
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,340
all the time

192
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,060
swimming is my dream,

193
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,220
but Mei Weiwei's happiness

194
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,980
is more important for me.

195
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,620
So

196
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
in any case,

197
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,700
I'll put her benefits as the priority.

198
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,300
Have you inquired the number?

199
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,980
I called him back,

200
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,340
but he's switched off.

201
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,060
I'll help you.

202
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,340
Thank you.

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,620
I'm sorry for

204
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,700
my offense.

205
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,580
I don't need your thanks.

206
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,020
Because you can do

207
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,860
what I can't.

208
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,300
His affair is very serious.

209
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,100
It'll be dealt with severely.

210
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,780
School leaders may have told with him.

211
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,580
Weiwei

212
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,420
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,300
It doesn't matter.

214
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,180
Ms. Meiling

215
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,780
Mai Sichong

216
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,300
Can you explain it?

217
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,820
I never cheated.

218
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,300
Sorry

219
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,660
This is only what I can tell you.

220
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,020
Are you crazy?

221
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,060
Do you know how serious it is?

222
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,140
Ms. Meiling

223
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,740
My team members will never violate sportsmanship.

224
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
There must be a mistake.

225
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I'm his tutor.

226
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
I always trust him.

227
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,100
I know you trust him.

228
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Our school also trusts you.

229
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,740
How can I persuade the leaders

230
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,780
of provincial team only by the trust.

231
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,860
And the truth is

232
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
that he was appointed to take the doping test,

233
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,020
but he,

234
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,500
he stood them up.

235
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,460
Now the internal document have been issued.

236
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,220
It'll be announced in three days.

237
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
It's slander!

238
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,140
Except the doping test data,

239
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,660
Is there any other evidence

240
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,420
can prove his cheating?

241
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,260
You can't deny that

242
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,300
the doping test is the best evidence.

243
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,660
What else do you want?

244
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I don't understand

245
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,580
why you didn't take the doping test.

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,860
Ms. Meiling

247
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I was set up.

248
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
I didn't cheat.

249
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,140
Then why didn't you take the test?

250
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,820
Your rejection is unconvincing.

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,220
Do you reckon that you will win others' trust

252
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,140
without any explanation?

253
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
Ms. Meiling

254
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,300
I trust him.

255
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,620
Mei Weiwei

256
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,820
Why are you here?

257
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Ms. Meiling

258
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,340
I can prove him innocent.

259
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
It's an extremely serious matter.

260
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,820
You should show evidence.

261
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,220
I got it.

262
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Please give us some time.

263
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,060
I'll find the evidence.

264
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,660
Please trust us.

265
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,940
Weiwei

266
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,700
Weiwei

267
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,980
Don't be angry.

268
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,620
I'm not angry.

269
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,100
I know you're angry.

270
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,900
Mai Sichong

271
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,380
Why didn't you tell me?

272
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,940
Why didn't you take the doping test?

273
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,180
If you miss this opportunity,

274
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,820
your dream will be harder to come true.

275
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,380
Sorry,

276
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,260
Sorry to make you worried.

277
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,860
I don't want your dream

278
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
be hindered by me.

279
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
You are really important for me.

280
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
I didn't tell you

281
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
because I don't want to bother you.

282
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm sorry to make it worse.

283
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,740
Trust me.

284
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,100
Though I don't take the test

285
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
I'll take actions.

286
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
I believe we can

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
find clues.

288
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
There is little time left.

289
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
We still have three days.

290
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,220
Okay,

291
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,500
just trust me.

292
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I won't give up

293
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,500
until the deadline.

294
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,660
Now, take your lesson,

295
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,300
right?

296
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
You have to promise that

297
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,260
there's no such a secret between us.

298
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,380
If you have any trouble,

299
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,340
you can ask me for help.

300
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,660
Okay.

301
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,340
Have you found that

302
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,500
there's someone taking photos of you?

303
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Never.

304
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,500
Could it be

305
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,420
the security guard?

306
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
It's impossible.

307
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
He was sentenced

308
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
over half a year in prison.

309
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,140
He is still in prison now.

310
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,140
Well,

311
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,500
did anyone come here to watch the video?

312
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,460
A man did.

313
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,100
The one who was with you.

314
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,180
With us?

315
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Help me.

316
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,420
How can I help you? I'm dying.

317
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm back.

318
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
Have you seen Mai Sichong?

319
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Daixi,

320
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
can I ask you a question?

321
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,580
Come here.

322
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,860
Are you serious?

323
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,580
You'll be reported!

324
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,180
What's wrong?

325
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,140
Daixi

326
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,260
Have you mentioned to others my secret?

327
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,820
Never.

328
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Why?

329
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,300
Mai Sichong didn't

330
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,180
take the doping test for that?

331
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,540
Mai didn't take the doping test?

332
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
Why?

333
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,460
It's not the time to ask why.

334
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,220
Ding Yi

335
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,020
You have to think it over.

336
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,060
Is it possible that one of your teammates

337
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,300
set up Mai Sichong?

338
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
No one would do that.

339
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,460
We are friends.

340
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
I have to ask Sichong.

341
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,740
Take it easy.

342
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,140
We'll figure it out.

343
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,420
Junjun

344
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,380
Junjun

345
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,780
Can I ask you a question?

346
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,900
Yeah.

347
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,540
Do you remember

348
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,820
when encountering the psychopath

349
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,460
who was beside you?

350
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,300
What's wrong?

351
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,060
The security guard

352
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,940
has been released?

353
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,340
Not yet.

354
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm just asking.

355
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,700
You can ask Xia Rui.

356
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,940
He was the first one who ran to you

357
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,500
when hearing your voice.

358
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,460
He may recall it.

359
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,380
Xia Rui?

360
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
My friend told me

361
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,820
that the SIM card

362
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,620
is sold in shops around our school.

363
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,100
It doesn't need real-name authentication.

364
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,380
My friend in the provincial team said

365
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,340
it was quite possible

366
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,700
that your teammate set you up.

367
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,780
My teammate?

368
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,820
It's obvious that

369
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,140
he wants you to keep silent

370
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
about this accusation.

371
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,860
Do you think

372
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,380
who will benefit most?

373
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
On that day,

374
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
was Xia Rui on the spot?

375
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,380
He can't do that.

376
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,340
There are limited positions.

377
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,420
If you can't enter, Xia Rui will.

378
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,740
He's the most possible guy.

379
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,860
It's reasonable.

380
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,300
Without considering our friendship,

381
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,220
I just keep to his personality.

382
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,180
He is self-disciplined.

383
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,500
He is the first to arrive at the natatorium every day.

384
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
So diligent he is,

385
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,420
he won't do that.

386
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,420
You don't know his thoughts.

387
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,740
I don't care about you,

388
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,660
but you can't make Weiwei hurt.

389
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,020
What's the matter?

390
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,580
Rui, have you seen Sichong today?

391
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,580
He came back once and left.

392
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
And he didn't come back again.

393
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,340
Why didn't he answer my calls?

394
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,620
Do you know that Sichong didn't take the doping test?

395
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,180
Yes.

396
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,660
Okay, everyone knows but me.

397
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,220
It's too much.

398
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
It's enough.

399
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,300
Thanks for joining us

400
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,020
despite your busy schedules.

401
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,340
We should toast to you.

402
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,940
Come on.

403
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,100
Let me fill your glass.

404
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,500
Cheers.

405
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,460
Thank you very much.

406
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,620
You are welcome.

407
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,740
Dry it.

408
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,500
Come on.

409
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,900
Dry the wine!

410
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,740
It's too much.

411
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,180
Okay, pour less.

412
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
To be honest,

413
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,580
I'm really worried about

414
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,860
my son's business.

415
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,020
You see,

416
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,140
could you please

417
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,340
help us

418
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,900
to intercede with

419
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,540
the authorities?

420
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,140
Sorry to trouble you.

421
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,660
Laomai

422
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,980
Don't say that.

423
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,140
I know Xiaomai very much.

424
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,420
Since he entered junior high school,

425
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,340
I could see that

426
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,420
your boy

427
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,780
is born to swim.

428
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,740
If he insists in

429
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,380
refusing the doping test,

430
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,980
no one can help him.

431
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,060
Hey.

432
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,380
Hurry up.

433
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
Come here.

434
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,180
Why are you so late?

435
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,220
I've called you so many times.

436
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,700
How dare you be late today?

437
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,140
Listen to your uncle.

438
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,020
Sichong

439
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,740
Why not you

440
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,820
take the test?

441
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,100
Uncle

442
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,020
Is it you that help me

443
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,820
postpone the test?

444
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,100
Thank you very much.

445
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,940
I'll come

446
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,860
to the hospital in time.

447
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,980
In this aspect,

448
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,100
I trust you.

449
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,220
After all,

450
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,340
you have been a good swimmer.

451
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,380
In these two days,

452
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,220
you have to take the test

453
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,140
before the deadline.

454
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,700
It's so easy.

455
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,140
You two

456
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,420
don't need to worry.

457
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:25,940
Laoli

458
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,220
We know our son,

459
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,740
he can't cheat.

460
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm wondering

461
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,220
who is framing Xiaomai?

462
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
You know,

463
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,780
the report is anonymous.

464
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
I guess...

465
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,100
Well,

466
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,620
it's just a guess.

467
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,260
Please.

468
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,580
As I guess,

469
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,900
the troublemaker

470
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,180
has to be his teammate

471
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,940
in the provincial team training camp.

472
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,140
If you

473
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,620
want to defeat a rival,

474
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,980
the shortcut

475
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,260
must be

476
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,580
ruining him.

477
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Thank you.

478
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,020
We got it.

479
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Xiaomai,

480
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,180
is the other candidate called Xia Rui?

481
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,780
Mom

482
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
What do you want to say?

483
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,220
We just want to

484
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,660
remind you that

485
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,940
what Uncle Li

486
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,140
mentioned today is possible

487
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,660
right?

488
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,260
Right.

489
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,380
We are not suspecting him,

490
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,060
but...

491
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,460
Mom

492
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
He's my roommate,

493
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,220
and I know him very much.

494
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,980
I trust him.

495
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
Don't say that anymore.

496
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,460
Dad

497
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,940
Mom

498
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,300
I'm sorry to

499
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,340
make you worried.

500
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,580
Please believe me.

501
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,540
No matter how difficult it is,

502
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
I'll solve it.

503
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,820
Okay.

504
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,420
You've grown up.

505
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,380
We know you are mature

506
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,580
and you can deal with it.

507
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,420
We trust you.

508
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,420
It's impossible.

509
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,300
Sichong

510
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
What's going on?

511
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,100
There are widespread rumor about your doping.

512
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,940
I don't believe that you need dope.

513
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Why did you not take the doping test?

514
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,940
Where is Xia Rui?

515
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,300
Xia Rui

516
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,060
is in the locker room.

517
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,900
Don't let others in.
