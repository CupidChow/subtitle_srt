00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Peng Pai

3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,560
Weiwei

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,760
Why are you at school today?

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Because of the paper.

6
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,880
I'll go to work this afternoon.

7
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,520
Er...

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,080
Peng Pai

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,320
I have something to ask you for help.

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,160
Say it.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Can you

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,280
arrange for Xunyang to meet Mai Sichong?

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
I think

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
Xunyang will definitely help

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
the present Mai Sichong.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm afraid

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,520
this is a little difficult.

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,320
I actually just take a chance.

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,080
You don't have to care too much.

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,000
Bye, I'll go to class.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Weiwei

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,480
Mai Sichong still doesn't come to class?

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,360
He took time off to go home.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
He's been gone for days.

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,240
He said he was ashamed to come to school.

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
His phone is off, too.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,400
Can his knees

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,160
recover or not?

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I think

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,160
it's impossible for his knees

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
to recover to their original appearance.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,840
But I think if he does well in the rehabilitation,

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,240
he will have no problem

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,560
entering province team.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,240
Ding Yi

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Do you want to help him?

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Come with me.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
Why do you move so fast?

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,280
Lin Baihui

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Do you keep your word?

41
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,760
As long as I'm willing to take part in the track and field,

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,920
you promise to help massage Mai Sichong?

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,800
But

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,080
isn't it good for us to move so fast

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
without telling the teacher?

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
So what?

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,120
You don't like the seniors in your dorm anyway.

49
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,720
You now move to the dorm of Mai Sichong

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
that there is a swimmer waiting for you to heal.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
How nice.

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,680
You'll be able to make new friends

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,760
and show off your skills at the same time.

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Kill two birds with one stone, right?

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,560
And the provincial examination is coming soon,

56
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,480
you must cooperate fully with Baihui.

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
The service must be in place.

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Stand by.

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,000
I promise to get the job done.

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,400
Hui

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,520
take good care of you.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,880
Can you

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
call me another name?

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,920
What do I call you?

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,640
Baibai

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,400
Huihui

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Whatever.

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Hurry up.

70
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll check in.

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Then I'll call you whatever I want.

72
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,320
Whatever.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,200
All right.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
You move it first.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,720
I have to go.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Come back quickly.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,840
Your son locks himself in the room now.

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
No one can open it.

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,120
Don't worry.

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
It's all your fault.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
You know I'll tell him,

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
but you still tell me.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
It's all my fault.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
He is already an adult.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
Give him time to calm down.

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
Who is here at this time?

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I'll hang up.

88
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Hello.

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,760
Weiwei

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Please come in.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,040
You can

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,320
call me Mom Mai.

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,640
Is Mai Sichong here?

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,760
You're just in time.

95
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
He locks himself in the room now.

96
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
No one can open it.

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
Please help me persuade him.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,920
Come on.

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,880
Auntie

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,440
Do I interrupt you

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,160
all of a sudden?

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,080
No, I'm very happy.

103
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,360
Please help me persuade him.

104
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,080
He has locked himself in for two days.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
I can do nothing with him.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,760
He also asked me to go to school and get him something.

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,200
He said he would stay at home for a while.

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm very worried.

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,200
Come on.

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,720
Then let me persuade him.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Weiwei

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,760
Take your time.

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
I'll get you some fruit.

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,800
OK.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Thank you.

116
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
Can you understand it?

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
You look down on me?

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,440
I certainly understand it.

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Why are you here?

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,160
I asked Lin Baihui to move to your dorm.

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,840
He is very good at rehabilitation,

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
so he can definitely help you.

123
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't need it.

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,400
Why?

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,320
Are you autistic?

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
What?

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,360
It's not you who are ashamed.

128
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,160
It's not shameful.

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,440
It's not the first time you've been ashamed anyway.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,240
People don't expect anything from you.

131
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,240
Don't worry.

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,400
Why do you twist the knife?

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,680
I don't go back.

134
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
Get up and come back to school with me.

135
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,760
I don't go back.

136
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
Get up or not?

137
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I'll drag you if you don't get up.

138
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,200
I don't go back.

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Get up.

140
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,680
I don't go back.

141
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,480
Mei Weiwei

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
Why do you take the initiative

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,000
to hug me?

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
You're shameless.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
It's obviously because you drag me that I fall down.

146
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,000
Is there any other reason?

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,160
I...

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,760
Please.

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,680
Fruit.

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,840
Excuse me.

151
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,520
Go on, you guys.

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Mai

153
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,240
Please help me take out the rubbish.

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
I can't lift it.

155
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,440
Dear

156
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
I can't keep up with the speed of your falling in love.

157
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Don't think too much.

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
I think too much?

159
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,520
What are you doing? Playing sumo?

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,280
Auntie, I have to go.

161
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,320
Weiwei

162
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Please stay.

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,480
I have something interesting to show you.

164
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,720
Interesting?

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,280
Look how fat he was when he was a child.

166
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
His stomach was like a little watermelon.

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
Look how much he looked like a big head doll.

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,640
Look at this photo.

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,320
I remember he was five years old.
Look, he still sucked his fingers.

170
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Let's continue.

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
This photo impresses me the most.

172
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,080
This should be the first time he won the gold medal.

173
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,600
You see, he had conjunctivitis.

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,760
He must cover his face with a swimming goggles.

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,800
Mom

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
Can you respect my privacy?

177
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,840
It doesn't matter and how cute you are.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,160
These photos of you are for Weiwei to see.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
This is our family of three.

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
That's enough.

181
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
You have yoga class in the afternoon.

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,200
Please be on your way to class.

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll talk to Weiwei for a while.

184
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,000
OK.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll leave you alone.

186
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't laugh.

187
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
Are these medals you won?

188
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,360
Just gold medals.

189
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
Have you won silver medals?

190
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
Of course not.

191
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,960
I remember someone at Team Match taking a...

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
Why do you like swimming?

193
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
It's been too long,

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,800
and I can't remember

195
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
the specific reason.

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,960
But when I was on the swim team,

197
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,480
Mr. Yang picked me at first glance.

198
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Mr. Yang?

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,440
He is my coach

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,040
in high school.

201
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
He is also a professional swimmer.

202
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
He saw me swimming at the time

203
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,840
and thought I could win all gold medals in the future.

204
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
Then he firmly chose me.

205
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
But

206
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
my current state...

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Mai Sichong

208
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,640
Let's go to Mr. Yang.

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,120
Mr. Yang

210
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,480
Chong?

211
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
You

212
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
finally show up.

213
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,800
It's been so long since we've seen each other,
and you're still like this.

214
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
We haven't seen each other for so long,

215
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,280
and you didn't come to see me?

216
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm here now, right?

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,640
She is

218
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,200
your girlfriend?

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,720
No.

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
She is my classmate.

221
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Do you wanna

222
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,000
go in and take a look?

223
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,240
No, I've been here for years.

224
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Let's go for dinner.

225
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,720
Let's go.

226
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,880
Let's go.

227
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,880
Mr. Yang

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,960
It's been a long time since I've had dinner with you.

229
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,960
By the way.

230
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
You just said

231
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
you didn't go to the province team
because of a knee injury.

232
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,320
What's going on?

233
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
I had an accident

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
before.

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,840
My meniscuses are injured.

236
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,680
The doctor advised me to have an operation,

237
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
so I couldn't go to province team for selection.

238
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,920
How can you,

239
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,000
a swimmer,

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
How can you hurt your knee?

241
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,800
Mr. Yang

242
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,160
It's my fault.

243
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll be careful.

244
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
All right.

245
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,120
Can you

246
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,760
still swim now?

247
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I can.

248
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,840
But...

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,200
What?

250
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,160
You wanna give up?

251
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,360
By the way.

252
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,160
I have a gift.

253
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,160
Take a look.

254
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,640
Gift?

255
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Take a look.

256
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Mr. Yang

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
Why do you bring this?

258
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
So what?

259
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
That's okay.

260
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,560
I tell you

261
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
I like you just the way you were.

262
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,160
You were persistent.

263
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,120
Chong

264
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
Listen.

265
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,640
You are very talented

266
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,600
and work very hard.

267
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,960
A dozen years have passed.

268
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
I only meet one talent and that's you.

269
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,720
I believe you will be on the podium in the future.

270
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,480
And

271
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
you will go far

272
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
in the whole country

273
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
and even the whole world.

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,440
Understand?

275
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I see, Mr. Yang.

276
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Thank you.

277
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,720
Be careful.

278
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,840
It's okay.

279
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm not drunk.

280
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Be careful.

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,560
Chong

283
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,760
Remember

284
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
to treat your girlfriend

285
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
well.

286
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,040
I...

287
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,560
You can't

288
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,240
fool me.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,720
Be safe.

290
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,440
Take care.

291
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Bye.

292
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,400
You drank a lot just now.

293
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,080
I'll get you a yogurt

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,800
to relieve your hangover.

295
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,640
Today, I lost to the little fat boy in the team.

296
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,720
I still lost my temper.

297
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
I know I was wrong.

298
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,640
But that doesn't mean I'll give up.

299
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,920
I swear

300
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll never cry again.

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
No matter what the ranking is,

302
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
I won't give up again.

303
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
If I give up again, I'll be a puppy.

304
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Yang

305
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Please don't be angry.

306
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
I promise

307
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,280
to keep my word.

308
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,080
By Mai Sichong.

309
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,360
Thank you.

310
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,080
Let me

311
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,240
send you back to school.

312
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,760
Let's go.

313
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
Mr. Yang thinks highly of you so much.

314
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,880
Of course.

315
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
The coaches I've met all think highly of me.

316
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,080
How about you?

317
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Do you think highly of me?

318
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,720
I...

319
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,120
Is that so hard to answer?

320
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,280
At least

321
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm the best swimmer among the people you know, right?

322
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,760
Mai Sichong

323
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
You are so confident.

324
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,680
Anyway, Mai Sichong, who I know,

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,320
is full of enthusiasm and confidence

326
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,640
in facing his favorite swimming.

327
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,640
If you give up now,

328
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
I admit that I was wrong before.

329
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,000
Goodbye.

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,760
Take care.

331
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,720
I have to go now.

332
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,280
Wait.

333
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,400
You dare not go to school with me

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,480
because you are afraid of shame?

335
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm

336
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
not scared.

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,360
I am afraid

338
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
that someone walking with me

339
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
will be gossiped by people

340
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,120
and then be unhappy.

341
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:18,880
How about

342
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
sending you back to your dorm

343
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,560
but I pick the route?

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,760
Dare you?

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
OK.

346
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
It's OK.

347
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,400
Why do you choose this route?

348
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,280
Because it's close to your dorm.

349
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
And

350
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,160
you were in danger last time.

351
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,440
I must send you back.

352
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I think it's because you're afraid

353
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
to walk in a crowded place.

354
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,960
It's impossible.

355
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm Mai Sichong.

356
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm not afraid.

357
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,120
You're kidding.

358
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,440
So take off your hat.

359
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,000
No way.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I think I'm more handsome this way.

361
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,160
Ding Yi

362
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,360
Here.

363
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,840
Is he gone?

364
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Is he gone?

365
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
You're afraid to see Ding Yi.

366
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,520
You're just afraid of shame.

367
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm not afraid of shame.

368
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Is there anything I should be afraid of?

369
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,560
So why do you choose this route?

370
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,720
I...

371
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,560
I

372
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,080
just want to stay with you a little longer.

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,880
I'm back.

374
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,840
Hello.

375
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,840
Why are you so happy?

376
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
I manage to persuade Mai Sichong
to come back to school.

377
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
So what?

378
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,120
It's quite good.

379
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Junjun

380
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,000
You and Mai Sichong have been friends since childhood, right?

381
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,640
Was he

382
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
such a coward before?

383
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,560
He flinched when he was troubled by gossip.

384
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,280
He actually

385
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
has too much self-esteem.

386
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,440
He had conjunctivitis

387
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
when he first won the prize.

388
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
He refused to take a group photo
after receiving the award.

389
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
This photo impressed me the most.

390
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
This should be the first time he won the gold medal.

391
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,800
You see, he had conjunctivitis.

392
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
He must cover his face with a swimming goggles.

393
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,080
Because his eyes were too red.

394
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,160
Are you sure

395
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,760
this is because of self-esteem,

396
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
not narcissism?

397
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
Why do you all

398
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,640
care so much about Mai Sichong?

399
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,080
Maybe it's because he's handsome.

400
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,480
But all the boys in our university seem to be good-looking,

401
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,560
except Ding Yi

402
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,760
and

403
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,840
Lin Baihui

404
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,560
in your class.

405
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,840
Li Daixi

406
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,880
Forget about Ding Yi, why do you mention our monitor?

407
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,520
Yuxin

408
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
What happened to you?

409
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
What?

410
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
Nothing happens.

411
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
Let's change the make-up class to 7:30am tomorrow.

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,040
We sign up for 4 x 100 m mixed relay race.

413
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,120
But we need one more girl.

414
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,040
Yuxin

415
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
We need one more girl.

416
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
Please help us.

417
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
I...

418
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,760
Actually,

419
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm the one who didn't sign up.

420
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
I really can't run.

421
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,360
Yuxin

422
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
You actually participate in a group activity?

423
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,720
Yes.

424
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,520
I

425
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,600
want to experience it too, right?

426
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm going to bed.

427
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Good night.

428
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm gonna wash up.

429
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Take your time.

430
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,000
You've been watching me for 20 minutes.
What the hell do you want?

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,920
You've changed.

432
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,120
I know

433
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm more handsome.

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,440
You've gone bad.

435
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,160
You and I are best friends.

436
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
But now you only talk to Mei Weiwei about anything.

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
Don't you

438
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,440
feel guilty about me?

439
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
You're asking for an insult.

440
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,960
Can you be the same as Mei Weiwei?

441
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,440
You are so superficial.

442
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,680
All right.

443
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,480
I'll buy you a game.

444
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
Don't try to grease my palm with games.

445
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
And meals for the next half month.

446
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
Do I look like the kind of person who betrays himself for food?

447
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
So

448
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
game and food are gone.

449
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,040
All right.

450
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,360
You are forgiven.

451
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,920
I am so generous,

452
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,800
so I forgive you.

453
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Are you finished?

454
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
Weiwei lets me do your rehabilitation.

455
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,920
So

456
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,640
can we get started?

457
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Come on.

458
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,560
How is it?

459
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,160
You are making progress.

460
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,920
That's good.

461
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,480
Take a look at the heartbeat.

462
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
115

463
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Put this on charge.

464
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,840
No problem.

465
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Take a break.

466
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Why doesn't my mom come?

467
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,560
Don't mention her to me.

468
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,960
It's so cold.

469
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,160
But in order to save electricity,

470
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,840
she wouldn't let me use the electric mattress.

471
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,320
The most exasperating thing is

472
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,800
that she puts her cold feet

473
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
on my small belly every day.

474
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
How irritating she is.

475
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Dad

476
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,080
You have a big belly.

477
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
It's because of you.

478
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,440
I run with you early in the morning.

479
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,720
My eating and sleeping are out of order.

480
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,880
So my belly must be big.

481
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Weiwei

482
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Can you find a boyfriend in the future

483
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
because of your special constitution?

484
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,240
Dad, I'm only in my first year of high school.

485
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,720
I think a little early.

486
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
Besides going to school,

487
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
you only like running.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
Why do you like running so much?

489
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Your mom and I thought

490
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,640
we had a treadmill.

491
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,280
Because running can make me feel satisfied.

492
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,960
The Flash can save the world.

493
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,560
Pikachu can save Ash Ketchum.

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Running can make me happy.

495
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
This is great.

496
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,120
You're right.

497
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
As long as you're happy,

498
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
I'll be happy.

499
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,240
Let's go home.

500
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,280
Let's go.

501
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,440
Why are you here?

502
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,720
You don't run long,

503
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
but you're so tired?

504
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
It's none of your business.

505
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,240
I promise to train with you.

506
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,200
I do what I say.

507
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
I'm all done with training.

508
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,840
So do you train or not?

509
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
If you don't train, let's go.

510
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,600
I won't train today.

511
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm so tired.

512
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,920
Come on.

513
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,480
You are comfortable, right?

514
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
I'll give you a discount.

515
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,360
80 yuan at one time.

516
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,680
You...

517
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,840
You should give me a free bill.

518
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,640
Then I'll add 20 yuan.

519
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:24,880
It hurts.

520
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,160
Be careful.

521
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,600
Good morning, Yuxin.

522
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Good morning.

523
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,120
Do you eat?

524
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,520
No.

525
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Let me show you.

526
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,800
This is made by the canteen chef.

527
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,120
I asked him to add five eggs for me.

528
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Please open it for me.

529
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm looking for something.

530
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Lin Baihui

531
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
Your egg cake

532
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,800
smells too strong.

533
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Please stay away from me.

534
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,640
Yuxin

535
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,840
Do you have time?

536
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes.

537
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,920
Then call Weiwei for me.

538
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Why hasn't she come?

539
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,920
What's going on?

540
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Come with me to the swimming pool.

541
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,520
There's a surprise for you.

542
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,960
Mei Weiwei

543
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,120
Why do you bring me here?

544
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
You'll know when you get there. Let's go.

545
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440
I am not in mood for training today.

546
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,000
No training.

547
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,200
There's a surprise for you.

548
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:43,960
Peng Pai

549
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:48,960
Weiwei

550
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,640
Here we are.

551
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,040
Sichong

552
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,520
And him?

553
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,360
Mai Sichong
