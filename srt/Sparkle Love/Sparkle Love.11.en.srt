2
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,474
The match is tomorrow.

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,520
Will you come?

4
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,954
Tomorrow is my birthday.

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,634
You didn't forget our
appointment, did you?

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
Tomorrow?

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,394
Come on.

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,114
It's Mai Sichong.

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,234
The one in the back is overtaking him.

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,794
He do it badly.

11
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Come on, Mai Sichong.

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,554
Chong

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,834
I'm still playing games
with you even I'm so sleepy.

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,280
Just forget the failure.

15
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Shut up and go on.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,474
It seems that you're
frustrated for the failure

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,274
and disappointed in a love affair.

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
Is it because Weiwei didn't come today?

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,074
How could it be possible?

20
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,994
It's none of her business.

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,914
Stop flaunting your
superiority, if you ask me.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,914
You were not in the mood to race

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,674
just because Weiwei didn't come.

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Otherwise you can't lose so much to Rui.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,874
Chong

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,674
You're out of form today.

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,314
Otherwise...

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,434
It's OK.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,834
I haven't

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,784
congratulated you.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,928
It doesn't matter to lose once.

32
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
You can win back later.

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,954
Never mind.

34
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,760
I'll apologize to him
face to face tomorrow.

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,554
No presence, no message.

36
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,960
She must have had a good
time at Peng Pai's birthday party.

37
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Mai Sichong

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,474
This is

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,714
the sports supplies I bought for you.

40
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Here you are.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,840
No, thanks.

42
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,794
What's the matter?

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
Are you not feeling well?

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,096
It's none of your business.

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,674
I know you're sad that you lost the match.

46
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
But you still have the
chance to win, right?

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

48
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,794
I come specially to see you.

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,560
How could you talk to me like that?

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,674
Be careful. I won't help you next time.

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,104
Then, don't help me anymore.

52
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Chong

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,656
What's wrong with you?

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,434
Wei didn't come to Chong's match.

55
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,674
As a result, Chong is
not in the mood to swim.

56
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,056
And he also lost the match.

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,914
You're really not good at talking.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Weiwei

59
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,264
I'm talking about the truth.

60
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,754
According to the inspection report

61
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
you have made a remarkable recovery.

62
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,754
But it's still hard to

63
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,328
get back to the same as before.

64
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Where is Weiwei?

65
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,434
She

66
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,074
went out early in the morning.

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,994
Maybe she went to
Peng Pai's birthday party.

68
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Peng Pai would not be so petty as you.

69
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,560
Grow up!

70
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,474
Weiwei

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,400
Milk tea for you.

72
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

73
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,914
So you are Peng Pai, the senior of Weiwei.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you.

75
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
Wait.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,954
What's the connection between
Peng Pai and club application?

77
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,314
He exposed Fan Zengxiang and
founding the club went smoothly.

78
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,034
By the way

79
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,034
thank you for the club.

80
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,074
You're welcome.

81
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
It's all part of the job.

82
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,794
Hello, the reporter.

83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,594
Could I speak to Weiwei please?

84
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,754
No, she has Peng Pai.

85
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,074
She's with Peng Pai?

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,754
No, not at the moment.

87
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,424
But it's uncertain in the future.

88
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Sticky tape.

89
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,352
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,434
Hello.

91
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,354
Well

92
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
we're going to hold some
new activities in our club now.

93
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,794
I neglected to introduce her.

94
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,794
This is Jiayi, the new president
of Students' Association Union.

95
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,754
Hello.

96
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,394
If you have any questions later

97
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,834
you can report them to us

98
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
and we'll make appropriate
adjustments and feedback.

99
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,234
Mei Weiwei

100
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,514
Your boyfriend is so good

101
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,280
that he exposed the former president.

102
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
He's not my boyfriend.

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,154
This came as a surprise, I must say.

104
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,434
Mai Sichong has done a lot for you.

105
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Mai Sichong?

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,034
Well, we'll go there and have a look.

107
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,074
Bye.

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,000
Wait.

109
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,914
What's the connection between
Peng Pai and club application?

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,474
He exposed Fan Zengxiang

111
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,994
so that founding the club went smoothly.

112
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,234
He did that?

113
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,234
Yes, of course.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Actually...

115
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,674
You go on.

116
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,864
I have something to do.

117
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,874
Yuxin

118
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,914
Do you understand the
therapy the teacher said in class?

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,994
The teacher has taught today.

120
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,394
And here.

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,074
I remember there seems to be the figure.

122
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,474
Well.

123
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,034
It suddenly occurred to me
that I had something else to do.

124
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,634
I'll go first.

125
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,434
OK, just go ahead.

126
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,154
OK, I've to go.

127
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,914
Bye.

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,674
Bye.

129
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,074
Yuxin

130
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,554
Let's go, Junjun.

131
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,480
And here.

132
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,074
I remember that

133
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
this part...

134
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,754
The boy who played Kurosaki
Ichigo at Comiket looks handsome.

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,554
Junjun

136
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,874
Didn't you say you
wanted to invite him today?

137
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,914
I didn't get to invite him.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Junjun

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,354
Hello, I'm Xia Rui.

140
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,554
Junjun, this is Kurosaki-kun, right?

141
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,514
We saw your picture before.

142
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,634
A little bit fuzzy.

143
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,400
I was surprised that you're so handsome.

144
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,634
Well, would you like to drink something?

145
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,674
I'll buy for you.

146
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,834
No, thanks.

147
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,456
You can have a talk. I've to go.

148
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,234
Or

149
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,680
let's go to the convenience
store and have something to eat.

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,880
OK.

151
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Let's go.

152
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Thank you.

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,200
You like BLEACH, too?

154
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Sorry about that day.

155
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
I.

156
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
I didn't

157
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
like...

158
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,600
I know.

159
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,914
There were too many people

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,954
that day.

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,714
Everyone was heckling.

162
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,096
You didn't know what to do.

163
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,240
So you just pointed at me, didn't you?

164
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
It doesn't matter. You
don't need to apologize.

165
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,120
At least we got to know
each other because of this.

166
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,594
Actually, I

167
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,834
was the same as you before.

168
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,600
I was more introverted than you before.

169
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,074
I

170
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,960
don't know how to communicate with others.

171
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
Seeing you

172
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,144
I feel like seeing myself before.

173
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,440
So I really want to make friends with you.

174
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
Friends?

175
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,400
I mean

176
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,480
just simple friends.

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,514
I heard you were ill.

178
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Here are medicine and
health care products for you.

179
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,714
Medicine and health care products.

180
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,712
Take them with you.

181
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,474
I heard you were ill.

182
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,274
What a coincidence!

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,640
There are medicine and health
care products, here you are.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Come on.

185
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
Mai Sichong

186
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Mai Sichong

187
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
Mai Sichong

188
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,674
Mai Sichong

189
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,768
Mai Sichong, wake up.

190
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,754
Is anyone there?

191
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,680
Is anyone there?

192
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Wake up.

193
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Mai Sichong

194
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
Mai Sichong

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,000
Mai Sichong, wake up.

196
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,714
Hey.

197
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,754
Hold on!

198
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
Wake up.

199
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
It's you.

200
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm really sick.

201
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,634
Everything is illusory.

202
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,560
Illusion.

203
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,954
Mai Sichong

204
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,914
Wake up. Don't scare me.

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,040
Is anyone there?

206
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,474
Hey.

207
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Hey.

208
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,954
Finally you're awake.

209
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
It scares me!

210
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,474
Hold on!

211
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,616
I'll call 120 for you.

212
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,194
Hello.

213
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
Please send someone over.

214
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,184
His fever is gone.

215
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,160
Now that you're awake,
don't pretend to sleep.

216
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,400
No, I don't.

217
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Why are you so childish when you are sick?

218
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,314
No, you're just as childish as usual.

219
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,234
I'm not childish.

220
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,160
You...

221
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,314
You

222
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,520
saved a person in the last
year of high school, right?

223
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,834
How do you know it's the
last year of high school?

224
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,434
Because I...

225
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,480
You're awake, Chong.

226
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,994
Chong, you're awake.

227
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,674
We brought you fruits.

228
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,354
Do you still have a fever?

229
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,280
Much better.

230
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,274
Hello.

231
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,314
Weiwei, are you at school?

232
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,834
I'll go back to school in the
afternoon to look for thesis data.

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,194
Can we have a meal together

234
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
and have a talk?

235
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
OK, then give me a second.

236
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,000
I will come soon.

237
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,474
I'm meeting Peng Pai to talk
about something in the canteen.

238
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,354
I'll go first.

239
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,954
I'll be back with takeout later.

240
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,880
I've to go.

241
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,360
Chong

242
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,834
Do you think there is something
between Mei Weiwei and Peng Pai?

243
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,600
It's none of your business. Shut up.

244
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,040
Junjun

245
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,554
You can go to have a meal.

246
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
I'll tell you if something
happens to Chong.

247
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Do you want bananas?

248
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
You have finished your paper, haven't you?

249
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Peng Pai

250
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,080
I told her about your plan
for your birthday party.

251
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,394
Sorry, I just...

252
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm going now.

253
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,754
Peng Pai

254
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,114
I didn't go to your birthday party.

255
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,034
Did you receive my gift?

257
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,194
Yes.

258
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,314
But

259
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,554
why did you send me a book?

260
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,554
I think that book is all
about sports economy.

261
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
It's very suitable for you to read.

262
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,034
But what I want is not a book.

263
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,674
I want...

264
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,600
Peng Pai

265
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,754
In fact, I'm glad to solve
the misunderstanding

266
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,088
and make friends with you.

267
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,914
You didn't go to my birthday party.

268
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,248
Do you have anything else?

269
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,800
You

270
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,008
went to Sichong's match, right?

271
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Yes.

272
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,274
Do you

273
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,200
like Sichong?

274
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,360
We...

275
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
It's unreal.

276
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,954
Peng Pai

277
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,320
My takeout is ready.

278
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll get it.

279
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
You're both here.

280
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:06,874
Mr. President.

281
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,474
Peipei

282
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,400
Look.

283
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,874
Mai Sichong's grades is not bad
even compared with provincial team.

284
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,114
Why is it so bad this time?

285
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,394
It shouldn't have been like that.

286
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,794
Pay more attention to him.

287
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,994
Coach Li of the provincial team
has always been confident about him.

288
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,600
And he asked why he didn't
take part in the selection last year?

289
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,514
I have a meeting right away.

290
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,992
You can think about it again.

291
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,314
Look.

292
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,920
The reason why he missed the
exam can't be found in his e-file.

293
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,960
We have to check the original files.

294
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,248
Where is Mai Sichong?

295
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,400
Chong wants to go back to
his dormitory without saying why.

296
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,954
Is he fine?

297
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,880
He

298
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,714
is not fine, right?

299
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,920
He is badly ill in the dormitory.

300
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
Or

301
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,674
you can go to visit him.

302
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,480
But how can I get into your dormitory?

303
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
We have a solution.

304
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,194
Rui

305
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,560
It's cold today.

306
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,994
Rui

307
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,194
What are you doing here?

308
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,560
Nothing.

309
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,674
Chong

310
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,394
Why are your clothes piled up here?

311
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,274
Ding Yi

312
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,040
Ms. Peipei is finding us.

313
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,554
For what?

314
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
About the training.

315
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
It's for you. You can have it.

316
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,440
Do it yourself.

317
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,474
When I was in the clinic

318
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,834
you went to have a meal with Peng Pai.

319
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,216
What have you talked about?

320
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,354
I didn't go to his birthday party.

321
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,544
So I apologized to him.

322
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,400
You didn't go to his birthday party?

323
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,514
Shouldn't I have gone to your match?

324
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
As a result, I didn't even
catch up with the match.

325
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,120
What are you laughing at?

326
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Nothing.

327
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,874
You lost the swimming competition.

328
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,234
You are upset, right?

329
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,874
And you are sick.

330
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,474
I don't mind.

331
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,120
Anyway, this is not the
reason why I'm upset.

332
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,194
I don't think our electrotherapy
is particularly effective.

333
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,834
Try something else?

334
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,954
It's OK.

335
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,074
I thought about it for a long time.

336
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,440
It's not because of electrotherapy
that I can swim faster.

337
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,754
Anyway, as long as you
come to my match every time

338
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,752
I'm sure I can win.

339
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,034
Why?

340
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,960
Because I like...

341
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
I want to buy two bottles of water.

342
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,034
Tell you a big secret.

343
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,994
What?

344
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,794
Weiwei is taking care of
Mai Sichong in our dormitory.

345
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,120
Weiwei is taking care of Mai
Sichong in your dormitory?

346
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,874
Lower your voice.

347
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,234
Impossible.

348
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,354
They two.

349
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,714
No way.

350
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,554
You don't believe that?

351
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,514
Let me tell you.

352
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,634
Chong got good grades in high school.

353
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,714
But when he went to
college, he was lagged behind.

354
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,394
Every time he sees Wei

355
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,154
he swims faster.

356
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,480
It's the power of love.

357
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,834
Mai Sichong

358
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,680
doesn't like Weiwei, surely?

359
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,834
What's the matter?

360
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,194
Are you jealous?

361
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,480
Don't talk rubbish.

362
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,994
Daixi, why not go to play games?

363
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,794
No, I won't go with you.

364
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,234
They're in the dorm and I can't go back.

365
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,160
I won't go.

366
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,432
Give it back to me.
