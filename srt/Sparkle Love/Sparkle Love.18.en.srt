2
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,940
Come on, Mai Sichong!

3
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm going to the provincial team soon.

4
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,060
Remember to video with me every day when you are there.

5
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,820
Eat well.

6
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,620
Sleep well.

7
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,900
And train well.

8
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,620
OK.

9
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,420
Don't worry.

10
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,500
I'll be back soon.

11
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,180
Hello,

12
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,020
what are you doing?

13
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,060
I am reviewing in the public area.

14
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,460
OK.

15
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,660
You can review it,

16
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,260
and I will accompany you.

17
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,980
Don't be distracted!

18
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,700
Look at your book.

19
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,700
Weiwei,

20
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
I will compete with you

21
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
to see who makes more dumplings.

22
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,660
Don't listen to your dad.

23
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,740
He has been making dumplings for many years, so ignore him.

24
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,060
Hello,

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,740
your package.

26
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,180
I'm coming.

27
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,340
Hello,

28
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,100
you finally answered my call. I'm so anxious.

29
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,940
I'm making a voice call with Mai Sichong.

30
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,780
Why are you...

31
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,340
Well,

32
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,420
Weiwei,

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,780
I

34
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
want to confess my love to Ding Yi.

35
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,340
I...

36
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,100
Mai Sichong is connecting me again. Hang up first.

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,580
Hello,

38
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,660
hello?

39
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Boyfriend comes before friends!

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,740
The movie's about to begin. What are you doing?

41
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Let's go.

42
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,060
Ding Yi

43
00:03:59,460 --> 00:03:59,900
What's wrong?

44
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,060
This is for you.

45
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,860
What does this mean?

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,420
That's what it means.

47
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,420
What else does it mean?

48
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,020
It means I love you!

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,100
Daixi,

50
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,980
you,

51
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,700
you love me?

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,900
Yes.

53
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,100
So

54
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,820
am I your boyfriend now?

55
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:43,980
Of course!

56
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,900
Let's go.

57
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,340
Why are you giggling like an idiot?

58
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,780
I went to my aunt's today.

59
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,660
My aunt's flower shop is going to close.

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,580
I'm a little sad.

61
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,900
If you like to open a flower shop,

62
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,020
we can open one together when I retire.

63
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,500
Hello, Daixi.

64
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,780
Weiwei, come out for the holidays.

65
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,020
OK.

66
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
Where are you?

67
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
See you at the cafe of our university.

68
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,420
Don't be late!

69
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,300
Well, wait for me.

70
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,260
It's done!

71
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,460
Good job!

72
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,020
Let's go!

73
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,540
But I really want to know.

74
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,140
Are you in love with me or Mai Sichong?

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,460
You care about him so much.

76
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Besides you,

77
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,380
who else can fall in love with me?

78
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,260
You're quite self-aware.

79
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,980
But

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,220
when are you going to tell everyone

81
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,660
about our relationship?

82
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,900
I think

83
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
we should wait until Chong is back.

84
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,820
Wei is alone now.

85
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,540
So

86
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,460
we shouldn't show her

87
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
how sweet we are,

88
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,900
right?

89
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:22,940
OK.

90
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,700
Then you tell Mai Sichong that we are all done here.

91
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,820
OK.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,580
Let's go.

93
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,220
Surprise!

94
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,740
You gave me a scare!

95
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,540
Wei,

96
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,260
Chong made several calls to me,

97
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,260
and asked me to prepare surprise for you.

98
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,300
Are you happy?

99
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,860
When did you prepare this? I don't know at all.

100
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,580
Chong is so busy that he can't come back.

101
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,380
The love between you two is too hard.

102
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,060
Don't talk nonsense.

103
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,660
Thank you.

104
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,700
What are you doing?

105
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,020
By the way, Wei,

106
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,660
Chong asked me to bring you a message.

107
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,900
The last time

108
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,500
the flowers were sent by tricycle.

109
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,380
It was not so romantic.

110
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,940
He hopes you like it this time.

111
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,820
I like this

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,620
very much.

113
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,820
Wei,

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,820
this is the last surprise Chong prepares for you.

115
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,220
He says

116
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,060
that's what you like.

117
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,060
Have fun.

118
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,420
Thanks.

119
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
This is what I prepared for you.

120
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,860
You just take up and adopt Chong's thoughts.

121
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,460
Please don't mess around with idioms.

122
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,300
It was my thought,

123
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,380
but Chong plagiarized it.

124
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,380
I hope Mai Sichong

125
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,060
can successfully enter the provincial team.

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,100
I hope everything goes well.

127
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,020
I wish you all health and happiness.

128
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,740
Healthy and happy!

129
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,220
By the way,

130
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,100
let me take a light painting for you.

131
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,860
Light painting?

132
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,380
Come on, you two stand together.

133
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,140
Get ready!

134
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,820
Come on.

135
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,220
Let's go.

136
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,620
OK.

137
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,740
The training is almost over.

138
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,420
Do you want to compete with me again?

139
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,060
It's not necessary.

140
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
You definitely win.

141
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
You're not in the right state.

142
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
Mai Sichong,

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,500
the coach asks you to go to his office.

144
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,940
The coach?

145
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay, I'll go first.

146
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,900
We've finally finished the English exam,

147
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,660
but there are still a few days before the exam week.

148
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,100
Let's go out and have fun together!

149
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,060
Go ahead.

150
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm a little uncomfortable.

151
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,940
I'll go back to rest.

152
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,740
Just let us know if you feel sick.

153
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Take care of yourself.

154
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,420
Wei,

155
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,580
here you are at last.

156
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,740
Li Daixi mistreats me.

157
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,020
Ding Yi, why are you here?

158
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,580
Their journalism department finished early,

159
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,940
and she asked me to help move things.

160
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,100
What's wrong with you?

161
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,340
It's okay.

162
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,980
What's wrong?

163
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,380
It's OK.

164
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,540
I accidentally bumped my hand.

165
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,180
Ding Yi,

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
can you help me clean up

167
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,940
and wait for me outside?

168
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,020
When you catch a cold or have a fever, your electricity

169
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,420
begins to be unstable.

170
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,900
Are you okay?

171
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,540
Let me stay and take care of you, okay?

172
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,420
Don't worry.

173
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
I'll be fine after a nap.

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,420
You can go back.

175
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,300
OK.

176
00:09:59,620 --> 00:09:59,980
Then

177
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,140
call me if you have something.

178
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,660
OK.

179
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,220
Go ahead.

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,620
Bye!

181
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,420
Bye!

182
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,620
Hello, Ding Yi.

183
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,300
Chong,

184
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,020
why do you call me?

185
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Don't talk about it yet.

186
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,340
What's going on with Mei Weiwei?

187
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,220
Why doesn't she answer my call?

188
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,860
Girlfriend comes before friends!

189
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,420
Well,

190
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,820
I'll help you ask Daixi.

191
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,020
OK,

192
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,980
tell me immediately after you ask.

193
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,860
Time is up.

194
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,860
Hand over your cell phone.

195
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,700
Why does the power suddenly go off?

196
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,820
Yeah, so suddenly.

197
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,860
What's wrong with you?

198
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,140
What happened to your hand?

199
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,300
Help me.

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

201
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,380
It doesn't matter.

202
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,620
It's just a little injury.

203
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,700
Just stick a band-aid.

204
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,580
Thank you, Yuxin.

205
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,700
It was annoying to break up with my girlfriend again yesterday.

206
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,860
I haven't been able to contact Weiwei these days.

207
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,700
Will something happen?

208
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,660
Do you want to contact Weiwei?

209
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,220
Hello, aunt,

210
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,700
can you lend me your cell phone?

211
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,700
Thanks.

212
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Wei is sick.

213
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,180
Hello, Junjun,

214
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,300
how about Weiwei?

215
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,660
She seems to have a fever.

216
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,220
She is resting now.

217
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,500
I'll be right back.

218
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
But she is much better.

219
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,420
Don't worry,

220
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,420
and we will take care of her.

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,220
Junjun,

222
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,900
please buy some medicine for her.

223
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,260
I'm going.

224
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,980
Thanks.

225
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,900
Junjun

226
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,940
Sorry

227
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,940
to wake you up.

228
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,700
I bought you porridge.

229
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,660
Would you like some?

230
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,300
Thank you.

231
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,980
Actually,

232
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,740
these

233
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
and the medicine

234
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,940
are

235
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,740
reminded by Mai Sichong.

236
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,580
Thanks, Junjun.

237
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,660
In fact,

238
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,780
it's the first time we've been apart for such a long time

239
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,020
since we knew each other.

240
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,260
He said

241
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,900
he's been calling you,

242
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,220
but your phone seemed to be locked

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,860
and you didn't get it.

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
I almost forgot it.

245
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,820
He should be in training.

246
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,740
He'll reply to you when he's done.

247
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,300
Eat something.

248
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,300
After eating,

249
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
let's open the blind box.

250
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:37,940
OK.

251
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,100
Thank you.

252
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,100
Mr. Cai

253
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,420
Sit down, Mai.

254
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,500
Mai,

255
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,700
someone says that you take stimulants

256
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,220
to fight injury and pain.

257
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,780
In this way, you got the first place

258
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,460
and entered the training camp.

259
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,060
I want to hear your opinion.

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,660
Mr. Cai,

261
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,460
I didn't do it, and I won't admit it.

262
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,380
As you can see,

263
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,780
the training results are made by myself.

264
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,420
But according to the archives,

265
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,380
your previous injury is also a fact.

266
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,700
My previous injuries have not affected my current performance.

267
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,580
All rehabilitation doctors can testify for me.

268
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,820
I have been treated for a whole year.

269
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,100
It is precisely because I have been injured before,

270
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,220
I cherish the days in the provincial team more.

271
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
Others shouldn't slander me

272
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,140
just because I concealed my illness before.

273
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:35,940
Don't worry.

274
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,140
We won't convict you casually.

275
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,020
But

276
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,900
you need to go to the designated hospital for a drug test this month.

277
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,460
No problem.

278
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,580
I can be checked at any time.

279
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay, go for training.

280
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm leaving.

281
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,980
I

282
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,500
didn't like making friends since I was a kid.

283
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
When I'm depressed,

284
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,100
I'll open the blind box.

285
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,780
And then I'll feel better.

286
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,260
Have a try!

287
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,820
OK.

288
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,260
Have a look.

289
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
So lovely！

290
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
It's so cute. I loved Hello Kitty when I was a kid.

291
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Then

292
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,060
guess

293
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
what's in this.

294
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,340
If you want to see someone,

295
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,940
just go and see him.

296
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,820
He's gonna be surprised.

297
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,740
But don't forget our class.

298
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,380
Thank you, Junjun!

299
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,940
Hello,

300
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,540
my boyfriend is training inside.

301
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
Can I come in?

302
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
Tell him to come out.

303
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,580
I can't let you in.

304
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,380
But he may be training.

305
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,540
Can you bring him a message for me?

306
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,900
Don't disturb their training.

307
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,540
Chong, you are number one again.

308
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,180
Xia Rui used to be on the same team with you, right?

309
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,380
Has he always worked so hard?

310
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Yes.

311
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:40,980
There is

312
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,820
a cute girl.

313
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,060
She came to see me.

314
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,460
That's cool.

315
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,820
Yes.

316
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,420
Miss me so much?

317
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,060
How are you?

318
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,020
Have you recovered?

319
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,060
How about the injury?

320
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,940
I feel better.

321
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,540
Let me see.

322
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,700
I happen to be free these two days.

323
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,460
I

324
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,460
help you disinfect it.

325
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Then it will heal faster.

326
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm not by your side these days,

328
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,100
and you must feel wronged.

329
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,020
Are you tired?

330
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,860
Go to the swimming pool to have a rest.

331
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,820
OK.

332
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,660
Let's go.

333
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,180
I thought it was the coach.

334
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,020
Chong,

335
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,220
your girlfriend comes to see you.

336
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,660
You are so lucky.

337
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,740
You have been training hard,

338
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
so I brought you some gifts.

339
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,060
And me?

340
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,580
Come on, Chong.

341
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,460
What else do you need with a pretty girlfriend?

342
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Yeah.

343
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,700
You're welcome.

344
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,100
Here you are!

345
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,820
Let me tell you,

346
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,740
many girls confess to Chong every day.

347
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,900
You have to keep an eye on him.

348
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,020
This is for Xia Rui.

349
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,380
Really?

350
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,780
Of course!

351
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,380
By the way,

352
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,340
it's okay for you to come out, right?

353
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,180
It's ok.

354
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,020
Swim two laps at most.

355
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,780
Don't worry.

356
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,060
Even if I'm found,

357
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,420
as long as I don't make mistakes in principle,

358
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,300
coaches will turn a blind eye.

359
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,220
OK.

360
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,660
By the way,

361
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,100
I have something for you.

362
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,300
How could you have this?

363
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,020
Because you like.

364
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,620
Weiwei,

365
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,540
you take the high-speed train here.

366
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
I don't have a cell phone

367
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
to get in touch with you.

368
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,940
What if I can't see you?

369
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,340
I'll wait for you.

370
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,780
Even if it's a day and a night.

371
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,460
Sweetheart.

372
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,180
You

373
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,860
don't hate the smell of durian now?

374
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,820
It's addictive

375
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
after eating it more than once.

376
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,340
Besides,

377
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,940
remember to call me

378
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,740
when you get there.

379
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,780
OK.

380
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll tell you.

381
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Don't worry.

382
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,140
Then

383
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,940
you go back.

384
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,540
Do you have something to tell me?

385
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,620
Train well.

386
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,380
That's all?

387
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,860
Come back in triumph earlier?

388
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,340
I'll come back in triumph no matter sooner or later.

389
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,980
The key is earlier.

390
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,980
All right, go back.

391
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,420
Or you really need to swim 20 laps.

392
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,420
I'm leaving.

393
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,500
Wait.

394
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,220
What are you doing?

395
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,380
What are you writing?

396
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,700
Stand still.

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,340
(This dog has an owner.)

398
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,940
(This dog has an owner.)
OK.

399
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,980
Next time someone strikes up with you, you can show her this.

400
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
OK.

401
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
I'm going back.

402
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,100
Someone says that you take stimulants to fight injury and pain.

403
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,540
In this way, you got the first place

404
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,340
and entered the training camp.

405
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,060
It is precisely because I have been injured before,

406
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,780
I cherish the days in the provincial team more.

407
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,020
Others shouldn't slander me

408
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,700
just because I concealed my illness before.

409
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,860
I'm leaving.

410
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,340
Bye!

411
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,060
Your speed

412
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,780
has slowed down a lot recently.

413
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,740
What's going on?

414
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,980
You are making progress

415
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,900
but I've been stuck in the same place.

416
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Why are you so upset?

417
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,780
Do you want to give up?

418
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,020
Anyway,

419
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,380
I will withdraw from the provincial team.

420
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,100
Quitting early

421
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
may not be a bad thing.

422
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,300
Come on.

423
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,380
There are few people who can win me.

424
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,180
You are included.

425
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,820
Want to give up?

426
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,460
Last time,

427
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
you get into the water slowly.

428
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,500
OK.

429
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,020
You can admit that I win.

430
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,060
How about another match?

431
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,340
OK.

432
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,980
I'll take a shower.

433
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,060
I'll run two more laps.

434
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Are you Mai Sichong?

435
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,140
I'm interested in you.

436
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,220
Let's make friends?

437
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,020
Sorry,

438
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,420
do I know you?

439
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,500
It doesn't matter.

440
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,900
You'll know me when we get along with each other.

441
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,140
My name is...

442
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,540
Stop.

443
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
I don't want to know.

444
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
(This dog has an owner.)

445
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,500
Bye!

446
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,180
Finally, the exam is over.

447
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,180
We can go home to enjoy holiday happily.

448
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,820
I invite you to drink.

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
(Exam completed! I've done well thanks to your supervision.)

450
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,100
Where are you going on holiday?

451
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,300
Stay at home.

452
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,940
Get it.

453
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,340
I want to go fishing at home.

454
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,300
Go fishing?

455
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,660
A healthy activity.

456
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,140
Weiwei,

457
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,980
it's half past eleven. Go to bed early.

458
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,700
OK.

459
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,700
Pikachu,

460
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,340
are you ready for my video?

461
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,860
Wait a minute, I have to change another room.

462
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,500
My parents are asleep,

463
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
so I need to speak quietly.

464
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,540
OK.

465
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,340
I've been thinking about a question recently.

466
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,860
When will this training

467
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,060
end?

468
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,820
I didn't think closed training was so hard before.

469
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,220
It's the first time I've felt this way.

470
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,460
You need to hold on a little longer.

471
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,780
Remember to train well every day.

472
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,700
And

473
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
don't mess with female athletes.

474
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,180
I seem to remember that

475
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,300
a female athlete confessed to me the other day.

476
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,540
Her name is...

477
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,180
What's her name?

478
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,340
How could I know?

479
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,260
As you see,

480
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,460
I wear the clothes every day.

481
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,140
Who has the chance?

482
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,820
Stand still!

483
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,260
It scares me!

484
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,060
Your dad and I thought someone else was in the house.

485
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
My sweetheart,

486
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,020
what are you doing here?

487
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,780
I'm learning English,

488
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,580
English.

489
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,420
I'm going to bed.

490
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,580
Learning English?

491
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,060
It's good.

492
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,180
Let's go.

493
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,140
Go to bed.

494
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
Come on.

495
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,460
Learning English is pretty good!

496
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
I have good news.

497
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,540
You can use mobile phones during the holidays.

498
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,060
This is approved by the coach.

499
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,020
Xia Rui,

500
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,420
you are back from the training camp?

501
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,700
Where is Mai Sichong?

502
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,260
It seems that

503
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,620
he stayed in the training center for something.

504
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,660
But I don't know

505
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,300
what happened.

506
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,700
I'm leaving now.

507
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,540
What happened

508
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,380
in the provincial team?

509
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,820
I feel you're hiding something from me.

510
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,260
Someone reported that

511
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,780
Mai Sichong cheated in the trials.

512
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,460
Do you know?

513
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,340
How can you explain that?

514
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,100
Do you know your condition now?

515
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,260
Is it a small thing?

516
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,460
Why didn't you take a drug test?

517
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,180
Do you know that if you miss this opportunity,

518
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,780
you will be farther and farther away from your dream?

519
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,060
I have my own reasons.

520
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,500
Stop asking, please.

521
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,060
I advise you to stop.

522
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,700
Even if I can't enter the provincial team,

523
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,060
I'll deal with you hard.

524
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,660
I have no idea what you're talking about.

525
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,700
Weiwei,

526
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,820
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,700
Trust me.

528
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,060
I won't give up

529
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
until the last moment.
