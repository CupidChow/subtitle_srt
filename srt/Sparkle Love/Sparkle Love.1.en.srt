2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,274
How can it suddenly rain?

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,720
How can I go to class with
such a constitution like Pikachu?

4
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,474
I can't come now.

5
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,234
Just figure it out yourself.

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,434
What took you so long?

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
The game took a little longer.

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
We will experience many
memorable moments in our life.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It may be a warm hug.

10
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
It may be an affectionate eye contact.

11
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
It may be a sudden
acceleration of heartbeat.

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,920
It may be a trace of
temperature from the palm.

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,314
It may also be

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
an unannounced touch

15
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,720
or a kiss that makes me flipped.

16
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
We call these sparkling pictures

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,336
hidden in our memories

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
sparkle love

19
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,954
Are you okay?

20
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
I have to go.

21
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,760
Sparkle Love

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,114
My name is Mei Weiwei.

23
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,634
Since I was born,

24
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,960
I have carried an unusually
high level of bioelectricity.

25
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,514
As long as my heartbeat exceeds 110,

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,314
I will discharge
electricity indiscriminately

27
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
like Pikachu.

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,154
And the faster the heartbeat is,

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,680
the stronger the voltage is.

30
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,794
But my electricity
didn't really hurt anyone.

31
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,274
It's just that when someone
gets an electric shock from me,

32
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,354
I will fall in love with the
person I see at first sight.

33
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,954
Such sparkle Love
certainly cannot last long.

34
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,554
It will disappear

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,160
as soon as it exceeds 24 hours.

36
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,114
If you ask me,

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,194
what else can my electricity bring me

38
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
besides such a useless skill?

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
In my opinion, there is only one thing,

40
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,834
that is,

41
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
endless troubles.

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Our class...

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,274
Mei Weiwei

44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,034
The class meeting is almost over.

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,514
You just got here?

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,274
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,704
I had an accident on my way.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,640
Right.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,504
Three weeks have passed

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,034
since the military training.

51
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I haven't seen Zhang Yuxin once.

52
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,394
You live in the same dorm with her, right?

53
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,114
Yes.

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,794
Please ask her what's going on.

55
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
OK.

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,634
Let's continue.

57
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,954
Although there are only four of you

58
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,514
in this class,

59
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,994
we are a team.

60
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,794
Lin Baihui

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,314
Here.

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,514
As the monitor,

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,554
please organize more class activities

64
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,794
to let everyone get to know each other.

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,914
OK.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,714
Let's stop here today.

67
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,594
Have a nice day.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,594
Excuse me.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,594
Do you have time?

70
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,954
I would like to talk to you alone.

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,034
I'm in a hurry for a meeting.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,960
You can meet me in
Lecture Hall this afternoon.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,194
Café Americano, please.

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,074
Thank you.

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,874
Matcha latte, please.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
Thank you.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,960
Yuxin

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,314
Ms. Meiling asked me
again in the class meeting

79
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,034
why you didn't come to class.

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,274
She has called me.

81
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,794
I have told her that I
work part-time at the café,

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,154
so I don't have time to go to class.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Enjoy your time.

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,034
Why didn't you come to

85
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
pick me up today?

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Where have you been?

87
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Weiwei

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,594
I

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,354
get a boy I like.

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,514
Again?

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
He is the NO.1 I met when I
interviewed the swim team today.

92
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,594
Excuse me.

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,754
Are you a member of the swim team?

94
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,680
Yes.

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,520
What is your goal in
joining the swim team?

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,794
I have no goal.

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,400
I'll be happy if I can
make progress every day.

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,434
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,514
An interview?

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,154
You can interview me.

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,514
I'm Ding Yi.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,514
What is your goal in
joining the swim team?

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,234
Be the hero

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,074
who comes in last every time.

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,274
Sorry.

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,714
I come not to interview the last one,

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
but to interview the first one.

108
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,554
He's coming.

109
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,994
He is Mai Sichong.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,714
His best time in the 100-meter
freestyle is 50.35 seconds.

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
He is the man of the hour in high school.

112
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,434
Hello.

113
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,714
I'm Li Daixi,

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,594
a reporter for the School TV Station.

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,154
I major in sports
journalism in Class of 2019.

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,914
Aren't you going to
interview the first one?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
Why do you introduce yourself?

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,280
Oh.

119
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,514
Mai Sichong

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,280
What is your goal in
joining the swim team?

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,714
Be the first.

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,394
But you're already the first.

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,234
Past accomplishments don't mean anything.

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,160
I want to be the first
in the next competition.

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,594
So handsome.

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

127
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,274
I mean that

128
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,274
will a relationship delay training?

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,656
How do you balance the two?

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,474
There is no love in sports competition.

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,154
I am the one who will fight for my country

132
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,920
and only fall in love
with the competition.

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,634
He is so handsome.

134
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,474
I have a hunch that

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,114
he

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,960
will be my last boyfriend.

137
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,714
But

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,194
I need you.

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,474
No way.

140
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,714
I promise my mom

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,040
I won't get into any more
trouble after going to college.

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,514
How about

143
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,114
I help you take Massage Practice?

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,394
The teacher

145
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,632
doesn't know you anyway.

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,760
Why did you say you didn't have time?

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,034
Then what else should we do?

148
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,314
Do electrotherapy

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,552
with your magical hands?

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
No one can stand it.

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,794
Ms. Meiling

152
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,714
I'm really accidentally transferred in.

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,714
Applying to this university is
for the School of Economics.

154
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,274
I can't give people a massage
because of my physical condition.

155
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,074
Please promise me.

156
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,914
You can't give a massage
because of your health condition?

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,954
Can you do whatever you want?

158
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,994
The regulations cannot change.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,394
Wait until you have a 90+
average in your first semester.

160
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,194
90?

161
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,714
Enough.

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,754
No way.

163
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,088
It depends on your grades.

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Ms. Meiling

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,234
Oops.

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
Jesus.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
You just ran me over in
front of the library, right?

168
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
You're the one in front
of my umbrella, right?

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,360
I accept the apology and
please be careful next time.

170
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
You...

171
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Kiss, kiss.

172
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,354
Chong

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,760
Are girls so open now?

174
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,914
Hello everyone, I'm Li Daixi
of the School TV Station.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,674
If you want to know about
the freshmen in the university,

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
you can ask me.

177
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,320
Is Mai Sichong single?

178
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,954
I can

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,314
assure you

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,394
that he is single.

181
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,994
But

182
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,840
he will probably not be single soon.

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,794
Well, it's getting late today.

184
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,314
Although we are students, we
should take good care of our health.

185
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
Good night.

186
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,554
How's it going?

187
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,194
Did she say yes to you?

188
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,514
No.

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,794
She said I had to have a 90+ average
at the end of the semester

190
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,154
before she would let me apply.

191
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
I don't think that's possible.

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,034
Just don't get discouraged.

193
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,994
Or you can promise to
help me one more time.

194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,834
In exchange,

195
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,274
I'll take a massage class instead of you.

196
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,834
This is the last time, okay?

197
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,514
I guarantee

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,280
you'll get a 90+ in Massage Practice.

199
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
Don't worry about it.

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,114
You must do

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,560
what you promise me.

202
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,720
Don't worry.

203
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,120
Junjun

204
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Thank you.

205
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
Weiwei

206
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,194
Are you sure she really doesn't talk?

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,274
Or

208
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,114
is she unhappy

209
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,194
because I move to your
dormitory without permission?

210
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,954
Don't overthink it.

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
I've only heard her say one
word since military training.

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
On your marks.

213
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,234
How long?

214
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,760
0.4 sec faster than last week.

215
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,274
Mai Sichong

216
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
Fighting, Chong.

217
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,754
Ms. Peipei

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,914
Don't worry.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,714
He won't give up

220
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,714
until he achieves what
he did in high school.

221
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,640
He won't.

222
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
How good is he,

223
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,914
and how about you?

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,360
Do you plan to punch the clock
for Mai Sichong all the time?

225
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,720
Can I?

226
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,314
The competition is only two months away.

227
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,274
We have limited entries.

228
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,234
But that doesn't mean

229
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,714
only participating players
need to attend training.

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,354
You all need to be clear about your goals.

231
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,594
Regardless of your future direction,

232
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,874
being here

233
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,914
is about laying the foundation.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,104
Continue your training.

235
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Which one?

236
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,274
The one in lane 7.

237
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,874
You even recognize him?

238
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,800
Of course.

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,434
They are resting.

240
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Go.

241
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,034
All right.

242
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,176
Take a break in place.

243
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,360
Hello?

244
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,744
What's the matter?

245
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,474
Hello.

246
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,034
I am from Class of Rehabilitation.

247
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,074
We usually take Rehabilitation
with the swim team.

248
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,234
I'm stupid and can't remember,

249
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,154
so I want to find someone to practice,

250
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,914
can I?

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,056
This is my student ID.

252
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Mei Weiwei

253
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,400
OK.

254
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,952
I'll find you a partner.

255
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,234
Mai Sichong

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,874
Come here.

257
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,112
Other students, dismiss.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,914
She is from Class of Rehabilitation.

259
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,920
Practice with her.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
You did it on purpose yesterday, right?

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,514
Coach

262
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,434
I suddenly realize that you are training

263
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,674
and it doesn't seem
right for me to interrupt.

264
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,194
I'll come here next time.

265
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,144
It doesn't matter.

266
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,234
Our training is over.

267
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,714
But all we practice in class

268
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,874
is massage.

269
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,514
It's not a good time to do it, is it?

270
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,754
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

271
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Just sit there.

272
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,834
Stop gawking.

273
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,168
Waiting for my invitation?

274
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,914
Swimmers

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,554
are most likely to be injured

276
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,128
in the joints of the shoulders,

277
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,034
followed by

278
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,674
the knees.

279
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,234
Knees.

280
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,714
How can I hurt my knee as a swimmer?

281
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,834
You stay away.

282
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,760
Stay away.

283
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,554
Chong

284
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,480
Be careful.

285
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,874
It was you in the auditorium yesterday.

286
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,754
You are the one coming
to the training base today.

287
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,714
I warn you.

288
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,834
I don't like you.

289
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,194
Please be sensible.

290
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,674
I don't like you either.

291
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,114
So what kind of girls do you like?

292
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,074
Sister

293
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,354
Please don't ask him again.

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,514
He likes nothing

295
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,114
but swimming.

296
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,496
Ding Yi, Xia Rui, let's go.

297
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,554
Mai Sichong

298
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,394
I still have some questions I
didn't ask in the last interview.

299
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,114
I want to ask you.

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,154
How old are you when you start swimming?

301
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,954
What makes you persist
in your love of swimming?

302
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,794
And

303
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,600
have you really never
had a crush on a girl?

304
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Hello?

305
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,088
Let's go back to the dorm.

306
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
People.

307
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,600
Why did you suddenly stop?

308
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,000
Daixi

309
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
I think I saw an acquaintance.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,320
But I should be wrong.

311
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,274
But then again,

312
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,794
the person you tell me to discharge

313
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,914
is the one who knocked me down last time
and didn't apologize.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
I really don't know
why your taste is so bad.

315
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,234
Every man has his hobbyhorse.

316
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,320
And you can't stop helping
me just because of someone.

317
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,634
You give me Mai Sichong's WeChat number.

318
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800
I'll get him for you.

319
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,914
Do you want to try my new lipsticks?

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,474
Yes.

321
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,400
Let's go.

322
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,194
I'm Mei Weiwei.

323
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,634
I'm sorry about today.

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,400
Can I ask you out to apologize in person?

325
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,714
No need.

326
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
My WeChat is not for anyone.

327
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,520
The message is successfully
sent but rejected by the receiver.

328
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,440
Dear

329
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,434
Mom

330
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,034
Don't I tell you not to drive this car?

331
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,834
The classmates must think it is
particularly silly when they see it.

332
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,754
That's okay.

333
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,954
You think I want it?

334
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,914
It's all because the nanny
van is being cleaned.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,554
Stop.

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,032
That car is more exaggerated.

337
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you thirsty? Here you are.

338
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,314
I've told you so many times.

339
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,834
Drinking is bad for your
health, but you don't listen to me.

340
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,474
Mom

341
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,954
You make fun of me, right?

342
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,154
You did when I was a kid.

343
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,034
You just play with me for a while,

344
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,194
and give me back to my dad If I cry.

345
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,474
Did you consider my feelings?

346
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,754
How can you say that

347
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,320
about me?

348
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,274
What's the use of having a son?

349
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,080
He is a white-eyed
wolf who is not grateful.

350
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,994
All right, I'll go back.

351
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,074
Wait a minute.

352
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Take it easy.

353
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,514
Mom, do you open a supermarket?

354
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Take them.

355
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,600
Remember to share with your housemates.

356
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,994
Bye.

357
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,794
Don't go in a hurry. I
have something to say.

358
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,128
What are you going to say?

359
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,954
I had dinner with your
teacher a few days ago.

360
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,514
She said that all those
materials were packed together,

361
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,034
so the report of yours is still in school.

362
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,314
What?

363
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,194
But it doesn't matter.

364
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,274
She said it involves the
personal privacy of the student,

365
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,514
so the public can't see it easily.

366
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,080
There must be no accidents.

367
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,474
Do not think too much.

368
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,434
Your father wouldn't have let me tell you.

369
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,634
But I think about it.

370
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,714
It's your own business

371
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,074
and you should know that, right?

372
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,634
That's why I tell you in secret.

373
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,514
You must keep it a secret.

374
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,960
I know and can you go now?

375
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,674
My birthday is tomorrow.

376
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,674
I'll come and pick you up.

377
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,514
OK.

378
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,040
Remember to focus on training.

379
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,634
Who is this girl? Does
she like me that much?

380
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,112
I'll lose if she calls again.

381
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,034
Who told someone my phone number?

382
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,960
It's not me.

383
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,024
I'll go for a run.

384
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,154
It should be

385
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,474
Li Daixi.

386
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,914
Who is Li Daixi?

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,154
She's the girl from sports
journalism who interviewed you.

388
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,320
She's quite pretty.

389
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,648
Chong, what's up with you?

390
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,034
I had dinner with your
teacher a few days ago.

391
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,834
She said that all those
materials were packed together,

392
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,120
so the report of yours is still in school.

393
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Chong

394
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,954
Chong

395
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,394
Why do you take the
key to the reference room?

396
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,474
Just to borrow it for a
while and you leave it alone.

397
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,354
I leave it alone?

398
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,914
I'm responsible if you get caught.

399
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,394
Don't worry.

400
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,514
You give it back.

401
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,440
Just an hour.

402
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,354
This is because you
work for the teacher, right?

403
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,794
What's your secret?

404
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,234
You don't come to the
university as an impostor, do you?

405
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,394
Stop guessing.

406
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,160
I will definitely tell you in the future.

407
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,434
Chong

408
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,034
There's monitor in the hallway.

409
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,634
Be careful.

410
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,920
Don't let me take the blame
if something happens to you.

411
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,394
Hello?

412
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,554
Hello, Daixi.

413
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I'll send you the positioning
and you come quickly.

414
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,554
Now?

415
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Yeah, come on.

416
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
OK.

417
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
Daixi, the reference room, come on.

418
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,434
Weiwei

419
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:24,914
Daixi

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,714
And him?

421
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,754
He must not be far away.

422
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,680
Let's go.

423
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,680
Wait.

424
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,040
Daixi

425
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,754
I have an idea.

426
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,680
What?

427
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,640
I have to go now.

428
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
Mai Sichong

429
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Mai Sichong

430
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,880
Are you okay?

431
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,274
Weiwei

432
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,520
You think it just worked, right?

433
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,914
I think so.

434
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,834
Great.

435
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,714
You don't even know

436
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,634
he just had stars in his eyes

437
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
when he met my eyes.

438
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,354
You think

439
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,120
why is he in such a hurry to leave?

440
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,034
Was

441
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
he shy?

442
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,120
Ding Yi

443
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,720
Ding Yi?

444
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,394
What's wrong?

445
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,392
Is Ms. Peipei here?

446
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
What's that?

447
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,114
I just picked this up

448
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
from Avatar Square.

449
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,234
Don't forget

450
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
that must be put back tomorrow.

451
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,120
I think I'm sick.

452
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,040
My heart beats fast.
