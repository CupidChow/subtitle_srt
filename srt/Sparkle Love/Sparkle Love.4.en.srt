2
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,140
I have been thinking
about it for a long time.

3
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,836
I can't stop thinking about you.

4
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,092
I just want to ask you today.

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,380
Could you accept me?

6
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,374
Explain it to me.

7
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,300
What is going on?

8
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,614
Let go of me or you'll be sorry.

9
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,852
Explain what's going on.

10
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,340
Well...

11
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:24,854
What...

12
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,780
What happened

13
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,780
to those lights？

14
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,894
You won't tell me, right?

15
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,324
I'm going to the police now.

16
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,620
Fine.

17
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,620
My body

18
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,780
is electriferous.

19
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,620
Electriferous?

20
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
Only when my heart rate exceeds 110.

21
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,732
Then you just hugged me?

22
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,260
I didn't want to hug you.

23
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,614
If I have electricity on me

24
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,694
and touch you

25
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,884
and look into your eyes

26
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,254
you will have the illusion

27
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,420
that you like me.

28
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,494
I like you?

29
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,694
It's just an illusion anyway.

30
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,076
It will only last 24 hours.

31
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,980
This feeling is

32
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,020
too real.

33
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,380
When I look into your eyes

34
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,548
my heart will beat faster.

35
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,814
Anyway

36
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,334
it's just an illusion.

37
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,260
Sorry.

38
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,254
Not bad, bro.

39
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,894
Are you here to celebrate
your love success

40
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,814
or are you lovelorn and
come to vent your anger?

41
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,574
Cut the crap.

42
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,500
Tell me the time.

43
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,494
50.35´´.

44
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,374
Well done.

45
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,694
Only 0.4 second behind

46
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,460
than your best score in high school.

47
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,500
Why you look unhappy?

48
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,534
What does that mean?

49
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,934
That only means

50
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,412
that my anger is at its peak.

51
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,924
Continue tomorrow.

52
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,260
I, Mai Sichong, will avenge the insult!

53
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,540
Sometimes I really want
to look into your mind.

54
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,094
Your happiness or unhappiness
can always lead to training.

55
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,374
I suspect that

56
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,060
you are a swimming robot.

57
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,694
Probably.

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,414
Anyway, nothing is impossible

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,540
in this world.

60
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,940
What do you mean?

61
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,414
If

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,814
I mean if

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,494
there was a Flashman in reality

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,588
would you believe it?

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,980
I can understand every word you say

66
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,694
but what is it supposed to mean?

67
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,654
Right?

68
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,748
No one would believe.

69
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,260
But it's real.

70
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,814
What are you looking at?

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,436
Why don't you turn on the light?

72
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,740
Ignore me.

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,116
What's wrong with him?

74
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm so humiliated.

75
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,454
You shocked me twice

76
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,094
and made me humiliated for 48 hours.

77
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,294
So you must make it
up to me with your action.

78
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,774
For the sake of acquaintanceship,
I'll give you a 50% discount.

79
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,374
Just be my attendant for 24 hours.

80
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,614
You're welcome.

81
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,454
No way.

82
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,054
Don't think about it

83
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,436
and we're not acquaintance.

84
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,614
Excuse me.

85
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,414
Ten Baozi

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,374
five duck legs

87
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,294
three steamed shrimps.

88
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,254
It's on her.

89
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,814
Why me?

90
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,694
I'm hungry.

91
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
I need to recharge.

92
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,580
It's on me.

93
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,420
Quickly.

94
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
Please.

95
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,774
Don't you think something's
missing of the breakfast?

96
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,700
What's missing?

97
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,614
The lights make my mouth dry.

98
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,940
I want a cup of milk tea.

99
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
Fine.

100
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,860
Please.

101
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,060
Peel the shrimp.

102
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,054
Mai Sichong, don't go too far.

103
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,854
What's the matter, are you angry?

104
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,574
How about

105
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,534
singing you the Pikachu theme song?

106
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,934
Pi...

107
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
I'll peel.

108
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,020
I'll do it.

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,340
Quickly.

110
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,820
Make it clean.

111
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,214
Welcome to the University Listening Test.

112
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,980
Please read the following sentences.

113
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,934
Hey

114
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,894
can't you record it yourself?

115
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,340
It can't recognize my voice.

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,380
I can do it,

117
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,774
but I

118
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,854
get sleepy in the middle of the day.

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,494
When I get sleepy,

120
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,694
I will inadvertently blurt out.

121
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,620
Fine.

122
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,380
I'll do it.

123
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,540
Sichong.

124
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,780
What happened?

125
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,454
Li dull xi

126
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,494
Don't you watch your steps?

127
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,454
My name is Li Daixi.

128
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,574
Idiot.

129
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,014
The name Daixi

130
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,334
sounds too clever.

131
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,860
Dull xi suits you better.

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,894
I have a question.

133
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,372
Mei Weiwei and Mai Sichong...

134
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,014
Never mind.

135
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,174
It's none of my business.

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,374
Right, it's none of your business.

137
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,300
You...

138
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,380
You have to give me a hard time, right?

139
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,254
You don't like me, do you?

140
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,334
For your primary school style

141
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,654
just save it.

142
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,294
You

143
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,940
are too old.

144
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,334
Who likes you?

145
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,734
It's the first time I've seen a girl

146
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,972
as self-absorbed as you.

147
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,894
OK.

148
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,654
That's all for today.

149
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,604
Continue tomorrow.

150
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,574
Why is there a tomorrow?

151
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,894
We had a deal for 24 hours.

152
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,014
One minute or one second less

153
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,300
is not twenty-four hours.

154
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,894
How about

155
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,892
going back with me?

156
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,734
I sleep and you do the laundry.

157
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,654
I'll calculate it into the
remaining 12 hours.

158
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
You are daydreaming.

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,854
The PPT I just sent to our WeChat group

160
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,694
is the presentation we will make tomorrow.

161
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,094
We will be the first to present.

162
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,694
You guys

163
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
don't be late.

164
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,316
Did you do this all by yourself?

165
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,894
You were all busy

166
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,774
and I happened to be free

167
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,094
so I just finished it all.

168
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,214
If we have group works next time

169
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,654
please let me know in advance.

170
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,580
OK.

171
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,174
Yuxin

172
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,140
you're coming to school tomorrow, right?

173
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,014
I have instant noodles on my desk

174
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,254
you can eat them if you want.

175
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Thank you, Yuxin.

176
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,534
It's all because of Mai Sichong.

177
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,260
I didn't eat well all day.

178
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,300
Mai Sihong?

179
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,980
So you can talk.

180
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,900
I

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,814
can talk all the time.

182
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,574
Junjun

183
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,934
you rarely talk in daily life.

184
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,374
You should talk to us more.

185
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,756
You have such a nice voice.

186
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,814
The coke on the table is mine.

187
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,654
You can take it.

188
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,604
Thank you, Junjun.

189
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,534
Yuxin

190
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,654
you are here today.

191
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,694
Weiwei

192
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,774
Someone changed shifts with me today

193
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,252
so I have nothing else to do.

194
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,460
Junjun

195
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,260
Mai Sichong?

196
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,134
That guy

197
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,516
is Mei Weiwei's boy friend?

198
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,380
You mean Mai Sichong?

199
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,574
It seems not.

200
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,254
Weiwei doesn't seem to like him.

201
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,294
But I think Mai Sichong is a good guy.

202
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,334
He helped us to do research last time.

203
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,854
First of all

204
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,174
let's finish the homework left last time.

205
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,940
Mei Weiwei in Rehabilitation Class.

206
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,460
What are you going to do?

207
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,494
What are you yelling at?

208
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,260
You don't want your
grades anymore, do you?

209
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,854
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,620
Today you are to give a presentation.

211
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,654
From the feedback from interviewees

212
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,734
we found that it is
more important to learn

213
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,294
how to better protect yourself

214
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,854
before exercise.

215
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,780
This is the project of our group.

216
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Thank you.

217
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Well done.

218
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,764
I have a question.

219
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,654
Can

220
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,894
electrotherapy

221
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,260
be applied to your major?

222
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,854
I hope you can ask some questions

223
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,774
related to the project.

224
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,694
Isn't electricity

225
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,254
closely related to human life?

226
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,140
How can it have nothing
to do with your major?

227
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,174
In fact, the rehabilitation major
has been introducing electrotherapy.

228
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,894
If the volts are well controlled

229
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,814
electricity can also be used...

230
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,094
Mei Weiwei

231
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,854
can't you answer my question in person?

232
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,460
I think you

233
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,492
should know electricity well.

234
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,534
Okay, our time is limited.

235
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,054
That's all for this group.

236
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,052
Next group, please.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,814
Medical Class

238
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,740
Wang Li.

239
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,774
You promised to be my 24-hour-attendant.

240
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,494
You didn't show up

241
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,174
so I came to you.

242
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,334
I just want you to electrify me.

243
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,134
Is it so difficult?

244
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,900
Can you stop mentioning electricity?

245
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,254
How about

246
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,494
giving you a nickname?

247
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,334
Pikachu.

248
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,260
Mai Sichong

249
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,060
Stop following me.

250
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,054
Why should I be like this?

251
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,820
It's obviously her fault first.

252
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,534
What?

253
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,214
Haven't given up on Wei yet?

254
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,404
Mind your own business.

255
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,734
If you want to call, just call.

256
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,134
You make me breathless.

257
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,060
Shot up.

258
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,854
What Wei?

259
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,894
Why did you call her
in such a cordial way?

260
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,654
I have nothing to do with her.

261
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,780
And you should stay away
from her, do you hear that?

262
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,174
No problem.

263
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,014
We just want you

264
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,348
to know about our company.

265
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,534
Okay.

266
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,628
I'm coming right now.

267
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,388
You can drive, right?

268
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,974
Thank you for coming.

269
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Come in, please.

270
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,254
You want something to drink?

271
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,214
Don't bother.

272
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,308
You are very welcome.

273
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,334
I come to visit today

274
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,654
because I want to talk to you two

275
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,900
about Sichong.

276
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,974
The semester has just started.

277
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,974
He's still excited about everything

278
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,452
and spends every day playing.

279
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,814
He's in the first year of college.

280
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,134
It is the age of playing.

281
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,974
He won't be like this for the senior year.

282
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,214
He

283
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,654
is at the same university with Sichong.

284
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,214
See?

285
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
He has started his internship.

286
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,294
Right?

287
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,534
You are from the
Southern Sport University?

288
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,014
What's your major?

289
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,374
I am from the School of Economics.

290
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,174
I've met with Sichong a few times

291
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,316
so we know each other.

292
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,414
That's great.

293
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,654
Mai grew up in the pool

294
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,894
so he is very unsophisticated.

295
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,534
Please help him more in the future.

296
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,774
Auntie, you're very welcome.

297
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,094
Sichong is very popular at school.

298
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,654
Really?

299
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,534
Of course.

300
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,814
He had a lot of fans

301
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,814
when he was in the swimming
competitions in high school.

302
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,574
Compared with other athletes

303
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,654
he definitely

304
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,420
has the potential to be a sports star.

305
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,574
Whether he's star or not is unimportant.

306
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,814
We only hope that

307
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,734
he is happy to play sports.

308
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,694
Wouldn't that be better for him?

309
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,614
We have all seen

310
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,020
Sichong's talent.

311
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,780
He could get a good score sooner or later.

312
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,534
Actually, we came here today

313
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,494
is to

314
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,020
provide him another chance.

315
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,014
He did not want to be
in the provincial team.

316
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,694
I think that's one reason why

317
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,300
he came to the university.

318
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,414
Things in the future

319
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,604
let's talk about later.

320
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Fine.

321
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,494
I won't bother much today.

322
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,420
I'm leaving.

323
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,054
You came all the way for this.

324
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,694
It's too much trouble for you.

325
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,054
You're very welcome.

326
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,614
So

327
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,974
If you two and Sichong

328
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,934
want to know anything about our company

329
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,494
just come to me.

330
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,014
Sure.

331
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,534
Come to me anytime if
you have any problems.

332
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,574
Goodbye.

333
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,054
I'll send you off.

334
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,934
Be careful on the road.

335
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,054
Goodbye, Mr. Zhang.

336
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Such a thing.

337
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,854
Senior

338
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,214
It's all filled out.

339
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,934
Is there any other procedure required?

340
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,054
Get your teacher's signature.

341
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,900
Get the approval from the chairman
of the Students' Association Union.

342
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,900
Who is the chairman?

343
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,460
Chairman.

344
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,780
It's you.

345
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,420
Hello.

346
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,780
Physical Massage Club.

347
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,334
Is it similar to the blind
massage near our school?

348
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,980
I think you are trying to steal
their business in the school.

349
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,894
Our major is rehabilitation.

350
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,940
Of course it will be
different from blind massage.

351
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,780
How many places left for clubs this year?

352
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,220
Only one.

353
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,574
There are a lot of students
applying for clubs this year

354
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,814
but the resources in
our school are limited.

355
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,532
I can't approve every application.

356
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,574
Senior

357
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,774
our monitor is professional

358
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,540
and he was born in
a rehabilitation family.

359
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,774
Could you please

360
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,574
give us a small favor?

361
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,614
Fraudulent.

362
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,948
Continue to be fraudulent.

363
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,574
Every club said so.

364
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,974
Fine, put it here.

365
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,220
I'll think about it.

366
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,614
OK.

367
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
Thank you.

368
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,774
Why is there so much
going on this afternoon?

369
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,694
We have so many things
to prepare for this event.

370
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,894
You should take more students
to help out this afternoon.

371
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,820
OK.

372
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,614
What is it?

373
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,540
I can help.

374
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,734
It's no big deal.

375
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,894
Besides, it's not appropriate.

376
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,054
That's fine.

377
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,934
It was my fault about the
headgear thing last time.

378
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,374
Please let me help you.

379
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,294
OK.

380
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,220
Take her there.

381
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,660
Fine.

382
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,334
Follow me.

383
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
Thank you.

384
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,294
Senior

385
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,094
I'm all done.

386
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,094
Do you want to take a look?

387
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,180
There are also some posters
there, please post them

388
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,454
and go through all the bulletin boards

389
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,974
of the school.

390
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,900
Fine.

391
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,254
What are you doing?

392
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,654
These are all wrong.

393
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,574
Aren't these posters from last year?

394
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,654
Oops.

395
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,580
You're right.

396
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,254
Weiwei

397
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,294
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,574
Well

399
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,854
they got the poster wrong.

400
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,820
Why don't you tear them
off and post them again?

401
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,814
I'm sorry.

402
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,974
I just finished posting them.

403
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,260
Please find someone else.

404
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,694
Weiwei

405
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,214
aren't you going to apply for

406
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,454
some kind of massage club?

407
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,654
This is a service
industry in essence, right?

408
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,460
It's also right for you
to serve the public.

409
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,374
Mei Weiwei

410
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,420
where are you going?

411
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,254
What kind of club do you want to apply

412
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,940
with that attitude?

413
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,932
I advise you not to mess with her.

414
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,054
Look.

415
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,374
Your boyfriend

416
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
comes to the rescue?

417
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,134
Weiwei

418
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
electrify him.

419
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,334
What electric guitar?

420
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,054
Didn't I gave it back to you?

421
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,628
I'm telling you to electrify...

422
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,094
They're a bunch of losers
who need to be punched.

423
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,854
Who are you talking about?

424
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,996
I'm talking about you.

425
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,014
Bullying students just
because you have some power.

426
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,780
You guys deserve to be electrified.

427
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,614
Mei Weiwei

428
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,134
work out these posters tonight.

429
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,214
Otherwise, don't even think about

430
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
your application.

431
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,940
Weiwei

432
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,340
I'm leaving.

433
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,300
Weiwei

434
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,654
Weiwei

435
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,580
Weiwei

436
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,894
It's my fault.

437
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,214
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,934
I promise

439
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,700
I'll never mention electrify anymore.

440
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,620
Even if my phone is dead, I won't charge.

441
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,574
How about

442
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,974
electrifying me to make
your feel less angry?

443
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,972
There you go again.

444
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,814
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,494
It's my fault.

446
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,774
Never mind.

447
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,054
You won't understand anyway.

448
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,294
I understand.

449
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,614
I really understand it all.

450
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,414
Look at the way those students treat you.

451
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,892
You are even fine about that.

452
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,734
I just said something
about your electricity

453
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,828
and you are so upset.

454
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,374
It affected you quite a lot,

455
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
didn't it?

456
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,460
I used to accidentally electrify people

457
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,340
and they will have a
good feeling about me.

458
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,060
It led to many kinds of misunderstanding.

459
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,180
Here you are.

460
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,934
Take it.

461
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,494
What are you doing?

462
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,420
Mom

463
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,414
Your teacher asked me to come over

464
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,844
because of this girl, right?

465
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,774
It's none of her business.

466
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,934
Don't say that.

467
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,334
Look at her, she doesn't
look like a student.

468
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,894
Mom, it really has nothing to do with her.

469
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,014
It's really none of her business.

470
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,294
Why are you like that?

471
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,916
You change boyfriends every day.

472
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,614
Even my best friend

473
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,540
left me.

474
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,454
Then

475
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,028
I transferred to another school

476
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,980
and met Li Daixi.

477
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,620
So I can't let anyone know
my secret no matter what.

478
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,452
Can you understand?

479
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
I understand you.

480
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,654
So

481
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,494
you worked so hard to change your major

482
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,940
because of this.

483
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,220
I have to change my major anyway

484
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,100
so I must get this club thing done.

485
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Mai Sichong

486
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,894
very good.

487
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,734
Your recent performance is very good.

488
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,574
Coach

489
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,094
Chong has done particularly good lately.

490
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,494
Last time he got a 50.35´´.

491
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,214
Just so so

492
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,212
third in the world.

493
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,214
What?

494
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,220
A little praise makes you proud?

495
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,854
This 50.35´´ is your high school level.

496
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,374
If you want to make a breakthrough

497
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,948
there's still a long way to go.

498
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,014
It seems that love can
really motivate people.

499
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,254
I think Wei has contributed a lot.

500
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,854
What does it have to do with her?

501
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,180
The semester has just started
and you're already in love?

502
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,254
That's not true, coach.

503
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,300
It's only a mistake.

504
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,014
Mistake?

505
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,054
Each time after seeing Wei

506
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,574
you swim so fast.

507
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,334
Faster than a duck.

508
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,374
I'm telling you

509
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,014
I'm not against falling in love

510
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,934
but you know very well

511
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,932
what I want to say.

512
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,454
Coach

513
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,774
I'm not in love.

514
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,494
Fine.

515
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Do bear in mind.

516
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,260
Practice a little longer.

517
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,780
Ding Yi

518
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,828
I have a very serious question.

519
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,294
Is there any way

520
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,614
to get an instant increase
in physical ability?

521
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,814
Stimulant.

522
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,654
Amphetamines

523
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,414
steroids

524
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
diuretics.

525
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,014
Oh my.

526
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,774
You are not going to...

527
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,174
No.

528
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,694
Apart from injection?

529
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,094
Inspiring your potential.

530
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,294
For example

531
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,374
bitten by a spider and
become the Spider-Man

532
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,094
or struck by lightning
and become the Flashman.

533
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,140
Then you must swim faster than the light.

534
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,534
Good.

535
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,628
I understand nothing.

536
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,254
If the volts are well controlled

537
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,740
electricity can also be
used to treat sports pain.

538
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
My body

539
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,380
is electriferous.

540
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,094
50.35´´.

541
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,974
Well done.

542
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,740
Only 0.4 second behind than
your best score in high school.

543
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,654
It seems that

544
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,228
I can come to Weiwei for a try.

545
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
Sichong

546
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,734
Peng Pai

547
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,174
Why are you here?

548
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,734
I came to look up
information for my paper.

549
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,494
You are here for...

550
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Me too.

551
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,540
I have to go, because
I have lectures later.

552
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
Excuse me.

553
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,534
Hey

554
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,374
Weiwei

555
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,374
Are you free tonight?

556
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,414
For what?

557
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,614
See you at the gym tonight at 8:00 p.m.

558
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,694
I have something to tell you.

559
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,454
What is it?

560
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,934
Can't we talk on the phone?

561
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,694
I can't make it clear over the phone.

562
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,374
That's it. Bye-bye.

563
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,300
See you tonight.

564
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,534
Mai Sichong

565
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,820
Why did you call me here?

566
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,628
Help me to count the time.

567
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,134
Why is it my turn to do this?

568
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,894
Where is Ding Yi?

569
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,220
Just help me out.

570
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,500
Ready?

571
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,460
Go.

572
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,374
How much time?

573
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,860
51´46´´.

574
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,260
That's 51´´.

575
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,654
Why are you yelling at me?

576
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,132
What exactly am I doing here?

577
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,900
Mei Weiwei

578
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,820
Please electrify me.
