2
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,980
Why do you bring me here?

3
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,780
You'll know when you get there. Come on!

4
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,180
I'm not in the mood for training today.

5
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,060
It's not training.

6
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,820
It's a surprise!

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
Mr. Peng, here we are.

8
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,740
Weiwei

9
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,460
Sichong

10
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,380
Where?

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,140
Mai Sichong

12
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,060
Xun Yang

13
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,780
Hello

14
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

15
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,820
That's a surprise!

16
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,620
Mr. Xun Yang,

17
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,780
thank you for your coming.

18
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,740
It's a secret that

19
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,420
I went back to university.

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,460
Say something.

21
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,140
What should I say?

22
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,500
Sichong,

23
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,140
have a chat with Mr. Xun Yang.

24
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,460
We go to buy some drinks.

25
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Have a nice talk.

26
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,700
Sichong,

27
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,340
Is there any change here?

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Please show me inside.

29
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,820
OK.

30
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,540
Xun Yang came back for

31
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,140
you today?

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,140
I didn't expect that he

33
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
would agree to my request.

34
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,020
Mai Sichong is so lucky!

35
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,660
Mr. Peng,

36
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,580
thank you very much.

37
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,980
Weiwei, do you care about Sichong so much?

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,300
Who cares about him...

39
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,380
The coffee is a little bitter.

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,580
I'll add some sugar.

41
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,180
Here is the same as before.

42
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,780
You've changed a lot.

43
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,900
You used to be in high and vigorous spirits.

44
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,940
You still know me when I was a kid?

45
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,580
Thanks.

46
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,420
By the way,

47
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,300
this signature is for a friend of mine,

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,700
who is also a swimmer.

49
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,500
He adores you very much.

50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,420
What is his name?

51
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,700
Mai Sichong,

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,780
Si is of Siyi, and Chong of Ling Huchong.

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
I thought of you at that time.

54
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,940
I gave you awards before.

55
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,220
Mr. Xun Yang,

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,660
I always have a regret actually.

57
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,340
You retired too early

58
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,620
and I have no chance to compete with you.

59
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,820
How about

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,580
having a match?

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,820
Right now?

62
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,260
Don't you have a back injury?

63
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,780
Just a friendly match.

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,500
Don't take it too seriously.

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,980
No,

66
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
I'll do my best.

67
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Are you ready?

68
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,140
Come on!

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,580
You

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,580
count down.

71
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,780
one

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,660
two

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,060
three...

74
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,420
Good job!

75
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,220
Thanks.

76
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,100
What's your idea?

77
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
Have you figured it out?

78
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,060
You mean swimming?

79
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Of course.

80
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,340
I came here today with a mission.

81
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,940
A mission?

82
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,140
Mei Weiwei told me

83
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,340
about your situation.

84
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,500
So what do you think now?

85
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,740
It is impossible without hesitation.

86
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,660
Don't look at me.

87
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,020
You have seen my choice.

88
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,460
The road of life always needs to be finished.

89
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,260
Different roads have different scenery,

90
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,700
but there is no right or wrong.

91
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,100
Today you ask me whether I regret,

92
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
I do have a pity,

93
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
but I don't regret.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,780
Because this is the way I choose,

95
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,620
I will go on firmly.

96
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,380
I used to think that

97
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,140
everything I thought could come true.

98
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,940
But now I dare not be as sure as before.

99
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,900
I don't know

100
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,380
whether I will win or lose,

101
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
but

102
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,940
I want to try again.

103
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,940
Try it if you want.

104
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,460
There is enough time.

105
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
Actually, if I don't show up today,

106
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
you won't give up either.

107
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
You already have the answer in your heart,

108
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,900
but you don't want to say it.

109
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
You

110
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,220
worry that it won't come true.

111
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
Before joining the provincial team,

112
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,260
I didn't swim as fast as you .

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
Weiwei said that you have always been confident.

114
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,420
Even if you are hurt, you pretend that you are not.

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,220
You even

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,860
kept the inspection report privately.

117
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,340
It's funny,

118
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,740
but isn't this the most important trait of an athlete?

119
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,420
Why did she tell you everything?

120
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,980
Is she your girlfriend?

121
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,340
No.

122
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,740
No?

123
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
I'm going to do something.

124
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
I think she's pretty cute.

125
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,100
No.

126
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,580
I mean,

127
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,740
she is not yet.

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I'm kidding you.

129
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,820
In fact, it's good not to fall in love.

130
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
You won't be so firm if you have a girlfriend.

131
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
At that time,

132
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,620
you must feel that swimming with men is boring.

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,060
It's better to hang out with girlfriend hand in hand.

134
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,060
She is special.

135
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,540
She is a huge inspiration for me.

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,540
OK.

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,740
Let's go!

138
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Yuxin,

139
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,940
do some exercise now,

140
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,700
or you will get hurt easily

141
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,860
You called me here

142
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,060
to...

143
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes,

144
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,900
the sports meeting.

145
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,620
Although we still lack one person.

146
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
We have already signed up,

147
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,140
so we should actively prepare for it.

148
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,100
Weiwei

149
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,220
has been running every day recently.

150
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,980
Practice it yourself.

151
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Myself?

152
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,820
Alright, just practice myself!

153
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,260
What's wrong?

154
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,540
I was pissed off by someone like a wood.

155
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
Like a wood?

156
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,820
Xun Yang!

157
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,300
Xun Yang comes to our university!

158
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,660
Mr. Peng,

159
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,900
it seems that Xun Yang has been secretly photographed.

160
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,100
Yang,

161
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,380
the photos you showed up at university

162
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,220
were posted on the Internet.

163
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,620
There are so many people outside.

164
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,460
How to deal with it?

165
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,140
I have an idea.

166
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,020
Please don't take photos.

167
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,460
This is Xun Yang's private itinerary.

168
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,340
Please don't take photos.

169
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,900
He made it.

170
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,420
They all followed him,

171
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,780
but this trick may not work for long.

172
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,540
It's kind of fun.

173
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,620
Yang,

174
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,740
This is not the time to joke.

175
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,980
Let's go.

176
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,620
I asked the driver to wait at the gate.

177
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,180
Mr. Xun Yang,

178
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,540
thank you so much for today.

179
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Sorry to bring you trouble.

180
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,500
It's okay.

181
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,740
Don't worry.

182
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,180
Take care of Mai Sichong.

183
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm ok.

184
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,700
OK.

185
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm leaving.

186
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Hurry up.

187
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Where is Xun Yang?

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Because of you,

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I lost the chance to see Xun Yang.

190
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,420
I...

191
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Xun Yang

192
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,820
Stop.

193
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,420
What are you doing?

194
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,980
That's not Xun Yang.

195
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
He is Chong.

196
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
How do you know?

197
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,780
I sleep with him in the same dormitory every day,

198
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,700
so I can recognize him from a single hair.

199
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Let's go.

200
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,620
Go to eat

201
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
strawberry cake.

202
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,380
Really?

203
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,300
Xun Yang,

204
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,620
I knew it was you!

205
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,180
Please sign for me.

206
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,980
Xun Yang

207
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Don't take photos, please.

208
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,380
Sorry.

209
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,980
Thanks.

210
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,740
Sorry.

211
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,540
Please don't take photos.

212
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,580
Xun Yang

213
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,780
Sorry.

214
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,700
Tell me if you get rid of them successfully.

215
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,380
Mai Sichong is quite interesting.

216
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,980
It would be fun

217
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,060
if he could sign in to our company.

218
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,660
I really want to sign with him.

219
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,660
From my point of view,

220
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,580
he is determined to take the professional path.

221
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,540
He is firmer than me,

222
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
not to mention he has his motivation.

223
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Yang,

224
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,860
you were too enthusiastic just now,

225
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,380
in case the company knows you and your fans...

226
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,460
So what?

227
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,180
Do you want me to ignore my fans?

228
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,780
That was scary!

229
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Do you get rid of them?

230
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Maybe.

231
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,780
You

232
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,180
find this place to meet.

233
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm exhausted, you know?

234
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,620
If you don't go around a little further,

235
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,380
how can we get rid of those fans?

236
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,020
OK.

237
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,900
Let's go!

238
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,780
Everybody's gone.

239
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,420
Oh

240
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,180
Alright?

241
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm a little hungry.

242
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Let's go to eat.

243
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,860
Let's go.

244
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,340
Go.

245
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,580
Yuxin,

246
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,980
Yuxin,

247
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,020
here are the snacks I bought for you.

248
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,820
Don't fool me with these.

249
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,020
What do you want to say?

250
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,220
You haven't been home for a long time.

251
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,180
Can you go home to have a meal with me?

252
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,780
Who are you like?

253
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,780
So stubborn.

254
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,660
Can you try to accept Meiyun?

255
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,540
Let's live a good family of three.

256
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,620
Live a good family

257
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,340
of three?

258
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,700
Zhang Weixin,

259
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,780
go to live with your Meiyun.

260
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,420
How can you talk like this!

261
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,740
So what?

262
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,180
My mom just passed away.

263
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,780
And then you're hooking up with the vixen.

264
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,100
Don't you feel ashamed?

265
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,020
What are you saying?

266
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,580
Who are you?

267
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,620
Why do you hit her?

268
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm her dad!

269
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,300
No matter who you are, you can't hit her.

270
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,620
You can't hit anyone if you are a man.

271
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,580
Not to mention Yuxin is your daughter.

272
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,740
hello

273
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,820
Mr. Zhang,

274
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,940
someone took pictures of Xun Yang competing with the students at Southern Sport University.

275
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
It seems to be brought by Peng Pai.

276
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,220
How could such a thing happen?

277
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm coming right away.

278
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,980
Yuxin,

279
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,740
let's talk about it later.

280
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,020
Yuxin,

281
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
are you okay?

282
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,260
Yuxin

283
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,420
What are you doing with me?

284
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,060
I'm shameful enough.

285
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,260
You want to see me make a fool of myself, right?

286
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Don't catch cold.

287
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,180
Come on.

288
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,380
Guess who won the match

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,620
between me and Xun Yang today?

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,740
Of course it is Xun Yang.

291
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,660
Am I so incapable in your heart?

292
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,460
Did you win?

293
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,940
You are awesome!

294
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Of course!

295
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,580
So I decided to

296
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,420
train well from now on

297
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
and join the provincial team

298
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,740
to win the champion.

299
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,620
What's more,

300
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,300
thanks to you,

301
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,900
I haven't flinched.

302
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,300
Actually, I didn't help you so much.

303
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,740
You figured it out by yourself.

304
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,620
Even if there is another person today,

305
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,620
such as Ding Yi,

306
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,500
Xia Rui,

307
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
or Baihui,

308
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
they will help you, too.

309
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,420
You are special for me.

310
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Actually,

311
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,220
you saved me many times.

312
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,780
Do you remember the person you saved

313
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,900
in high school?

314
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Hello,

315
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
hello,

316
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,780
You finally wake up.

317
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
It's scary.

318
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,580
Hold on. I'll call an ambulance.

319
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,500
Hello,

320
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,980
is it the emergency center?

321
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,620
Please send someone over here.

322
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,140
Please.

323
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,820
You are the person I saved, right?

324
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes.

325
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,500
I was still wondering which fairy it was.

326
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
I didn't expect it

327
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,780
to be Pikachu.

328
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,940
So what?

329
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,860
Dislike?

330
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
No.

331
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,140
Mei Weiwei,

332
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,740
thank you.

333
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,980
Why?

334
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,420
Thank you for coming to my world.

335
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,260
The food is cold because of much talk.

336
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,700
Let's eat.

337
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
By the way,

338
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,980
I almost forgot.

339
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,220
Why did you tell Xun Yang about my stealing the inspection report?

340
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,340
It's embarrassing.

341
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,900
Who let you do such a stupid thing?

342
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,300
Pikachu, wake up!

343
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,940
I'll go back to the dormitory.

344
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,060
Wait for me.

345
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,660
Peng Pai,

346
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,340
I've always trusted you.

347
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,340
How can you make such a mistake?

348
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,420
You took Xun Yang

349
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,340
to meet friends

350
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,820
and let him compete with others.

351
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,940
What can I save you now?

352
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

353
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,180
It's my mistake.

354
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,980
This is a company,

355
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,060
not a place for you to be a hero.

356
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,900
I know about

357
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,580
your family.

358
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,460
You've always done well,

359
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,100
but why?

360
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,540
Do you want to give up

361
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,740
your bright future?

362
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,340
Mr. Zhang,

363
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
thank you for your cultivation.

364
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,660
This matter has nothing to do with you,

365
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,380
and I will bear all the consequences.

366
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm leaving.

367
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,820
I don't need your appreciation.

368
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,380
Since Lin Baihui came to our dormitory,

369
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,780
Ding Yi has changed a lot.

370
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,580
He asked Lin Baihui to massage him every day.

371
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,580
Pikachu,

372
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,780
are you out of power?

373
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Why is your face

374
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,420
so hot?

375
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,260
I'm ok.

376
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,740
Yuxin

377
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,420
Weiwei

378
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
Are you going back?

379
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,940
The one you wear on your hand is a heart rate indicator, right?

380
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,820
Most of the time, physical reactions are not deceptive.

381
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,220
Sichong

382
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,660
Mr. Peng, I should thank you today.

383
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,100
If you really want to thank me,

384
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
there is one thing you can do.

385
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,020
In the senior year of high school,

386
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,500
Weiwei joined the track team.

387
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,860
I was the captain at that time.

388
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,860
She was the most lovely one on our team.

389
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
On Chinese Valentine's Day that year,

390
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,860
she secretly gave me a gift.

391
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
From then on, I knew

392
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
she had some special feelings for me.

393
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Mr. Peng,

394
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
what do you want to express?

395
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
I waited for her for four years.

396
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,940
How long did you know her?

397
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Do you know her?

398
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,100
Do you know what kind of person she likes?

399
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,940
Have you ever played games?

400
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
A person who often lets opponent players give up

401
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,180
will eventually hear the system say,

402
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,420
Defeat.
