00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
The provincial team selection match is very important.

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,760
I won't emphasize the importance more.

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
To ensure fairness,

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,160
a pre-match drug test must be conducted on both of you.

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
I hope

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,000
both of you can play to the best of your ability.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,000
And seize the opportunity.

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Where is Xia Rui?

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll go to the locker room to have a look.

11
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,640
I owe you an apology.

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Sorry.

13
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,320
Mai Sichong, a student of our swimming team,

14
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,760
was selected into the provincial
swimming team with excellent results.

15
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,720
As I say,

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,840
Mai Sichong is sure to make it.

17
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,720
Weiwei

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
are you happy now?

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
You are in such a hurry to take a picture and tell him.

20
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
Women in love are hard to deal with.

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,960
Provincial swimming team? That's cool.

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,880
No, you have to go back.

23
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Come on.

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,080
NO.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Why does the culprit not go

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
and the victim go?

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
You still come to see me.

28
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,920
Are we

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,240
still friends now?

30
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
You should apologize to Mai Sichong.

31
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Is he the only one

32
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
in your heart?

33
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,120
It doesn't matter.

34
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,200
I

35
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
don't hope

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,440
you lose your goodness.

37
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,120
I won't apologize.

38
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
There should be a price for everything.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
No one will forgive me,

40
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,760
and that's my price.

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Mai Sichong chooses to do the drug test,

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
and the fact that Mei Weiwei is electrified is announced.

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,080
This is his price.

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Xia Rui

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,720
you can't destroy other people's lives.

46
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,720
Instead, you can only destroy yourself.

47
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
If you are still stubborn,

48
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,200
then

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
this is the last time we meet.

50
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
Have you ever cared about me?

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
You should go back to your dorm.

52
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,520
They will forgive you.

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,440
I don't care.

54
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,120
Xia Rui

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
I know you are not a bad person.

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
As long as you admit your mistake,

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,880
we are willing to accept you again.

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Actually,

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,800
I

60
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
always want to say thank you.

61
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,800
Because

62
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,600
you are the first to notice me,

63
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,680
and,

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
are willing to know about my heart.

65
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,640
Junjun

66
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,920
thank you.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,080
Well.

68
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Go back to your dormitory.

69
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Where are you going?

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
I

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
want to be alone.

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
And think it over.

73
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,840
What should I do in the future?

74
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,840
Xia Rui

75
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,800
in fact,

76
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,760
you have never destroyed

77
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,560
your image in my heart.

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,080
It shouldn't be like this.

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,440
I shouldn't be the electrified physique anymore.

80
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,240
My heart rate didn't go up either.

81
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
It's just static electricity.

82
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,440
It's okay.

83
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,960
Don't worry.

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Anyway, the electricity has disappeared.

85
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
It won't come out again.

86
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
About Xia Rui,

87
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,520
what's your idea?

88
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,800
How about you?

89
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,920
Should I forgive him?

90
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
You already have the answer in your heart, don't you?

91
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,440
From the first day I knew him,

92
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,240
I felt that he was hard-working

93
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
and positive.

94
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,840
A lot of things have happened recently,

95
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
but I still believe

96
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,680
he is not what he seems to be.

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,840
He doesn't have so many bad thoughts.

98
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
I believe he is a good person.

99
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
When is our Mai Sichong

100
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,280
so generous?

101
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
I've always been generous.

102
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,920
Let's go.

103
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,400
It's ok.

104
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:58,920
OK.

105
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
It's all done.

106
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
We'll transfer your archives to the provincial team directly.

107
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Don't worry.

108
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I used to be

109
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
immature.

110
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
Coming to the provincial team,

111
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,840
you should work hard.

112
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Don't shame our school.

113
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,720
Understand?

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,840
After winning the Olympic champion,

115
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll hang my photo here.

116
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Famous alumni.

117
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Come on.

118
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
You're so narcissistic.

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,760
Thank you

120
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
for your cultivation of this year,

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,640
Ms. Meiling

122
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,000
Come on.

123
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm leaving.

124
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,520
Pay attention to your knees.

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,240
I will.

126
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Sorry, sorry.

127
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Are you okay?

128
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm ok.

129
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,160
There is an International College Students'
Championship at the end of the month.

131
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,760
Remember to come and cheer for me.

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,800
You're gone, too.

133
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,960
Baihui and I will be left in the dormitory.

134
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,800
He gets up at six o'clock to do shadowboxing

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
and meditates at nine.

136
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
What should I do?

137
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
You can join him.

138
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't stay up late to play games every day.

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,880
What if your hair is less and less?

140
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,800
At that time, Li Daixi will dump you.

141
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,840
This is for you.

142
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,480
Take a look at this when you miss me.

143
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Chong

144
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,680
I'll miss you.

145
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Come on, we'll see each other again.

146
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,160
Where's Xia Rui?

147
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,880
Xia Rui seems to be preparing for the
college entrance examination again.

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,960
He has always done well in his studies.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,360
With his hard work,

150
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,560
there is no university he can't pass.

151
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,640
That's good.

152
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,600
Chong

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
do you still care about what Xia Rui did?

154
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,960
Forget it. It's all over.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Xia Rui: Are you free later?

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm coming to tell you something face to face.

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
I told Ms. Peipei

158
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,120
I framed you.

159
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
And I've applied to drop out.

160
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,080
Don't worry.

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I didn't tell anyone

162
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,280
about Mei Weiwei.

163
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,720
And

164
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Xia Rui

166
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,040
do you know how I feel when I first see you?

167
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,760
You are silent,

168
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,320
disciplined,

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
and gifted.

170
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,880
You didn't do well

171
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
in the first group match.

172
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,720
At that time, Ms. Peipei asked you.

173
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,360
What do you want?

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,560
You said you want to

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,160
win the national championship through your own efforts.

176
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
From then on,

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,520
I regarded you as my respect opponent.

178
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,920
Xia Rui

179
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
let's have a match?

180
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,240
Have a fair match.

181
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,480
Are they going to have a match?

182
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,520
Of course.

183
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
It looks like a match,

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
but it's actually a reconciliation, right?

185
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
Who will win?

186
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,920
I think

187
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
winning or losing is not the most important thing.

188
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Come on!

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
On your marks.

190
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,600
Ready?

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,640
Go!

192
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Come on, Mai Sichong.

193
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,600
Xia Rui, come on!

194
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,040
Speed up!

195
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
Chong, come on!

196
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,440
Mai Sichong

197
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,040
thank you.

198
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,560
Come on.

199
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
Stop here.

200
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,120
See you in the future.

201
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Bye, Xia Rui.

202
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Bye.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
Bye bye.

204
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
It's late.

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,600
So

206
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,960
let's go back and rest.

207
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,640
It's a pity to sleep

208
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,040
during such a long and beautiful night.

209
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560
Cheers!

210
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,600
Mai Sichong

211
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,000
are we disturbing you so much?

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't worry.

213
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,760
I've inquired for a long time.

214
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,600
His parents are not at home tonight.

215
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You know a lot?

216
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
My home or yours?

217
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,160
Of course, it's your home.

218
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
This is the taste of wine.

219
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
My parents never let me drink,

220
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
for fear that I would get drunk and electrify people.

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,840
You can drink in the future,

222
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,960
because I'm here.

223
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
Chong, where did you learn these words?

224
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,760
You're good at it!

225
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,160
Look at you.

226
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
You can't learn it well.

227
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Who says I can't?

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,120
Mai

229
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
your knees just recovered.

230
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,480
These are medicine packs specially made by my family.

231
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,600
You'll use one in the morning and one in the evening.

232
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,000
The most important thing for rehabilitation is time,

233
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,120
and persistence.

234
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,240
Thank you.

235
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,120
You're welcome.

236
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,200
Baihui

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,280
you didn't choose this gift bag yourself, right?

238
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,640
Yuxin picked it for me.

239
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,560
Yuxin, what is this?

240
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,200
A knee pad

241
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
that can put medicine packs?

242
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,640
Yes.

243
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,560
It would go perfectly with my medicine packs.

244
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,120
Come on.

245
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
Let's have another drink.

246
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,280
We wish Chong a bright future

247
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,240
and win the championship as soon as possible.

248
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,320
Cheers!

249
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
Why am I here?

250
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
It should be

251
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
Ding Yi and others.

252
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,280
Chong

253
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
we're going.

254
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,240
Seize the chance.

255
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Come on.

256
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,400
Where are they?

257
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Maybe they're gone.

258
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
They cleaned up here.

259
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Then I'll go back.

260
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,600
No.

261
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,160
Are you hungry?

262
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,480
Would you like something to eat?

263
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,640
Tell me, what do you want to eat?

264
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,600
I'll make for you.

265
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,600
Does it need so much oil at a time?

266
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,040
Although I haven't tasted it yet,

267
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
I think

268
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,880
you are professional.

269
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Wait to eat.

270
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,200
By the way,

271
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,920
this

272
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,880
is specially selected for you.

273
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
Congratulations on your successful entry into the provincial team.

274
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
It's just static electricity.

275
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,720
Open it up and have a look.

276
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,960
Will you think it's naive?

277
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,400
How can it be?

278
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Who dares to say that I am naive,

279
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,520
I will never forgive him.

280
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,280
Don 't worry.

281
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,000
Except for training, I will wear it all the time.

282
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,840
Do you have any other arrangements today?

283
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,560
Today...

284
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,720
My whole day is yours.

285
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,240
Where do you want to go? I'll be with you.

286
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
Congratulations to our new colleagues who join us in 2020,

287
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,080
Peng Pai

288
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,120
Lin Kangkang

289
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,080
and Jiang Siyun.

290
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,520
It's okay.

291
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
You are so good,

292
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,840
and you can shine everywhere.

293
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,040
I heard that Xun Yang is going to America.

294
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,440
Mr. Li wants you to go with him.

295
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,000
If the market there is good, it will take two or three years.

296
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,040
Will you go?

297
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,360
Maybe.

298
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,240
I wish you all the best.

299
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,000
The same to you.

300
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,560
My sweetheart.

301
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,720
This feels fantastic.

302
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,560
Ever since I was a child, what I admired most is other children.

303
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,600
Because they can get into their mom and dad's arms anytime.

304
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,800
Now I can finally do this, too.

305
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,360
I don't need to be afraid of the electricity.

306
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,320
You've electrified us so many times.

307
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,040
dad

308
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Don't mention that.

309
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,760
However, your electric current is not so powerful.

310
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
It can't kill people.

311
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Besides,

312
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
it helps you find a boyfriend.

313
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Dad, Mai Sichong was not electrified.

314
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,280
He really loves me.

315
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,560
My daughter is excellent.

316
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,040
Just like you two.

317
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,120
By the way,

318
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,680
although it disappears,

319
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,680
you need to be careful.

320
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,320
Also, regular inspections are indispensable.

321
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,800
I get it.

322
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
OK.

323
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,960
Two beauties, eat strawberries.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,000
What are you doing?

325
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,920
I just watched TV with my parents. How about you?

326
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,640
I just finished a game with Ding Yi.

327
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
You know what? He is terrible.

328
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,680
He also tries to carry Li Daixi.

329
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,320
It's so hard for me.

330
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
I'm sure

331
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,200
Ding Yi says the same thing to Li Daixi.

332
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
He must be lying.

333
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,600
What are you looking at?

334
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
I haven't thought it before.

335
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,840
Looking at you, you look pretty.

336
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,840
Really?

337
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
That means I was ugly before?

338
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,600
No,

339
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,480
I

340
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
haven't observed a girl's appearance seriously.

341
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,600
Just think...

342
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm going to sleep.

343
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,000
Stop.

344
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,720
I have other plans I haven't told you.

345
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,440
What plan?

346
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,680
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

347
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,920
We'll go camping together.

348
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
OK.

349
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
Go to sleep first. I have to grab tickets.

350
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,440
See you tomorrow.

351
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,240
Come on!

352
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
See you. Good night.

353
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
Bye!

354
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,920
How can so many people grab tickets?

355
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,760
Let me try again.

356
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,600
Weiwei, it's time to eat.

357
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,920
Weiwei

358
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Weiwei, you...

359
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,200
Lao Mei

360
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,880
Lao Mei

361
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,400
Lao Mei

362
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,840
Doctor

363
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
what is going on?

364
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,280
Is she okay?

365
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,200
Weiwei

366
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,560
Last time you said that you used another method

367
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
to remove the electricity from your body, right?

368
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
You must tell me the truth.

369
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,960
Otherwise, I can't help you.

370
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
Come on. Tell us.

371
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
I took the medicine you gave me,

372
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,320
a whole box.

373
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:25,960
You...

374
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Are you crazy? Why do you eat a whole box?

375
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,520
You were anxious to remove the electricity.

376
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,600
Why?

377
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,480
Doctor Jiang

378
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
Is there any good way?

379
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,840
Please,

380
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,920
help us.

381
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,920
The heart rate looks normal.

382
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
But before,

383
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,080
her heartbeat determines whether she discharges involuntarily.

384
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,360
With the bracelet,

385
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,600
she can know whether she is safe.

386
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,720
But now

387
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
the results show

388
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,080
the electricity is more unstable.

389
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,760
Now,

390
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,880
Weiwei

391
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,080
I'll give you some medicine to stabilize your body.

392
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
Within 24 hours of taking it,

393
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,960
your spirit will be in a relatively stable state.

394
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,880
You won't discharge easily.

395
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
But

396
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
because it's a powerful sedative,

397
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,400
after eating it,

398
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
you'll be very sleepy.

399
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,040
In addition,

400
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,400
I suggest you

401
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
find a place with fewer people.

402
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,640
Stay there for half a year,

403
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,560
and her situation may change.
