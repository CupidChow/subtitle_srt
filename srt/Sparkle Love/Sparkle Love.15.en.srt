2
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,440
Dad, time to eat.

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Weiwei

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,840
I've checked it totally, but it works well.

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Let's have a meal.

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Pikachu

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,120
where's your electricity?

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,040
Weiwei

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,160
Are you sure to participate in the running race?

10
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,320
Your physical constitution is special.

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,600
What if you get injured?

12
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Mom,

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,240
don't worry.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
I'll be careful.

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,960
You don't know that

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,480
there's a boy in our swimming team,

17
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
who persists in swimming with knee injury.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
A boy?

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,960
Mom,

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
I will sort out the books.

21
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you here?

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
I want to eat with you,

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,640
so I asked Li Daixi for your address.

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,600
Why did she tell you that?

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,840
Dad!

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,880
What book do you want to buy?

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
I can help you.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Dad,

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
he's my schoolmate.

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
He has something to ask me.

31
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Nice to meet you, uncle.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,960
Can you swim?

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
You said you want to buy a book.

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Yes.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Hurry up.

36
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Where're the scallions?

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,960
I just poured the oil.

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
Hurry up.

39
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
You read this kind of book.

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Of course, I don't read this kind of book.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you have time now?

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
Eat with me.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
Ding Yi has recommended a good restaurant to me.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,480
Okay.

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
I have to tell them first.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Wait a moment.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,880
You said that if I gave Mai Sichong her address,

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,120
we can know the relation between them.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,800
But now, I haven't got any news.

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,240
They're dating. Why should they send you news?

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,880
But

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,200
do you reckon that Mai loves Weiwei?

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,760
They love each other.

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
You should tell me the truth,

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
do you still love Mai Sichong.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Or I'll...

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,720
What will you do?

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Listen,

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,120
I don't like him now.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,640
Wait,

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
I am not interested in him.

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
So who do you like?

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,680
Uh...

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,840
Here you are.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,720
Have a taste of that one.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,720
Come on.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,480
Here,

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
eat more.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,240
It's enough.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
Stop feeding me.

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,400
You're too thin, eat more.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
Are you serious?

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
You don't eat scallions and garlic?

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Wait a minute.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Mai Sichong

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
Did I discharge electricity to you?

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Nope.

78
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
I just feel that

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,600
staying with you

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
makes me more energetic.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
I don't know why,

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,360
but I want to treat you better.

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,160
I swam faster the other day.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,040
In fact,

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
it's not because of your electricity,

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,080
but because of you.

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's eat.

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay.

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Here, the meat.

90
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Hello, Daixi.

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,200
Weiwei

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,120
Did Mai Sichong come to you today?

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
He didn't seem normal.

94
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,480
Have you ever thought the possibility

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,440
that he likes you?

96
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm sleepy, and I have to hang up.

97
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,560
Weiwei

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,600
Mom?

99
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
I get you a glass of milk.

100
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,200
Thank you, mom.

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,400
Slow down.

102
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,680
You are going back to school tomorrow.

103
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
I have a question to ask you.

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,720
Okay.

105
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
Do you have a boyfriend?

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,280
Nope.

107
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Really?

108
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
Mon, let me knead your shoulders.

109
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,880
Okay.

110
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,480
Weiwei

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,080
It's normal to love someone at your age.

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,920
We expect you can find

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,240
one who loves you and can make you happy.

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,200
After all, you are an adult now.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
And we can't accompany you all the time.

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Mom,

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,400
can you tell me

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
what's true love?

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,480
What's true love?

120
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Weiwei,

121
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,120
if there's someone who knows

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,600
your special physical constitution,

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,920
he still loves you.

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,680
He

125
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,280
is your true love.

126
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Are you clear?

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,440
Thank you, mom.

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
My girl has grown up.

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,360
Weiwei

130
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm beside Ms. Meiling.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,240
She said we should get four students to compete.

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Can I run two sections?

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,600
No, you can't.

134
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
Can you persuade Junjun?

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,120
Talk to you later.

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,600
Why are you here?

137
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,560
You don't need to train?

138
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
You've told me you would come back at 9:00am.

139
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
I'm here

140
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
for almost one hour and a half.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Why?

142
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,240
Because

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
I want to have lunch with you.

144
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,880
Auntie

145
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,400
Auntie

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm helping her taking these things. I'll leave soon.

147
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,760
Okay.

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,040
Girl,

149
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
you have a considerate boyfriend.

150
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,440
Bye.

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,440
Junjun

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
You see, I promised to join them though I don't want to,

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
why don't you join us?

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,240
With you, we can build a team.

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,360
Sorry, I can't.

156
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I can't do it.

157
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,600
Yuxin, help me.

158
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,920
Thank you.

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
It's your turn to persuade her.

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,360
Lin Baihui has called me many times.

161
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,280
She always rejects me.

162
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
I want to help you,

163
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,800
but

164
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
there will be many people on the playground.

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
I'll be nervous,

166
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,800
then I can't move.

167
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,680
I'll slow you down.

168
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Thank you.

169
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
Why are you determined to participate in the sports meeting?

170
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,480
At the beginning...

171
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
I want to run.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,520
Really?

173
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
I haven't told you that

174
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I liked running at high school.

175
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Though I have a special physical constitution,

176
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,120
I enjoy the feeling of running.

177
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
So I want to run again.

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,080
But now we can't build a team.

179
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't worry.

180
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
It would be solved.

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,120
Take it easy.

182
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,960
Let's eat.

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
Mai Sichong

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Are you free now?

185
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,520
Junjun

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Why do you want to meet me?

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,760
Thank you.

188
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,040
I have a question.

189
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,480
My classmates want to participate in 4×100 m relay race.

190
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
I'd like to join them,

191
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,160
but

192
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
I've never participated in such kind of activity.

193
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,600
As I see it,

194
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,880
it's up to you.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Make the choice as you wish.

196
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,480
But

197
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm worried that I will slow them down.

198
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,320
Don't be worried.

199
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,120
Hey,

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
no matter what results are,

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,480
I'll always stand for you.

202
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,800
I'll buy you snacks of this year.

203
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,240
Agree?

204
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,680
Well,

205
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
let me think it over.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Well,

207
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,880
this is the end of the class.

208
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,720
Class is over.

209
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,560
Thank you, sir.

210
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,400
Guys,

211
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
I have good news to announce.

212
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's applaud Junjun

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
for her decision to

214
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,000
join in the sports meeting.

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
Now she is one important member of

216
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,320
4×100 m relay team of our Rehabilitation Class.

217
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:30,840
Bravo!

218
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,280
From now on,

219
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,200
we should

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,240
prepare for the race.

221
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,520
Junjun

222
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,640
Thank you for your participation.

223
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,960
To show my gratitude,

224
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,040
I'll buy you snacks of this year.

225
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,680
It's out of a collective sense of honor.

226
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,040
Thank you, Weiwei.

227
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,840
But

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,040
why do you

229
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
say the same words as Mai Sichong?

230
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,720
Daixi

231
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I think

232
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,360
Junjun's participation

233
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,320
is due to Mai Sichong's help.

234
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,240
What do you think

235
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,400
he'd like to do?

236
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,600
What do you mean?

237
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,360
It's obvious.

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
I've helped you several times before,

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360
but never succeeded.

240
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,160
Because

241
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
love can't be forced by the superpower.

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,400
At senior high school,

243
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,720
the one in the Grade Two

244
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
the one in the Grade Three,

245
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,680
the boy in another class,

246
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
and the boy

247
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,840
we met at the military training,

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
all of them just loved me one day.

249
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
And you still ask me to discharge for you.

250
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,520
One day's love

251
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,280
is okay.

252
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
You see,

253
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
as your magic can work for only 24 hours,

254
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
he still likes you

255
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,880
after 24 hours.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm sure that

257
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,520
Mai Sichong really loves you.

258
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Don't mention him.

259
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,720
You like Mai Sichong. Don't lie to me.

260
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,800
If

261
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,880
he dares to betray you,

262
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,840
I'll ask Ding Yi to

263
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
poison him.

264
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
As to Ding Yi,

265
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,280
do you realize that

266
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,920
after you meet him,

267
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,520
you have never asked me to discharge for you.

268
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,800
Really?

269
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,000
Sure.

270
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,360
Hold this for me.

271
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
Wow.

272
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Why are you here?

273
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Just pass by,

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,640
can't I?

275
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,880
This is for you.

276
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,760
You can take of it as a gift for helping me.

277
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
So kind of you.

278
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
Don't get me wrong.

279
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,280
I just want to thank you for your help.

280
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,520
It's

281
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,280
too ugly to get me wrong.

282
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
Give me back.

283
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,200
No.

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,280
Give me back.

285
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
No.

286
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,040
I have to go now.

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Let's warm up.

288
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
Don't get hurt.

289
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay.

290
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,480
Let's warm up.

291
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,000
Junjun, come here.

292
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,600
Hi, Junjun.

293
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,520
Junjun

294
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,120
You always wear dress.

295
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
It's the first time that I've seen you in sportswear.

296
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,080
It's good.

297
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,480
Well,

298
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
with Junjun,

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,800
our relay race team

300
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
is formally established.

301
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,640
Great!

302
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Now,

303
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,600
let's decide the order of our turns.

304
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,480
Baihui

305
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
I never run.

306
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,840
Any section is OK.

307
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,400
It doesn't matter.

308
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,600
Let's begin.

309
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,640
Have a jogging to warm up, can we?

310
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,480
Okay.

311
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,080
Well,

312
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,240
run with me.

313
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
Come on.

314
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Lin Baihui

315
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,400
You seem to be on a 10 kg weight-training.

316
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,440
Have a rest.

317
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm fine.

318
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
I can run.

319
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,520
The race hasn't begun yet, but your game is over.

320
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Listen,

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,280
I, Lin Baihui

322
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,120
will never give up.

323
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,120
Hey, morning.

324
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,080
Hey.

325
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,720
How much time did you run?

326
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,040
An hour and a half.

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

328
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,520
Do you want to go with me?

329
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,000
I won't. I wanna sleep.

330
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,680
Well,

331
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
you bring breakfast for Junjun.

332
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,120
Right.

333
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm going now.

334
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,760
I want to come with you.

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,120
There will be many people in the dining room.

336
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,440
Are you sure?

337
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,640
It's okay.

338
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,240
When we have the relay race,

339
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,120
there will be more people.

340
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I want to have a try.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,360
Good for you.

342
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,560
Don't be afraid of them.

343
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
You can take of them as Chinese cabbage.

344
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,600
Let's go.

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Chinese cabbage.

346
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
They're Chinese cabbage.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Chinese cabbage.

348
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,320
You don't need to exchange for me.

349
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,160
It's okay.

350
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
After all I should add vitamin

351
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,120
after running.

352
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,160
Thank you, Weiwei.

353
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,880
Well,

354
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
"Chinese cabbage",

355
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,200
the way is effective.

356
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
It seems that

357
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm not so nervous.

358
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,920
Good for you.

359
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's eat.

360
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,400
Eat more.

361
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
If you don't like running,

362
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
why do you force yourself?

363
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,200
I can tell them.

364
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,640
Don't.

365
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't want to let them down.

366
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,920
You don't want to let them down

367
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,840
or

368
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,920
don't want to let Mai Sichong down?

369
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,800
Baihui,

370
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Yuxin and Weiwei.

371
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,760
Now that I've promised them,

372
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,280
I'll try my best.

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
What's more,

374
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
I found that

375
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,960
running isn't difficult as I thought.

376
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,800
Okay.

377
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,760
Just do it as you wish.

378
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,040
I'll accompany you.

379
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm Xia Rui.

380
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,360
I know.

381
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,360
The sports meeting will begin.

382
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Let's have breakfast together

383
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
to cheer you on.

384
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,920
I'm wait for you downstairs.

385
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,120
I...

386
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,000
It's too much for me.

387
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,480
I can't finish it.

388
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,280
Don't worry.

389
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
Just eat what you like.

390
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
The sports meeting is coming.

391
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,480
You should eat

392
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
more protein and sugar.

393
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,680
In addition,

394
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,760
your speed

395
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
is okay,

396
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
But...

397
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,600
Don't be nervous.

398
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,320
Have this.

399
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Xia Rui

400
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,520
Thank you.

401
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,720
Come on!

402
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,920
Come on!

403
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,200
Why do they run so fast?

404
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,000
Maybe all of them run for the third section.

405
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,840
Are you nervous?

406
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
Pressing here can relieve stress.

407
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,200
That's what you told me.

408
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you.

409
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
You finally managed to take lessons seriously.

410
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,840
Why do you come here together?

411
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,440
I remember Swimming Class hasn't sign in the sports meeting.

412
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm here to cheer you on.

413
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Where's Weiwei?

414
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,360
I don't know.

415
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
She's not here.

416
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,640
Thank you.

417
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,200
Take it easy.

418
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,040
I've checked it.

419
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,600
The relay baton is made of wooden PVC materials.

420
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,160
It doesn't conduct electricity.

421
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What if it rains suddenly?

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I have to browse the weather forecast.

423
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,520
I sent you the screenshot of today's weather last night.

424
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
What if it turns bad?

425
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't worry too much.

426
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't take the one Peng Pai gave you.

427
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,040
It's conductive.

428
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,680
Got it?

429
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
Got it.

430
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,040
Let's go.

431
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Eat out?

432
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,640
Hey,

433
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,960
take an umbrella.

434
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,360
The weather forecast has updated.

435
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,560
There will be a few scattered showers.

436
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,920
Thank you.

437
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,960
You are welcome.

438
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,520
Weiwei

439
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Just try your best.

440
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,760
On your marks.

441
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,160
Weiwei

442
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,160
Come on!

443
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,800
Come on!

444
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Weiwei, come on!

445
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm here for you.

446
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,280
Chinese cabbage.

447
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,720
Junjun

448
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,520
Take it easy.

449
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm with you.

450
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:33,920
Come on!

451
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
On your marks.

452
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,080
Get set.

453
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,800
Go!

454
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Come on, Yuxin.

455
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
She runs so fast.

456
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Come on, Yuxin.

457
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,920
Come on, Junjun.

458
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Come on!

459
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,360
Don't run, go with me.

460
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
It won't rain soon.

461
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,360
I want to finish it.

462
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,640
Don't worry.

463
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,640
Hurry up.

464
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,600
What's wrong with Baihui?

465
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,120
Cheer up!

466
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Come on, Baihui.

467
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Lin Baihui.

468
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,000
Don't mind it.

469
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,960
We've lost.

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,120
Come on!

471
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
Come on, Weiwei!

472
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,920
Come on!

473
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,760
Weiwei

474
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm fine.

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Don't worry.

476
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,240
I can stand up by myself.

477
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,920
Thank you.

478
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
It's going to rain. Let's go.

479
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,360
Leave me alone.

480
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,360
I'll hurt you because my electricity is out of control.

481
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,000
Don't be afraid.

482
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,320
I'm here.

483
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,840
Mai Sichong

484
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,920
Thank you.

485
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,560
I'll always be with you.

486
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,000
Weiwei

487
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I love you.

488
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,840
I

489
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,360
love you, too.
