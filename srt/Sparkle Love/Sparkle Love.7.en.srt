00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,754
Fan Zengxiang, the former chairman of
Students' Association Union of our school,

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,834
embezzled the public funds of the union.

4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,834
The circumstances were bad

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,215
and he was relieved
of his post as chairman

6
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:57,314
of the Students' Association Union.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,408
A fine was imposed...

8
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,160
It's ok.

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,114
I know about the thing about
chairman of Students' Association Union.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,234
You have done a good job.

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,594
Come on in the future!

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,634
Thanks.

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,874
Okay, I still have classes.

14
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm leaving.

15
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,600
Thanks, Mr. Peng.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Why didn't she give me the message?

17
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,714
According to this inspection report,

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,994
he is recovering well.

19
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,154
But it is still somewhat difficult

20
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,834
to recover to the state before the injury.

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,794
Don't worry, auntie.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I can do it myself.

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,074
Is this Junjun?

24
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,714
Yes.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,994
She has grown up.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,594
I remember her as a little girl.

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,594
By the way,

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,594
perhaps you do not know that

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,154
Mai Sichong and Junjun

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,536
are in the same university.

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,434
Which class are you in?

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,714
I'm

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,288
in the Class of Rehabilitation.

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,754
Then

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,834
you and Mei Weiwei are in
the same dormitory, right?

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,314
Yes.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,474
When you were kids,

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,354
you two played together every day.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,954
Since you moved,

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,914
Junjun

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,488
didn't have a playmate anymore.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,674
Why don't I remember?

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,754
When did it happen?

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,874
What can you remember?

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
You only remember some funny things.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,074
Then,

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,514
mom, auntie,

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,114
I'll go back to school first.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,634
Don't you go back to school, Mai?

50
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,714
You can go together!

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
OK, let's go.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,034
Be careful on the road.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,394
OK.

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,474
Be careful.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
Bye!

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,074
Junjun,

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,114
your phone is upside down.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Thanks.

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,194
By the way, Junjun,

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,600
are you supposed to
have class at this time?

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,914
You

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,520
want to know Weiwei's
class schedule, right?

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
Are you two familiar?

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,994
I

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,874
I am completely not familiar with her.

66
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,274
How can I be familiar

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
with her?

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
What's this?

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
This is

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
for you.

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
For me?

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,240
Thanks.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
Pretty cool.

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,960
It looks like me,

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
right?

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
I make it!

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
Why are you here?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,056
To return your gloves.

79
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Thanks.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,074
Great!

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,874
Weiwei,

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,874
I heard that the misappropriation
of public funds by Fan was exposed.

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,074
Did you do it?

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,874
No.

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,074
This is a long story.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,312
I'll tell you next time.

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,354
Now tell him

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,234
who helped you deal with that man.

89
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,834
Well,

90
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,674
it's Mr. Peng.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,834
Thanks to him, our club can
apply successfully this time.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,034
Really?

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
What?

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Who?

95
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Mr. Peng

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,754
OK, stop talking about that.
Let's talk about the club activities.

97
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,874
I have ideas!

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Mei Weiwei

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
What's wrong?

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,554
Weiwei,

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,552
what's up with him?

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,874
He is crazy.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,914
Come,

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,434
come on!

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,274
Let me show you.

106
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,034
I wrote 3941 words.

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,714
Look!

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,856
This is the first one.

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,394
OK.

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,594
That's all for today.

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Class is over.

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,714
Don't miss it when you pass by.

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,114
Please have a look.

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,794
The first Massage Club

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
Impart professional skills selflessly.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,776
You can learn it well.

117
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,794
Look,

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
have a look!

119
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,114
Weiwei,

120
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,994
We're almost done.

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,920
Let's go outside.

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,314
Hi

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,954
Have a look at the first
Physical Massage Club.

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,720
We impart professional skills for free.

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,954
Hi,

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,144
please give me a flyer.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Here you are.

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,634
Mr. Peng

129
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,474
You can't call on others here.

130
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,434
You should go to the gym.

131
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,576
There are more people.

132
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,914
Weiwei,

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,434
I bought you milk tea.

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,194
Thank you.

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,120
Mr. Peng,

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,434
milk tea is bad for health

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,200
because there is too much sugar in it.

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,754
Mr. Peng,

139
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,240
I haven't thanked you for
helping us with the club last time.

140
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
What?

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,914
You're Mr. Peng?

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,840
Hello, Mr. Peng.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,554
We'll move to the gym and hand out flyers.

144
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,794
Thanks.

145
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,394
Mr. Peng,

146
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,074
thanks.

147
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Be careful.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,480
It's free!

149
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,874
Have a look!

150
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,874
Have a look at the Physical Massage Club.

151
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,474
It's free.

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
Free!

153
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,314
You don't reply to my message

154
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,874
but to distribute the flyer here.

155
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
You look busy.

156
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,594
I was too busy in class just now,

157
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,234
so I forgot to reply.

158
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,120
You won't get angry
because of this, will you?

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
How could I?

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,354
You don't know how to send out flyers.

161
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,496
Why are you so stupid?

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,234
It's like you have a way.

163
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,834
It is easy for you to say!

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,154
In your way,

165
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,754
it can be finished after graduation.

166
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,120
Look at me!

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Hurry up!

168
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,274
246

169
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,674
247

170
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,994
248

171
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,914
249

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
250 people

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,234
Mai,

174
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,034
thank you very much!

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,674
If I can be like you,

176
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,994
the recovery of Massage Club

177
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,328
will be around the corner.

178
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,034
It's a piece of cake.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,520
I just don't want her
to delay my training.

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,674
Weiwei,

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,554
are you going to train with Mr. Mai?

182
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,074
Can you swim?

183
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,954
No. Ding Yi has something else recently.

184
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,714
I help him about the timekeeping.

185
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,114
OK,

186
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,994
stop talking about this.

187
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,874
Let's think about the
club activities first.

188
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,794
Yes.

189
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
Club activities?

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,440
What can a Massage Club do?

191
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,680
About this,

192
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,056
I have already thought about it.

193
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,274
You'd better come down.

194
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Let me think about the
content of the activity.

195
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
That's ok.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,754
Weiwei,

197
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,434
Mr. Peng has helped us
with the club application.

198
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,474
Stop it.

199
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,000
What's the relationship between
Peng Pai and club application?

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,274
He exposed Fan Zengxiang,

201
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,154
which made our club run smoothly.

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,114
He exposed?

203
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,274
It was he who exposed Fan Zengxiang.

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,754
Actually...

205
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,834
Also,

206
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,674
our classmate Mai Sichong
helped us a lot today.

207
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,816
He is the second hero.

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,714
Do it by yourselves!

209
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,288
I have something else. I'll go.

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,394
Mr. Mai,

211
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,714
I'll give you some massage tickets later.

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,640
I don't need.

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,040
Yuxin,

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,954
is there any strawberry cake?

215
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,754
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
He bought the last piece.

217
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,994
It's you again!

218
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,634
You bought my strawberry cake!

219
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,234
Your strawberry cake?

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,994
You call it

221
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,794
and see it responds to you or not.

222
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
You...

223
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,272
What's wrong? In a bad mood again?

224
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,680
Are you still having trouble
with my brother's girlfriend?

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,114
Don't talk nonsense here.

226
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,880
She's not your brother's girlfriend.

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,194
Do you mind?

228
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,434
I advise you to give up Chong.

229
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,194
You are homely.

230
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,192
There is no chance.

231
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,554
You're ugly!

232
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,874
Your body looks like a frog,

233
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,834
and you look like a squirrel!

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,274
You...

235
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,560
So what?

236
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,114
I tell you,

237
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,554
I'm not interested in Mai
Sichong for a long time.

238
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,714
Weiwei doesn't like being gossip outside,

239
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,354
so you'd better not talk nonsense here.

240
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,320
She'll be upset.

241
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
You haven't used the fork, have you?

242
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,314
It's used by you.

243
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,394
How can I use it?

244
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
I reward it to you.

245
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,914
What time is your activity?

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,674
I'll come to have a look after work.

247
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,600
Ok.

248
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,194
What are you doing?

249
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,114
How can this be conductive?

250
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,474
So what?

251
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,834
Do you want to hold hands again?

252
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,312
Do you want to hold my hands?

253
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,634
Who want to hold your hands?

254
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,400
You asked me to come and help you.

255
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,074
Well...

256
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,834
Do what others ask you to do?

257
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,354
Someone asks you to set up
a club, and you set up a club?

258
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,914
Someone gives you
milk tea, then you drink it?

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,714
Can you have your own opinion?

260
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,320
You ask me to help you,
but you're blaming me.

261
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
Forget it.

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,920
I'm not in the mood.

263
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
Why are you angry?

264
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,234
Why am I angry?

265
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,154
Mei Weiwei, I tell you

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,584
that the club is actually...

267
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,376
what's the matter with you?

268
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,994
Don't worry.

269
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,120
It's just the days that all girls have.

270
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
Come on!

271
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Hurry up!

272
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
What's up?

273
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,834
Put me down.

274
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,928
I'm not feeling well.

275
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
Be careful.

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,794
I don't seem to

277
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
feel that bad anymore.

278
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,994
Weiwei

279
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,234
Daixi

280
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,232
What are you doing?

281
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,354
She

282
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,514
is not feeling well.

283
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,440
I send her back.

284
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
Thanks.

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,914
Weiwei,

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,994
sit down.

287
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
I'll make some brown sugar water for you.

288
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,354
Daixi,

289
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
are you back?

290
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,000
Why did you even change
the style of the sheets?

291
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,194
I think it's pretty cute recently.

292
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
So I change it.

293
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,994
Come on.

294
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,914
Drink the brown sugar water.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,914
Thanks.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
It's hot.

297
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,354
The affections you get by
electrifying are not reliable.

298
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,354
Falling in love at first electrifying

299
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
is really...

300
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,800
Junjun, you're back.

301
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,474
She just...

302
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,794
Did she hear me?

303
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
It's OK. I don't think she heard you.

304
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,634
Are you sure?

305
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,394
Yes.

306
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't worry.

307
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,914
It can't be true?

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,488
I was electrified by her again?

309
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Whatever. Sleep.

310
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Weiwei,

311
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,594
You haven't told me

312
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,920
what our theme is today?

313
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,354
Isn't this clear?

314
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,928
Disco dancing in a healthy way!

315
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,754
Disco dancing in a healthy way?

316
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,314
But we can't drink wines.

317
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Soda water...

318
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,434
Why are you here?

319
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm here to see if I can help.

320
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,674
Isn't this syrup?

321
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,394
I tell you

322
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,874
this is very bad for health.

323
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,034
It contains food flavors
and food colorants.

324
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm going to hang
up the fairy lights first.

325
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,834
Mr. Mai,

326
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
have a try.

327
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,114
Add some wolfberry.

328
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Wolfberry?

329
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,400
Why hadn't I thought about it?

330
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
Give it to me.

331
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,240
Thanks.

332
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,080
You are not tall enough to hang it.

333
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,514
Who is short?

334
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
You really...

335
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,234
Li Daixi,

336
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,434
I wonder why you move things with me?

337
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,274
You just want to exploit me.

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,234
No.

339
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,794
It's your honor

340
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,994
to help me carry things.

341
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,514
You...

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,114
You can see clearly now

343
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,354
that's me.

344
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,474
So,

345
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,960
don't fall in love with me.

346
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,432
I fall in love with you?

347
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,074
Do you know the name
of Zhang Ziyi's daughter?

348
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,914
What?

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,914
Xingxing,

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,074
please wake up!

351
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
You...

352
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
It's not bad.

353
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
No, thanks.

354
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,914
Everybody,

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,554
next,

356
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,194
we are going to welcome
the most important activity

357
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,634
of our health-preserving party,

358
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,968
health-preserving lecture.

359
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,994
Next I need a volunteer.

360
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,154
If you are interested,

361
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
please step forward.

362
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,074
Who would like to be the volunteer?

363
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
He!

364
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,914
Let's welcome Ding Yi!

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,040
Great!

366
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,114
Well.

367
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,794
Please lie here.

368
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,834
Today I will tell you about

369
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,314
an acupuncture point called Shenshu.

370
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,994
It is between the ribs.

371
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,154
Find this position,

372
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,554
and see if his kidney is healthy.

373
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,720
Press it.

374
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,354
Mr. Lin now presses
Shenshu Point for this student.

375
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,274
He screams so violently.

376
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,840
It can be seen that
the kidney is not good.

377
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,314
What?

378
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,154
Li Daixi, are you on purpose?

379
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,320
Relax.

380
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,514
Pay attention to this technique,

381
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,040
and the strength.

382
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,328
Mr. Peng, why do you come here?

383
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,074
You can share it later.

384
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,874
I'm going back to work overtime.

385
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,634
Thanks.

386
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,074
Actually, you don't have to come here.

387
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,594
You're so busy.

388
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,154
Your things are important for me.

389
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,434
If it wasn't for my internship,

390
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,104
I would play with you until dawn.

391
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,874
By the way,

392
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,874
I didn't thank you for
your help with the club.

393
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,434
Thank you.

394
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
It doesn't matter.
That's what I should do.

395
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,034
I'm leaving.

396
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,674
OK.

397
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
Bye!

398
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
I have something to
tell you. Come with me.

399
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,394
What are you doing?

400
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,632
What do you want to say?

401
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,944
You have to come out to say?

402
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,434
I ask you,

403
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,200
is there anything between
you and Peng Pai?

404
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,120
What's the matter?

405
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,744
Answer my question directly.

406
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,114
Answer what?

407
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
What are you doing?

408
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,914
Chong,

409
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,520
we don't see anything.

410
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,994
Go on,

411
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,920
go on.

412
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,384
Not in your right mind.

413
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,674
In such a flurry,

414
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
she must like Peng Pai.

415
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
Okay, Ding Yi.

416
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,634
Thank you all for participating
in our lecture today.

417
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,114
Then let's continue our activities.

418
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,034
Come on!

419
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
Good.

420
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,674
Your massage skill is good.

421
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,434
Thank you.

422
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,074
OK.

423
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,040
Then you continue to
play. I'm going over there.

424
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
Li Daixi,

425
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,434
let me give you a massage.

426
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,440
I don't need.

427
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,840
Hi,

428
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,360
let me help you.

429
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,474
Are you in Class of Rehabilitation, too?

430
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,800
Hello, I'm Xia Rui.

431
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
Thank you.

432
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,634
The Class of Rehabilitation is
dancing for health preservation.

433
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,394
I want to join them, too.

434
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Come on!

435
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Hurry up!

436
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,954
You're the only one left. Come along, too!

437
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,880
OK.

438
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,874
You are not busy at all.

439
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,680
You still have time to
steal things of home.

440
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,394
How did your mother teach
you when she was alive?

441
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,434
Wang Meiyun,

442
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,194
don't mention my mother.

443
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm back. Anything to eat?

444
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,634
Where's the table?

445
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,954
Is the house robbed?

446
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,554
Thanks to your sweetheart,

447
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,714
the mahogany table I just bought

448
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,994
was thrown away.

449
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,234
I think she wants to tear down this home.

450
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,594
Zhang Yuxin,

451
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,914
what do you want to do?

452
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,360
She threw the table
left by my mother first.

453
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,674
If you want to protect her,

454
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,600
then

455
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
throw me away.

456
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,274
Weiwei,

457
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,114
trouble you to clean up.

458
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,154
Weiwei, we'll go first.

459
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,034
OK. Bye!

460
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,074
Be careful.

461
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,954
See you, Weiwei.

462
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Go back.

463
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,320
Mr. Mai

464
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,400
Weiwei

465
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,160
Why don't you get up?

466
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,200
It's done!

467
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,560
There are still people inside.

468
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,816
What's wrong with your leg?

469
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,056
What's wrong with the door?

470
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,714
The door is locked.

471
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,874
What to do then?

472
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
I'll call Daixi.

473
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,520
I gave Daixi my cell phone.

474
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
How about yours?

475
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,514
Mine

476
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,608
is at Ding Yi's hand.

477
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,064
what should we do then?

478
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,674
Wait a minute.

479
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,152
Maybe someone will come soon.

480
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,160
Okay.

481
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,794
Oh, my God.

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,794
Li Daixi,

483
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,834
You're not hungry, are you?

484
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,200
Why do you eat so much?

485
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,834
I'm here to supervise you.

486
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,554
As an athlete, you should
pay attention to your diet.

487
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,674
Can you stop talking about me?

488
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
I plan to bring many dishes for Chong.

489
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,568
Are they going to be okay?

490
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,280
Is your knee

491
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,714
okay?

492
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
Almost well.

493
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,056
There should be no problem.

494
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,514
Where you've been injured before

495
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,760
is in the knee, right?

496
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,400
No.

497
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280
I just knocked here.

498
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,434
Don't cheat me.

499
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,634
You want me to electrify you,

500
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,080
because you want your knee
injury to recover soon, right?

501
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,514
How did you know?

502
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,354
Anyway,

503
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,560
I know it.

504
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,000
You haven't said how your knee hurt.

505
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,354
I'll tell you,

506
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,514
but don't tell anyone else.

507
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
OK.

508
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,760
Before,

509
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,234
I had an accident

510
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,240
to save a child.

511
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,856
I fainted at the time.

512
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,280
Later, it's said that

513
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,200
someone saved me.

514
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,864
My knee was sprained at the time.

515
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,920
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

516
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,992
Do you have any secrets?

517
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,874
It's not a secret in fact.

518
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,114
But you know that

519
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,714
my electrified physique is so special

520
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
that it is impossible to
talk to others everywhere.

521
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,314
Since I was a child, I thought

522
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,280
this physique was a troublesome thing

523
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,000
because it never brought me good luck.

524
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,920
But you know what?

525
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
I saved a person with my electricity,

526
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,240
and since then I've felt that
electrified physique is cool.

527
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,674
You used to

528
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,514
babble around me

529
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,474
about my electrified physique.

530
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,674
I was a little nervous at that time,

531
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,440
so I yelled at you.

532
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,280
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,480
Thank you.
