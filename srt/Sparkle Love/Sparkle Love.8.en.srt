00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,414
Is your knee

3
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
feeling better?

4
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,820
All right.

5
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Hello, Ding Yi.

6
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,534
My phone is with me.

7
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,974
Why didn't you tell me?

8
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,654
Hello?

9
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,734
Hello?

10
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,164
The signal is a little weak.

11
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,300
Mai Sichong, you just wait and see.

12
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,494
Mr. Zhang

13
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,214
This is Xun Yang's activity process,

14
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,374
please confirm it.

15
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,300
OK.

16
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,734
These days you have worked hard.

17
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,894
After the event,

18
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,294
you can apply for several days off.

19
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,294
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

20
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,694
Taking advantage of this opportunity,

21
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,974
you ask if Mai Sichong has time.

22
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,134
Let him come to play

23
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,934
and visit the company by the way.

24
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,534
OK.

25
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,414
I just have to go back to school soon.

26
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
All right, go ahead.

27
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,814
Here comes Chong?

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,134
What did you do last night?

29
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,254
What else can I do?

30
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,014
Nothing.

31
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,814
I know.

32
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,140
Chong, you are shy.

33
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,774
Didn't you play enough last night?

34
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,094
At least you should swim a lap.

35
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,854
During the days that Ms. Peipei is away,

36
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,574
just be lazy

37
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,260
when you can.

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,894
Coach

39
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,660
Coach, I'll get in the water right away.

40
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,676
Chong, you lied to me.

41
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,660
Fall in!

42
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,494
The provincial team
trials are about to begin.

43
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,214
In order to cheer up everyone,

44
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,054
our school

45
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,294
is going to hold

46
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,964
a friendly match in school first.

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,654
Although it's just a friendly match,

48
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,414
as long as it's a match,

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,294
I hope

50
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,814
you can show your strength

51
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,014
and fight for the first place,

52
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,014
understand?

53
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,334
Understand!

54
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,374
Coach

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,734
Since it is a friendly match,

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,574
can I give up participating in the match

57
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,620
for friendship?

58
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,614
I think,

59
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,494
for the sake of friendship,

60
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,974
you still have to participate
in the competition,

61
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,780
so that you can give
everyone a bottom line.

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,494
All team members

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,694
must participate.

64
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
Keep training!

65
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,654
The hospital will have a consultation
with experts from America tomorrow.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,614
You have to go.

67
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,814
I bet Chong is the number one.

68
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,934
Why am I the worst?

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,340
I bet I'm number one.

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,734
I don't know if I'm the first,

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,974
anyway,

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
the last place is definitely for Ding Yi.

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,094
Chong, don't be so modest,

74
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,934
I bet you, too.

75
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,620
Rui, don't follow the blind.

76
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,774
I bet on Rui and me.

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,294
Chong, you are playing rogue.

78
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,174
How can there be two
people in the first place?

79
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,020
You just need to keep your last place.

80
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,060
Sichong

81
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,700
Peng Pai

82
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,494
Sichong

83
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,734
Since you can't come tomorrow,

84
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,254
let's make it next time.

85
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,180
OK.

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,900
Weiwei

87
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,374
Mei Weiwei?

88
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,300
Hello.

89
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,174
You bought it for me?

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,574
Stop being narcissistic.

91
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,014
I'm afraid you're wrong about me.

92
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,214
Is that who I am?

93
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,454
Isn't that who you are?

94
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,380
By the way,

95
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,654
Our company has an
event for Xun Yang today.

96
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,094
Sichong can't come.

97
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,134
Would you like to come over for a visit?

98
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,894
Xun Yang?

99
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,814
Yes.

100
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,454
Can I?

101
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,174
Of course you can.

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,334
What are you going to do?

103
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,214
Have you ever been
concerned about Xun Yang?

104
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,694
Of course.

105
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,294
I've seen every game of
Xun Yang before he retired.

106
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,254
I'm telling you,

107
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,054
it's gonna be a lot of people,

108
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,654
so take care.

109
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,534
Don't worry,

110
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,820
I'll take care of Weiwei.

111
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,214
Let's meet at 14:00 tomorrow.

112
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,094
Let me know when you arrive

113
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,414
and I'll come to meet you.

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,974
OK.

115
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,214
Well, I have classes
later, so I'm going to leave.

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,214
See you tomorrow afternoon!

117
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,694
OK.

118
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,374
Bye.

119
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,300
Bye.

120
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,174
Weiwei

121
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,014
Junjun

122
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,894
Don't sleep.

123
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,494
For the massage exam next Wednesday,

124
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,420
we need to find a partner
to massage ourselves.

125
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,380
Shall we find our own partner?

126
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,134
Lin Baihui

127
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,014
Can Taijiquan defend oneself?

128
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,860
Take the exam with me
next Wednesday morning.

129
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,460
There have been perverts
in the school recently.

130
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,414
What perverts?

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,454
Don't you know?

132
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,454
Lady-killer,

133
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,614
taking pictures in the toilet,

134
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,014
they have done it all.

135
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,214
They wear hats and masks,

136
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,614
and surveillance cameras
can't capture their faces.

137
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,756
This is too abhorrent!

138
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,294
Weiwei

139
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,054
Junjun

140
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,494
We have a lot of activities these days,

141
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,934
so you will be late to go back,

142
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,414
but you must think about your safety.

143
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,094
How about

144
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,054
buying some pepper spray?

145
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,494
No,

146
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,214
it's too late.

147
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,894
How about this?

148
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,014
I'm sorry, Weiwei.

149
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,454
I have a live broadcast
on Wednesday morning,

150
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,614
and I really can't miss it.

151
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,734
Wing Chun Kungfu, a
traditional Chinese martial art,

152
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,580
is a way to stop attacks.

153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,174
On to business,

154
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,500
please help me with the body
massage exam next Wednesday.

155
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
No problem.

156
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,380
Welcome.

157
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,094
Yuxin

158
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,814
Are you busy?

159
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,774
A large cup of coffee is 35 yuan
a small one is 30 yuan. Which one?

160
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,214
I don't drink coffee,

161
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,654
because there is too
much caffeine in coffee.

162
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,974
Drinking too much of
it is not good for health,

163
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,548
and it can also cause insomnia.

164
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,300
What kind of coffee tastes good?

165
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,134
Yuxin

166
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,094
I'm here today

167
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,334
to sincerely invite you

168
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,214
to join our massage club.

169
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,894
This is the first club in
our Class of Rehabilitation,

170
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,814
and it will miss the
soul if you're not there.

171
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,214
And I like you very much.

172
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,860
Do you like me?

173
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,734
You look cold outside,
but warm heart inside.

174
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,894
Everything can be stabilized

175
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,934
if you are there.

176
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,694
Wait a minute.

177
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,494
If you want to use

178
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,534
the club to chase me,

179
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,294
I would say that

180
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,014
there is no need.

181
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,734
No, no. I'm not.

182
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660
Then it is OK.

183
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,294
You left this

184
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,220
in class today.

185
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,014
How much

186
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,974
is this?

187
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,694
It's free,

188
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,620
my treat.

189
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,980
Thank you.

190
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,414
Hmm.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,934
Our store is closing up,

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,316
so you'd better hurry home.

193
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,974
Then

194
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,694
please think again

195
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,020
about the club.

196
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Thank you.

197
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Weiwei

198
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,694
Sorry, I can't accompany you to the exam.

199
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,574
Did you

200
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,494
find anyone to accompany you?

201
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,740
I found it. Don't worry.

202
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,614
That's good.

203
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,414
Then

204
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,414
you must pay more attention,

205
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,940
don't let anyone else find it.

206
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,694
As compensation,

207
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,014
how about eating something
delicious tomorrow?

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,334
I have an appointment tomorrow.

209
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,014
Have an appointment?

210
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
What's going on?

211
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,614
I'm going to see Xun Yang.

212
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,854
Xun Yang?

213
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,476
Where are you going to meet him?

214
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,500
FT company.

215
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,934
Isn't that the company
where Peng Pai interned?

216
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,614
He will take you to meet him?

217
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,948
You two got back together?

218
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,854
No.

219
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,134
Weiwei

220
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,614
He turned around

221
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,894
when you were being bullied.

222
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,214
Are you relieved

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,220
about it?

224
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,534
I'm just going to see Xun Yang,

225
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,854
not Peng Pai.

226
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,374
Mei Weiwei

227
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,340
You,

228
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,820
why is your little brain so dim?

229
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,620
Forget it,

230
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,172
I won't say you anymore.

231
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,014
Look!

232
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,940
Xun Yang

233
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,500
Actually, he gave me my first gold medal.

234
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,734
Although he is retired now,

235
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,294
he is still my role model.

236
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,614
Then why don't you come with me today?

237
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,332
What the hell are you going to do?

238
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,054
I'm...

239
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,934
going to...

240
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,094
I'm going to training.

241
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,854
Yes,

242
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,996
I'm going to training.

243
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,334
Don't lie to me.

244
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,004
You're not usually that obedient.

245
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,974
I really have something to do,

246
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,900
so don't ask.

247
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Then I won't ask.

248
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,534
Save it well.

249
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,534
Maybe you can only see me on posters

250
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,100
in the future.

251
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,820
Save it well!

252
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Do you still want to run?

253
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,500
Of course.

254
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,060
You're back.

255
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,814
Do you want to have a meal?

256
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,134
Daixi is going, too.

257
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Why are you hanging
out with Li Daixi recently?

258
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,100
We just have the same taste for food.

259
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,820
How about Weiwei?

260
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
She left beforehand.

261
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,740
So are you going?

262
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Okay, let's go.

263
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,300
Why hasn't Xun Yang come yet?

264
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Is my make-up OK?

265
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,454
You're a fan of the Xun Yang,
right? Come on over here.

266
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,692
Xun Yang will come soon.

267
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
It looks great.

268
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,054
Xun Yang is coming.

269
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,620
Xun Yang

270
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,014
Who is she?

271
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,780
Why is she allowed to enter the FT?

272
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
Go, go, go.

273
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,094
This is our office block.

274
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,060
Qiao

275
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,174
You're here.

276
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,094
Qiao

277
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,420
You have to dress like
that every day at the FT?

278
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,174
Not really.

279
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,460
Every Friday is casual day at the company.

280
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,294
That is casual dress day.

281
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,694
Athletes' agents, after all,

282
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,700
are a little more formal
than other entertainers.

283
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,934
I got it.

284
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,814
Let's go.

285
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,174
I'll show you the conference room.

286
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,974
OK.

287
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,116
We're going now first.

288
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,540
What's the matter with you two?

289
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,774
Weiwei went to see Xun Yang.

290
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,620
How do you both know?
Why didn't I know that?

291
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,414
Mai Sichong

292
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,974
Why don't you care about Weiwei?

293
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,980
I can't believe you let
her go out with Peng Pai.

294
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,734
Don't you think you see too much?

295
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,660
Just eat!

296
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,494
What reason can I stop her?

297
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,100
It is Xun Yang, her idol.

298
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,414
Why would Weiwei want to meet another man?

299
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,814
Don't you like Xun Yang,
too? Why aren't you there?

300
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,820
Just eat!

301
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,574
You don't know that

302
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,214
Weiwei was criticized in high school
until she couldn't stay any longer

303
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,534
and had to change school.

304
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,980
At that time, Peng Yan was
the person she trusted most.

305
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,454
But when she was being bullied,

306
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,374
he disappeared without a word.

307
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,374
Wait,

308
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,294
Peng Yan?

309
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,494
He is now named Peng Pai.

310
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,854
In my opinion,

311
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,294
he changed his name because
he was afraid to face the past.

312
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,180
He even used Xun Yang as an excuse.

313
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,436
Chong, where are you going?

314
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,260
You sit here.

315
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,974
Peng Pai has told me all about it.

316
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,356
Thank you for your support.

317
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,934
I used to be a student of
Southern Sports University,

318
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,220
so you can call me Yang.

319
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,454
Yang

320
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,254
Oh, right.

321
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,780
I brought you a gift today.

322
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,734
Yang

323
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,014
I've been preparing
for this for a long time.

324
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,254
I compiled all your achievements

325
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,374
in the past five years.

326
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,934
I also posted photos.

327
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,934
It is a little token of my affection.

328
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,220
I wish you would like it.

329
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,414
I've retired,

330
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,220
so competitions don't
matter to me anymore,

331
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,060
but still thank you very much.

332
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,454
Yang

333
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,494
Weiwei has been adoring you,

334
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,116
can you take a picture with her?

335
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,054
Is that alright?

336
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,980
Sure.

337
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,134
Why could she stay with Xun Yang?

338
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,494
Is that guy a staff of FT?

339
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,414
This girl is so ugly,

340
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,180
how did she get in touch with an insider?

341
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,574
Thank you.

342
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,500
By the way,

343
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
this poster,

344
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,694
could you please give me your autograph?

345
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
Thank you.

346
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,614
Yang

347
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,814
This autograph is for a friend of mine.

348
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,934
He is also a swimmer,

349
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,334
and he admires you very much.

350
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,334
Can you write a few words
of encouragement for him?

351
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,134
What is his name?

352
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,014
Mai Sichong

353
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,774
Si of SiYi (emcee).

354
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,916
Chong of Linghu Chong.

355
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,060
Mai Sichong

356
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,940
The name rings a bell.

357
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,734
Why don't ask an autograph for yourself?

358
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,700
The photo is enough for me. Thank you.

359
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,180
OK,

360
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,460
here you are.

361
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,420
Thank you.

362
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,854
I have something to do later,

363
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,534
so I'll leave first.

364
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,134
See you.

365
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,060
Thank you.

366
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,854
It's okay. Don't bother to see me out.

367
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,780
Be careful on your way back later.

368
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
Thanks.

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,614
I'll see him off first.

370
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,540
Wait for me.

371
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,334
Why did you pretend
to be a fan of Xun Yang?

372
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,814
You just pull the strings.

373
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,694
Since your boyfriend works for the FT,

374
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,534
you're sneaking in to see Xun Yang, right?

375
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,774
Who are you guys?
I'll call security if you do that again.

376
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,094
You are so shameless.

377
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,860
Don't you know that Xun Yang is ours?

378
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,414
My hand!

379
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,534
Why did you hit me?

380
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,934
How can you be unreasonable?

381
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,254
How's that?

382
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,934
I didn't.

383
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,174
Her hand has turned
red and you still say no?

384
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,974
Anybody here?

385
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,014
You still say you didn't hit me.

386
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,014
You see,

387
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,894
it has turned red.

388
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
I didn't hit anyone.

389
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,774
Weiwei?

390
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,014
Qiao

391
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,374
Who are you?

392
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,214
I'm a staff member.

393
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,614
You guys just calm down.

394
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,334
You're an intern, and
you're not in charge.

395
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,694
Find someone who
can really call the shots.

396
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,174
Don't be impulsive, okay?

397
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,180
If you have any questions,
you can tell me, okay?

398
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,716
You can't go in there, Sir.

399
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,260
Sir.

400
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,294
I find you staff really unreliable.

401
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,414
You don't let the fans in,

402
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,094
but let his girlfriend in.

403
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,934
You are so shameless.

404
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm not.

405
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,734
These are all misunderstandings.

406
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,534
I didn't hit anyone.

407
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,734
You have taken all the advantages,

408
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,694
why are you still
pretending to be pitiful?

409
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,268
I told you I didn't hit anyone.

410
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,774
You didn't hit anyone?

411
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,868
You are too arrogant.

412
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,180
Do you know the consequences
of making trouble in the company?

413
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,174
If you don't want me to call the police,

414
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,180
just be honest.

415
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Who are you?

416
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,374
Let's go.

417
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,574
She hit us first.

418
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,854
Yes.

419
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,540
You must give an account of this.

420
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,940
Weiwei

421
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,820
Are you okay?

422
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,334
I'm fine.

423
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,860
Why didn't you answer my call?

424
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,294
My phone might have been
on mute and I didn't hear it.

425
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,374
Do let me know

426
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,294
if this happens to you again.

427
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,494
We can scold back together.

428
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,374
If it doesn't work,

429
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
beat him.

430
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,174
Forget it.

431
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,614
You're so weak.

432
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,780
I'll protect you.

433
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,054
All right.

434
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm really fine.

435
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,540
Peng Pai

436
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,212
Why do you have Weiwei's bag?

437
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,454
Just now there are two fans broke in.

438
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,174
They said they saw you take
Weiwei to meet Xun Yang,

439
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,614
saying you're jobbery
and keeping fighting.

440
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,894
So where is she now?

441
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,974
She went off with that boy.

442
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,900
Go and find her.

443
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,420
Weiwei

444
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,020
Your bag.

445
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,134
How dare you to come here?

446
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,734
You called Weiwei to the company,

447
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,164
why did you leave her alone?

448
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,574
Weiwei

449
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,614
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,974
I have something to tell you.

451
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,644
Are you still qualified to speak?

452
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,654
I met Mr. Zhang

453
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,574
when I saw Xun Yang off just now.

454
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,774
I really don't know just in the company...

455
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,054
You don't know.

456
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,420
You put all the responsibility
away with "You don't know".

457
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,540
Then, do you know about her transfer?

458
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,574
Peng Pai

459
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
You're a double-faced hypocrite.

460
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,300
In the past, Mei Weiwei was
hurt so much because of you.

461
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,060
I warn you,

462
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,100
stay away from her.

463
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,140
let's go.

464
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,820
That day my dad had a car accident.

465
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,100
Here you are.

466
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,974
You keep it.

467
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,972
What are you doing?

468
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,134
Mom

469
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,494
Is it because of this girl that

470
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,214
your head teacher asked me to come over?

471
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,854
It's none of her business, mom.

472
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,574
Look at her.

473
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,094
What does she look like as a student?

474
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,214
It's really none of her business, mom.

475
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,574
Let's go home.

476
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,534
It's none of her business.

477
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,534
Mom

478
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,780
Why is she like this?

479
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,094
Peng Yan

480
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Your father's dying. Come
back as soon as possible.

481
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,694
When I got to the hospital,

482
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,174
the doctor said,

483
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
my father's dying.

484
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,900
When my father died,

485
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,140
my mother sold our house.

486
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,260
She can't live without me,

487
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,340
So I gave up studying abroad.

488
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,214
After college,

489
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,574
I didn't want to get in
touch with my old relatives,

490
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,020
so I changed my name.

491
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,214
Afterwards,

492
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,894
you changed your QQ,

493
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,564
and your phone is out of service.

494
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,934
I tried to contact you.

495
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,460
I left you messages every day,

496
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,180
but I didn't get a reply.

497
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,300
Now,

498
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,300
I couldn't even find you.

499
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,380
It's the same today.

500
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,140
I'm sorry that

501
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,660
I wasn't there to protect you.

502
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,420
Sichong

503
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,060
Thank you.

504
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,534
If you hadn't come today...

505
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,460
It's nothing.

506
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,454
I'm off.

507
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,380
You chat.

508
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,254
He

509
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,220
really has been looking
for you for a long time.

510
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,014
It's been four years

511
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,174
and he's been trying to explain it to you.

512
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,300
What does it show?

513
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,894
It shows I'm silly.

514
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,174
I didn't even look at my QQ
messages before I deleted them.

515
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,580
That shows he still
cares about you, honey.

516
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,060
Are you too happy?

517
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,380
I'm going to bed.

518
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,894
You are too innocent

519
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,054
to deal with such a
complicated emotional problem.

520
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,134
Good night.

521
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,060
Good night.

522
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,934
You waited for her all these years,

523
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,134
but she wasn't always there.

524
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,494
I waited four years for her.

525
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,894
How long have you known her?

526
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,934
Do you know her?

527
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,254
Do you know what kind of person she likes?

528
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,254
What do you mean?

529
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,854
From then on,

530
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,974
I knew she had feelings for me.

531
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,334
She's with Peng Pai?

532
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,014
Not yet,

533
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,444
but the future is uncertain.

534
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,854
I have a race tomorrow.
Will you come and watch?

535
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,894
Tomorrow is my birthday,

536
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,774
you mustn't stand me up.

537
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,614
When I win,

538
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,500
you'll be the first physical therapist
for the future Olympic champion.

539
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,374
Did he jump late?

540
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,854
What if you lose?

541
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,854
I won't lose.

542
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
I don't allow.

543
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,694
Mai Sichong

544
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,454
Thank you.

545
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,220
I will always stay here by your side.

546
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,180
Weiwei

547
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,300
I like you.
