2
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,514
Good morning.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
Morning.

4
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,994
Ding Yi

5
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,154
get up to have breakfast.

6
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Hurry up.

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,714
Chong, what were you doing yesterday?

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,874
Where did you get this?

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,544
It frightened me at the midnight.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,834
Do you guys know the girl
coming to the natatorium?

11
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Who? The journalist?

12
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,024
Not her, the other one.

13
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
The girl from Class of Rehabilitation?

14
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,114
What's up?

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,594
Nothing.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,954
Do you keep something from us?

17
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,674
Nope.

18
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,214
Xia Rui

19
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,788
Have you found that he's weird?

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,808
Guys, I have to leave now.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,154
So secretive.

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Let's go for a meal.

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,354
More than 600 yuan.

24
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Too expensive.

25
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,960
Weiwei

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,914
I've been waiting for

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,074
Mai Sichong all the night.

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Why didn't he call me?

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,994
I guess he didn’t wake up.

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,994
Take it easy.

31
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,834
He will call you when he gets up.

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,114
It's been over ten hours since then.

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,160
The magic will not work until tonight.

34
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,914
Darling

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,354
are you uncomfortable?

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,114
Tell me if you are.

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,194
I'm definitely well.

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Don't worry.

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,274
Find the head of Pikachu first.

40
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,994
Okay.

41
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,954
Weiwei

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,914
Can you return me the Pikachu costume?

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,994
See you at the small
classroom on the third floor.

44
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,800
The Student Union
needs it in the afternoon.

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,394
Daixi

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,554
Stop finding it. We
don't have enough time.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,794
I'd better get going.

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,834
But the costume...

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
Forget it.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
Am I dazzled?

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Where's the head?

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,434
Missing.

53
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,274
Are you kidding me?

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,394
I lent it to you

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,434
because I trust you.

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,874
You betray it so easily.

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll use it today.

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,354
Sorry.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,928
What if I pay you for the head?

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,074
Well, that's a solution.

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,354
Okay. How much is it?

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,280
6000 yuan.

63
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,394
6000 yuan?

64
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,194
Yes.

65
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,394
It's imported from Japan.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,754
Even if you fly to Japan now,

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,184
it's hard to buy a same one.

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,194
Fine.

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,634
Please,

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
could you give me

71
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,314
a 50% discount?

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,834
No way.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,554
The price is fixed.

74
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,394
What rubbish do you think
is worthy of 6000 yuan?

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,154
What...

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,674
So poor your fraud.

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,154
Hey,

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,434
who the hell are you?
Mind your own business.

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,994
Mai Sichong, from the swimming team.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Never hear of me?

81
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,674
She promised to pay for it.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,834
Here you are.

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,354
Don't bully her.

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,194
Well,

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,354
now that the whole Pikachu is here.

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,154
we may leave it behind us.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
Thank you.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
Go now.

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,234
Why did you steal the costume?

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,434
I found it for you.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
This is your way to express gratitude?

92
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
Wanna catch my eye?

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,074
What are you doing?

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
I don't know.

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Anyhow,

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,144
I wanna stay close with you.

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
Do you...

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
What?

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,594
Never mind.

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
I have a class to attend. I'd better go.

101
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,594
Would you like to have dinner together?

102
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Sorry, I have things to do.

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,034
Damn it! What should I do?

104
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,074
How can I explain to Daixi?

105
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,408
He's falling love with me.

106
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,034
Sorry, Junjun.

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,634
I thought there's only myself.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,994
Never mind.

109
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,280
I won't tell her.

110
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,954
I'm going to take my takeout.

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Okay.

112
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,954
a piece of good news

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,314
and a piece of bad news

114
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,794
Tell me the good one first.

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,474
The good one is I've found the costume.

116
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,754
Good job. And the bad one?

117
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,760
The bad one is

118
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
that I failed.

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,634
What?

120
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,994
The head of the Pikachu is too big

121
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,154
to affect my vision.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
So I failed.

123
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,634
I said something went wrong.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,034
Or he should have called me.

125
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,954
Take the time.

126
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,360
Let me try again.

127
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,394
Are you sure about this?

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,674
Don't force yourself.

129
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,714
I've promised you.

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,114
What's more,

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,840
I have a new plan.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,874
Guys,

133
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,240
now the most concerned part is coming.

134
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,354
Federer is more handsome in reality

135
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,554
than in the photo.

136
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,034
He always takes off his ring

137
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,074
when playing tennis.

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,274
So on the court

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,944
he can be loved by all the girls.

140
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,154
Girls are excited.

141
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,754
Well,

142
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,514
the boy sitting in the
middle of the third row,

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,704
why are you so excited?

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,514
Peng Pai

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,704
I admire you very much.

146
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,794
Thank you.

147
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,314
I want to know that

148
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,880
were you anxious about the work.

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,874
Actually,

150
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,154
the division of the whole work

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,554
of the sport was clear-cut.

152
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,914
We had explicit division of labor.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,034
And we had to cooperate.

154
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,554
Take me for example.

155
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,994
My mission was to

156
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,394
lead the team.

157
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,872
Thank you for your answering.

158
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,954
Peng Pai

159
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,834
My name is Ai Ning.

160
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,634
It stands for

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
"I love you".

162
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,354
Thank you.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,074
No wooer,

164
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,674
more questions related to volunteering.

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,434
I have a question.

166
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,914
You are the only one who
followed up the whole project,

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,834
will this experience help
you to hunt a job in FT?

168
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,640
After all, FT is the best sport agency.

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,434
I just got my luck.

170
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,394
I was appointed to lead the earlier work.

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,474
And because of the lack of a personnel,

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,554
I followed up the later phrase, too.

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,914
You are too busy.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,880
May I be your girlfriend to help you?

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,434
It's not today's topic.

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,834
I don't have the pressure to get married.

177
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
All right?

178
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,954
Okay,

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
let's continue the topic.

180
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
Any question?

181
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,234
Well,

182
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
that one.

183
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Excuse me,

184
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,234
I'm going to take the result
of our psychological test.

185
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,714
Senior Sport Administration Class.

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,514
Okay.

187
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,834
Wait a moment please.

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
Thank you.

189
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,114
Excuse me, I feel sick.

190
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,314
I take my temperature first.

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,240
Ummm,

192
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,674
sorry?

193
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,816
What class are you in?

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,754
Mai Sichong, from Swimming Class,
the College of Competitive Sports.

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,914
Mai Sichong?

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,040
The one who are recruited
with lower entering grade?

197
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,114
Counselor,

198
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
I think I'm crazy.

199
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,554
After meeting a girl,

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,434
Her face always occurs to me.

201
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,754
It's out of control.

202
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
And I want to

203
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,720
approach her.

204
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,280
Are you uncomfortable?

205
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,280
Mai Sichong

206
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,714
If you feel sick,

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,620
go to the doctor.

208
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,640
Anyway, I feel sick.

209
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,994
According to your description,

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,314
you may fall in love.

211
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,754
You'd better ask your friends about

212
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,474
what girls like.

213
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,474
I think

214
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,314
she was scared by me.

215
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
Will she hate me?

216
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,714
Well, I guess it's difficult to find

217
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
a girl hate you.

218
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,994
You're right.

219
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,114
Thank you, counselor.

220
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm not the counselor.

221
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,034
Well, I'm back.

222
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,874
Here you are.

223
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
What?

224
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,874
I'm Peng Pai, from Senior
Sport Administration Class.

225
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,274
Sorry to hear your secret.

226
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,194
But trust me,

227
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,474
I'll keep it for you.

228
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,400
Thank you.

229
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,272
I know what should I do.

230
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,760
Weiwei,

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,194
why are you so early today?

232
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,200
How dare I be late.

233
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,034
Guys,

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,794
let's call the roll.

235
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,794
Mei Weiwei

236
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,794
Here!

237
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,314
Mei Weiwei

238
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,114
Here!

239
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,394
I'm here.

240
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,394
What's wrong with you?

241
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,514
So weak your voice.

242
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,848
You didn't have breakfast?

243
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,834
Professor,

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,994
we can hear her.

245
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,194
Sorry?

246
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
What?

247
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,314
He said he didn't hear me, too.

248
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,434
Sorry, professor, I lost my voice today.

249
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,634
Now we continue.

250
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,554
Peng Wanli.

251
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,354
Here.

252
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,474
Gao Dashan

253
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,754
Here.

254
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,834
Keep quiet

255
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,554
until class is over.

256
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Okay.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,514
Well,

258
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,434
this is the end of the class.

259
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,714
Class is over.

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,834
Thank God, the class is over.

261
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
It's killing me.

262
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,160
Can we have a chat now?

263
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,016
What would you like to say?

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,074
I love you.

265
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,360
Can you be my girlfriend?

266
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,914
It's true.

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,114
I'm serious.

268
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Accept me.

269
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,560
Accept him.

270
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,194
Weiwei

271
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,000
You said I could talk to you after class.

272
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,114
Mai Sichong

273
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,554
Why don't you just go back and sleep?

274
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,754
It may be your dream

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,554
which will disappear when you wake up.

276
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,794
You call it a dream?

277
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,874
I've been think of it for a long time.

278
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,754
I've never thinking of

279
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,800
something except this
one for more than ten hours.

280
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,474
I don't have the mood to explain.

281
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,680
Stop pestering me.

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,194
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,120
Mom

284
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,714
did I ask you to wait for me at the gate?

285
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Who's she?

286
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,234
My expected girlfriend,

287
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,434
Mei Weiwei.

288
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,154
Really?

289
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,074
No, he's kidding.

290
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,880
I get it, still chasing.

291
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,994
So lovely the girl.

292
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,594
Do you have any class this afternoon?

293
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,074
No.

294
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,674
Great!

295
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,994
Would you like to have lunch with us?

296
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,994
Today is my birthday.

297
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,754
Let's go.

298
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,034
Come with us.

299
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Hurry up!

300
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,680
Come on.

301
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,114
Hey.

302
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,434
Good for Mai Sichong.

303
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,794
Not only a good swimmer,

304
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,760
but also good at pursuing girls.

305
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,440
Let me see.

306
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,674
It's really him!

307
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,114
Are they meeting parents?

308
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
So quick.

309
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,474
Wow, this man!

310
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,400
Unbelievable.

311
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,794
Cool.

312
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,994
Cool.

313
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,954
Our model.

314
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah.

315
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,576
One more heart-broken girl.

316
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,274
Here's the roast chicken!

317
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,434
Here you are.

318
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,194
That's all the dishes.

319
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,474
Do you like roast chicken?

320
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,194
It's Sichong's favorite food.

321
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,394
I like it.

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,360
Aunt, happy birthday to you.

323
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,714
Thank you.

324
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,794
What a considerate girl.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,994
Is it the first time?

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,994
Weiwei

327
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,994
Sichong

328
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,594
has never brought a girl back home.

329
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,874
I don't...

330
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,634
Stop it.

331
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,034
Weiwei is Sichong's
good friend in the college.

332
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,634
Don't say those boys or girls things.

333
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,354
It's weird.

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,454
Don't mind it.

335
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,800
My fault.

336
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,434
There are no rules

337
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,394
in our home.

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,714
Do you like the dishes?

339
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,474
Just help yourself.

340
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,114
Yes.

341
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,594
Just some normal dishes.

342
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,034
Can you act as usual?

343
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,474
Don't make us uneasy.

344
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
Ummm, I'm fine.

345
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,220
What would you like to eat?
I can order takeouts for you.

346
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,794
Don't bother.

347
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,314
Takeout?

348
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,354
The dishes are better than takeout.

349
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,314
Right.

350
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,154
Your dad's cooking is great.

351
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,114
Right?

352
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,334
Well done!

353
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,260
Thank you.

354
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,794
May I get you some water?

355
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
No, thanks.

356
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,954
What's wrong?

357
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,234
Nothing.

358
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,194
Are you okay?

359
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm fine. I'll get you a glass of water.

360
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Come here.

361
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,954
Did you overtrain?

362
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
I didn't.

363
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,394
Don't lie to me.

364
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,634
I know you.

365
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,754
It's been several months.

366
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,328
Why does it still hurt so much?

367
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,274
I've told you a million times

368
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,914
if it can't recover,

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,794
the injury will last in
the rest of your life.

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,794
Why don't you listen to me?

371
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,754
Why do we ask you
to go to this university?

372
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,954
We hope you can get some time to recover.

373
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,994
Okay, you're right.

374
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,554
It doesn't matter.

375
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
The most important is to keep it a secret.

376
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,754
If our team leader knows it,

377
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,472
I can't enter the provincial team.

378
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,034
Though I'm in the Sports
University, I can't relax.

379
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
The competition in later
this year is important for me.

380
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,754
Now that you get it,

381
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,720
you have to adhere to the doctor's advice.

382
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,274
All right, I got it.

383
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,200
Back for lunch.

384
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,234
Let's go.

385
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,160
You brat.

386
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Give him.

387
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,114
We'll come back to the school now.

388
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,674
Okay.

389
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,440
I'll ask my driver to give you a ride.

390
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,560
Weiwei, we hope you can come again.

391
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,594
Thank you.

392
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,194
Bye, Weiwei.

393
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,114
Bye.

394
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,304
Be careful on the road.

395
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,834
Weiwei

396
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,794
Asking you to eat in my home

397
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,954
isn't my idea.

398
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,160
It's my mom's.

399
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,914
Mai Sichong

400
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,874
Please thank your mom for me.

401
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,674
I can't take these.

402
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,154
You take these back.

403
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,594
Why?

404
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
Ummm,

405
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
did I scare you?

406
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,514
There's no need to continue this topic.

407
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,434
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

408
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,754
I have to go.

409
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,594
Weiwei, take the snacks.

410
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,234
I can't take...

411
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,194
Sichong

412
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Sichong

413
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,994
Hey,

414
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,992
what a coincidence.

415
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Weiwei

416
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,914
Do you guys know each other?

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I never imagine that

418
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
I can meet you here.

419
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,354
Long time no see.

420
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Peng Yan.

421
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,474
Peng Yan?

422
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,568
His name is Peng Pai.

423
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,714
I have to go.

424
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,856
What about the snacks?

425
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,440
Hey.

426
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,920
Peng Pai

427
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,874
You see, she's angry again.

428
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,208
What should I do on earth?

429
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,354
Sichong

430
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
She

431
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,274
is the girl you mentioned?

432
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,200
Yes.

433
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,914
Mei Weiwei

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,594
Why don't you answer my calls?

435
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,874
What's this.

436
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,754
You and Mai Sichong...

437
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,944
How can you explain it?

438
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,040
Daixi

439
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
I met Peng Yan.

440
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,034
Peng Yan?

441
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,512
I remember he studied abroad.

442
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,994
He renamed himself.

443
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
Now his name is Peng Pai.

444
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,820
Peng Pai.

445
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,464
That Peng Pai in our school?

446
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,360
What did he say?

447
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,040
Nothing.

448
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Did you just walk away?

449
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,194
I was brought up short by him.

450
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,394
I didn't know what to say.

451
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,394
And I ran.

452
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,154
Babe, why are you scared?

453
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,034
If he does something weird,

454
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,984
you can discharge.

455
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,154
Ummm, you can't.

456
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,994
If he falls in love with you,

457
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,328
it will be a real trouble.

458
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,034
This is the point.

459
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,080
Are you dating?

460
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,754
It's a long story

461
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,514
I failed again

462
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,834
and he pursued me.

463
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,114
Why don't you tell me

464
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,274
the truth in the cafe?

465
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,714
Why did you lie to me?

466
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,320
I don't want to let you down.

467
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,914
Trust me.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,834
He will be fine in hours.

469
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,754
And then

470
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,034
we can carry out plan B.

471
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,834
This time

472
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,594
we'll make it.

473
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,914
Are you sure?

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,840
Definitely sure.

475
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,840
All right.

476
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,514
You means

477
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,954
you two have known each other

478
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,434
since high school?

479
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,354
Yes.

480
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,194
Sichong

481
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,194
Do you go after her?

482
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,194
Yes.

483
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,754
But you see,

484
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,560
she ran so fast to escape from me.

485
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,554
She used to be on the track team.

486
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,874
She always ran fast.

487
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,800
Really?

488
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,794
Do you know other
interesting things about her?

489
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,834
Tell me more.

490
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,880
I don't know how to make her happy.

491
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,360
How do you know her?

492
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,114
At the start of the school life,

493
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,514
I wasn't impressed by her.

494
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,074
Later I met her in the campus,

495
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,754
and she always came up around me.

496
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,634
I recalled it.

497
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,194
She had feelings for me first.

498
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,634
Why does she reject me now?

499
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,874
Maybe you take it wrong.

500
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,034
You should calm down.

501
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,200
So did she said that.

502
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,194
I used to reckon that she's a silly girl.

503
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,474
And I glanced at her in the party,

504
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,074
I got attached.

505
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,000
Got attached?

506
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,834
Sounds like love at the first sight.

507
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,514
Don't be impulsive.

508
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,840
Think it tomorrow.

509
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,874
Come on,

510
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,800
cheers.

511
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,594
Help yourself.

512
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
Try this.

513
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,794
I believe you'll love me someday.

514
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
I won't give up.

515
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,794
Keep sober.

516
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,000
Keep calm.

517
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Can you stop it?

518
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
Ding Yi

519
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,674
Let me sleep.

520
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,600
Morning.

521
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,034
Get up.

522
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,834
Time for breakfast.

523
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,120
Leave me alone.

524
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I wanna sleep.

525
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,354
I believe you'll love me someday.

526
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,834
I won't give up.

527
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Keep sober and calm.

528
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,314
Weiwei

529
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,960
Why do you reject me?

530
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,954
No matter what you say,

531
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,640
I'll never give up.

532
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,674
What the hell are these?

533
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,280
What did I do yesterday?

534
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,994
Weiwei

535
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,874
Are you falling asleep?

536
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,634
I'm missing you.

537
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
I want everyone to
know that you are so cute.

538
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,794
Ding Yi

539
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,888
Hi, Mai's young lady.

540
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,914
Call me Mei Weiwei.

541
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
Thank you.

542
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,274
Ding Yi

543
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,074
I'd like to ask you a favor.

544
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,480
This is on me.

545
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,200
Does your team have training at night?

546
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,194
We don't train at night.

547
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,864
But Chong will go the natatorium.

548
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,984
Do you wanna give him a surprise?

549
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Thank you.

550
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,416
Don't you remember me?

551
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,954
Peng Pai

552
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm sorry that we didn't
have a chat that day.

553
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,034
Weiwei

554
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,194
I want to apologize for that thing.

555
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,674
At that time...

556
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
Sorry.

557
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,594
Let the past be it.

558
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,800
I've forgotten it.

559
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,914
Sorry, I have a lesson.

560
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,840
I have to go.

561
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,554
Hey, bro.

562
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
Why are you so happy today?

563
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,874
You and Mei Weiwei...

564
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,800
Shut up.

565
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,314
What's wrong with you?

566
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
You chased her fanatically yesterday.

567
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,834
She's right.

568
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,960
Love at first sight is unreliable.

569
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,234
What if she comes to you?

570
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,794
Then it's up to me.

571
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,720
Let's train.

572
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
Uh huh.

573
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,680
He's coming.

574
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,434
Mai Sichong

575
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,294
Come here!

576
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,274
She is near drowning.

577
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,154
Help her.

578
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,754
Near drowning?

579
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,920
Help!

580
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,440
Why not help her?

581
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,114
It's shallow. How can she drown?

582
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
Are you kidding?

583
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,794
Trust me.

584
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,954
She's got a cramp in her leg.

585
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,554
What a poor performance.

586
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm leaving.

587
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,994
Hi, tutor.

588
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Tutor?

589
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
Help!

590
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
I get a cramp!

591
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,274
Here.

592
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
Come here.

593
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,880
Get on.

594
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
Why are you here?

595
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,736
What's wrong with you?

596
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
It's not a big deal.

597
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
What?

598
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,634
Mei Weiwei, you...

599
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,584
Mei Weiwei, you...

600
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,256
What did you do to me?
