00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,861
Hello everyone, I'm Cho Soo-bin from the news.

10
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:49,777
Today, we've invited Kim Soo-hyuk,
the creator of the webtoon 'Agent Jun'.

11
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,694
Welcome.

12
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,444
- Hello.
- I'm Kim Soo-hyuk, a webtoon artist.

13
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:54,777
Congratulations on winning the grand prize.

14
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,577
Thank you.

15
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,300
An agent who became a webtoon artist.

16
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,350
What inspired you to draw 'Agent Jun'?

17
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:04,600
My daughter told me to tell my story,

18
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,434
saying she thought it would be interesting.

19
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:08,817
- And that's how I got the idea.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:12,734
So I made the main character a webtoon artist,
like me.

21
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,817
You should give your daughter a bigger allowance.

22
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:15,851
Yes.

23
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:19,944
There's a rumor going around on social media now

24
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:23,317
that the artist is actually a
real national intelligence agent.

25
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,017
Have you heard about it?

26
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:26,517
Oh, really?

27
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:28,996
How could that be?

28
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,150
Absolutely impossible.

29
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:33,900
I wouldn't shoot people like Agent Jun.

30
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,461
- I'm very timid.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,234
I couldn't even kill an ant.

32
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:40,143
Now that I see you in person...

33
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:44,661
You have a great physique,
very similar to Agent Jun.

34
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,401
I can understand why there are such rumors.

35
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:47,817
Actually...

36
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,034
Before everyone knew me from this webtoon

37
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,517
I went through a lot of hardships.

38
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,984
- I did all sorts of things.
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:58,268 --> 00:03:59,934
Actually, like Jun...

40
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:03,127
I've suffered even more hardships than him.

41
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,151
But...

42
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:05,734
Those around me...

43
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,434
My wife, my daughter.

44
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,051
Well...

45
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,434
You could say it's a responsibility.

47
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:19,600
Truly, great work comes from experience.

48
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,217
Many fans are now anticipating your next work.

49
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,067
Please say a few words.

50
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:33,660
This is the 4B pencil I use for drawing.

51
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,350
To stay true to my roots

52
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:37,400
I always carry it with me.

53
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,650
In the future, I'll also become a webtoon
artist who stays true to their roots.

54
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,701
Also,

55
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,734
I'll soon meet everyone
through Season 2 of 'Agent Jun'.

56
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:49,968

Are you going to Korea to make money?

71
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:58,218
No.

72
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,734
I have a debt to collect.

73
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,350
Sounds like a pretty big debt?

74
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:06,984
You even have to sneak across the border.

75
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,135
Very big.

76
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,184
Big enough to trade a life for.

77
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,734
Catch them!

78
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:46,684
Hey, kid.

79
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:49,968
What now?

80
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,267
You won't be able to collect your debt.

81
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,185
Come with me.

82
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,934
Ow, that hurts!

83
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:58,850
Fuck!

84
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,411
You scared me!

85
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:01,484
Ow, that hurts!

86
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:02,885
I'll kill you!

87
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,400
Too slow...

88
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,734
I told you you were slow.

89
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:20,900
Come meet your end!

90
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,400
Ah! That hurts!

91
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,684

92
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:32,927
Hello, Jun.

93
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:33,500
Chief.

94
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,617
You didn't forget about my wife's exhibition,
did you?

95
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,217
How could I forget, you punk?

96
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,250
It's the first one she's
organizing since becoming manager.

97
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,161
Don't be late, and don't come empty-handed.

98
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,834
Show some appreciation.

99
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:42,884

100
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,094
Got it.

101
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:46,084
I won't call Cheol separately then.

102
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:47,334
Ultimate move!

103
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,784
Okay, I'll tell Cheol.

104
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,417
Got it. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,417
Chief, did you see that?

106
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:04,834
Amazing!

107
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,334
Hey! Grab him!

108
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,301
Chief,

109
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,350
shouldn't we tell Jun?

110
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:20,194
Tell him what?

111
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,027
Those guys smuggled themselves
in just to kill him.

112
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,734
Who knows what'll happen next?

113
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:25,827
Cheol.

114
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:26,851
Yes?

115
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,984
Jun's an ordinary person now.

116
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,468
He's just a webtoon artist.

117
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,217
What if he gets into danger like before?

118
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,317
We have to protect him.

119
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,384
He finally found his place.

120
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,150
He worked so hard for the life he has now.

121
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,267
We have to protect him.

122
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,850
Let him do what he wants.

123
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:45,968
Chief.

124
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:52,768
What's

125
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,301
that smell?

126
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,067
What's that smell?

127
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,101
Chief.

128
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,223
Chief!

129
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:02,567
Cheers!

130
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,100
- Eat more.
- Mm.

131
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:09,784
Speaking of which,

132
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,111
you're really amazing.

133
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:12,777
What's so amazing?

134
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,527
You love drinking so much, yet you can handle it.

135
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,017
I'm a woman who keeps her word.

136
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:18,884
How's the gallery?

137
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:19,777
Are you happy?

138
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,744
Yeah.

139
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,134
I like looking at the art.

140
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,611
The people around are all very nice.

141
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:27,050
Planning every exhibition
myself is really interesting.

142
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,218
So, you're happy then?

143
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:28,867
Mm-hmm.

144
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,644
I'm really happy.

145
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,334
This is all because you succeeded

146
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:33,977
I get to do what I want.

147
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:37,417
It's all thanks to Cartoonist Kim.

148
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,500
Thank you.

149
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,451
Honey?

150
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:42,217
- He's here.
- You're back.

151
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,884
- Come here.
- Eat some fried chicken!

152
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,667
No, I'm not hungry.

153
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,867
Want me to get you some juice?

154
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:47,750
I'm going to my room first.

155
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:48,667
I still have things to do.

156
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:49,684
Are you writing rap lyrics?

157
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,067
I want to study...

158
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:53,567
Why the sudden urge to study?

159
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:54,294
Didn't you want to be a rapper?

160
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:54,944
So go rap!

161
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,567
Do what you want to do. Like me.

162
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,767
Use rap to say everything you want to say.

163
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,600
Go inside and study.

164
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,934
Hey, you...

165
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,417
Stop it.

166
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:06,967
Is she going through puberty?

167
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:19,034
Thank you all sincerely for
taking the time to be here.

168
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:23,250
Now, let me introduce today's main guest,
artist Yu Jae-yeon.

169
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,700
Hello everyone. I'm Yu Jae-yeon.

170
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:28,200
The weather is so lovely today.

171
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,784
Thank you all sincerely
for taking the time to come.

172
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:34,090
I'm truly touched.

173
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,167
Thank you all.

174
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,634
My wife is so beautiful.

175
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,884
I'm the only man she's ever had.

176
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,250
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

177
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,356
It's okay, Honey.

178
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,117
As long as things are like this

179
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,750
I ask for nothing else.

180
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,584
Such a simple woman.

181
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,000
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

182
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:12,750
Ga-yeong...

183
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,850
When did you get here?

184
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:14,927
Just now.

185
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,050
Sister-in-law!

186
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,334
Are you okay?

187
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:20,668
I'm fine.

188
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,617
Congratulations on your exhibition.

189
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:24,094
Thank you.

190
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,500
You didn't have to bring a gift.

191
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,887
There are so many people.

192
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,367
Looks like the exhibition is a success.

193
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,634
Yes. Thank you.

194
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:31,677
Chief.

195
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,184
This is so embarrassing.

196
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,384
Are you here for the housewarming party?

197
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,434
Why bring toilet paper?

198
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,300
You can use it in the restroom.

199
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,227
Thank you.

200
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:39,027
Sister-in-law!

201
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:39,884
Be careful.

202
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:40,885
Sister-in-law!

203
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,317
I'm so sorry.

204
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:44,817
Are you okay?

205
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:45,694
Sister-in-law.

206
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,434
Be careful.

207
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,327
Congratulations. Wishing you all the best.

208
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,434
You didn't have to bring a gift.

209
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,583
There are so many people.

210
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,617
Looks like the exhibition is a success.

211
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:55,484
- Yes.
- Thank you.

212
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,400
How come you two look more and more alike?

213
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,401
- What?
- What?

214
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,534
- What are you talking about?
- Seriously.

215
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,700
How much is something like this?

216
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,400
- You're here.
- Yes.

217
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:14,350
This is the director of our gallery.

218
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:17,767
My name is Hae-in.

219
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,684
I see.

220
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:24,301
Hold on.

221
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,017
Hold on.

222
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,517
Why don't you two chat first.

223
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:29,734
Oh, okay.

224
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,917
I heard you're a good friend of Mi-na's husband?

225
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:46,500
Good friends? More like an ill-fated relationship.

226
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:48,118
So...

227
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,717
are you a cartoonist?

228
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,367
No, I'm not.

229
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:54,550
I teach at a university.

230
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,050
What subject do you teach?

231
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,967
Public Administration.

232
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,684
Seems like a good fit for you.

233
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:01,861
Mm.

234
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:04,993
You're so handsome.

235
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,734
Your students must love you.

236
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:09,817
Doesn't your wife worry?

237
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,067
I'm single.

238
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,900
Are you divorced?

239
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,067
Never been married.

240
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:15,554
No way.

241
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:16,567
I don't believe it.

242
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,284
I'm married to the country.

243
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,834
Seriously...

244
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,417
And funny too.

245
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:38,350
You should dress up a bit.

246
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,217
A tie would really suit you.

247
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:46,267
I'll pick out a tie for you later.

248
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,017
Dressed up a little bit,

249
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,767
even Brad Pitt couldn't compare.

250
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:50,694
Ah...

251
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:52,934
Of course, you look handsome now too.

252
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,700
Remember to contact me.

253
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,584
Isn't this just scribbled trash?

254
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,950
What kind of artwork is this?

255
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:13,667
Picasso spent four years
learning to paint like Raphael,

256
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,384
but spent a lifetime learning
to paint like a child.

257
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:18,934
To paint like a child

258
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,584
It seems you're very interested in art.

259
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:25,600
Very interested in art.

260
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,018
Excuse me.

261
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,217
I love you.

262
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,700
- Eh?
- Eh.

263
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:34,450
No, no...

264
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:36,961
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,650
This... this...

266
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,284
I'm sorry. Please...

267
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:44,667
It's alright.

268
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,167
My name is Hae-in.

269
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,417
I'll wash these clothes and return them to you.

270
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,884
Remember to contact me.

271
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:09,317
I love you.

272
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,117
That... Pierre Jean?

273
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,104
Yes.

274
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,317
He's a very famous collector from abroad.

275
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,484
Rumor has it his personal collection

276
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:28,450
is more impressive than
renowned overseas museums.

277
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,167
I mean...

278
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,784
That Pierre Jean going to exhibit

279
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:35,417
his personal collection in our museum?

280
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,335
Ms. Mi-na...

281
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,727
He's the most important
VVIP our gallery has ever had.

282
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,317
Yes, I'll give it my all.

283
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,400
Don't worry.

284
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,434
Who else wants to kill Jun?

285
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:56,550
Do you think it's just one or two?

286
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:57,551
Speak up, you bastard!

287
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:00,268
You think I'm going to talk?

288
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,867
Talk, you bastard!

289
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,334
You really are a bastard.

290
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,700
Talk!

291
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,617
Talk, damn you!

292
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:13,250
What should we get to eat?

293
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:16,417
How about sushi?

294
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,467
I know a good place.

295
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,500
Forget eating. How about drinks?

296
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,584
What?

297
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:22,934
You don't drink?

298
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,050
I can drink a lot.

299
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,034
Editor-in-chief, I've sent you the files.

300
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,234
I'll check them.
If there are no issues, I'll upload them.

301
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,567
- Thanks.
- Okay.

302
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:50,777
Hey, Cartoonist Kim...

303
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,801
Yes?

304
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:53,317
It's nothing.

305
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:54,802
Good work.

306
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:55,984
You must've pulled several all-nighters.

307
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,044
Get some good sleep.

308
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:57,984
Come to the office when you wake up.

309
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:58,985
The office?

310
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,450
Sure.

311
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,601
Okay.

312
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:19,134
Are you okay?

313
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:21,933
Post it.

314
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,374
[Agent Jun 2]

315
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:48,834
Agent Jun, so bold. Walking right into a trap.

316
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:55,750
Damn it!

317
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:57,311
Jun, you're not alone.

318
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,261
Chief.

319
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,167
Leave this to us.

320
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:03,527
Secret weapon. Weapon No. 2.

321
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:06,534
Chief, initiate teleport!

322
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,817
Weapon No. 2, teleport approved.

323
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,784
Teleporting...

324
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,967
Weapon No. 2, fire!

325
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,384
Damn that Shield Team.

326
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,650
Robert.

327
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,800
Your end has come.

328
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:33,217
Ridiculous fool. You can't possibly stop me.

329
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:36,184
Come down and face justice!

330
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,200
Everything is ready, Jun.

331
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,900
Chief, requesting backup!

332
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:52,951
Listen.

333
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,834
We miscalculated.

334
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:58,584
Chief! Chief!

335
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,834
Who are you looking for, Jun?

336
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,584
Shield Team is already in ruins.

337
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,984
This is what happens when you challenge me.

338
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:06,985
Chief!

339
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,250
Shield Team...

340
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,500
Unforgivable!

341
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:38,850
You're not the only one with
a hidden special weapon, Jun.

342
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:56,717
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed.

343
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:03,034
You dare make me show up in person?

344
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,750
You useless trash.

345
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:09,434
To be continued...

346
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,717
- Wait.
- Wow, this content is infuriating.

347
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,000
This is complete trash.

348
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,934
The content is so stupid. You like this stuff?

349
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:19,467
- Total garbage.
- This is so boring.

350
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,334
If it's so boring, why bother reading it?

351
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,250
The comments are actually more
interesting than the webtoon.

352
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:34,550
<i>It's completely changed.</i>

353
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,167
<i>Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four...</i>

354
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,384
<i>I almost fainted reading it. They should just die.</i>

355
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,884
<i>This really is garbage.</i>

356
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,217
Hello everyone.

357
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,168
So busy.

358
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,567
Hello.

359
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,400
- Editor-in-Chief.
- You're here.

360
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:06,268
It's me.

361
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:07,685
Let's talk.

362
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,484
Looks like everyone's busy.

363
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,567
We're not busy because of you.

364
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,667
Stopping the serialization?

365
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:15,734
Are you kidding?

366
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:18,000
If I'd known,
I would've just ended it last season.

367
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:20,967
Why all of a sudden?

368
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,584
Don't you read the comments?

369
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,394
I don't.

370
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,584
I'm afraid I'll impulsively kill
those guys who write bad reviews.

371
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,950
These guys are really...

372
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,184
Show me the comments! Let me see!

373
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:30,450
Bear with it.

374
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:31,734
Just bear with it.

375
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:33,400
You don't need to be so angry.

376
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,400
Sit down.

377
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:38,100
I know. I know.

378
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,967
Of course, I know you're really
the secret agent, Jun.

379
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,350
That's why I couldn't tell you because I'm afraid.

380
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:43,850
These comments are...

381
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:47,200
What it is...

382
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,934
Weren't the sales figures supposed to be good?

383
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:51,167
Compared to the ratings,
sales are naturally a bit higher.

384
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,484
But do you know why?

385
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:55,367
It's because some people are paying

386
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:57,700
just to leave you bad reviews.

387
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,734
Get what I mean?

388
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,550
What kind of people do that?

389
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,617
If this keeps up it'll be a total flop.

390
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:06,167
And when you release your next work,
you'll be finished.

391
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:09,417
So let's just scrap this one

392
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:10,667
and start something new.

393
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:12,517
Think about it carefully.

394
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:15,050
- Editor-in-Chief.
- Yeah?

395
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,300
Can I get my manuscript fee in advance?

396
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:19,189
Advance?

397
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,088
What?

398
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,650
Do you think I'm joking?

399
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,317
You're lucky I'm not docking your pay.

400
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,911
After I bought that stock you recommended...

401
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,284
I lost so much I don't know which way is up!

402
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:26,785
Quiet down.

403
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:27,933
10 times the profit?

404
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:28,957
10 times!

405
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,050
You said it would pay off right away!

406
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,117
Be quiet.

407
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:35,200
What if they hear us?

408
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,050
I mortgaged the house.

409
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,634
If my wife finds out

410
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:38,300
she'll definitely divorce me.

411
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,717
Will you take responsibility then? Will you?

412
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:41,019
Divorce isn't a big deal.

413
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:42,250
It just takes a stamp.

414
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,967
I need to buy a coffin now.

415
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:45,135
I mortgaged my house too

416
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,674
and I maxed out all my cards.

417
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,834
If my wife finds out I'm dead.

418
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,250
Also, I haven't been able to
eat properly at home lately.

419
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,394
Why?

420
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:54,917
I'm afraid she'll poison the food.

421
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,551
This is crazy.

422
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,401
What do I do now?

423
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,268
Is this appropriate?

424
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,400
- Hello, honey.
- Yes?

425
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,200
You know I had to
prepare for a big exhibition, right?

426
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,488
I'm swamped right now.

427
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:22,917
I'll probably be home very late today.

428
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,400
Ga-yeong's cram school class is ending soon.

429
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,584
Go pick her up, okay?

430
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,384
Honey, hang in there!

431
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,313
You can do it.

432
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:33,500
Don't overwork yourself.

433
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:34,884
Your health is the most important thing.

434
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,100
But luckily, we don't have huge debts,

435
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:40,384
unlike others who lose
everything on crypto and stocks.

436
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,837
Right?

437
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,250
Don't worry.

438
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:44,967
I only trust you, honey.

439
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,900
Got it? Keep going!

440
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,027
If she finds out, I'm really dead.

441
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,250
Are all those cars here to pick up kids?

442
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:10,800
That's really over the top.

443
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:18,300
Ga-yeo...

444
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:19,684
- Ga-yeong!
- You scared me!

445
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,100
That bastard.

446
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:28,067
- Thanks for your hard work.
- You're here.

447
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:29,450
Oh my god.

448
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,251
What the hell?

449
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:46,285
Ga-yeong.

450
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:48,884
Ga-yeong.

451
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,917
I'm going to kill that bastard.

452
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,684
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

453
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,917
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

454
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,201
I'll be going then.

455
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:38,701
Okay.

456
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:40,635
See you tomorrow.

457
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:42,168
Okay.

458
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:46,953
Good.

459
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:47,977
Go on back. Go home.

460
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:49,301
Ga-yeong.

461
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:02,350
Do you want to have some noodles first?
(Can be a euphemism for a romantic invitation)

462
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,259
Noodles?

463
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:05,367
No, definitely not.

464
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,167
Sure.

465
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,496
I'll kill him.

466
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:18,134
I'll definitely kill that kid.

467
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,767
- Isn't it delicious?
- Totally.

468
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:31,718
Eat it with kimchi.

469
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:32,357
Mm.

470
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,381
You eat too.

471
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:39,484
I don't imitate others. I just follow my gut.

472
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,034
Follow my gut, follow my gut.

473
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,950
It sounds cool.

474
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:46,985
How was that?

475
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,000
Is studying interesting?

476
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,751
What?

477
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:56,750
You don't study because it's interesting,

478
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:58,250
you study because you have to.

479
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,750
Studying isn't for you.

480
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,000
You should rap.

481
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,667
I haven't given up on rapping.

482
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,667
That can just be a hobby.

483
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:06,818
A hobby?

484
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,467
You can't do Hip Hop with that attitude.

485
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:09,984
That's how artists are.

486
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:11,517
If you don't risk everything,

487
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:14,850
you'll never create great rap.

488
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:20,850
Have you read the webtoon "Agent Jun"?

489
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,484
The one with the second season?

490
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:24,950
That one's so boring.

491
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,400
It's really absolute trash.

492
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,784
Absolute trash.

493
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:31,534
I'm gonna kill you myself!

494
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,000
The author is my dad.

495
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,716
Sorry!

496
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,167
I didn't mean it was trash.

497
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,168
No, no.

498
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:41,835
You're right.

499
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:45,250
Dad's webtoon is trash. Absolute trash.

500
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:46,501
Ga-yeong...

501
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,418
Even you?

502
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,723
My dad's finished.

503
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:51,534
Totally finished.

504
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,417
No, I'm not.

505
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:54,249
He's your dad.

506
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,467
That's a bit...

507
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,100
My dad has nothing left to write about now.

508
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,150
I know that.

509
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:01,317
He's written everything he could

510
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:02,817
there's really nothing left to write.

511
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:05,735
It's just garbage.

512
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,284
Ga-yeong, that's too harsh.

513
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,485
Let me tell you.

514
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:13,834
My mom has suffered ever since she met my dad.

515
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:18,500
Now she's finally started
doing something she likes.

516
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,967
I can't let Mom be the
breadwinner again like before.

517
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:25,384
So from now on, I'll be the breadwinner.

518
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,100
I have to study hard and succeed.

519
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,967
I know what you mean.

520
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:44,059
Look at that guy!

521
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,250
It must be fun.

522
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:47,367
Good grief, what's fun about that?

523
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,234
What's going on?

524
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:51,841
How did he get up there?

525
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,043
Is he a thief?

526
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:58,468
Too bad.

527
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:02,318
Who are you?

528
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,767
I am an agent of justice.

529
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:11,084
Trash belongs in the trash can, kid.

530
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,584
Do you understand how
carelessly discarded trash feels?

531
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:19,000
Not all trash is just trash.

532
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:19,833
Huh?

533
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,500
You never know when you
might become trash yourself.

534
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,450
- Got it?
- Yes, got it.

535
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,350
- I asked if you got it?
- Yes, got it.

536
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:30,467
Save the noodles for college.

537
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:40,067
What's up with that asshole?

538
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:51,500
Ga-yeong, I'm home.

539
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,084
You should say hello.

540
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,467
Dad, you're back.

541
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,050
Look at me when you say it.

542
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,217
Dad, you're back.

543
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:12,767
Is there anything you want to say to me?

544
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:14,135
Like what?

545
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:20,817
Men are all trash.

546
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:22,717
Except for your dad.

547
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:23,744
They're all trash.

548
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,700
- What are you talking about all of a sudden?
- I said they're all trash.

549
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,034
Have you been drinking?

550
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,200
Also, when a guy asks if you want

551
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,200
to come over for noodles, never say yes.

552
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,317
If you ever want noodles

553
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:39,750
then study hard, get into university...

554
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:41,062
No, forget it.

555
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:42,383
Just give up noodles for now.

556
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:44,667
Dad...

557
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:46,633
Were you following me just now?

558
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:48,668
No.

559
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,836
I knew something felt weird.

560
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,900
This is so annoying!

561
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:56,434
Dad, you're really the worst.

562
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:00,134
- Dad, get out!
- No.

563
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:02,184
Get out! Get out!

564
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:07,544
Guys are all trash except for your Dad!

565
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:10,350
That kid's clearly in high school
but he has bleached hair.

566
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,950
Why is he trash?

567
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,317
Your webtoon is the real trash.

568
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:17,284
How dare you call my webtoon trash?

569
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:25,717
I'm still here, you know!

570
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:28,050
I'll show you all what I'm really capable of.

571
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,434
You bunch of guys, just you wait!

572
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,267
My mind's completely blank.

573
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:46,733
My mind's blank.

574
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:47,784
I can't draw anything.

575
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,167
I can't draw anything.

576
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:22,734
Who are you?

577
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:23,885
Hello there?

578
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,018
Excuse me.

579
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,251
Grab him!

580
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:40,000
There are so many people. Why use a gun?

581
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:41,167
Grab him bare-handed!

582
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,734
Hey kid,

583
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:12,234
Deok-gyu. Good night.

584
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,034
Good night to you too.

585
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:27,117
Smile.

586
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:40,634
Today, let's try to adopt a mindset

587
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,333
of letting go of all trivial matters.

588
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,817
Okay. Inhale as you raise your arms.

589
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,950
Deputy Director, I have something to report.

590
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:02,417
- We'll talk after this.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:13,917
Deputy Director, today two terrorists

592
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,050
from a neighboring country
attempted to enter illegally.

593
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:17,083
You...

594
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,508
Why are you only telling me this now?

595
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,157
- I was about to tell you.
- Spit it out!

596
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,864
Chief Cheon and Agent Cheol are escorting them.

597
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:26,934
Those lunatics...

598
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:29,267
Couldn't they wait? Two more stowaways already?

599
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:32,817
It's all that Jun's fault.

600
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,767
Drawing webtoons wasn't enough,
he had to go on TV?

601
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,400
Can't he just keep a low profile?

602
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:39,850
Are we still monitoring Jun's family?

603
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:41,917
Per your instructions,
they're under close surveillance.

604
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:44,200
Wait, closely monitoring them?

605
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:47,067
Deputy Director,
Jun's family aren't dangerous people.

606
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:47,880
That's right.

607
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:49,133
Jun is a civilian now.

608
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:50,950
He's someone we should be protecting.

609
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:52,209
Civilian?

610
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,281
That guy's a killing machine.

611
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:54,570
He's just a webtoon artist.

612
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,084
We're discussing deporting Jun.

613
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:58,917
Absolutely not!

614
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,333
Why not?

615
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:02,117
It's the logical choice.

616
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,967
If he is gone from this country

617
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:07,641
those lunatics targeting
him won't come here anymore!

618
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:09,911
Deputy Director, that's completely unreasonable!

619
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:11,967
Why should he bear the burden of
something we should be taking care of?

620
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:14,100
Deputy Director, please reconsider.

621
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:16,950
Jun's webtoon no longer
threatens national security.

622
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:18,735
What?

623
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,417
Jun isn't writing about his past anymore.

624
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,917
He's drawing about his current life now.

625
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,961
Hello, Pierre Jean.

626
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:14,867
Welcome to Korea.

627
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:18,967
- Do you speak French?
- Do you speak Korean?

628
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:20,717
Then we don't need an interpreter.

629
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,050
Oh, that's great.

630
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:24,000
I was quite nervous before.

631
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:28,050
Because I only know the greetings.

632
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,434
- Greetings are enough.
- Thank you.

633
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,184
This is Ms. Lee Mi-na, the one
in charge of this exhibition.

634
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:36,474
I'm Lee Mi-na.

635
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:38,334
It's a pleasure to meet you.

636
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:51,034
I'll be in your care.

637
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:07,934
What style are you looking
for for this exhibition?

638
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,767
I want the exhibition to be special.

639
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:15,567
It's the first time I'm publicly
showing my collections.

640
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,150
Can you give me some keywords?

641
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:22,367
Then I'll research and plan
based on your requirements.

642
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:29,117
But what does your husband do?

643
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:31,367
He's a webtoon artist.

644
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:32,550
An artist?

645
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,950
He's very handsome.

646
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:37,484
That dick (Chibre-là).

647
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:40,250
Bastard (Shibal-nom)?

648
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,334
That's French.

649
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:43,650
It means handsome.

650
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:45,800
Oh, it is French for handsome?

651
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,684
The exhibition hall is this way.

652
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:07,267
Ms. Hae-in! Over here!

653
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,417
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, no.

654
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,850
Only 3 hours. You got here fast.

655
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,434
I was exercising so I didn't
realize so much time had passed.

656
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:17,267
Exercise is very important, of course.

657
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:18,268
I don't want to lose muscle mass.

658
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:24,284
It was too cold on the way here,

659
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:26,962
so I put on the jacket.

660
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:29,350
I hope you don't mind I wore it?

661
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:31,800
Why would I mind? You can keep it.

662
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,567
Thanks.

663
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:35,884
The restroom here...

664
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,434
It's down that way, at the end.

665
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:39,017
I'll be right back.

666
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,484
The passcode is 8585*.

667
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:50,284
Professor Cheon Deok-gyu?

668
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:53,434
What the hell? This damn...

669
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm very happy to be
spending this time with you.

670
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:13,818
Sorry,

671
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:17,084
I drank a bit fast.

672
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,017
You're very cute.

673
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:20,667
Okay.

674
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,085
Yes.

675
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,967
I mentioned it last time.

676
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:36,600
Necktie.

677
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,434
Right.

678
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:41,317
Come over for a bit.

679
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:45,351
Okay.

680
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:58,535
Ms. Hae-in?

681
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,167
Mr. Cheol.

682
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,167
What are you doing here?

683
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:04,720
Do you come here often?

684
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,467
What about you?

685
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,800
I came for a drink alone after work.

686
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,017
I keep a bottle here.

687
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:11,967
Want to have a drink together then?

688
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:13,300
Sure.

689
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:14,551
You don't mind, right?

690
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,051
No.

691
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:24,400
You're doing your master's, right?

692
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:25,518
Yes.

693
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,150
I'm preparing for my PhD.

694
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:29,617
It must be hard, right?

695
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:33,284
You're a professor of public administration.

696
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:34,461
You must understand,

697
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:36,050
since you must have studied a lot. *

698
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,034
Yeah.

699
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,950
It is quite hard doing a PhD.

700
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:41,500
Doing a PhD is really hard.

701
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,684
I need to take this call.

702
00:40:49,885 --> 00:40:51,767
Sure.

703
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:53,967
Go ahead.

704
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,350
When did you start keeping liquor here?

705
00:41:01,435 --> 00:41:02,984
All you do is eat popcorn.

706
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:04,434
Then how did you end up here?

707
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,900
Also, professor?

708
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:09,484
Professor? What professor?

709
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,650
That's hilarious!

710
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:12,867
You...

711
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:14,500
You tracked her location, didn't you?

712
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:17,367
Abusing your position for personal reasons?

713
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,034
That's treason!

714
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:20,750
You should be put on trial immediately.

715
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:21,950
How is that treason?

716
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:25,334
I wanted to protect her from the killer.

717
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,667
That's disgusting.

718
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:27,867
So disgusting.

719
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:29,000
What did you say, brat?

720
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:31,084
Look at your age!

721
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:32,134
What about my age?

722
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:35,250
Looking so creepy.

723
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,734
Creepy.

724
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,750
You're almost 60.

725
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:41,134
Still such a lech.

726
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,934
You disrespectful punk!

727
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,484
You wanna eat shit?

728
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:45,518
Oh, you're back.

729
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:50,534
Oh wow, looking from here...

730
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:53,034
You two look so much alike.

731
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:54,351
Huh?

732
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:56,381
How do we look alike?

733
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,417
Rediscover your original purpose.

734
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,700
I can do it.

735
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:02,050
I can do it.

736
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:08,684
Okay, forget the past.

737
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:11,084
Settle it using my old trade.

738
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,850
No story? Then rewrite it.

739
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:16,300
Things have come to this.

740
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,350
I need to make a new plan.

741
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:23,150
<i>If I were a villain,</i>

742
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:24,850
<i>what would I do?</i>

743
00:42:26,768 --> 00:42:28,017
<i>Times have changed.</i>

744
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,400
<i>No villain follows the old ways anymore.</i>

745
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,400
<i>What's important is money.</i>

746
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:37,084
<i>Information about a company's new products...</i>

747
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:39,417
<i>That must be very valuable information.</i>

748
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,984
<i>Targeting private companies is
better than targeting the government.</i>

749
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:43,867
<i>There won't be any repercussions.</i>

750
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:44,917
<i>Let's see...</i>

751
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,467
<i>The simplest method is armed intrusion.</i>

752
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:51,334
<i>Limited firearms.</i>

753
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,334
<i>With this kind of firepower</i>

754
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:53,703
<i>it should be a piece of cake.</i>

755
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,243
<i>But...</i>

756
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:01,417
<i>But we'll definitely get cursed out for it.</i>

757
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:03,134
<i>First, evacuate everyone outside.</i>

758
00:43:03,135 --> 00:43:04,600
<i>Then mail a bomb,</i>

759
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,400
<i>set a timer, and blow it up.</i>

760
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:11,450
<i>That's too dangerous.</i>

761
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:12,777
<i>Let's find another way.</i>

762
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:21,234
<i>If a building like this catches fire</i>

763
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:23,984
<i>fire departments from this jurisdiction
and others will come to put it out.</i>

764
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:25,167
<i>In that case,</i>

765
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:27,834
<i>it'll be easy to disguise ourselves.</i>

766
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:45,567
<i>A firefighter could enter
through the evacuating crowd</i>

767
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,317
<i>without arousing suspicion.</i>

768
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,717
<i>Once inside,</i>

769
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:01,617
<i>they also need to destroy the server.</i>

770
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:12,017
<i>Jun will be a step behind.</i>

771
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:26,284
<i>The villains casually left the scene.</i>

772
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:28,184
<i>The operation is over.</i>

773
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,267
This is it.

774
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,100
This is the real Agent Jun.

775
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:33,134
Very good.

776
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:34,950
Looks like he's back to his roots.

777
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,150
Good.

778
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:41,856
But...

779
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:44,167
Just in case...

780
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:48,867
This wasn't an operation you
were personally involved in, right?

781
00:44:48,868 --> 00:44:51,117
It's not like I live like this every day.

782
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:53,267
I've run out of experiences to draw from.

783
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:54,950
Really? I thought...

784
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:58,067
This chapter was really great.

785
00:44:58,068 --> 00:44:59,734
The characters felt so real.

786
00:44:59,735 --> 00:45:01,400
The response should be pretty good.

787
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:01,934
Really?

788
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:02,935
Yes.

789
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,500
Yeah. This is it.

790
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:20,067
Isn't it interesting?

791
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,684
It looks quite convincing.

792
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:26,017
Right?

793
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:33,700
Do you know what artists pursue their whole lives?

794
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:34,950
What is it?

795
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:44,834
Turning imagination into reality.

796
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:57,034
<i>Best webtoon!</i>

797
00:45:57,035 --> 00:45:58,150
<i>My life mentor is back!</i>

798
00:45:58,151 --> 00:45:58,467
<i>This is so good!</i>

799
00:45:58,468 --> 00:46:00,467
<i>Release the next chapter soon!</i>

800
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:02,434
<i>A classic never gets old.</i>

801
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,634
<i>Trash who like this trashy webtoon...</i>

802
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:09,434
<i>must all be otaku pigs staying at home.</i>

803
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:10,717
<i>Have you ever even earned 100 won?</i>

804
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:11,767
<i>Have you ever been on a date with a girl?</i>

805
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:14,350
<i>I'm so handsome, I make hundreds
of millions a year, and I drive a Ferrari</i>

806
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:16,100
<i>Cartoonist Kim, you bastard, I pity your parents.</i>

807
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,150
<i>I'd love to see what they look like.</i>

808
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:19,267
<i>Did they actually celebrate
after giving birth to trash like you?</i>

809
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:20,100
<i>You unfilial bastard!</i>

810
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,450
<i>If you have no talent, go learn a trade.</i>

811
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,500
<i>Stop padding chapters just to farm clicks.</i>

812
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,382
This bastard!

813
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,734
How dare you insult my deceased parents?

814
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:27,050
You don't bring family into this!

815
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,234
I swear I'll find him.

816
00:46:29,235 --> 00:46:31,167
That lunatic. I'm going to kill him!

817
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:32,301
VeryHandsome?

818
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:39,700
You're dead meat!

819
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:40,850
Just you wait!

820
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:03,534
Kid.

821
00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:05,017
I've come to kill you.

822
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:11,800
So you're the VeryHandsome?

823
00:47:15,128 --> 00:47:16,593
Kim Soo-hyuk, the webtoon artist?

824
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:25,067
Nobody cares about me.

825
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,484
Let alone a girlfriend,

826
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:30,484
I don't even have a decent friend.

827
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:31,734
What about your parents?

828
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:33,067
They're both busy with work.

829
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:34,734
They don't come back until after midnight

830
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:36,750
and don't care about me either.

831
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:44,334
The only time I get attention

832
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:46,634
is when someone gives me a like.

833
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:48,718
So...

834
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:50,167
even if that's the case,

835
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,134
you shouldn't hide online
writing malicious comments.

836
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,267
Insulting people's parents...

837
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:56,067
that's not what a decent person does.

838
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:57,517
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:00,450
I'm really sorry.

840
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:05,234
But, Mr. Cartoonist...

841
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:06,568
What?

842
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,834
You're trespassing, right?

843
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:12,417
Before my parents get back,

844
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:14,767
you should leave quickly.

845
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:19,427
Alright then.

846
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:20,451
Mm.

847
00:48:20,918 --> 00:48:21,918
I'll leave now.

848
00:48:22,218 --> 00:48:23,300
Not that way.

849
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,134
Leave through the front door.

850
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:28,694
Can I?

851
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:29,477
Mm-hmm.

852
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,501
Thanks.

853
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:32,885
Wait a moment.

854
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:39,067
Eat this on the way back.

855
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:40,644
Thanks.

856
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,350
I've been a fan of Agent Jun
since elementary school.

857
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,117
This episode is really interesting too.

858
00:48:47,735 --> 00:48:48,900
Really.

859
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:51,234
You punk.

860
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:52,984
Don't just stay cooped up inside typing all day.

861
00:48:52,985 --> 00:48:54,317
You talk a good game.

862
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:55,284
Talk more with your friends.

863
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:56,177
Be more outgoing.

864
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:56,700
Okay.

865
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,500
And if you lost some weight,

866
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:00,317
you'd be handsome too.

867
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:01,044
What?

868
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:02,250
Never mind. I'm leaving.

869
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:03,618
Okay.

870
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:10,684
Arrived at the target location.

871
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:13,467
Get ready...

872
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,684
Download complete.

873
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,200
The fire at Neuron Science wasn't an accident

874
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:49,050
but a planned criminal explosion.

875
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:50,417
This is shocking news.

876
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:52,100
According to the police report,

877
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:54,334
their target was the latest AI technology.

878
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,184
The methods of corporate
espionage are evolving rapidly.

879
00:50:57,301 --> 00:51:00,850
It's even more shocking that a crime resembling

880
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,934
a terrorist attack has occurred domestically.

881
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:03,850
Cartoonist Kim...

882
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:06,717
Is he innocent, or is he a terrorist?

883
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:10,150
The webtoon's content is strikingly
similar to the terrorist attack.

884
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,284
Cartoonist Kim...

885
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,917
This is incredible!

886
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:17,067
Ga-yeong! Something terrible happened!

887
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:17,534
Huh?

888
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:18,034
What?

889
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:22,950
I think that Cartoonist Kim is the culprit.

890
00:51:23,168 --> 00:51:26,217
He's desperate for attention.

891
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:29,927
Jun couldn't have planned this, right?

892
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:33,300
No matter how crazy he is,

893
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:34,717
he wouldn't be this crazy.

894
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:37,217
How could this happen?

895
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:38,800
You scared me!

896
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:39,733
Jun, Jun, Jun!

897
00:51:39,757 --> 00:51:40,600
It's the damn Jun again!

898
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:42,767
Damn Jun!

899
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,467
Issue a level-one wanted notice immediately!

900
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:47,100
Bring that guy back right now!

901
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:48,400
Calm down. Sit and talk.

902
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:50,150
How can I calm down? Just bring him back!

903
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,400
Sit down, sit down.

904
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,200
Calm down.

905
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:55,318
Get your hands off!

906
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:00,417
Don't be soft-hearted.

907
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,367
The biggest beneficiary this time is Jun.

908
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:06,084
This guy's webtoon views are skyrocketing.

909
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:07,717
What does this mean?

910
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:09,250
But...

911
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,417
This guy previously revealed

912
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:13,184
state secrets in his webtoon.

913
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:15,384
Now that there are no secrets left to reveal,

914
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:16,634
he's teamed up with terrorists

915
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:19,167
to create new stories!

916
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,634
Bring that guy back.

917
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:22,635
Bring him back!

918
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:23,884
Get up, you!

919
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:24,600
Get up!

920
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:25,100
What's wrong?

921
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,800
Wake up!

922
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:26,984
What is it now?

923
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:28,950
I want to ask

924
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:30,100
what's going on here.

925
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:31,984
I don't understand what you're saying.

926
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,600
- Seriously...
- Dad, your webtoon.

927
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:34,484
Webtoon...

928
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,167
- Show him.
- This episode is great, right?

929
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:39,400
How can things go on like this?

930
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:41,034
With something like this happening,
how can we be happy?

931
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:42,284
Isn't going viral a good thing?

932
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,317
- Honestly, you...

933
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:44,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

934
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:45,401
Quick, look.

935
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,500
What's going on? Look.

936
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,834
After today's webtoon update,

937
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,450
three hours later,

938
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:53,084
an identical crime occurred.

939
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,467
This is outrageous!

940
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:56,468
What happened?

941
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:57,717
Something's wrong, isn't it?

942
00:52:57,718 --> 00:52:59,000
You drew this?

943
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:00,350
First...

944
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,717
Ga-yeong, step outside for a moment.

945
00:53:02,718 --> 00:53:05,184
He predicted this crime would happen.

946
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,444
You didn't draw this drunk, did you?

947
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:09,300
It can't be such a coincidence.

948
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:13,267
Why always pick on my kind husband?

949
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:14,750
After the webtoon got popular,

950
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:16,667
we could finally live a bit happier.

951
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:19,217
Why would he do something like this?

952
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:19,850
Living happily?

953
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:20,634
Yes.

954
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:23,150
Do you know your husband's
current financial situation?

955
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:24,484
My husband...

956
00:53:24,485 --> 00:53:26,584
After Agent Jun got popular,

957
00:53:26,585 --> 00:53:27,650
even though there's still a bank loan,

958
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:28,784
we bought a house. We're living happily.

959
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:30,084
Your husband...

960
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:32,167
He used the house as collateral to buy stocks.

961
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,750
What does that have to do with this?

962
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:34,717
How is it not related?

963
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:37,000
What was stolen from that
company was the AI technology.

964
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:38,800
You wanted to sell it to make big money, right?

965
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:41,217
No, what did you just say?

966
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,067
You want to make big money, right?

967
00:53:43,068 --> 00:53:44,284
No, the sentence before that.

968
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:45,700
"Used the house as collateral to buy stocks."

969
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:46,705
You bastard!

970
00:53:46,729 --> 00:53:48,167
Do you want me to get divorced?

971
00:53:48,168 --> 00:53:49,550
Let go! Let go!

972
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:51,934
Wait, stop.

973
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:53,014
Wait a minute.

974
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:55,616
You...

975
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:57,951
Speak clearly.

976
00:53:57,952 --> 00:53:59,351
What did you just say?

977
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:03,467
Your husband

978
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:05,534
used the house you live in now as collateral.

979
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:07,851
He bought stocks and cryptocurrency,

980
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:09,834
and lost everything.

981
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:10,851
That guy...

982
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:12,884
They also, because of your husband...

983
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:13,984
lost everything.

984
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,684
And he calls himself a senior?

985
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,317
Bastard!

986
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:17,318
Really?

987
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:18,134
Lost everything?

988
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:18,817
No, no.

989
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:19,867
How much did you lose?

990
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,034
Well...

991
00:54:22,935 --> 00:54:23,734
60-70%

992
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:24,751
Tell the truth!

993
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:26,417
Don't be honest.

994
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:27,418
90%!

995
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:31,867
You lunatic!

996
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:35,717
Life was just starting to
get better and you pull this!

997
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:38,017
Do you want to die?

998
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,261
You liar!

999
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:42,301
How could you do this?

1000
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:46,361
Is it funny?

1001
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:47,051
Very funny?

1002
00:54:47,052 --> 00:54:48,334
What's so funny?

1003
00:54:48,335 --> 00:54:50,017
Hid the past.

1004
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:52,601
You also hid many things from him.

1005
00:54:52,768 --> 00:54:54,151
What are you talking about?

1006
00:54:54,152 --> 00:54:55,351
Ms. Mi-na! Ms. Lee Mi-na!

1007
00:54:55,352 --> 00:54:56,017
What?

1008
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,801
Your past is really quite something.

1009
00:54:57,802 --> 00:54:59,417
What's so special about it?

1010
00:54:59,485 --> 00:55:00,984
Play the video.

1011
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:02,784
Ms. Lee Mi-na.

1012
00:55:03,102 --> 00:55:05,367
Original name, Lee Soon-geum.

1013
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:07,734
While at Seoul University,

1014
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:10,067
she was always a cover model.

1015
00:55:10,068 --> 00:55:11,834
Her nickname was '60 Seconds'.

1016
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:15,284
She could charm anyone within 60 seconds.

1017
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:19,384
She became a legend in the famous

1018
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:20,951
nightclubs of Hongdae.

1019
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:22,301
'60 Seconds'...

1020
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,459
Sister-in-law, that tattoo on your arm...

1021
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:27,997
Who is this guy?

1022
00:55:28,022 --> 00:55:30,051
Just someone I know.

1023
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:32,596
Where did you find these photos?

1024
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,673
Psyworld.

1025
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:34,473
Haduri.

1026
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:35,553
Damoim.

1027
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:36,692
C Club.

1028
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:37,619
I Love School.

1029
00:55:37,852 --> 00:55:40,284
I deleted everything completely.

1030
00:55:40,285 --> 00:55:41,401
How did you find it?

1031
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:42,984
We're the NIS.
(National Intelligence Service)

1032
00:55:44,485 --> 00:55:46,784
Mi-na, who are you really?

1033
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:48,867
You seem like a stranger I don't recognize.

1034
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,334
Seriously?

1035
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:52,847
So I had a past.

1036
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:53,667
So what?

1037
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,251
So, do you want to

1038
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:56,301
"return" me now?

1039
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:56,734
No.

1040
00:55:56,735 --> 00:55:57,767
Seriously.

1041
00:55:58,802 --> 00:55:59,600
But still...

1042
00:55:59,601 --> 00:56:01,517
This is an invasion of personal privacy, right?

1043
00:56:01,518 --> 00:56:02,217
Yes.

1044
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:03,017
Right?

1045
00:56:03,018 --> 00:56:06,551
Can you just investigate
an ordinary person's past?

1046
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:08,100
What exactly are you trying to do?

1047
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:09,600
Invading my personal privacy...

1048
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:12,617
Why show photos of me from 20 years ago?

1049
00:56:12,618 --> 00:56:13,401
What did you say?

1050
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:16,234
You bastard! You ruined my family!

1051
00:56:16,235 --> 00:56:17,717
Bastard?

1052
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:18,467
Get over here!

1053
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:19,817
Let go! Let go!

1054
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:20,900
Get her out of here.

1055
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:23,434
Stop making a scene!

1056
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:26,067
I know! This is so embarrassing.

1057
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:26,946
You!

1058
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,817
I'll deal with you later.

1059
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:31,867
What are you looking at?

1060
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,284
You look like a python.

1061
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:35,661
What? Python?

1062
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:36,867
What?

1063
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:39,223
Seriously.

1064
00:56:40,335 --> 00:56:43,051
- I won't go out then.
- Take care, sister-in-law.

1065
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,767
I'm screwed.

1066
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,467
I'm screwed.

1067
00:56:50,468 --> 00:56:51,967
Seriously.

1068
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:54,051
What are you guys even good for?

1069
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:55,834
Even the NIS

1070
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:57,567
shouldn't mess with people's families, right?

1071
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:58,934
Do you wanna die, punk?

1072
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,600
Shoot! Shoot!

1073
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:01,384
Hurry up and shoot!

1074
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:02,267
You think I won't?

1075
00:57:02,268 --> 00:57:04,100
- Shoot!
- You think I don't dare?

1076
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:06,367
Let go of me! You wanna die?

1077
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:08,867
Please calm down.

1078
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,567
That's not the point.

1079
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:11,151
Let go!

1080
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:12,234
What about that case?

1081
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:13,451
Were you really involved?

1082
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:14,701
I'm going crazy!

1083
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:16,367
Why would I do something like that?

1084
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:17,201
Do you have proof?

1085
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:17,867
What?

1086
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,617
Do you have proof you didn't do it?

1087
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:21,867
I didn't do it, so how could there be proof?

1088
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:22,967
An alibi.

1089
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:23,928
An alibi?

1090
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:26,251
When the incident occurred
where were you and what were you doing?

1091
00:57:26,252 --> 00:57:27,467
That day...

1092
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:31,184
Look at this guy.

1093
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:33,267
He's got a guilty conscience,
that's why he won't talk!

1094
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,434
So, that day,

1095
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,934
were you two together?

1096
00:57:40,052 --> 00:57:41,052
Why?

1097
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:44,684
Because I wrote a nasty comment online.

1098
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:47,017
He came to kill me

1099
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:48,242
because he was angry.

1100
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,100
I admit I went a bit too far.

1101
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:50,101
So,

1102
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:52,567
did this uncle really want to kill you?

1103
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:53,751
No...

1104
00:57:53,935 --> 00:57:55,567
If he really did would I still be here?

1105
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:56,428
You punk.

1106
00:57:56,452 --> 00:57:58,517
Lying here will have serious consequences.

1107
00:57:59,052 --> 00:58:00,101
What exactly did he do?

1108
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:01,218
He...

1109
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:04,984
Gave me life guidance.

1110
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:06,052
What?

1111
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:06,850
Do you have evidence?

1112
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,184
This is outrageous.

1113
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,984
- That's enough!
- I have...

1114
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:10,911
What?

1115
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:11,661
I have.

1116
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:12,685
What?

1117
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,901
- What?
- Do you have it?

1118
00:58:13,902 --> 00:58:14,684
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

1119
00:58:14,685 --> 00:58:16,401
- What is it? Where?
- Why?

1120
00:58:16,402 --> 00:58:16,850
What is it?

1121
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:18,401
- You brat!
- I have...

1122
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,901
- So where is it? What evidence?
- What is it?

1123
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:23,584
2024/06/05 22:14:30:01

1124
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:26,467
When did you record this?

1125
00:58:27,285 --> 00:58:28,801
Just in case.

1126
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:31,051
It's a treacherous world.

1127
00:58:33,252 --> 00:58:35,967
I really don't know whether to praise you or not.

1128
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:40,634
How many times do I have to say it wasn't me?

1129
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:42,434
Is that enough?

1130
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:45,252
Take him away.

1131
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:52,185
Wait.

1132
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:55,101
So, he really is

1133
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,117
Agent Jun...

1134
00:58:58,185 --> 00:58:59,400
It's a state secret.

1135
00:59:01,452 --> 00:59:02,452
Okay.

1136
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:07,035
See you next time.

1137
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:08,568
Okay.

1138
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,434
Is there really no one you suspect?

1139
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:21,417
There's something...

1140
00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:25,584
I didn't want to tell you.

1141
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:32,501
Chief, where are we going now?

1142
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:34,601
You'll know when we get there.

1143
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:35,694
Where are we going?

1144
00:59:35,718 --> 00:59:36,851
You'll know when we get there.

1145
00:59:45,518 --> 00:59:46,850
Why are these people here?

1146
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:49,100
A lot of people hold grudges against you.

1147
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,067
Are all these people here to kill me?

1148
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:52,068
That's right.

1149
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:53,844
You should've told me earlier!

1150
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:55,651
You're living a new life now.

1151
00:59:55,652 --> 00:59:58,067
We didn't want you to keep dwelling on the past.

1152
00:59:58,485 --> 00:59:59,617
Yeah.

1153
00:59:59,735 --> 01:00:01,567
You're not Agent Jun anymore.

1154
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:02,951
You're the cartoonist Kim Soo-hyuk,

1155
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:04,367
a family man.

1156
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:05,368
Yeah.

1157
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,568
Chief.

1158
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:08,285
Cheol.

1159
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,900
I just can't figure it out.

1160
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:29,934
Who could it be?

1161
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:31,701
I have a feeling this person is tough.

1162
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:35,818
Basically...

1163
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:37,400
There's only one thing we know.

1164
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:38,461
What's that?

1165
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:39,617
That person

1166
01:00:39,952 --> 01:00:40,984
imitates the events in my webtoon.

1167
01:00:41,268 --> 01:00:42,044
So?

1168
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:43,651
To catch a fish, you need bait.

1169
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:44,652
Bait?

1170
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:46,318
Chief.

1171
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:48,451
I'll draw the next chapter and see.

1172
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:53,467
Reporting on the special operation.

1173
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:56,284
Based on the premise that the
opponent will mimic Jun's webtoon

1174
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,001
we can choose a controllable time and place,

1175
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,167
lie in wait beforehand

1176
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:01,467
and when the opponent appears,

1177
01:01:01,468 --> 01:01:04,134
striking first is our operational plan this time.

1178
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:07,820
What are you doing?

1179
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:08,734
Hurry up and start!

1180
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:10,333
Let me see...

1181
01:01:10,357 --> 01:01:11,650
Where should the target building be?

1182
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,850
Is there a building we can use in our decoy plan?

1183
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:16,100
I've already selected a
few inconspicuous locations.

1184
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:17,951
Wouldn't that be even more suspicious?

1185
01:01:18,235 --> 01:01:20,684
If I choose a specific building
as the target in my webtoon

1186
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:22,017
the opponent will be even more suspicious.

1187
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:23,234
Let's just pick a regular company building.

1188
01:01:23,235 --> 01:01:24,334
Fewer civilians involved.

1189
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:28,617
So I think...

1190
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:30,334
how about a bank?

1191
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:31,535
A bank?

1192
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:33,001
A bank...

1193
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:35,034
Isn't it straightforward?

1194
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:37,801
Robbing a bank to steal money.

1195
01:01:44,418 --> 01:01:47,067
<i>How quickly to scout the target bank and rob it...</i>

1196
01:01:47,968 --> 01:01:49,484
Nobody move!

1197
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:00,817
Go, go, go!

1198
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:03,685
Damn it.

1199
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:05,667
Robbing a bank is a race against time.

1200
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:08,417
The enemy might mobilize everyone.

1201
01:02:08,785 --> 01:02:11,334
It's the best way to catch them all at once.

1202
01:02:11,368 --> 01:02:13,217
If it were me, I'd create a diversion first

1203
01:02:13,702 --> 01:02:14,967
to buy time.

1204
01:02:15,002 --> 01:02:16,834
<i>Get all police responding to the bank</i>

1205
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:18,384
<i>to gather elsewhere.</i>

1206
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:23,351
<i>Then seize the opportunity</i>

1207
01:02:23,901 --> 01:02:25,033
<i>to rob the bank.</i>

1208
01:02:25,385 --> 01:02:26,934
Nobody move!

1209
01:02:32,552 --> 01:02:35,601
The car's blocked in. We can't get out.

1210
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:42,367
Damn it.

1211
01:02:42,985 --> 01:02:44,951
We need to prevent civilian casualties.

1212
01:02:45,435 --> 01:02:47,617
Then let's pick a warehouse we bought

1213
01:02:47,618 --> 01:02:49,284
one far from residential areas.

1214
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:50,734
There's one warehouse that
hasn't been demolished yet.

1215
01:02:50,735 --> 01:02:52,034
Okay, I'll check

1216
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,167
if there's a bank within
a 3km radius that can help.

1217
01:02:54,285 --> 01:02:55,884
Okay,
I'll change the building type to 'warehouse'.

1218
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:06,443
Explosion set.

1219
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:08,410
Lots of cops showed up.

1220
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:12,934
Nobody move!

1221
01:03:13,601 --> 01:03:15,767
Hands on your head!

1222
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:19,652
Freeze!

1223
01:03:20,068 --> 01:03:21,617
Now's the time to make your entrance,

1224
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:23,034
Jun.

1225
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:37,067
- Who is it?
- Kill him!

1226
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:47,467
Wait!

1227
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:54,230
Hey!

1228
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:56,201
If you do that, the money will be blown up!

1229
01:03:56,202 --> 01:03:59,834
What will be blown up isn't the money,
but these people's hearts.

1230
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:02,417
That was awesome.

1231
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:06,134
Cartoonist Kim.

1232
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:09,651
What happened, has nothing to do with you, right?

1233
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:11,001
It really doesn't.

1234
01:04:11,568 --> 01:04:13,117
If the NIS

1235
01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:14,901
contacts you, please let me know.

1236
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:16,207
Okay, got it.

1237
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,667
Be careful.

1238
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:20,185
Mm.

1239
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:21,502
It's been a while.

1240
01:04:22,285 --> 01:04:23,667
Are we carrying out a mission together again?

1241
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:25,167
Reminds me of the old days.

1242
01:04:26,052 --> 01:04:28,501
You wet-behind-the-ears punk, what 'old days'?

1243
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:30,634
I was just saying.

1244
01:04:33,851 --> 01:04:34,817
Good work.

1245
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:36,184
This is all for the country.

1246
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:37,517
Your mission is complete.

1247
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:38,601
What?

1248
01:04:38,996 --> 01:04:40,651
Until this operation is over,

1249
01:04:40,652 --> 01:04:42,150
stay here.

1250
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:43,650
But Deputy Director.

1251
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:46,728
Jun is the key person in this operation.

1252
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:48,234
He's a webtoon artist.

1253
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,028
And a civilian.

1254
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,617
- Deputy Director
- Damn it.

1255
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:53,011
Jun.

1256
01:04:53,035 --> 01:04:54,617
I know what you're capable of.

1257
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:56,701
But you have no authority to act officially.

1258
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:57,817
Don't you think your involvement

1259
01:04:57,818 --> 01:04:59,451
will only make things worse?

1260
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:00,452
That's right.

1261
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:01,967
This is for your own good.

1262
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:03,551
And for your family.

1263
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:08,459
Yeah, Jun.

1264
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:09,483
Don't worry about it.

1265
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:10,417
We've got this.

1266
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:11,725
Yeah.

1267
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:12,794
We'll handle it properly this time.

1268
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:13,367
Okay.

1269
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:14,311
You guys stay out of it too.

1270
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:15,335
What?

1271
01:05:15,585 --> 01:05:17,384
Don't go to the scene causing trouble.

1272
01:05:17,502 --> 01:05:18,584
Stay in the office and work.

1273
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:19,868
Deputy Director.

1274
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:21,351
How can you say that?

1275
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,400
Accidents must be prevented before they happen.

1276
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:28,817
You guys are just a bunch of troublemakers.

1277
01:05:29,935 --> 01:05:30,951
Don't stick together.

1278
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:37,251
I told you not to gather together.

1279
01:05:40,118 --> 01:05:42,417
They're very interested in this operation.

1280
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:45,001
It's a good chance to earn credit.

1281
01:05:45,618 --> 01:05:46,618
What?

1282
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:53,134
Shield Team people are an
eyesore even when they do nothing.

1283
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,517
The credit for this operation

1284
01:05:57,601 --> 01:05:59,201
is all mine.

1285
01:06:02,302 --> 01:06:03,701
It belongs to us.

1286
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:07,651
Until the operation ends,

1287
01:06:07,652 --> 01:06:08,652
just stay here.

1288
01:06:08,985 --> 01:06:10,317
Is this necessary?

1289
01:06:10,735 --> 01:06:12,117
I'm a civilian.

1290
01:06:12,985 --> 01:06:14,834
I just do as I'm told.

1291
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,051
Where do we eat?

1292
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:18,684
There's no mess hall here.

1293
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:20,684
If you're in a hurry, eat some noodles.

1294
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,367
I won't eat noodles!

1295
01:06:23,652 --> 01:06:24,817
Order me some jajangmyeon.

1296
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:27,827
Help me wrap things up over there, got it?

1297
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,851
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1298
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:36,985
Okay.

1299
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,784
I might not be home for a few days.

1300
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,001
What the hell are you talking about?

1301
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:41,467
It's not nonsense.

1302
01:06:41,952 --> 01:06:43,801
The NIS really needs me.

1303
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:44,967
Are you still involved with them?

1304
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,334
Will you snap out of it?!

1305
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,801
Why are you getting involved in that?

1306
01:06:47,918 --> 01:06:49,684
Didn't we agree you wouldn't
do that kind of thing anymore?

1307
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:51,218
Sorry.

1308
01:06:51,302 --> 01:06:54,100
I won't go to the field.

1309
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:55,384
You don't need to worry.

1310
01:06:55,385 --> 01:06:56,934
Don't try to be some hero.

1311
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:58,400
You're a father.

1312
01:06:58,851 --> 01:07:00,567
Don't just think about yourself.

1313
01:07:00,628 --> 01:07:01,961
Of course.

1314
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,384
I'm a father. I have to take care of myself.

1315
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:04,244
Forget it.

1316
01:07:04,268 --> 01:07:05,284
You're getting paid for this, aren't you?

1317
01:07:05,985 --> 01:07:07,434
This is for the country.

1318
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:09,701
You lost so much money in stocks
and you still dare say that?

1319
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:11,150
How are you going to cover this financial hole?

1320
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:11,784
I'm asking you.

1321
01:07:11,785 --> 01:07:13,584
Your webtoon is finished too, you brat!

1322
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:14,868
Sorry.

1323
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:17,360
I'll talk to Chief.

1324
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:19,067
Ask him to settle my labor costs.

1325
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,501
Make sure you tell him.

1326
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:23,361
Tell him I'll sue him if he doesn't. Got it?

1327
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:24,850
Okay, I'll tell him you'll sue if he doesn't pay.

1328
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:25,851
Make sure you do.

1329
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:28,335
Damn it!

1330
01:07:29,468 --> 01:07:31,267
Come on, you scared me.

1331
01:07:36,468 --> 01:07:37,468
Hello.

1332
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:38,635
Let's proceed.

1333
01:07:39,468 --> 01:07:41,317
Okay, got it.

1334
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:55,417
Ga-yeong, the webtoon's been updated.

1335
01:07:58,735 --> 01:08:01,167
Look, the webtoon's been updated again.

1336
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:04,634
Will the webtoon become reality this time?

1337
01:08:27,785 --> 01:08:30,167
The fate of the National Intelligence
Agency rests on this operation.

1338
01:08:30,168 --> 01:08:31,751
All personnel, deploy to the scene.

1339
01:08:31,752 --> 01:08:32,752
Yes, sir!

1340
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:40,835
New intel.

1341
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:50,444
New message!

1342
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:56,784
See you soon.

1343
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:01,701
Chief, I'm heading off now.

1344
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:03,652
Alright.

1345
01:09:03,785 --> 01:09:05,534
I'll go with you...

1346
01:09:06,335 --> 01:09:07,351
That brat!

1347
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:20,952
Huh?

1348
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:22,344
Hey.

1349
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:23,717
Huh?

1350
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,684
Why are you here?

1351
01:09:26,952 --> 01:09:29,001
What are you doing here? Are you lost?

1352
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:30,001
Of course,

1353
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:32,084
I came because our Ms. Hae-in invited me.

1354
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,501
Our Ms. Hae-in?

1355
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,228
Yeah.

1356
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:35,884
How disgusting.

1357
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:37,634
Watch your behavior. Act your age.

1358
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:40,434
I should be asking you that. An ignorant
brat like you doing in an exhibition hall?

1359
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:42,634
You really like exhibitions, huh?

1360
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:44,267
Why don't you go back to eating pancakes?

1361
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:46,651
Look who's talking.

1362
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:50,684
Your hair looks so elaborate.

1363
01:09:50,735 --> 01:09:51,476
How is it?

1364
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:52,901
Do I look good?

1365
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:54,068
Look.

1366
01:09:54,518 --> 01:09:55,151
Here.

1367
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:56,784
Mm-hmm, it's a bit separated.

1368
01:09:57,451 --> 01:09:58,078
Fix it up.

1369
01:09:58,102 --> 01:09:59,651
Fix it up...

1370
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:01,567
- It hasn't fallen, right?
- Just adjust it a bit.

1371
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:02,867
Ms. Hae-in.

1372
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:05,834
Congratulations.

1373
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:07,009
You're here.

1374
01:10:07,034 --> 01:10:08,349
Here, this is for you.

1375
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:14,584
You two are really amusing.

1376
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,267
What's with that tone?

1377
01:10:16,968 --> 01:10:17,844
Ah, okay.

1378
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:18,868
Chief Cheon.

1379
01:10:20,218 --> 01:10:21,218
Agent Cheol.

1380
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:25,351
Long time no see.

1381
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:33,867
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1382
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:35,768
What?

1383
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:38,318
Damn it!

1384
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,417
Two, four, six, eight... Why are there so many?

1385
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:44,001
But you were definitely dead!

1386
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:46,250
If they could fake Jun's death,

1387
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:48,001
why couldn't I?

1388
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:49,134
It's you.

1389
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:51,252
It's you again.

1390
01:10:51,285 --> 01:10:53,250
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

1391
01:10:54,502 --> 01:10:56,334
Long time no see. Let's catch up.

1392
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,335
No!

1393
01:10:57,835 --> 01:10:58,778
Let the woman leave.

1394
01:10:58,802 --> 01:10:59,802
Hae...

1395
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:02,501
- It's dangerous! Give that to me!
- You did well.

1396
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:03,884
- Come on, give it to me.
- Give the gun back now.

1397
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,884
- Ms. Hae-in, you can't hold that!
- Ms. Hae-in!

1398
01:11:05,885 --> 01:11:07,351
Holding a gun doesn't suit you.

1399
01:11:07,352 --> 01:11:10,301
Ms. Hae-in!

1400
01:11:10,302 --> 01:11:11,434
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god!

1401
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:13,467
- Ms. Hae-in!
- What are you doing?

1402
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:15,301
- Ms. Hae-in!
- What are you doing?

1403
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:16,817
Don't you like me?

1404
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,151
- Ms. Hae-in!
- This isn't right!

1405
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:22,234
Ms. Hae-in!

1406
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:23,117
- Ms. Hae-in!
- No!

1407
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:26,617
- Ms. Hae-in!
- No!

1408
01:11:26,618 --> 01:11:27,618
No!

1409
01:11:38,918 --> 01:11:40,134
This operation...

1410
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,384
I will carry it out personally.

1411
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:50,151
What do you want?

1412
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:52,852
Is it revenge?

1413
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,734
That's all in the past.

1414
01:11:55,068 --> 01:11:57,517
Jun is finally living like a human now.

1415
01:11:58,852 --> 01:12:00,734
It's been so long.
Do you really have to go this far?

1416
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:03,584
I'm here to take back what you stole.

1417
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,852
Don't tell me it's...

1418
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:08,202
Hellgate?

1419
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:10,951
Hellgate? What's that?

1420
01:12:11,835 --> 01:12:14,084
Are you doing all this because of Hellgate?

1421
01:12:14,252 --> 01:12:16,001
You'll pay the price too.

1422
01:12:16,085 --> 01:12:17,467
Wait. What price?

1423
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:19,834
And what is Hellgate?

1424
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,084
Chief, what are you talking about?

1425
01:12:22,085 --> 01:12:24,551
If you hadn't stolen Hellgate,

1426
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:27,717
my family wouldn't have died.

1427
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,317
I regret what happened.

1428
01:12:30,518 --> 01:12:32,151
But it couldn't be avoided.

1429
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:39,984
What did you say?

1430
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,235
Stop it!

1431
01:12:48,568 --> 01:12:51,201
I didn't expect things to
suddenly turn out that way either.

1432
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,051
People like us just do what
the country tells us to.

1433
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:04,601
All dogs of the motherland.

1434
01:13:07,502 --> 01:13:09,017
Where did you hide Hellgate?

1435
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,851
I don't know.

1436
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:14,601
We were just busy escaping.

1437
01:13:15,302 --> 01:13:17,701
South's demon, Cheon Deok-gyu.

1438
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:20,617
South's best agent.

1439
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,617
He's comparable to me,

1440
01:13:24,852 --> 01:13:27,151
the North Korean Grim Reaper.

1441
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:30,501
It's hard to make him talk.

1442
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:35,618
Wait.

1443
01:13:35,952 --> 01:13:37,834
Wait, wait.

1444
01:13:38,118 --> 01:13:39,501
Hold on.

1445
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:40,644
Uh...

1446
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:43,117
You might have misunderstood.

1447
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,451
Jun was the main guy.

1448
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:47,134
I was just his lackey.

1449
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:49,167
My nickname is Devil,

1450
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:51,317
not because I was bad to you,

1451
01:13:51,318 --> 01:13:53,334
but because I tortured them.

1452
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:54,684
That's how I got the name.

1453
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:56,384
Where is Hellgate?

1454
01:13:56,385 --> 01:13:58,194
I told you, I don't know! It's true!

1455
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,643
I really don't remember!

1456
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:00,384
I don't know, really!

1457
01:14:00,385 --> 01:14:03,017
I honestly don't know. That was ages ago.

1458
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,201
I'm old, I can't even remember yesterday.

1459
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:07,234
Damn it.

1460
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,027
Just as I thought.

1461
01:14:09,051 --> 01:14:10,901
It'd be hard to make you talk.

1462
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:12,501
It's not like that!

1463
01:14:12,868 --> 01:14:15,501
I really don't know, so I can't say!

1464
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,034
Damn it.

1465
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,134
Why only hit me?

1466
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:21,844
What about that kid over there?

1467
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:23,108
Ask him!

1468
01:14:23,132 --> 01:14:25,051
Maybe he knows.

1469
01:14:25,052 --> 01:14:26,101
Is that so?

1470
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:30,084
You know something?

1471
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:31,851
No, I don't know anything.

1472
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,801
I wasn't even a Shield Team back then.

1473
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,102
Right?

1474
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:36,401
You didn't know, did you?

1475
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,801
That guy... that devil... he knows everything.

1476
01:14:38,802 --> 01:14:39,417
Hit him a few more times.

1477
01:14:39,418 --> 01:14:41,217
You despicable bastard!

1478
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:43,334
Can you even call yourself
a Shield Team acting like that?

1479
01:14:43,335 --> 01:14:43,967
Bastard!

1480
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:44,969
Son of a bitch!

1481
01:14:44,993 --> 01:14:46,467
Why drag me into this? Damn it!

1482
01:14:46,468 --> 01:14:47,884
What did you say, bastard?

1483
01:14:47,885 --> 01:14:48,984
Get over here!

1484
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,051
- Get over here!
- You come here! Come on!

1485
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:53,034
- Am I scared of you, bastard?
- How interesting.

1486
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:53,867
Go on.

1487
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:54,879
You need to take a few more hits.

1488
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:55,951
Hit him more!

1489
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:58,251
- Damn it!
- Hit him! Hit him!

1490
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:00,567
- Hit him more!
- Seriously...

1491
01:15:00,568 --> 01:15:02,951
- You bastard!
- Just kill him.

1492
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:04,534
Yeah. That's right.

1493
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:07,117
- Damn it!
- Stop it!

1494
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:11,034
Is that enough now?

1495
01:15:12,202 --> 01:15:15,084
Why is there never a peaceful day

1496
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,075
for Cartoonist Kim's webtoon?

1497
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:19,027
What a hassle.

1498
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:22,717
Agent Jun.

1499
01:15:23,302 --> 01:15:24,884
- Editor-in-chief?
- What?

1500
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:26,851
Yes, I am...

1501
01:15:27,552 --> 01:15:28,552
But who are you?

1502
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:54,884
Holding out this long without talking.

1503
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,884
Impressive, Devil Cheon Deok-gyu.

1504
01:15:59,118 --> 01:16:00,251
I don't know how

1505
01:16:00,752 --> 01:16:02,834
to say this, brat.

1506
01:16:03,668 --> 01:16:05,301
I've found the location of Hellgate.

1507
01:16:05,452 --> 01:16:07,551
It's in the headquarters' underground storage.

1508
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:09,134
How could you know?

1509
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:10,934
That's classified information!

1510
01:16:12,885 --> 01:16:15,151
Didn't you say you didn't know?

1511
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:17,517
You told me yourselves when you were drunk.

1512
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:19,517
There's nothing I can't find out.

1513
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:21,801
You liar!

1514
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:23,767
You damn nerd!

1515
01:16:23,768 --> 01:16:24,767
How dare you lead me on?

1516
01:16:24,768 --> 01:16:26,201
Did you ever really

1517
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:27,367
love me?

1518
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:32,384
Shorty...

1519
01:16:32,568 --> 01:16:34,201
Let's begin.

1520
01:16:34,985 --> 01:16:35,985
Damn it!

1521
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:39,627
How do you plan to get in there?

1522
01:16:40,752 --> 01:16:43,001
Do you think we agents are just scarecrows?

1523
01:16:50,752 --> 01:16:52,184
To catch me, you've all set up

1524
01:16:52,335 --> 01:16:54,017
an ambush at the bank, haven't you?

1525
01:17:02,935 --> 01:17:04,434
- Come on.
- Young man.

1526
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:05,351
Yes?

1527
01:17:05,352 --> 01:17:06,784
Where is the restroom?

1528
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:08,567
Go straight that way,

1529
01:17:08,652 --> 01:17:09,951
then turn right.

1530
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:11,534
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1531
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:13,701
So your headquarters

1532
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:15,451
is empty now,

1533
01:17:15,868 --> 01:17:16,868
right?

1534
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:20,501
Lately,

1535
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:23,217
to use your Southern expression,

1536
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,217
feeling wronged?

1537
01:17:31,635 --> 01:17:33,944
These guys...

1538
01:17:33,968 --> 01:17:35,978
Why aren't they faster?

1539
01:17:36,002 --> 01:17:38,944
They're so slow.

1540
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:50,617
Chief,

1541
01:17:50,685 --> 01:17:52,484
what exactly is Hellgate?

1542
01:17:53,018 --> 01:17:54,211
It's a nuclear bomb.

1543
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:54,817
What?

1544
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:56,834
Does our country have nuclear bombs?

1545
01:17:57,068 --> 01:17:58,201
In the past, North Korea

1546
01:17:58,235 --> 01:18:00,517
built it using former Soviet technology.

1547
01:18:01,418 --> 01:18:02,834
A former Soviet nuclear bomb.

1548
01:18:03,068 --> 01:18:05,051
Because it's portable,

1549
01:18:05,668 --> 01:18:07,844
it can be detonated anytime, anywhere.

1550
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:09,884
Did Jun steal it?

1551
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:15,611
<i>Intelligence suggests North
Korea plans to use Hellgate</i>

1552
01:18:15,635 --> 01:18:18,717
<i>to overthrow the southern regime.</i>

1553
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:22,767
<i>To deal with Hellgate,
the government dispatched special agents.</i>

1554
01:18:24,352 --> 01:18:26,267
<i>So that agent was Jun.</i>

1555
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:29,328
<i>But then North and South Korea
suddenly entered a peace mode.</i>

1556
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:31,484
The government canceled the operation.

1557
01:18:31,518 --> 01:18:34,828
But that was after Jun had
already successfully taken Hellgate.

1558
01:18:34,852 --> 01:18:37,084
Being too good is also a problem.

1559
01:18:37,202 --> 01:18:40,344
Hearing that someone took Hellgate,
the North Korean commander

1560
01:18:40,368 --> 01:18:42,734
held everyone involved accountable.

1561
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:44,867
Not just Jang Cheol-ryong,

1562
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:47,417
but all their relatives were
targeted for elimination.

1563
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:49,967
At the time,
it was reported they were all eliminated.

1564
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:53,217
Afterwards, he blamed himself for a long time.

1565
01:18:54,085 --> 01:18:56,467
He thought they were all dead.

1566
01:18:56,668 --> 01:18:59,278
Hellgate could kill all the citizens of Seoul.

1567
01:18:59,302 --> 01:18:59,784
What?

1568
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:01,111
We must stop it.

1569
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:02,578
We can't even move right now.

1570
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:04,067
How are we supposed to stop it?

1571
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:07,138
Siri.

1572
01:19:07,185 --> 01:19:08,351
What?

1573
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:09,422
Siri.

1574
01:19:09,447 --> 01:19:10,051
What?

1575
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:10,799
Siri.

1576
01:19:11,202 --> 01:19:12,067
What's going on?

1577
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:13,451
Be quiet.

1578
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:15,761
Did you hide your phone there?

1579
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,317
Why isn't it responding?

1580
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:20,851
I got hit so hard my tongue feels weird.

1581
01:19:21,318 --> 01:19:22,834
You're full of tricks, aren't you?

1582
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:25,918
Yes.

1583
01:19:27,502 --> 01:19:30,110
Siri, call Kim Mong-jun.

1584
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:31,890
Kim Mong-jun.

1585
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:39,311
Hello?

1586
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:40,684
- Bad news!
- Chief?

1587
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:43,260
I can't hear clearly!
Something terrible happened!

1588
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:44,578
It's very urgent! Urgent!

1589
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:46,501
Speak closer! I can't hear!

1590
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:47,851
Hey, you tell me!

1591
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:49,934
- What should I do?
- Come over here.

1592
01:19:52,018 --> 01:19:53,018
Come here.

1593
01:19:55,818 --> 01:19:57,734
Bro, bad news!

1594
01:19:57,735 --> 01:19:58,984
What's the bad news?

1595
01:19:59,152 --> 01:20:01,534
It was all Jang Cheol-ryong doing.

1596
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,578
It was all

1597
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:03,951
Jang Cheol-ryong doing.

1598
01:20:04,452 --> 01:20:05,452
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1599
01:20:05,702 --> 01:20:06,511
Hellgate?

1600
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,361
Yes, exactly.

1601
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,344
That Hellgate.

1602
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:10,134
Recreating scenes from your webtoon

1603
01:20:10,735 --> 01:20:13,201
It's also a distraction to divert
our key personnel's attention.

1604
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:15,067
Recreating scenes from your webtoon

1605
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:17,322
It's also a distraction to divert...

1606
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:18,167
What?

1607
01:20:18,202 --> 01:20:19,317
A distraction.

1608
01:20:19,335 --> 01:20:19,801
What kind of distraction?

1609
01:20:19,802 --> 01:20:21,128
A distraction, you ignorant fool!

1610
01:20:21,152 --> 01:20:22,152
Anyway,

1611
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:24,917
what they want is Hellgate.

1612
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:26,801
- Isn't Hellgate decommissioned?
- No.

1613
01:20:26,885 --> 01:20:29,867
It's right there at headquarters where you are,

1614
01:20:29,918 --> 01:20:32,217
kept in the special underground storage room.

1615
01:20:32,268 --> 01:20:33,944
He said it's at the headquarters where you are now,

1616
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:36,278
in the special underground management room.

1617
01:20:36,302 --> 01:20:37,467
Fortunately, they still don't know

1618
01:20:37,635 --> 01:20:39,101
you're there right now.

1619
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,673
It's up to you now, Bro.

1620
01:20:40,697 --> 01:20:42,117
You have to stop all this.

1621
01:20:42,152 --> 01:20:43,444
Where are you and the Chief now?

1622
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:44,378
Right now,

1623
01:20:44,402 --> 01:20:46,911
we're locked in the basement
warehouse of sister-in-law's gallery.

1624
01:20:46,935 --> 01:20:48,078
Oh, and also...

1625
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:49,684
That employee with sister-in-law...

1626
01:20:49,685 --> 01:20:50,778
She's a fraud.

1627
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,451
Damn it. We were both deceived.

1628
01:20:55,235 --> 01:20:57,411
Chief, a new chapter has been uploaded.

1629
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,544
Did you upload it?

1630
01:20:58,568 --> 01:21:00,251
No, it wasn't me.

1631
01:21:00,252 --> 01:21:01,367
Then who did?

1632
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:04,801
This art style is exactly

1633
01:21:05,418 --> 01:21:06,584
the same as mine.

1634
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:24,560
Explosion in Gangnam.

1635
01:21:24,735 --> 01:21:26,344
- Chaos!
- Police dispatched!

1636
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:29,301
Explosion in southern Seoul at the same time.

1637
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:31,834
Who the hell is this guy?

1638
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:33,134
Today...

1639
01:21:34,202 --> 01:21:35,634
this country...

1640
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:38,267
will disappear.

1641
01:21:39,635 --> 01:21:43,517
Starting today,
there's only one way to save this rotten country.

1642
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:45,911
- Hell!
- Hellgate!

1643
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:48,234
No! The moment that explodes, we're all done for!

1644
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:50,184
Dispatch people immediately!

1645
01:21:50,968 --> 01:21:54,067
Are you perhaps looking for Agent Jun?

1646
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:56,451
The one trained to be a weapon,

1647
01:21:56,685 --> 01:21:59,244
forced to give up all dreams and hope...

1648
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:00,701
Agent Jun.

1649
01:22:00,818 --> 01:22:03,984
Should I now call him cartoonist

1650
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:06,251
Kim Soo-hyuk?

1651
01:22:06,985 --> 01:22:07,928
How do you know that?

1652
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:10,501
There's no cartoonist Kim Soo-hyuk anymore.

1653
01:22:10,535 --> 01:22:12,667
Nor Agent Jun.

1654
01:22:12,868 --> 01:22:14,584
What's left now

1655
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:17,867
is only the terrorist Jun.

1656
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:20,968
Jun!

1657
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:22,851
What exactly are you doing?

1658
01:22:25,635 --> 01:22:27,551
No one

1659
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:29,901
can stop me now.

1660
01:22:37,885 --> 01:22:38,885
No!

1661
01:22:52,618 --> 01:22:55,001
Everyone, he finally confessed.

1662
01:22:55,118 --> 01:22:56,510
I was right.

1663
01:22:56,534 --> 01:22:58,467
Cartoonist Kim is the assassin.

1664
01:22:58,618 --> 01:23:00,251
But did you all see?

1665
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:03,394
This time,
a nuclear bomb will be detonated in Seoul.

1666
01:23:03,418 --> 01:23:06,301
- Now...
- You'll all really die!

1667
01:23:06,335 --> 01:23:09,744
The moment the nuke explodes, Seoul will melt!

1668
01:23:09,768 --> 01:23:10,768
Mom, what should I do?

1669
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:15,934
Look at this.

1670
01:23:16,018 --> 01:23:18,984
Debate King was right.
Cartoonist Kim really is Agent Jun.

1671
01:23:19,152 --> 01:23:20,744
Will they really detonate a nuke?

1672
01:23:20,768 --> 01:23:21,636
Hey!

1673
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,451
That's insane! Then we'll all die!

1674
01:23:23,602 --> 01:23:24,834
What do you mean, die?

1675
01:23:27,735 --> 01:23:28,735
Dad.

1676
01:23:36,952 --> 01:23:38,834
Honey, what's with this webtoon?

1677
01:23:38,835 --> 01:23:39,934
Are you crazy?

1678
01:23:40,418 --> 01:23:41,844
I didn't draw that.

1679
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:43,017
Then who drew it?

1680
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:44,778
You obviously drew it!

1681
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:46,134
Trust me. Besides,

1682
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:47,978
now's not the time to worry about that.

1683
01:23:48,002 --> 01:23:48,834
Where are you right now?

1684
01:23:48,835 --> 01:23:50,634
Me? I'm at the gallery.

1685
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:51,991
- What's wrong?
- Honey.

1686
01:23:55,635 --> 01:23:57,267
I need you to do something.

1687
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:10,628
What is it?

1688
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:12,284
We shouldn't have everyone spread out guarding.

1689
01:24:12,818 --> 01:24:14,284
Quickly contact Deputy Director Chae Hong-ju!

1690
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:15,951
He's in a special operation. Can't be reached.

1691
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:17,118
Damn it.

1692
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:22,084
Welcome.

1693
01:24:22,252 --> 01:24:23,228
- Hello.
- Hello.

1694
01:24:23,252 --> 01:24:24,561
How can I help you?

1695
01:24:24,585 --> 01:24:26,851
I'd like to open a savings account for my child.

1696
01:24:28,252 --> 01:24:30,051
Please wait at window number 5.

1697
01:24:30,052 --> 01:24:32,267
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1698
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:41,534
- How's the situation.
- Not yet.

1699
01:24:43,735 --> 01:24:45,034
Stay in your positions.

1700
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:46,234
Stay alert.

1701
01:24:48,568 --> 01:24:49,428
Hello.

1702
01:24:49,452 --> 01:24:50,535
Excuse me, sir.

1703
01:24:50,559 --> 01:24:51,678
Could you help me get some change?

1704
01:24:51,702 --> 01:24:53,084
Okay. Right this way.

1705
01:24:55,235 --> 01:24:56,501
Where's the restroom?

1706
01:24:56,552 --> 01:24:58,334
- That way, please.
- Okay.

1707
01:25:07,718 --> 01:25:08,718
Let's begin.

1708
01:25:13,718 --> 01:25:14,851
Explosives.

1709
01:25:14,852 --> 01:25:16,151
All key personnel, standby.

1710
01:25:16,935 --> 01:25:19,517
Descend. 300 meters to target.

1711
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:40,961
Damn it.

1712
01:25:40,985 --> 01:25:42,067
Who the hell are these people?

1713
01:25:43,768 --> 01:25:44,984
Who are you?

1714
01:25:48,952 --> 01:25:49,952
Come have a drink.

1715
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:50,651
Okay?

1716
01:25:50,652 --> 01:25:52,617
Come have a drink.

1717
01:25:52,618 --> 01:25:53,618
My treat.

1718
01:25:54,235 --> 01:25:56,534
Where are we drinking?

1719
01:25:56,702 --> 01:25:57,917
This guy...

1720
01:25:58,952 --> 01:26:00,511
You hit me first.

1721
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:01,535
- Okay?
- What?

1722
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:09,468
You punk!

1723
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:16,267
Go down!

1724
01:26:18,718 --> 01:26:21,284
Bastard! Asshole!

1725
01:26:21,352 --> 01:26:23,284
Pervert! Hooligan!

1726
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:25,367
Son of a bitch!

1727
01:26:29,235 --> 01:26:30,201
Sister-in-law.

1728
01:26:30,202 --> 01:26:31,284
Sister-in-law!

1729
01:26:31,618 --> 01:26:33,417
This is really...

1730
01:26:36,368 --> 01:26:37,511
Wait.

1731
01:26:37,535 --> 01:26:38,728
Stay together. Okay.

1732
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:39,752
Stand up.

1733
01:26:40,702 --> 01:26:41,717
Hold on.

1734
01:26:44,618 --> 01:26:45,618
Stop.

1735
01:26:52,502 --> 01:26:54,184
Since the signal cut out,

1736
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:03,151
the server connection failed.

1737
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,378
External communication is cut off.

1738
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:06,084
It seems like someone is jamming the signal.

1739
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:08,201
All communications are completely cut off.

1740
01:27:45,985 --> 01:27:48,411
Where do you think this is? How dare you barge in?

1741
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:49,817
This is the NIS!

1742
01:27:55,735 --> 01:27:57,117
If you want to live,

1743
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:59,367
play all the internal surveillance footage.

1744
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:01,794
Yes.

1745
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,001
Understood.

1746
01:28:11,218 --> 01:28:12,218
What is this?

1747
01:29:01,685 --> 01:29:02,817
No.

1748
01:29:03,235 --> 01:29:04,267
It's them.

1749
01:29:04,352 --> 01:29:06,401
How many combat-ready agents are here right now?

1750
01:29:06,885 --> 01:29:07,885
Just me.

1751
01:29:08,602 --> 01:29:09,602
What?

1752
01:29:11,318 --> 01:29:12,318
Give me the gun.

1753
01:29:12,568 --> 01:29:13,328
No way.

1754
01:29:13,352 --> 01:29:15,617
The Deputy Director said I absolutely
cannot let you act rashly.

1755
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:17,251
I'm Agent Jun.

1756
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:54,251
Pursue quickly!

1757
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:02,667
Quickly report the situation

1758
01:30:02,702 --> 01:30:03,567
to Deputy Director Chae Hong-ju
and request backup.

1759
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:04,834
Do you need my help?

1760
01:30:05,785 --> 01:30:07,751
Back off if you don't want to die.

1761
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:16,351
You need to come see this.

1762
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,184
Looks like there's an intruder.

1763
01:30:29,211 --> 01:30:30,227
Interesting.

1764
01:31:03,468 --> 01:31:05,901
Congratulations, you are now free.

1765
01:31:06,568 --> 01:31:08,767
I'll give you one more chance.

1766
01:31:08,768 --> 01:31:10,684
Jun is near you right now.

1767
01:31:10,802 --> 01:31:13,484
What did you lose because of him?

1768
01:31:13,985 --> 01:31:15,601
My eyes.

1769
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:16,734
My fingers.

1770
01:31:16,735 --> 01:31:18,484
My handsome face.

1771
01:31:18,685 --> 01:31:21,317
What did you lose?

1772
01:31:23,118 --> 01:31:24,584
My everything...

1773
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:32,267
Jun is in this building right now.

1774
01:31:32,585 --> 01:31:34,634
I'll tell you his location.

1775
01:31:35,118 --> 01:31:36,801
Jun!

1776
01:31:37,035 --> 01:31:38,267
Jun!

1777
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:05,094
An assassin trained by the state,

1778
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:06,784
taking revenge on the state.

1779
01:32:07,235 --> 01:32:08,634
That's really something.

1780
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,667
Hey. Did you upload that?

1781
01:32:11,868 --> 01:32:14,017
Although I drew it,

1782
01:32:14,502 --> 01:32:16,217
I wrote the story myself.

1783
01:32:16,285 --> 01:32:18,978
Who the hell do you think you are,
ruining someone else's work?

1784
01:32:19,002 --> 01:32:20,717
I thought you, of all people, would understand.

1785
01:32:21,418 --> 01:32:23,611
Why would Agent Jun become a terrorist?

1786
01:32:23,635 --> 01:32:25,894
What did the country you dedicated

1787
01:32:25,918 --> 01:32:27,317
your life to ever do for you?

1788
01:32:28,768 --> 01:32:30,684
You should hate the country too, right?

1789
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:32,734
I have things I must protect.

1790
01:32:32,768 --> 01:32:34,651
A lovely wife

1791
01:32:35,835 --> 01:32:36,835
and daughter.

1792
01:32:39,235 --> 01:32:40,367
I used to have that too.

1793
01:32:43,485 --> 01:32:47,201
Before my whole family was killed because of you.

1794
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:49,417
I regret what happened to your family.

1795
01:32:50,302 --> 01:32:51,517
Why don't you just kill me

1796
01:32:51,518 --> 01:32:52,411
and take your revenge?

1797
01:32:52,435 --> 01:32:53,701
If Hellgate explodes,

1798
01:32:54,118 --> 01:32:55,984
countless innocent people will die.

1799
01:32:59,602 --> 01:33:00,617
So righteous?

1800
01:33:00,652 --> 01:33:03,251
Were my family members who
died that day guilty then?

1801
01:33:06,202 --> 01:33:08,751
The inhumane hell of that day,

1802
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:11,467
I will show everyone today.

1803
01:33:12,918 --> 01:33:13,918
Stay tuned.

1804
01:33:14,002 --> 01:33:15,501
You lunatic!

1805
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,301
Look at these guys.

1806
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,134
How did you get out?

1807
01:33:22,302 --> 01:33:24,301
We can't just kill him easily.

1808
01:33:24,502 --> 01:33:26,234
He needs to die painfully.

1809
01:33:39,152 --> 01:33:40,152
Move.

1810
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:41,602
Let's go.

1811
01:34:19,735 --> 01:34:21,451
You guys...

1812
01:34:21,902 --> 01:34:23,234
You still want to get thrashed?

1813
01:35:11,818 --> 01:35:12,818
Why aren't they here yet?

1814
01:35:13,618 --> 01:35:16,051
Uh, business hours are over.

1815
01:35:16,802 --> 01:35:18,667
Uh, hold on.

1816
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:24,228
You scared me!

1817
01:35:24,252 --> 01:35:25,144
You kid!

1818
01:35:25,168 --> 01:35:26,528
Why are you here?

1819
01:35:26,552 --> 01:35:27,694
I told you to stay with Jun.

1820
01:35:27,718 --> 01:35:28,694
Deputy Director...

1821
01:35:28,718 --> 01:35:30,017
Headquarters was hit by a terrorist attack.

1822
01:35:30,718 --> 01:35:31,734
What did you say?

1823
01:35:32,302 --> 01:35:33,934
Almost completely wiped out.

1824
01:35:44,985 --> 01:35:46,151
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1825
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:06,802
Stop.

1826
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,111
Take care of them.

1827
01:36:15,135 --> 01:36:16,135
Follow me.

1828
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:22,568
Like it?

1829
01:36:32,568 --> 01:36:34,034
They're acting like idiots, Bro.

1830
01:36:34,202 --> 01:36:36,201
Just you wait.

1831
01:36:36,418 --> 01:36:41,634
We're heading over.

1832
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:44,001
Let's go.

1833
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:46,411
Jang Cheol-ryong.

1834
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:48,201
Let's settle this.

1835
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:49,568
What?

1836
01:37:49,818 --> 01:37:50,867
Scared now that you see me?

1837
01:37:52,152 --> 01:37:53,152
Make way.

1838
01:38:01,035 --> 01:38:02,035
Damn it!

1839
01:38:07,752 --> 01:38:08,967
You bastards!

1840
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:12,384
The numbers aren't even, you despicable bastards!

1841
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:13,385
Chief.

1842
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:20,268
Hey!

1843
01:38:20,718 --> 01:38:21,718
Damn!

1844
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:25,268
Damn it!

1845
01:38:31,985 --> 01:38:32,985
Missed every shot.

1846
01:38:33,018 --> 01:38:34,018
Damn it!

1847
01:38:34,285 --> 01:38:35,617
These guys are out of bullets!

1848
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,051
Calling you bad is an understatement.

1849
01:38:37,318 --> 01:38:39,534
You bastards! That's not how you hold it!

1850
01:38:39,618 --> 01:38:40,967
Get them!

1851
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:44,617
Come on!

1852
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:55,901
My work ended because of you.

1853
01:38:56,768 --> 01:38:58,534
No matter how I look at it, I can't forgive you.

1854
01:38:58,685 --> 01:39:01,401
Agent Jun should have ended long ago.

1855
01:39:02,035 --> 01:39:03,167
Trash like that

1856
01:39:03,568 --> 01:39:05,034
should have disappeared long ago.

1857
01:39:05,035 --> 01:39:06,035
Agent Jun...

1858
01:39:06,735 --> 01:39:07,751
isn't over yet.

1859
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:10,251
Even if it ends, I'll be the one to end it.

1860
01:39:21,268 --> 01:39:22,401
Farewell.

1861
01:39:31,268 --> 01:39:34,267
You shouldn't have touched my face
or disregarded my sincerity.

1862
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:35,601
Hilarious.

1863
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:37,317
That is all just in your head.

1864
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:38,985
Isn't it?

1865
01:39:39,018 --> 01:39:40,317
I can't forgive you.

1866
01:39:41,068 --> 01:39:43,151
Oh my god, Mr. Deok-gyu.

1867
01:39:43,735 --> 01:39:45,701
You think you can hit me?

1868
01:39:49,752 --> 01:39:51,151
I'm the Devil Drill Instructor.

1869
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:53,901
Does a devil care if they hit a man or a woman?

1870
01:39:54,518 --> 01:39:55,851
You!

1871
01:39:58,135 --> 01:40:00,184
You're not on my level. Too slow.

1872
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:01,534
What did you say?

1873
01:40:06,768 --> 01:40:07,784
I take it back.

1874
01:40:49,485 --> 01:40:50,485
Doesn't it hurt?

1875
01:40:52,568 --> 01:40:53,568
My hand hurts.

1876
01:41:08,368 --> 01:41:10,201
While you were drawing those comics...

1877
01:41:10,652 --> 01:41:12,317
I was fighting on the battlefield.

1878
01:41:12,318 --> 01:41:13,318
It's just a webtoon.

1879
01:41:13,918 --> 01:41:14,918
What do you know?

1880
01:41:28,968 --> 01:41:31,267
Oh my god, it moved.

1881
01:41:31,268 --> 01:41:32,934
That's disgusting.

1882
01:41:34,518 --> 01:41:35,518
And you're laughing?

1883
01:41:45,018 --> 01:41:46,018
Hello?

1884
01:41:52,985 --> 01:41:53,985
Mr. Deok-gyu, hold on! Hold on tight!

1885
01:41:57,668 --> 01:41:59,501
I used to like you.

1886
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:00,834
Mr. Deok-gyu!

1887
01:42:10,135 --> 01:42:11,135
A little more.

1888
01:42:29,952 --> 01:42:31,834
Bastard.

1889
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:55,828
Chief!

1890
01:42:55,852 --> 01:42:56,551
Chief!

1891
01:42:56,552 --> 01:42:57,552
How outrageous!

1892
01:42:58,052 --> 01:42:59,052
Die!

1893
01:43:04,268 --> 01:43:05,617
You were already tricked like that,
and you fell for it again!

1894
01:43:05,852 --> 01:43:07,651
You've really lived all these years for nothing!

1895
01:43:08,352 --> 01:43:10,267
What did you say? Bastard! Get over here!

1896
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:13,051
You! Get over here! Hey! Get over here!

1897
01:43:13,052 --> 01:43:14,767
Fuck you...

1898
01:43:43,952 --> 01:43:45,134
Stop Hellgate.

1899
01:43:46,002 --> 01:43:47,002
What?

1900
01:43:47,252 --> 01:43:48,467
Are you scared?

1901
01:44:16,702 --> 01:44:18,751
See you in hell.

1902
01:44:26,752 --> 01:44:28,717
- It's gonna blow!
- There's no time!

1903
01:44:31,285 --> 01:44:32,801
Load Hellgate onto the helicopter and fly it out.

1904
01:44:32,802 --> 01:44:33,967
It has to detonate over the sea.

1905
01:44:34,252 --> 01:44:36,684
Above 30 kilometers, or there will be damage.

1906
01:44:37,718 --> 01:44:39,634
Bro, who's flying the helicopter?

1907
01:44:39,635 --> 01:44:41,010
- I'll...
- Chief!

1908
01:44:42,268 --> 01:44:43,934
What the hell?

1909
01:44:43,935 --> 01:44:45,601
I haven't even gotten married yet!

1910
01:44:45,602 --> 01:44:46,717
Didn't you say you were married to the country?

1911
01:44:46,718 --> 01:44:48,867
To hell with the country!

1912
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:52,944
Soo-hyuk.

1913
01:44:52,968 --> 01:44:53,861
No way!

1914
01:44:53,885 --> 01:44:54,885
I...

1915
01:44:55,052 --> 01:44:56,967
I've never even had a girlfriend!

1916
01:44:57,585 --> 01:44:58,967
Didn't you date someone?

1917
01:44:58,968 --> 01:45:00,434
Bro, you're married with kids!

1918
01:45:00,435 --> 01:45:01,934
I haven't even had my first kiss!

1919
01:45:01,935 --> 01:45:03,984
Then what are we supposed to do?

1920
01:45:03,985 --> 01:45:05,234
There's no time!

1921
01:45:05,485 --> 01:45:06,485
Chief!

1922
01:45:06,652 --> 01:45:07,234
Jun.

1923
01:45:07,235 --> 01:45:08,235
You guys are unbelievable...

1924
01:45:08,485 --> 01:45:09,734
Don't you know I have a wife and daughter?

1925
01:45:09,735 --> 01:45:11,784
But the bomb's about to explode!

1926
01:45:17,535 --> 01:45:20,034
As chief of the Shield team,
I have something to say.

1927
01:45:20,868 --> 01:45:22,617
There's really no other choice.

1928
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:24,561
Chief!

1929
01:45:24,585 --> 01:45:25,884
Is this really the only way?

1930
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:27,418
Yeah.

1931
01:45:30,752 --> 01:45:32,801
If you don't play you lose,
Rock Paper Scissors.

1932
01:45:32,802 --> 01:45:34,634
Rock Paper Scissors!

1933
01:45:34,802 --> 01:45:35,802
Rock Paper Scissors!

1934
01:45:39,502 --> 01:45:40,884
A real man always plays rock!

1935
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:53,185
Chief!

1936
01:45:54,018 --> 01:45:55,018
Jun!

1937
01:45:55,535 --> 01:45:56,535
Please take care

1938
01:45:56,785 --> 01:45:57,785
of my family.

1939
01:45:57,868 --> 01:45:58,678
Jun...

1940
01:45:58,702 --> 01:45:59,702
Bro...

1941
01:46:00,818 --> 01:46:02,151
Bro, thank you.

1942
01:46:02,152 --> 01:46:03,152
Jun...

1943
01:46:03,702 --> 01:46:04,594
Ge...

1944
01:46:04,618 --> 01:46:05,618
Jun!

1945
01:46:05,702 --> 01:46:06,834
Jun!

1946
01:46:39,652 --> 01:46:40,652
Hello?

1947
01:46:40,868 --> 01:46:41,868
Honey?

1948
01:46:42,535 --> 01:46:43,784
Honey, are you okay?

1949
01:46:44,068 --> 01:46:45,034
Are you sure you're alright?

1950
01:46:45,035 --> 01:46:46,035
Yeah, I'm fine.

1951
01:46:46,652 --> 01:46:47,367
What about Ga-yeong?

1952
01:46:47,368 --> 01:46:49,217
Dad, I'm here, next to Mom.

1953
01:46:49,585 --> 01:46:50,917
Ga-yeong's right here. Don't worry.

1954
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:52,467
I was so worried about you.

1955
01:46:53,285 --> 01:46:54,501
Dad, what's that sound?

1956
01:46:54,785 --> 01:46:55,785
Why is it so noisy?

1957
01:46:56,252 --> 01:46:57,252
I'm in a helicopter right now.

1958
01:46:57,552 --> 01:46:58,552
What do you mean, you're in a helicopter?

1959
01:46:58,802 --> 01:47:00,017
I found the bomb,

1960
01:47:01,168 --> 01:47:02,134
but I can't stop it.

1961
01:47:02,135 --> 01:47:03,301
What does that mean?

1962
01:47:03,718 --> 01:47:05,517
Then what are you going to do?

1963
01:47:06,352 --> 01:47:08,401
I have to fly it out over
the sea and let it explode.

1964
01:47:08,935 --> 01:47:10,351
What are you talking about?

1965
01:47:10,352 --> 01:47:12,151
- Why are you doing that?
- Yeah!

1966
01:47:12,352 --> 01:47:14,734
Let someone else do it!
Why does it have to be you?

1967
01:47:14,735 --> 01:47:15,867
To detonate it safely,

1968
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,184
it has to be me.

1969
01:47:17,185 --> 01:47:19,617
Honey, don't do this.

1970
01:47:20,068 --> 01:47:21,068
Honey...

1971
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,201
It must have been hard being with me, right?

1972
01:47:25,285 --> 01:47:26,285
I really love you.

1973
01:47:27,985 --> 01:47:28,985
Our Ga-yeong,

1974
01:47:29,618 --> 01:47:30,617
you must raise her well.

1975
01:47:30,618 --> 01:47:31,906
Honey, why are you acting like this?

1976
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:32,667
Stop it.

1977
01:47:32,918 --> 01:47:33,918
Ga-yeong.

1978
01:47:34,168 --> 01:47:35,217
Be good and listen to Mom.

1979
01:47:36,452 --> 01:47:37,801
Stay healthy.

1980
01:47:40,385 --> 01:47:41,517
To Mom and me,

1981
01:47:42,918 --> 01:47:44,384
you are the most precious thing.

1982
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:47,317
Dad, I'm sorry.

1983
01:47:48,102 --> 01:47:49,102
Sorry for what?

1984
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:55,351
I was too mean to you.

1985
01:47:55,852 --> 01:47:56,901
No, no.

1986
01:47:57,152 --> 01:47:58,152
It's nothing like that.

1987
01:47:58,652 --> 01:47:59,652
Dad, it's okay.

1988
01:48:00,485 --> 01:48:01,651
It's okay because I'm your dad.

1989
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:04,334
Dad, I'm sorry.

1990
01:48:08,118 --> 01:48:10,167
Ga-yeong, I love you.

1991
01:48:12,202 --> 01:48:13,202
Honey...

1992
01:48:14,952 --> 01:48:16,551
The best thing I ever did in my life

1993
01:48:18,168 --> 01:48:19,168
was meeting you

1994
01:48:20,302 --> 01:48:21,434
and having our daughter.

1995
01:48:24,085 --> 01:48:25,085
I love you.

1996
01:48:26,135 --> 01:48:27,135
Honey...

1997
01:48:27,335 --> 01:48:28,584
I'm so scared.

1998
01:48:30,585 --> 01:48:32,084
The reason I played the stock market

1999
01:48:33,452 --> 01:48:34,452
was because I really wanted

2000
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:36,084
to provide for our daughter.

2001
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:38,301
I really thought it would turn out well.

2002
01:48:39,502 --> 01:48:41,551
I'm sorry for making you and Ga-yeong suffer.

2003
01:48:43,035 --> 01:48:44,651
My editor-in-chief said it would turn out well.

2004
01:48:46,402 --> 01:48:47,834
None of that matters, honey.

2005
01:48:48,902 --> 01:48:49,902
Just come back.

2006
01:48:50,185 --> 01:48:51,694
Honey, just come back alive.

2007
01:48:51,718 --> 01:48:53,017
Honey, I'm sorry.

2008
01:48:53,718 --> 01:48:54,718
I love you both.

2009
01:48:55,852 --> 01:48:56,601
You two must live well.

2010
01:48:56,602 --> 01:48:58,267
Dad, don't go.

2011
01:48:58,268 --> 01:48:59,651
Without you...

2012
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:19,785
Brother!

2013
01:49:20,468 --> 01:49:21,468
Jun!

2014
01:49:22,418 --> 01:49:26,534
Dad!

2015
01:49:27,685 --> 01:49:29,867
Honey!

2016
01:49:38,602 --> 01:49:40,284
Jun went flying over there!

2017
01:49:44,452 --> 01:49:45,452
Jun!

2018
01:49:56,118 --> 01:49:57,118
Hello?

2019
01:49:57,585 --> 01:49:58,585
Chief?

2020
01:50:01,235 --> 01:50:03,901
What's going on? This voice...

2021
01:50:04,985 --> 01:50:05,985
Is that Jun's voice? Am I hearing things?

2022
01:50:06,185 --> 01:50:07,917
What's with the reaction?

2023
01:50:07,985 --> 01:50:09,784
Chief, it's me Jun.

2024
01:50:11,035 --> 01:50:12,617
- Jun?
- It's Jun! Can't you hear me?

2025
01:50:12,618 --> 01:50:13,951
Kim Mong-jun.

2026
01:50:13,952 --> 01:50:14,952
Jun!

2027
01:50:15,285 --> 01:50:16,717
It really is you, Jun, right?

2028
01:50:17,452 --> 01:50:19,134
Where are you? You're not dead?

2029
01:50:19,418 --> 01:50:20,584
I was a Shield Team once.

2030
01:50:21,252 --> 01:50:22,252
This much is nothing.

2031
01:50:22,585 --> 01:50:23,934
You know how well I can swim.

2032
01:50:28,385 --> 01:50:30,201
Not that. The helicopter.

2033
01:50:30,568 --> 01:50:31,568
Oh, that.

2034
01:50:32,368 --> 01:50:33,517
I set it to autopilot.

2035
01:50:34,302 --> 01:50:36,151
That helicopter has autopilot?

2036
01:50:36,768 --> 01:50:37,784
Does it?

2037
01:50:58,368 --> 01:51:00,334
Forget it. Hurry and pick me up.

2038
01:51:00,702 --> 01:51:02,584
Jun!

2039
01:51:08,668 --> 01:51:09,668
Dad!

2040
01:51:10,385 --> 01:51:12,434
- Honey!
- Dad!

2041
01:51:12,585 --> 01:51:13,934
Jun!

2042
01:51:14,085 --> 01:51:14,584
Jun!

2043
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:16,784
- Honey!
- Dad!

2044
01:51:18,468 --> 01:51:19,468
Jun!

2045
01:51:21,018 --> 01:51:22,200
Honey. Ga-yeong.

2046
01:51:24,651 --> 01:51:25,651
Honey.

2047
01:51:26,852 --> 01:51:27,828
Are you okay?

2048
01:51:27,852 --> 01:51:28,627
I'm okay.

2049
01:51:28,651 --> 01:51:30,617
Gosh, I thought you were dead.

2050
01:51:30,702 --> 01:51:31,702
I wouldn't leave my family behind

2051
01:51:32,151 --> 01:51:33,121
to die.

2052
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:33,784
I won't die.

2053
01:51:34,068 --> 01:51:35,068
Dad won't die.

2054
01:51:36,485 --> 01:51:38,551
I missed you.

2055
01:51:41,335 --> 01:51:42,417
Looking at them makes me

2056
01:51:42,835 --> 01:51:43,967
want to get married.

2057
01:51:44,668 --> 01:51:45,967
I want to start a family too.

2058
01:51:47,168 --> 01:51:48,834
I don't want to date women anymore.

2059
01:51:50,468 --> 01:51:51,767
I want to marry the country.

2060
01:51:53,385 --> 01:51:54,385
Yes, that's right.

2061
01:51:54,918 --> 01:51:56,384
We should marry the country.

2062
01:51:58,052 --> 01:51:59,317
Personal relationships

2063
01:51:59,552 --> 01:52:00,601
aren't for us.

2064
01:52:00,885 --> 01:52:01,861
Right.

2065
01:52:01,891 --> 01:52:02,891
For Shield Team,

2066
01:52:03,052 --> 01:52:04,317
love is meaningless.

2067
01:52:04,518 --> 01:52:05,518
Right.

2068
01:52:27,035 --> 01:52:28,043
Are you guys okay?

2069
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:29,334
You look seriously injured.

2070
01:52:30,802 --> 01:52:32,851
Because we were fighting, I forgot about the pain.

2071
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:34,780
Can I get some treatment?

2072
01:52:34,805 --> 01:52:37,401
Please take a look. I can see the bone in my nose.

2073
01:52:37,685 --> 01:52:38,685
- Get away.
- Chief.

2074
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:40,851
- I want to get married.
- Weren't you going to marry the country?

2075
01:52:41,385 --> 01:52:42,651
It hasn't even been a minute since you said that.

2076
01:52:42,802 --> 01:52:45,101
Maybe this lady here is the "country."

2077
01:52:45,935 --> 01:52:46,935
Am I shaking?

2078
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:48,401
Just let me have this one.

2079
01:52:49,651 --> 01:52:50,651
I love you.

2080
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:21,784
- Hello?
- Cartoonist Kim?

2081
01:53:21,785 --> 01:53:23,701
How's the final issue of
'Agent Jun coming along?

2082
01:53:23,702 --> 01:53:24,501
It's almost finished.

2083
01:53:24,502 --> 01:53:25,034
Is that right?

2084
01:53:25,035 --> 01:53:27,417
I wanted to wait until it was confirmed,
so I didn't tell you.

2085
01:53:27,418 --> 01:53:29,684
Agent Jun is being adapted into an animation.

2086
01:53:29,718 --> 01:53:31,884
- It's happening!
- Seriously?

2087
01:53:32,218 --> 01:53:33,265
I already sent you the opening sequence.

2088
01:53:33,289 --> 01:53:34,051
Take a look.

2089
01:53:34,052 --> 01:53:35,467
Awesome!

2090
01:53:41,135 --> 01:53:42,934
Honey! Ga-yeong!

2091
01:53:43,102 --> 01:53:43,767
What's wrong?

2092
01:53:43,768 --> 01:53:44,851
My webtoon...

2093
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:46,784
is getting an animation!

2094
01:53:47,102 --> 01:53:48,484
What? Really?

2095
01:53:49,535 --> 01:53:50,851
They already sent me the opening video.

2096
01:53:50,852 --> 01:53:52,034
Really? Let me see! Let me see!

2097
01:53:52,035 --> 01:53:53,035
Here.
