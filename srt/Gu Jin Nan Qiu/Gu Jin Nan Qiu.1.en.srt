00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,337
[This story is fictional.]

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,433
[Zhong Zebin as Wen Hai]

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,566
"According to the court's verdict, the Wen couple died in an accident. On Hai was not yet 18 years old, so his brother Co Hoai Chau became his sole guardian."

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,200
Is this my new home?

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,266
Is there no one at home?

6
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,550
[Duong Than Hi as Co Hoai Chau]

7
00:00:58,633 --> 00:00:59,800
Who are you?

8
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,100
What to do here?

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,266
I... My name is On Hai

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,700
Turns out he's an embarrassing stepchild.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,700
Do you still have to wait for me to invite you in?

12
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,933
So this is my rich brother.

13
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,900
Don't bring trash in.

14
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,066
This is not trash.

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,466
It's a painting

16
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,166
Also my friend.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,666
My painting!

18
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,133
This is a painting that has been with me for many years.

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,633
Be my only friend!

20
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:56,266
I didn't expect you to be the type of person who likes attention.

21
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,000
If you don't like it

22
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,200
It's okay if I go!

23
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,666
In the end, what do you want?

24
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,866
I'm already angry at that.

25
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,533
After all... What are you doing?!

26
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,100
Look at your poor, weak appearance.

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Just like your shameless mother.

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,733
Just pretend to be pitiful.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,000
The illegitimate child was born to a shameless little girl

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,666
Like mother, like child.

31
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,666
I'm not an illegitimate child.

32
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:35,666
I have parents.

33
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,933
I live with my parents.

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,700
That useless man

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,600
Just like that, he died because of a shameless little girl.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,633
Of course I inherited his property.

37
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,166
Including you.

38
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,533
An embarrassing stepchild.

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,066
Was my parents' death an accident?!

40
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,933
The court decided to hand you over to me.

41
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,466
I haven't looked for you yet

42
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,933
But you've already offered yourself to the door.

43
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,066
My good brother

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,666
From today onwards

45
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,400
You have become my personal property

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,466
Without my permission

47
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,566
You can't leave.

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
He answered me

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,100
You... master

50
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,733
The owner seems interested in the West Coast project.

51
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,200
It seems he can't hide his ambition anymore.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,933
I am not an illegitimate child

53
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,466
Not me

54
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,800
I am not an illegitimate child

55
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,366
Not me

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
No, I'm not an illegitimate child.

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,133
I'm not an illegitimate child

58
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,100
I have parents

59
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,466
I live with my parents!

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,500
Not me!

61
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:23,066
Not me!

62
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,200
You are On Hai, right?

63
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,066
My father is your brother's uncle.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Don't talk to me in that angry tone

65
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,433
Laughing is more unsightly than crying.

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,433
Practice for me!

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,933
Go away!
