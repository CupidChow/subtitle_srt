1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,766
No, no

2
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:01,500
, no!

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,566
You must be Wen Hai, right?

4
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,233
My dad is your brother's maternal uncle

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,933
. Do n't talk to me

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,400
with that lewd tone

7
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,533
.

8
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,466
Your smile is uglier than a cry

9
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:14,533
. Get lost!

10
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm not an illegitimate child. I'm not

11
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:18,733
, I

12
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,366
'm not!

13
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm dreaming again

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,800
. Gu Huaizhou,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,233
is this your half-brother?

16
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,733
He looks much cuter than you.

17
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,100
Hello,

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,600
you must be Wen Hai.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,733
My name is Gu Leng.

20
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,266
My dad is your brother's maternal uncle.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,666
Theoretically,

22
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,266
although we are not related by blood

23
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,133
, according to the Gu family's seniority,

24
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,600
you can call me cousin.

25
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,666
You didn't

26
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,066
come to our family

27
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,133
to try and get a share of the Gu family's assets, did you?

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,966
Gu Huaizhou,

29
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,533
why isn't your brother talking?

30
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,000
Is he mute?

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,833
I didn't come here for money

32
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,233
. You don't want money,

33
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:26,233
did you come to our family simply to claim kinship?

34
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:29,266
I don't care what your purpose is in entering the Gu family.

35
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,233
Everything that man left behind belongs to me,

36
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,666
including you.

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,233
I just want the truth.

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,466
Please don't make your brother angry!

39
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,666
If you do,

40
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,400
he's a cold and ruthless person

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,100
, but he can go crazy.

42
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,700
If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute.

43
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,500
Just enjoy your red wine.

44
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,166
Oh,

45
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,000
I almost forgot,

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,966
you can't see red

47
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:55,400
, but I can see your heart—it

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,666
's shiny black . Don't

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,133
talk to me in that lewd tone.

50
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,533
I don't tolerate idlers here.

51
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,900
Starting tomorrow,

52
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,633
you'll start cleaning the whole house.

53
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,266
I don't want to see a gloomy face first thing in the morning.

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
Ha, your

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,400
smile is uglier than a cry.

56
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,866
So diligent, cousin!

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,300
Keep it up,

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,000
cousin!

59
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:58,833
Come

60
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:00,800
here

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,133
, sit down.

62
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,266
Look

63
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,566
at this coffee, is it good?

64
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,433
Try it,

65
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,933
is it good?

66
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:21,733
"

67
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,266
Hey, since we're all family,

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,566
don't be so formal.

69
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,000
Call me cousin from now on.

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,100
Go

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,200
ahead and get busy.

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,266
You seem quite interested in him.

73
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,466
It's normal

74
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,100
for a cousin to care about his younger cousin

75
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,933
. Are you having your old habit again?

76
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,233
The West Coast project is mine

77
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,533
, and he's mine too.

78
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,500
Don't even think about touching him.

79
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,566
Hey,

80
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,366
if—

81
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,666
I mean, if

82
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,366
you had to choose between him and the West Coast,

83
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,700
which would you choose

84
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,666
? No, if

85
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,066
they're both mine...

86
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,733
Hey, I was just joking

87
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,866
. I don't like joking.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,500
Gu Huaizhou,

89
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,966
you're so boring.

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,966
Why does he look so sad?

91
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,300
But he plays quite well. He ca n't even play the piano

92
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,233
properly. Sure enough,

93
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,633
he's got the blood of a good-for-nothing in his veins.

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,266
He 's a little

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,766
good-

96
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,666
for-nothing too. I'd rather raise a dog than you.

97
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,166
I was wrong, Mom.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,866
No man is any good.

99
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:32,833
Get up

100
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,933
and practice

101
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,900
! Are you alright?

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Get out of here!

103
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,433
No wonder you're the offspring of a scoundrel.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,933
You're really good at playing the victim

105
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,566
. Let me go!

106
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,366
Your gambling dad owes me a million.

107
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,166
Do you know how much a million is?

108
00:05:59,033 --> 00:05:59,966
I can work to pay off the debt

109
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,733
. He drinks a glass of red wine before bed every night. Behave

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,500
yourself!"
