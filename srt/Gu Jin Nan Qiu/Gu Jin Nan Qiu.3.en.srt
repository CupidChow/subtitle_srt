1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
No wonder you're the offspring of a scoundrel,

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:04,300
you're so good at playing the victim

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
! Let me go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Your gambling-addicted dad owes me a million !

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,533
Do you know how much a million is?

6
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:10,000
Hmm?

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,300
I can work to pay off the debt.

8
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,700
He

9
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,333
drinks a glass of red wine

10
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:14,833
before bed every night

11
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:18,866
. Behave yourself!

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,566
Are you alright?

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,033
Get lost! My cousin,

14
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,066
how could you be so careless?

15
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,933
Your hand is bleeding. Come on, come on!

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,533
No wonder you're

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,000
the offspring of a scoundrel,

18
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,900
you're so good at playing the victim.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,566
Since you don't like your own brother

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,066
, I can take him away.

21
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,033
Whether I like him or not is my business.

22
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,366
If you keep doing this,

23
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:12,833
I'll let Uncle know what you're doing outside.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,666
He might not be happy.

25
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,200
Fine

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,300
, be nicer

27
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,666
to your own brother.

28
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,100
I have other things to do. I

29
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,766
'm not playing with you

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,333
anymore. Sit down.

31
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,166
What are you doing?

32
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:36,966
Don't move him.

33
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,600
Does he have a split personality?

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,566
Don't put it in your mouth next time, it'll

35
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,300
get infected.

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,233
Why is he sometimes so irritable

37
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,733
and sometimes so gentle

38
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,400
? Damn it!

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,033
I actually care about him.

40
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,566
Stay away from Gu Leng.

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,133
He's not a good person.

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,166
What kind of person are you?

43
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,733
Who are you

44
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,266
? Let me go!

45
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,366
Let me go!

46
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,633
Who are you?

47
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,800
Why are you arresting me?

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,466
My cousin Jiang Yin ran away!

49
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,133
He's Jiang Yin's son, Jiang Nan

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,100
!

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,133
What did you do to my dad? He's

52
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,233
quite handsome,

53
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,200
especially his eyes, they're

54
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,600
so beautiful

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,666
, you know?

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,866
Your gambling-addicted dad owes me 1 million

57
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,700
! 1 million, do you know how much that is?

58
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,500
Hmm?

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Impossible!

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Since he's playing hide-and-seek with me now

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,866
, why don't I play with his son ?

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Impossible

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
! You're still a virgin!

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Hmm, how about this:

65
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,733
since the son is responsible for the father's debts, and

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,100
your dad ran away,

67
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,466
how about we pay off the debt with our bodies?

68
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,400
I
... I beg you ,

69
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,033
I can work to pay off the debt!

70
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh, I don't need that little bit of money you earn from working!

71
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,066
Gu Huaizhou recently got a new toy

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
that's making me quite envious

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,433
. Take

74
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,400
it with you!

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,333
No

76
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,166
! No !

77
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,500
Let me go! Let me go!

78
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,000
Cousin,

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,733
cousin,

80
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:45,733
cousin,

81
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,600
you're so cute!

82
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:47,733
If you don't have anything else,

83
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:48,800
I'll go to work first.

84
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Gu Huaizhou treated me like this, do you

85
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,133
want to get revenge on him?

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,733
Gu Huaizhou,

87
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,600
your parents had problems as soon as you returned to the country

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
. What do you mean?

89
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,000
I know you came to the Gu family

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,900
just to find out if

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,433
your parents' deaths

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,866
were related to the Gu family.

93
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,000
I can help you

94
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
! What do you want to do?

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,466
This

96
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,633
is a bottle of slow-acting hallucinogens.

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,766
He

98
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,400
drinks a glass of red wine

99
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,100
before bed every night, you know what I mean?

100
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,533
Gu Huaizhou,

101
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,866
enjoy yourself tonight

102
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,100
! Let go! Behave

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,200
yourself!

104
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,066
Young Master, I've brought him back for you,

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,833
let me go!

106
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,166
I told you to let me go

107
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:41,700
! Shh,

108
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,300
don't make a sound, I

109
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,766
'm showing you something.

110
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:46,500
Nan Nan Nan Nan

111
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,066
, please help Dad, this is the last time,

112
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,533
they really will beat me to death.

113
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh, you know,

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,233
these people at the casino are really ruthless.

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,700
If they kill someone,

116
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:57,600
they'll probably

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
just throw them into the sea to feed the fish,

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
anyway, no one will be able to find out, right?

119
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,233
No, no,

120
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,066
I beg you, Young Master Gu,

121
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,633
as long as you let my dad go,

122
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,166
I... I'll agree to anything you want

123
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,166
, yes,

124
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,233
I'll agree to anything you

125
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,333
want, please,

126
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,033
okay?

127
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:12,633
I beg you,

128
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,666
take him

129
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:14,633
to my room, please.

130
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,366
No

131
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,733
, don't

132
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:20,800
go.

133
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,666
It happened three years ago, don't you dare mention

134
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,566
my business, and don't interfere with

135
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:31,300
your cousin's affairs. What are you doing?

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,266
Don't forget our deal,

137
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,233
you are indeed an illegitimate child

138
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,133
, you're on my side, right?

139
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,500
Thank you, Young Master Gu,

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,300
but that will have to wait until I'm tired of playing with him.
