1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,199
Besides Qianyuan Pill,
what else did she take?

2
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,720
One Kunling Pill,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,199
one Hongma Pill, and two Wuling Pills,

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,839
one Xuanyuan Pill,
and one Tianqiong Pill.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,079
Go inform Master.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,719
Yes.

7
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,479
Miss.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,560
You're awake.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,439
Master.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Where is this?

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,119
Chongyang Temple on Mount Zhongnan.

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:42,920
Don't move.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,600
You're poisoned.

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,560
You need proper rest.

15
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,319
In just one day,

16
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,280
you took

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,840
our 10-year refined pills.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
Your body can't withstand it.

19
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,519
I'll help you neutralize these pills

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,560
and expel them.

21
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,319
Two more days of treatment,
and you'll recover.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,959
Do you also want the evil sutra?

23
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,359
That's not an evil sutra.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,959
The Nine Yin True Sutra

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
was created by Huang Chang,

26
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,439
a martial arts master.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,280
I've heard it contains

28
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,760
not just techniques

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,280
but deep analyses

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,480
of the essence of martial arts.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,239
It helps

32
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,359
ordinary martial artists improve

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
and helps gifted ones

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,319
progress leaps and bounds.

35
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,200
All your struggles

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
for it.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
Is it really worth it?

38
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,080
Jialan.

39
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,719
You don't understand

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
what the Nine Yin True Sutra
means to us.

41
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,240
What does it mean?

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
It means supremacy,

43
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,280
unrivaled power,

44
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,759
untold wealth,

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
unshakable authority,

46
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,479
the power

47
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,919
transcending laws and morals,

48
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,080
and unrestrained dominance.

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,639
Taoists say

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
small temptations mislead,

51
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,800
while great ones corrupt.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
Petty gains make people

53
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,479
abandon principles.

54
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,680
The Sutra is the biggest temptation

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,639
destroying humanity itself.

56
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,000
Jialan.

57
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,080
I won't force you

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
to tell me the location.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
After the duel on Mount Hua,

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,800
whoever becomes champion,

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,479
I urge you to reveal

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,639
how to find the Sutra.

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Only then

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
can you escape

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,199
this bloodshed.

66
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you, Master.

67
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,199
I understand.

72
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,920
Jialan doesn't want

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
to see you.

74
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,920
But she hopes

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,279
you will

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,920
win the duel.

77
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,240
How is she?

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
She's recovering well.

79
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,160
Why?

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,759
What's your question?

81
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,759
Why?

82
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,959
For vengeance.

83
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,319
For 300

84
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,439
dead souls on Mount Baituo.

85
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
For dead innocents

86
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,360
in Shiyang Fort.

87
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,720
Satisfied?

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,279
In three days,

89
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,000
what will you do?

90
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,240
Defeat all challengers.

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Claim ultimate victory.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,959
No one

93
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,639
can confidently say something

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,759
like that.

95
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,480
Are you that certain?

96
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,519
For Feng Heng,

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,439
I must win.

98
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,240
True.

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,279
If we join forces,

100
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,319
we'll win for sure.

101
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,199
Why should I work with you?

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
I know you hate me for setting snakes.

103
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,319
But you said,

104
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,759
you need one chapter.

105
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,519
If Wang Chongyang,

106
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,399
Hong Qi,

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,079
or Emperor Duan gets the Sutra,

108
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
do you think any of them will

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
give you one chapter?

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
I will.

111
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Now, all I have is my life.

112
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,199
Either I'll become the winner

113
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,800
or die on Mount Hua.

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
See you then.

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
I'll try to win

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
at any cost.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,040
Yaoshi.

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
Will you

119
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,199
abandon our friendship?

120
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,839
Let go.

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,199
Take care.

122
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,279
Sect leader.

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
The coffin is loaded.

124
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,079
I'm leaving.

125
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't delay.

126
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,480
You pacify

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,320
Elder Wu's family.

128
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,639
Give him a grand funeral.

129
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,200
Go now.

130
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,159
Yes.

131
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,519
Sect Leader.

132
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,559
Sect Leader.

133
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,039
Yesterday,

134
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,320
I made a mistake,

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
trusting a sorcerer

136
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,519
and misleading others.

137
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Please

138
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,879
punish me.

139
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,240
Rise.

140
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,559
If you think so,

141
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,759
I'll be upset.

142
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,240
Do you think

143
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,159
I can't even

144
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,799
hear the truth,

145
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,799
and I hold grudges against you?

146
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Elder Xu.

147
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,480
Tell our men

148
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,639
that I'll get the Nine Yin True Sutra

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
for our sect.

150
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,399
Yes.

151
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,519
Take care.

152
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,759
The duel will come in two days.

153
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,200
Should we join it?

154
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,879
I think I'll pass.

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,399
Gauge your ability realistically.

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,159
Can you defeat those

157
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,519
from Chongyang Temple?

158
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,240
Huang Yaoshi,

159
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,279
Master Wang,

160
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,320
Leader Hong,

161
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
and Emperor Duan,

162
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,000
we can't beat any of them.

163
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,200
But Ouyang Feng,
a guy from the Western Regions,

164
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,639
isn't particularly formidable.

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
I heard from a guy

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,159
in Chongyang Temple

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
that Ouyang Feng killed

168
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,519
one of Ming Cult's Guardians.

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Impossible!

170
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,679
His martial arts can't be weak.

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,679
Your Majesty.

172
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,200
What's wrong?

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,039
I'm thinking about Qi.

174
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,879
What about him?

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,720
Well,

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,519
when we first met in the martial world,

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,639
we hit it off.

178
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,639
I never expected

179
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,159
that he'd become like this.

180
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
I think

181
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,639
I should persuade him.

182
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,159
I don't know much about his past.

183
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,159
Right now,

184
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,600
I don't think

185
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,320
he will listen to you.

186
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,159
If the Nine Yin True Sutra

187
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,679
falls

188
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,360
into the hands of Qi,

189
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,080
disaster will follow.

190
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
Given his current arrogance,

191
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,200
he'll become the world's target.

192
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,000
Many people will attack him.

193
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,840
He will be in grave danger.

194
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,039
Moreover,

195
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,799
given his current achievements,

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,399
he's already this domineering.

197
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,679
If he truly

198
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,960
masters the Nine Yin True Sutra,

199
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,120
I fear

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
he will cause greater calamities.

201
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,120
Stop worrying about him.

202
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,240
Anyway,

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
how confident are you

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
in the upcoming duel on Mount Hua

205
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,399
to claim victory?

206
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,720
Others' capabilities
remain unknown to me,

207
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,799
but regarding Hong Qi,

208
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,720
I hold no absolute certainty
of defeating him.

209
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,279
Previously,

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,159
at Junshan,

211
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,120
we once fought.

212
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,000
I lost to him.

213
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,919
All these years,

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,519
my skills have improved.

215
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm sure

216
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
he has also improved.

217
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Moreover,

218
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,440
his 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

219
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,919
have grown better,

220
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
shocking the martial world.

221
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,480
Don't be pessimistic

222
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,279
before the duel.

223
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,600
Be confident.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,240
If you secure the Sutra

225
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,039
at the duel on Mount Hua,

226
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,399
fulfilling your ambition,

227
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,000
could you truly

228
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,759
abdicate the throne

229
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,759
and wander the martial world?

230
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
The throne

231
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,080
has never

232
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,960
been what I want.

233
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,440
Good.

234
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,120
I will

235
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,519
roam the martial world with you.

236
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,279
And we are

237
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
a gallant couple.

238
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
Emperor Duan. It's cold.

239
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,799
I brought you another quilt.

240
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,480
Leave it there.

241
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,320
Good night.

242
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,480
Senior.

243
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,799
Do you think our Master

244
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,559
looked for the Sutra

245
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,240
across the martial world these months

246
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,799
only

247
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,519
to safeguard it

248
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,000
for the martial world?

249
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,000
Anyway, obtain it first.

250
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,399
Then,

251
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,559
our Master decides

252
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,000
whether

253
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,200
to study it

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
or not.

255
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,159
Outrageous!

256
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,039
Who gave you the guts

257
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,279
to slander our Master?

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,159
- Please
- Please

259
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,360
- punish me.
- punish me.

260
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,080
Leave!

261
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

262
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,559
Master.

263
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,600
Master.

264
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,559
Forgive them.

265
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,399
They...

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,039
Regarding the Nine Yin True Sutra,

267
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,840
every word and deed

268
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,960
becomes suspect to others.

269
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,120
Even blood kin
and disciples face suspicion,

270
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,720
so I cannot blame strangers

271
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,840
for questioning me.

272
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,320
Master.

273
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,039
We just moved in.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,759
It's quite humble.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,360
Well...

276
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:35,919
It's alright.

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,919
I don't mind.

278
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:51,879
Master,

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
how does the Ming Cult

280
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,200
have unique martial arts?

281
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,000
The 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

282
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,240
are remarkable.

283
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,440
It's a secret technique.

284
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,879
How could he replicate it

285
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,159
with precision?

286
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,440
So indistinguishable.

287
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
Legends tell of a master from Tubo

288
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
from years past

289
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,799
who knew a unique skill,

290
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,039
the Xiaowuxiang Technique.

291
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,919
Its practitioner can

292
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,200
mimic any martial technique,

293
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,279
replicating its form perfectly.

294
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,879
The strong masters

295
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,320
may even defeat opponents

296
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,519
with mimic moves.

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,159
I see.

298
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,679
It is

299
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
such a marvelous technique.

300
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
But that person always

301
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,080
acted weird.

302
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,159
No one knows

303
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,639
what's behind him.

304
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,039
Master, good night.

305
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,919
I'm leaving.

306
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,000
(Those who know me know my sorrows.)

307
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,799
(Those who don't wonder what I seek.)

308
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,159
(When I failed to defeat the Jin,)

309
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,240
(I hid in an ancient tomb for years.)

310
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,519
(Zhaoying,)

311
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,799
(you persuaded me every day)

312
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,080
(to leave the tomb.)

313
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,039
(You accompanied me through dark days.)

314
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,679
(I owe you.)

315
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,720
(So far,)

316
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,519
(you've been gone for years.)

317
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,320
(I'm just a mortal.)

318
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,840
(I'll die eventually.)

319
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,679
(I feel I won't last long,)

320
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,000
(and I'll see you again.)

321
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
(Yet we haven't expelled the Jin,)

322
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,679
(and the Sutra has stirred things up)

323
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,840
(in the martial world.)

324
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,639
(It's full of conflicts.)

325
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,759
(The Jin will exploit our weakness.)

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
(Should the Sutra)

327
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,279
(fall into vicious hands,)

328
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,559
(disaster would come.)

329
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,120
(Men face undeserved praise)

330
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,839
(and unwarranted blame.)

331
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,400
(How can I force the masses)

332
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,480
(to comprehend me?)

333
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
(I'll stake my reputation)

334
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,519
(to preserve the martial world's peace.)

335
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,599
(Guard it as long as I can.)

336
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,640
(Though nobody understands me,)

337
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,599
(I'll act with a clear conscience.)

338
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,039
Emperor Duan,

339
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
your guest has arrived.

340
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,680
Just tea.

341
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,839
Just tea.

342
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,319
I knew you'd seek me.

343
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,079
Speak your mind.

344
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,119
Qi,

345
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,200
we're alone now.

346
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,039
State your purpose.

347
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,440
Why must you
have the Nine Yin True Sutra?

348
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,799
I don't crave the Sutra,

349
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,559
yet I must get it.

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,559
Why?

351
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,240
Xing,

352
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,200
you were born a prince.

353
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,839
Whether you like it or not,

354
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,799
you must become emperor.

355
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,200
That's your fate, right?

356
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,920
That's it.

357
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,000
I was a slave.

358
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,200
The lowly folks like me

359
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,400
hate predetermined fates.

360
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,440
The Nine Yin True Sutra belongs to none.

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,319
Why should Wang Chongyang

362
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,440
keep it?

363
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,319
Because of his martial arts

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
or reputation?

365
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,799
Neither in truth.

366
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,480
It's because of his status.

367
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,799
I lead

368
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,480
all beggars.

369
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,160
This time,

370
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,680
I'll champion their rights.

371
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,599
I seek not the Sutra.

372
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,480
I fight

373
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,720
for the nobodies' dignity.

374
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,240
When Emperor Qin toured Kuaiji

375
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,440
and Zhejiang,

376
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,160
Xiang Yu and his uncle

377
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,519
witnessed imperial grandeur.

378
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,680
He vowed aloud,

379
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,680
"I can replace him!"

380
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,720
Qi,

381
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,640
if even Xiang Yu thought so,

382
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
shouldn't we aspire more?

383
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,720
I don't get it.

384
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,400
I mean,

385
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,160
Xiang Yu

386
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,359
saw only

387
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,960
imperial extravagance,

388
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,960
never considering

389
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,160
the people's suffering

390
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,440
from such excesses.

391
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
He didn't mean

392
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
to save the masses.

393
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,839
He craved status

394
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
and prestige.

395
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,519
People

396
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,079
praise Xiang Yu as heroic,

397
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,319
but Qi,

398
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,640
when people face empty fame and glory,

399
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,599
it's easy to lose their way.

400
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,920
Even Xiang Yu couldn't

401
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,839
meet your standards,

402
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,200
then naturally,

403
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't either.

404
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,240
Sure.

405
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,720
We all crave empty fame.

406
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,480
We're all lost.

407
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,079
But as an emperor,

408
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,240
why do you

409
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,039
want the Sutra?

410
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,400
Qi.

411
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,079
Do you

412
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,240
remember our agreement?

413
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,079
What agreement?

414
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,359
We once vowed

415
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,359
to defeat the old martial artists

416
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,160
and shake the martial world.

417
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,640
Now,

418
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,119
as the leader

419
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,279
of the world's largest sect,

420
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,440
you act like a local tyrant,

421
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,039
relying on your massive following

422
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,880
to endlessly...

423
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,359
Ridiculous!

424
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,400
The size of the Beggar Sect

425
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,519
isn't my doing.

426
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,759
It's done

427
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,319
by emperors like you.

428
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,839
If you rule well,

429
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,839
and people have food,

430
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,160
who will join me as beggars?

431
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,680
The one expanding my sect

432
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,480
is not me,

433
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
but you.

434
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,279
Are you a good emperor?

435
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,240
You're soft-hearted,

436
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,079
thinking Confucian governance

437
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,559
will work.

438
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,279
But you're easily manipulated.

439
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,400
An emperor like you

440
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
makes people suffer.

441
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,680
I believe

442
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm doing better

443
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,279
than you.

444
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,400
Yes.

445
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,759
I admit

446
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm not a good emperor.

447
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,039
That's why

448
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,119
I've been thinking

449
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,160
about the meaning
of the Nine Yin True Sutra.

450
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,519
How can it benefit the people?

451
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,759
If I can

452
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,000
obtain the Nine Yin True Sutra,

453
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,359
I'll strengthen Dali's army,

454
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,079
protecting my people

455
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,480
from war's devastation.

456
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,039
Conflicts would end,

457
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,319
and tragedies cease.

458
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,359
Qi.

459
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,680
If you

460
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
understand my purpose,

461
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,240
will you withdraw?

462
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,319
Well said!

463
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
Had I not known you so long,

464
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,640
I'd buy it.

465
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,559
I know you

466
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,519
pretty well.

467
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,200
You've obsessed over martial arts,

468
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,119
neglecting governance.

469
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:34,960
Now, you're clever,

470
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,720
using the people as an excuse.

471
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,200
Listen,

472
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,440
I've promised my men

473
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
to get the Nine Yin True Sutra.

474
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,400
I must bring it back

475
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,319
to honor my word.

476
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,480
You expect me

477
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,759
to retreat on your say-so?

478
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,200
How would I face my men?

479
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,119
Leader Hong.

480
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,759
Let's duel on Mount Hua.

481
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:10,880
Good.

482
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,799
(Since the Nine Yin True Sutra appeared)

483
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,400
(in the martial world,)

484
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,400
(it has brought endless bloodshed.)

485
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,920
(Today,)

486
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,359
(we gathered here.)

487
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,079
(There are five directions,
namely, east, west, south,)

488
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,200
(north, and center.)

489
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,799
(Five victors will)

490
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,240
(ascend Mount Hua's summit)

491
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,000
(for the final duel.)

492
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,599
(The ultimate victor,)

493
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,960
(the greatest martial artist,)

494
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,519
(shall have the Nine Yin True Sutra.)

495
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,759
(With his unmatched skills,)

496
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,759
(none)

497
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,720
(could seize the Sutra from him.)

498
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,759
(This is a duel)

499
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,359
(on Mount Hua.)

500
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,920
(All participants)

501
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,960
(exercise restraint.)

502
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,400
(Never take lives)

503
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,720
(unless absolutely necessary.)

504
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,799
(There are four lines
to find the Sutra.)

505
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
(Through perilous cliffs you must trek,)

506
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,319
(beyond Lord Lao's
plowed ravine's neck.)

507
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,559
(Where pines conceal the sacred ground,)

508
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,079
(in hidden grotto the sutra's found.)

509
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,119
Master.

510
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,079
Master.

511
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,872
(Jin of Xiliang)

512
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,119
(Nine Yin True Sutra)
This small book

513
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,319
has plunged the martial world
into chaos.

514
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,400
Jialan.

515
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,319
Before we determine the winner,

516
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,559
you must keep this book.

517
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,960
My sect will protect you.

518
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,480
Where's your staff?

519
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,240
I came

520
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,559
not as the leader of the Beggar Sect.

521
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,039
Your skills have improved, Emperor Duan.

522
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,160
Thanks.

523
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:10,599
Xing.

524
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,119
Given our past friendship,

525
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,200
I've shown restraint.

526
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,920
Leave now,

527
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,640
and you may leave unscathed.

528
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,599
I'm carrying hope

529
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,559
of the living

530
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
and aspiration of the dead.

531
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,240
I cannot retreat.

532
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Then you must defeat me.

533
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,920
I've lost.

534
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,960
But it's exhilarating.

535
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,839
I'm convinced.

536
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,799
You said you served the people.

537
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,079
I believe you.

538
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,240
Qi.

539
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,759
I'm a beggar,

540
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,599
yet I don't beg.

541
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,160
You're a mighty ruler,

542
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,400
yet yesterday,

543
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
you talked to me

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,039
like a beggar.

545
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,400
Have you considered?

546
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,759
Even if I withdraw,

547
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,759
would Wang Chongyang retreat?

548
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,680
Would Mr. Huang withdraw?

549
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,640
If you fight for Dali,

550
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
then act like a ruler!

551
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,440
Obtain the Nine Yin True Sutra

552
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,440
with your own hands.

553
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,279
Yes.

554
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:12,720
Yes.

555
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,559
Thank you for your advice, Leader Hong.

556
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,640
Don't use these empty words

557
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,480
to flatter me.

558
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,720
I can see through you,

559
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
yet I'm confused about myself.

560
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,359
Yes.

561
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,160
You claim

562
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,799
to get the Sutra

563
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,480
for your sect.

564
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,160
I have questions.

565
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,599
Do your men

566
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
follow you

567
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,079
for the Nine Yin True Sutra?

568
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,079
Do they covet supremacy?

569
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:46,960
Or do they just

570
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
need a good sect leader?

571
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,839
You have a long way to go.

572
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,400
Take care.

573
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,119
Qi.

574
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,480
Take care.

575
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
When we first met,

576
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,880
we hit it off straight away.

577
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,199
You astonished me at first sight.

578
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,599
Unexpectedly, one word

579
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,280
made you wait three days.

580
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:28,960
How exhilarating!

581
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,679
I remember it was a rainy day.

582
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,639
If only those days

583
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,840
could've lasted longer.

584
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,360
Enough.

585
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,920
If...

586
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,960
Cut it out!

587
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,480
We can't

588
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,360
go back in time.

589
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,679
If we join forces,

590
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,719
victory would be assured.

591
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:23,128
(Qingsong Pavilion)

592
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,199
But I don't trust you.

593
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,639
Let us each

594
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,159
face our own desperation

595
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,639
within our separate abysses.

596
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,639
Yaoshi.

597
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,480
You don't know

598
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
how terrifying a man becomes

599
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,760
when he's lost everything.

600
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,679
Yaoshi.

601
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,199
I used Knockout Powder on you.

602
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,039
You'll sleep for at least two days.

603
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,079
Have a good rest.

604
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,079
Stop struggling.

605
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,559
You've lost.

606
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,599
Yaoshi.

607
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,480
Return to Taohua Island.

608
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,920
I'm weakening.

609
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,039
