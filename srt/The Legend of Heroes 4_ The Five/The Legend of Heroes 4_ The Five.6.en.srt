1
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,799
Congrats, Emperor Duan.

2
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:40,759
Is that

3
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,520
the Nine Yin True Sutra?

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,039
Would you like to rest for a moment?

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,920
No need.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,960
Please.

7
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:50,920
Mr. Huang.

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I've changed my mind.

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,959
I want all

10
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,400
of the Nine Yin True Sutra.

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,840
Master!

12
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,960
You are not Huang Yaoshi.

13
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,848
(The Legend of Heroes)

14
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:10,496
=Duel on Mount Hua=

15
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,896

The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

=The Five=
=Episode 6=

17
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,519
If given another chance,

18
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
would you still jump down to save her?

19
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,040
Get out of my body.

20
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
Whose body this is

21
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,879
is not for you to decide.

22
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,519
About whether

23
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
we are a butterfly

24
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,120
in Zhuang Zhou's dream

25
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,519
or

26
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
Zhuang Zhou in a butterfly's dream,

27
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
no one can truly say for certain.

28
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,360
She jumped down

29
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,199
for liberation.

30
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,000
Why would you jump after her?

31
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,399
Not only did you fail to save her,

32
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
but you also sacrificed yourself.

33
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,439
The troubles you face now

34
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,600
are all of your own making.

35
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,319
(If heaven had feelings,
it too would age.)

36
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,720
(Only heartless trees
achieve longevity.)

37
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,839
(You're shackled by romance,)

38
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
(toiling endlessly.)

39
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
(That Taohua Island)

40
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,680
(has become your prison.)

41
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,319
Humans exist in the world,

42
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,079
like transient travelers
passing through.

43
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
You wish to spend

44
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,720
an ordinary lifetime with her.

45
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,279
But I am no ordinary man.

46
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,279
In Mount Wuliang's

47
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,399
Langhuan Blessed Land,

48
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,000
I mastered the All-Under-Heaven

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
Dominating Technique.

50
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,279
15 years

51
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,519
after I left there,
I completed it in Mongolia.

52
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,199
Yet for the past ten years,

53
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,759
you've neglected cultivation

54
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,160
and become obsessed with her.

55
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,040
Do you feel worthy of your past

56
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
or yourself?

57
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,600
All you care about

58
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,040
is martial arts?

59
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Your martial arts mastery
in this lifetime

60
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,879
required years of arduous training.

61
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,240
Quickly sever these distractions

62
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,720
and give me back my freedom.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because of her,

64
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,639
you've become so much weaker

65
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,199
to be ambushed by Ouyang Feng

66
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,600
using mere snakes!

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
If it were me...

68
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,920
I don't blame him.

69
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,040
He lost his home.

70
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,120
A person with nothing left

71
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,639
deserves pity.

72
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,839
He seeks the Nine Yin True Sutra

73
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,720
not for himself.

74
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,560
The best way for someone

75
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,519
to grow strong

76
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,439
is to have someone

77
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,439
they want to protect.

78
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,800
He will become stronger.

79
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,600
What do I care about his strength?

80
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,199
My concern

81
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
is you.

82
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,480
He is my friend.

83
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,480
Who are you?

84
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,360
Every year,

85
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,240
we endure

86
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,319
this endless cycle

87
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,040
of ascetic cultivation.

88
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,639
And for what?

89
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,160
In this endless corridor,

90
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,399
there is tranquility.

91
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,519
But isn't it just another form

92
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,879
of escapism?

93
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,600
Look.

94
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,240
Down the mountain,

95
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,319
there is chimney smoke.

96
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Earthly happiness

97
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,519
simply means dwelling

98
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,320
in a peaceful, undisturbed village

99
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,519
with your beloved

100
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,519
through life's journey.

101
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,200
Yes.

102
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,039
Yet even for this tiny,

103
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,480
insignificant

104
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,320
mortal wish,

105
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,919
no one in this world has ever

106
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,200
truly managed to fulfill it.

107
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,039
But I have.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,159
On Taohua Island.

109
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,799
Taohua Island?

110
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,399
Taohua Haven.

111
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,000
I admit saving her back then was unwise.

112
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
But I firmly believe

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,559
no snowflake falls

114
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,320
at a wrong place

115
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
by accident.

116
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
I yearn for her heart's devotion,

117
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,399
hand in hand until our hair turns white.

118
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,600
Love in the mortal realm

119
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,519
is but a fleeting illusion.

120
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,759
Moreover, meeting her itself

121
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,919
was an accident from the start.

122
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,720
If the Nine Yin True Sutra

123
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,759
can't save her, what then?

124
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,279
I'll keep searching.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When you love someone,

126
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,240
you want to do countless things for her.

127
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,039
Every hard moment

128
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,120
feels joyful.

129
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,440
She's wonderful.

130
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,919
And I've realized

131
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,799
there are no 'in facts'

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,799
or 'ifs'.

133
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,159
Love

134
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,639
is simply love.

135
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,279
If given another chance,

136
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,799
I'd still jump for her.

137
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,039
Thank you

138
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,120
for being with me for so long.

139
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm leaving now.

140
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,639
I won't come back.

141
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,879
Pain in the heart

142
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,399
breeds such delusions.

143
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Life is like a mirage.

144
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,159
Behold its true nature.

145
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,440
Thank you both.

146
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,519
Where is the Sutra?

147
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,720
In a martial contest,

148
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
follow the rules.

149
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,559
Why should I obey the rules

150
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,639
set by an old Taoist?

151
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
I, Red-Crowned Crane, Ou Bujing,

152
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,759
seek enlightenment.

153
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,600
I, Golden-Eyed Primate,

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
Xue Miao, seek enlightenment.

155
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,200
White-Scaled Serpent,
Lu Yi, seek enlightenment.

156
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,559
I, Black-Armed Bear,

157
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,360
Bao Sanlang,

158
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,639
seek enlightenment.

159
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:22,784
(Zhong Juesheng, Ming Cult Leader)

160
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,759
And who might you be?

161
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Leader of the Ming Cult,

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,799
Zhong Juesheng.

163
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,919
Zhong Juesheng, Ming Cult's leader.

164
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,440
I heard of you, but never met you.

165
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,879
Showing yourself
at Mount Hua's peak today,

166
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,000
you must be here

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,279
for the Nine Yin True Sutra too.

168
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,200
Why would I be?

169
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,039
Three years ago,

170
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,279
this very Nine Yin True Sutra

171
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
was personally released

172
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,720
into the martial world by me.

173
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,240
I intended to share this supreme manual

174
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,639
with all martial practitioners.

175
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,759
Unexpectedly,

176
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,519
it has brought

177
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
endless bloodshed and strife.

178
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,159
You people, seeing the Sutra,

179
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,679
succumb to madness.

180
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,120
For selfish desires,

181
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,720
you forsake sanity,

182
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,720
resulting in

183
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,840
countless deaths.

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
It has nothing to do with me.

185
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,679
Master Zhong,

186
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,000
having schemed for years means

187
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,960
you want something.

188
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,440
Speak plainly.

189
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,080
As Su Dongpo once wrote,

190
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,759
'Learning words begins life's sorrows.'

191
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,600
For us

192
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
martial artists,

193
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,720
all woes began

194
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,159
when we learned
our first martial arts move.

195
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,240
Without martial arts,

196
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,559
how can the weak protect themselves

197
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,919
against the strong?

198
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,759
What if this world

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,279
had no more 'strong' people?

200
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,519
Your ambition is too grand.

201
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,480
Mr. Huang, you've figured it out.

202
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,399
Yet you disregard it all.

203
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,879
Mr. Huang,

204
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
you seek the Nine Yin True Sutra

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,480
because you want its Healing Chapter

206
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
to cure your beloved wife.

207
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,960
I've read the Sutra

208
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,039
already.

209
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,679
The Healing Chapter

210
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,799
contains no cure
for your wife's condition.

211
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,600
You're lying.

212
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
To know whether it's true,

213
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,240
after we conclude the matters here,

214
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,080
I can give you

215
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,080
the Sutra.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,039
Emperor Duan,

217
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,879
with all your strenuous efforts,

218
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
you merely wish to obtain the Sutra

219
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,480
to cultivate countless elites

220
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,079
and protect your nation.

221
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,599
But have you considered

222
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,200
once you succeed,

223
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,839
these military elites

224
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
will become Dali's

225
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
true calamity?

226
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,319
Explain yourself.

227
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
Innocence attracts envy

228
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,440
when treasures are revealed.

229
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,759
If Dali

230
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,559
gains such divine forces

231
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,240
and is invincible,

232
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,640
Tubo,

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,440
Jin,

234
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
and even the Song

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,319
will never

236
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,880
rest peacefully again.

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,559
I fear as former foes,

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,279
they'll turn into allies

239
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,039
and join forces,

240
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,440
vowing to annihilate Dali.

241
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
I've observed you extensively.

242
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Your benevolent nature

243
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,599
makes you indecisive

244
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,920
when facing challenges

245
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
and always prioritize others.

246
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,480
Even with elite troops,

247
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,200
you couldn't control them.

248
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,720
Wouldn't it bring

249
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
mortal danger upon yourself

250
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,839
and endless civil wars to Dali?

251
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,799
Don't you find

252
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,720
this utterly ridiculous?

253
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Are you Jialan?

254
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,440
Yes.

255
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,559
I have a question for you.

256
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,799
For these people before you,

257
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,519
do you fear them?

258
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,240
Both yes and no.

259
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:37,920
What fears you?

260
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,319
Their supreme martial skills.

261
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,359
They could kill me effortlessly.

262
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,240
I...

263
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,599
From the moment I was born,

264
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,839
I've only witnessed

265
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
those obsessed with martial arts,

266
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,920
each boasting their supremacy,

267
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,839
scheming against each other,

268
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,000
and casually taking lives

269
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
or even entire families.

270
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,720
Yet above every strong one,

271
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,519
there's always a stronger one.

272
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,400
Old grudges may end,

273
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,000
but new enmities arise.

274
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,119
It repeats endlessly,

275
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,119
plunging the world

276
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,799
into perpetual unrest.

277
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,799
Countless innocent lives

278
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,640
are lost because of this.

279
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,160
The martial path

280
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,880
truly stands as

281
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,640
the root of all evil.

282
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,200
Then why practice martial arts?

283
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,119
I aim to eliminate them.

284
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,559
I'll erase the martial world,

285
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,519
bring down all sects,

286
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,559
and create a world

287
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,000
without distinctions of strength.

288
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
I'll use martial arts to end them.

289
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,680
The Nine Yin True Sutra

290
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,000
is the perfect tool for this.

291
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,880
You came today

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
to kill us all?

293
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,039
I prefer not to kill.

294
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,720
If you cherish humanity

295
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,440
and embrace my vision,

296
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,200
then today

297
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,920
on Mount Hua's peak,

298
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,759
renounce your martial arts.

299
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,160
Wouldn't that

300
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
make for a splendid tale?

301
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,480
So you revere

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,160
this lunatic?

303
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,319
To end martial arts,

304
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,519
why don't you

305
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,519
renounce yours first?

306
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,839
When peace reigns under heaven,

307
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
it shall be time
for warriors to lay down arms.

308
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,440
Master Zhong,

309
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,119
since you insist on this course,

310
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,680
we humbly request your guidance.

311
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,559
Then we'll

312
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,079
have to proceed with force.

313
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,279
No brawl is complete without me!

314
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
(Master Zhong,)

315
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,960
(you're deceiving yourself.)

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,599
(By your logic,)

317
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,400
(all human desires harm humanity.)

318
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,279
(Must you eradicate them all?)

319
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,039
(Martial arts are tools.)

320
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,839
(The key is human intent.)

321
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,240
(With good will,)

322
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,559
(they protect the weak.)

323
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,200
(With ill intent,)

324
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,880
(they oppress the innocent.)

325
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,599
(This is the way.)

326
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,319
(Eliminating all martial artists)

327
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,720
(solves nothing.)

328
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
(Your noble facade)

329
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,599
(hides vicious ambitions.)

330
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,519
(The one who destroyed)

331
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,920
(Jialan's family was you.)

332
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,720
(The one who ignited
the martial world's turmoil)

333
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
(was also you.)

334
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,079
Come up!

335
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,079
My entire life

336
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,079
is true to my name.

337
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,079
Now,

338
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,799
manipulated and used,

339
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,119
I've ended up like this.

340
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,039
Come up!

341
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,799
My ending is self-inflicted.

342
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,000
Death serves me right.

343
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
Let me tell you one thing.

344
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,559
Ke

345
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,079
is your flesh and blood.

346
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,599
He is

347
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,160
at Ming Cult's headquarters.

348
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,400
He is

349
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
waiting for you there.

350
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,319
Stop talking nonsense and come up here!

351
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,279
Remember.

352
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,759
Destiny...

353
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,400
I...

354
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,640
We...

355
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,000
Ouyang Cuo?

356
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,160
Ouyang Cuo?

357
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,759
Brother.

358
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,920
Brother!

359
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,759
Brother!

360
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,160
Master!

361
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,279
Heaven's way reduces excess
to replenish deficiency.

362
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,960
Thus, emptiness prevails over substance,
and insufficiency balances surplus.

363
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Its meaning's vast.

364
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,799
Its principles profound.

365
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,799
Its wisdom boundless.

366
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,400
Heaven and earth divide.

367
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,839
Yin and yang unfold.

368
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,240
Transformation manifests.

369
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,759
Life and death become clear.

370
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Unplanned, yet patterns converge.

371
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,519
Untold, yet light and darkness align.

372
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,039
Words are weighed finely,

373
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,519
and deeds are proven truly.

374
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,319
The ultimate truth's foundation,

375
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
and the start of all cultivation.

376
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,839
Chuyi,

377
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,599
sword!

378
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,720
Master!

379
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,119
(Elder Wu,)

380
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,240
(I have failed.)

381
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,720
(I hoped to honor your spirit)

382
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,279
(with the Sutra.)

383
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:46,799
(But I am useless.)

384
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,039
(I dare not face you,)

385
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,279
(yet I must come.)

386
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,240
The Chongyang Temple chaos

387
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,559
stems from my actions.

388
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,039
I doomed you

389
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,279
and shamed the Beggar Sect.

390
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,519
I now

391
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,880
beg forgiveness from you
and all brothers.

392
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,559
- Sect Leader!
- Sect Leader!

393
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,319
Since becoming the sect leader,

394
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,480
I've carried burning ambition

395
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,759
to show the world that we,

396
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:54,839
the beggars

397
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,759
trodden underfoot by all,

398
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,519
could rise to become

399
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,039
a respected martial sect,

400
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
and none should dare scorn us.

401
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,839
I believed my martial prowess

402
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,000
would glorify our sect

403
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,319
and restore its former glory.

404
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,039
These years,

405
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,680
I've become increasingly reckless.

406
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:18,720
For trivial

407
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
accomplishments,

408
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
I acted obstinately

409
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,759
and fought endlessly.

410
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,000
Though seemingly
bringing fame to our sect,

411
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,359
in reality,

412
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,319
I've tarnished
its century-old reputation.

413
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,319
Sect Leader,

414
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,160
fingers hurt the most.

415
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
Why torture yourself?

416
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,960
As for the Sutra,

417
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,079
who gets it

418
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,000
or keeps it

419
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,680
is never our concern.

420
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,640
Neither is

421
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,440
the empty title of 'world's best'.

422
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,559
Elder of Teaching's right.

423
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
Fingers hurt the most.

424
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,599
Now losing one finger

425
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,480
makes me realize

426
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,400
that we're all poor wretches

427
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,039
and that being able to have shelter

428
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,400
and gather together like this

429
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,559
is fortune enough.

430
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,680
I was wrong before.

431
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,400
If you allow

432
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,759
the useless me to stay here,

433
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,839
I'll serve the Beggar Sect

434
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,839
in useful ways.

435
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,720
Chongyang,

436
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,640
you want to see me?

437
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,000
Botong,

438
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,440
my victory at Mount Hua

439
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,039
was mere luck.

440
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,319
What nonsense!

441
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,319
Why say that?

442
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,759
You're the best martial artist.

443
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:03,960
It was no luck.

444
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,728
(Zhou Botong, Quanzhen Sect).

445
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,319
That final strike at the peak

446
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,160
cost me almost half my life.

447
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,799
My internal strength has been depleted.

448
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,799
Now that I have the Sutra,

449
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,599
I can't show weakness.

450
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,359
Yet I know clearly

451
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,720
my time

452
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,359
is running short.

453
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,079
Don't be so discouraged,

454
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,680
Chongyang...

455
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,119
Let me finish.

456
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,519
Now that I safeguard

457
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,920
the Sutra for the martial world,

458
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,400
it means that from now on,

459
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,119
Chongyang Temple

460
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,519
will become the martial world's

461
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
coveted target.

462
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,079
And Ouyang Feng.

463
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,880
Though defeated

464
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,319
at Mount Hua,

465
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,680
he remains

466
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,240
ambitious

467
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
and unyielding.

468
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,599
I must prepare for future storms.

469
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,039
Chongyang, you mean?

470
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,639
Come with me

471
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,119
to Dali.

472
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:28,559
Gao Ang,

473
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,480
my good brother.

474
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,960
I failed you,

475
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,039
your family,

476
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,599
and all

477
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,559
the brave ones who died on battlefields.

478
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,679
This monument bears no words

479
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,800
yet speaks

480
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,840
volumes more than any inscription.

481
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,239
A nation's fate

482
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,880
rests with its ruler.

483
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,159
People are innocent.

484
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,199
I admit my failures.

485
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,159
I went to Mount Hua

486
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,119
seeking the Sutra to train soldiers.

487
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,920
But wiser counsel showed me

488
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,760
our weakened country

489
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,400
couldn't withstand the chaos

490
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
it would bring.

491
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,360
Border wars

492
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,920
exhaust me.

493
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,679
But shouldn't a true ruler

494
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,519
be as decisive

495
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,880
as a dragon

496
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,400
and swift and fierce

497
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,239
in action?

498
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,079
I ask myself:

499
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,239
Am I fit for this?

500
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,519
Can my temperament

501
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,800
allow me to rule well?

502
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,440
Or should I

503
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,280
follow my father's path

504
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,519
and abdicate

505
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,239
to not hold the people back

506
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,199
and to grant

507
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,239
myself inner peace.

508
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,119
In this world,

509
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,920
protecting those we care about

510
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,719
demands becoming stronger,

511
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,400
even via ruthless means.

512
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,159
Uncle,

513
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,960
why didn't my father come to save me?

514
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,519
He saved you

515
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,079
and me as well.

516
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,639
Did you get into a fight?

517
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,119
We lost.

518
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,599
Uncle,

519
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,599
aren't our martial arts

520
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,480
good enough?

521
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,199
Our martial arts

522
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,320
are unrivaled in the world.

523
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,559
I just haven't mastered them fully.

524
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,159
Unrivaled in the world?

525
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,320
Uncle,

526
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,719
teach me martial arts.

527
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
I never want to be bullied again.

528
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,880
Training is grueling.

529
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,000
Can you do it?

530
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,559
You and my father could do it.

531
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,239
I will manage too.

532
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,360
Okay.

533
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:14,719
Starting today,

534
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
I'll teach you.

535
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,239
Uncle,

536
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,320
where are we going now?

537
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,840
Home.

538
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,320
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

539
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,480
As the tale goes,

540
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,239
in the bitter winter,

541
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,519
at Mount Hua's summit,

542
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,480
the snow

543
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,840
capped everything.

544
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,840
- Good!
- Good!

545
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,400
Eastern Heretic,

546
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,320
Western Venom,

547
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,199
Southern Emperor,

548
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,159
Northern Beggar, and Central Divinity.

549
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,264
The five convened atop Mount Hua.

550
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,079
They debated philosophies

551
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,639
and clashed in combat,

552
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,360
battling fiercely

553
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,440
for seven days and nights in the snow!

554
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,840
Seven days and nights?

555
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,320
Who's Eastern Heretic?

556
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,960
That would be

557
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,639
Huang Yaoshi of Taohua Island.

558
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,320
They say when he loses control,

559
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,840
he slaughters indiscriminately,

560
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,800
as if possessed by a demon.

561
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,239
And Western Venom?

562
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,519
That would be

563
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:26,840
Ouyang Feng.

564
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,000
(Emperor Duan,)

565
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,679
at today's duel on Mount Hua,

566
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,119
we haven't fought yet.

567
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,039
Shall we continue?

568
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:34,559
No.

569
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,039
Master Zhong

570
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:38,880
spoke wisely.

571
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,760
The Sutra is

572
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,480
not worth it.

573
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,000
The turmoil caused

574
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,079
by the Sutra

575
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,039
has finally subsided for now, at least.

576
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,079
Miss Jialan,

577
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,800
before we part,

578
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
I wonder what your plans are.

579
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,440
To learn martial arts,

580
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,480
you can join Chongyang Temple.

581
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,000
Chongyang Temple?

582
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,840
Too stifling.

583
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,599
Join the Beggar Sect.

584
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,639
You've aided us

585
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,360
greatly.

586
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,519
I offer you

587
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,000
a Three-Sack disciple position.

588
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,119
The Beggar Sect's no better.

589
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,039
And do you expect a young girl

590
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,320
to become a beggar?

591
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,679
Who says girls

592
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,559
can't be beggars?

593
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,159
Our next sect leader

594
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,039
might be a girl.

595
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
I appreciate your offers.

596
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,480
But I must decline.

597
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:38,880
Let's part ways here.

598
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,880
I'll live

599
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,079
an ordinary life now.

600
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,440
Never speak of me again.

601
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,320
Let your martial world

602
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,000
and people

603
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,360
forget

604
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I ever existed.

605
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,559
You brought me here.

606
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,360
Now take me down the mountain.

607
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,039
Okay.

608
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,920
You're back.

609
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,360
I am.

610
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,039
Yaoshi,

611
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,880
I don't want to stay
on Taohua Island anymore.

612
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,119
Wander the world with me.

613
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,639
To where?

614
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,159
