(Half a month ago)

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,160
Being called Master,

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,960
you actually put on airs.

4
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,200
Geezer,

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,640
you're naturally dull-witted.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,320
You haven't learned a single move

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
of the martial arts
from the Nine Yin True Sutra.

8
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,520
Better obediently

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,679
hand over the Sutra.

10
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,200
Many skilled fighters have come today.

11
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,000
If you refuse,

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
you will all die.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
To steal the Sutra,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,479
you murdered my wife.

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,200
Considering our master-disciple bond,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,079
I spared your life

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,959
and severed your arm

18
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,959
before expelling you from the sect.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,319
Who would've thought

20
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,079
you'd remain unrepentant?

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
The Nine Yin True Sutra

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,920
was sent out of Xiliang long ago

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
and hidden
in a safe and secret location.

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,760
You want
to learn the Nine Yin True Sutra?

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,439
Try again in your next life.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,519
Master!

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,359
Master!

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,959
I'm sorry, Father.

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,200
Since you never intended

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,159
to pass the Sutra to me,

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,560
don't blame me for this desperate move.

32
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,439
He killed your mother!

33
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,079
So what if he killed my mother?

34
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,760
If we can obtain the Sutra together,

35
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,439
we'll be sworn brothers.

36
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,480
Be quiet.

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,560
Leave with your mother.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
Hurry. Follow me!

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Brothers, leave none alive.

40
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,120
Kill them all!

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes!

Yaoshi?

47
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,199
Why are you here?

48
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,600
I got a letter

49
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,279
saying you were dying.

50
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,879
I...

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,560
You are...?

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,279
My brother is joining Ming Cult.

53
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
I learned forbidden techniques

54
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,360
to resist Ming Cult.

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,480
But my brother found out

56
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,920
and imprisoned me here.

57
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,600
Can you move?

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
What's wrong?

60
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,000
No time to explain.

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,199
Get out

62
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,480
and protect a girl for me.

63
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Her name is Jialan.

64
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,760
Second Lord.

65
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:01,160
Second Lord.

66
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
- Second Lord.
- Second Lord.

67
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,120
Second Lord.

68
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,720
Second Lord.

69
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,759
Feng!

70
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,680
I knew you wouldn't die.

71
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,040
Nobody believed me.

72
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
What's the celebration in the fort?

73
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,959
Are we allying with the Ming Cult?

74
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,000
Are we?

75
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,839
Cui, be good.

76
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,959
Big events are happening today.

77
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,000
Go home with Granny now.

78
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,480
I know

79
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,720
bad people are coming.

80
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,399
Cui!

81
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,639
But Feng will protect us.

82
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,519
Right?

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,360
Go home.

84
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,759
This is Jialan?

85
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,879
Cuo,

86
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
what do you want

87
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,959
with her?

88
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,000
You're handing over

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
the Sutra to our enemies.

90
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
What about us?

91
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm doing this

92
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,679
to ensure we can

93
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,919
return to the Western Regions,

94
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,559
rebuild our manor,

95
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,679
and preserve everyone's lives.

96
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,639
Preserve everyone's lives?

97
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,519
Or to protect

98
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,679
your own son's life?

99
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,759
You said to send Ke

100
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,240
to an old friend's care.

101
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,159
That was a lie.

102
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,840
The Ming Cult kidnapped Ke.

103
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,799
Now you want to use her

104
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,039
to exchange for your son's life.

105
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,120
So you're yielding to Ming Cult?

106
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes!

107
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,919
Wouldn't it be worth

108
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,039
doing for the family?

109
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
Today's matters are crucial.

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
Don't stir up trouble.

111
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,720
Then promise me

112
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,759
you'll never let our people

113
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,759
be bullied by Ming Cult.

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,759
My lord,

115
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,879
the guest came.

116
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,679
Behave properly.

117
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,879
Lord Ouyang.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,879
So she is the only person alive

119
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,399
from the rumors who knows

120
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
the whereabouts
of the Nine Yin True Sutra?

121
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,600
We invited

122
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,399
one of your cult's Four Guardians,

123
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,399
the Snow-Eyed Fox King.

124
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,919
And you are?

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,159
Guardian Li's caravan travels slowly.

126
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,639
He'll arrive within two hours.

127
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,200
No need for haste, Lord Ouyang.

128
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,840
But the long journey

129
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,879
is tiring.

130
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,799
Prepare food and wine

131
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,159
to receive

132
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,120
and serve him.

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,000
We risked

134
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,159
offending Taohua Island's Master

135
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,039
to deliver this girl to you.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
We expect your cult

137
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
to honor our agreement

138
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,639
and return the hostage.

139
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,440
No more 'your cult.'

140
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,919
After Baituo Manor joins the Ming Cult,

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,960
we'll all be one family.

142
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,399
When you meet our leader,

143
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,120
remember to flatter him

144
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,279
and kowtow properly.

145
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,840
I've exhausted every scheme

146
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,639
to negotiate peace with the Ming Cult.

147
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
Must you ruin this

148
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,120
now?

149
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,639
Is this your promise

150
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,919
of preserving our dignity?

151
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,120
Everyone out!

152
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,039
Whoever wins

153
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
gets the snake staff.

154
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,679
Whoever loses

155
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,159
should vanish

156
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,879
from this world.

157
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,080
How dare you dig open

158
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,919
Father's grave

159
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,559
and steal forbidden techniques?

160
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,799
You're insane, worse than a beast!

161
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,000
He'd not want you to live in shame.

162
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
For Toad Skill,

163
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,320
even if mastered,

164
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,879
it's not truly formidable.

165
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,759
Only after nearly dying

166
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,240
can one's cultivation
advance by a fraction.

167
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
That's why Father

168
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,039
chose to bury it with him.

169
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,039
It isn't cultivation.

170
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,799
It's gambling with life.

171
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,799
With our home destroyed,
why cling to life?

172
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,559
From today onward,

173
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
I, Ouyang Feng,

174
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,600
am Lord of Mount Baituo!

175
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,159
The demonic cult destroyed our manor,

176
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,639
slaughtered our people,

177
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
and ceaselessly harassed us.

178
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,759
For years,

179
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,279
many innocents among us have perished.

180
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,000
Now,

181
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,480
the traitor within our ranks

182
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
colluded with enemies

183
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,960
and sought to sever

184
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,360
Baituo's legacy!

185
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,080
Tonight we face annihilation,

186
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,279
yet Shiyang Fort shelters us.

187
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,360
I won't let a single soul here

188
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,519
die needlessly!

189
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,639
Every Baituo resident

190
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,919
will reject the demonic cult!

191
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,600
Repel the cult!
Reclaim the Western Regions!

192
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Repel the cult!
Reclaim the Western Regions!

193
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,559
Repel the cult!
Reclaim the Western Regions!

194
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,639
Repel the cult!
Reclaim the Western Regions!

195
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,759
- Second Lord.
- Reclaim the Western Regions!

196
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,519
Fort Leader.

197
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,920
Second Lord,

198
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,400
our fort has only

199
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,440
the elderly, children, and infirm.

200
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,759
We can't withstand conflict.

201
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,119
Perhaps

202
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,200
you could propose another solution?

203
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Fort Leader,

204
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,440
it's too late now.

205
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,319
Well...

206
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,720
My brother colluded with enemies.

207
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,559
Our foes will surely come

208
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,279
to get the Sutra.

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,359
If we leave now,

210
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,119
you'll face greater calamity.

211
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,599
My lord!

212
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,599
My lord!

213
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,200
They're here.

214
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,599
What?

215
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,079
Fort Leader,

216
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,160
you must protect

217
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,759
this girl.

218
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,559
Well...

219
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,559
Come! Hurry!

220
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,200
Go now.

221
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,200
Second Lord, rest assured.

222
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,119
The rugged mountain path
tossed me relentlessly.

223
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,519
I vomited multiple times on the journey

224
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
yet managed to arrive here.

225
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,119
Why must you

226
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,720
reject me?

227
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,720
It seems we'll settle this
with a fight today.

228
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,880
Then let's fight.

229
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,559
Tell me.

230
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,680
Where's the Nine Yin True Sutra?

231
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,839
Will you talk or not?

232
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Tell me.

233
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,480
Where's the Living Map
to the Nine Yin True Sutra?

234
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,519
You won't speak?

235
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:49,960
Guardian,

236
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,200
we found a girl.

237
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,319
Second Lord!

238
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,359
Second Lord.

239
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,960
Second Lord.

240
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,720
Second Lord.

241
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,119
Second Lord.

242
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,079
Cui! Cui!

243
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,400
Cui.

244
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,319
Cui.

245
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,079
Feng, you're bleeding.

246
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,880
Is it her?

247
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,000
No... no!

248
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
It's truly not her?

249
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,039
No.

250
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,319
No.

251
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,880
What a pity.

252
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,240
He says it's not you.

253
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,279
Cui!

254
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,640
Cui!

255
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,720
You doomed us! It's you...

256
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
If you don't talk,

257
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,400
they all die.

258
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,039
Feng!

259
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,240
But Feng will protect us.

260
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,240
Right?

261
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,440
So there's a master hidden here.

262
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,279
Might I ask your honorable name?

263
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,519
I'm from Taohua Island, East Sea.

264
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm Huang Yaoshi.

265
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,279
Long have I admired your reputation.

266
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,799
Pleased to meet you.

267
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,440
Get the horses.

268
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,440
At once.

269
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,839
I hope someday I will have the privilege

270
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,960
to seek instruction from you again.

271
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,599
Where's Jialan?

272
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,759
You should protect her!

273
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,279
I'm here.

274
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,160
You okay?

275
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,799
Do you want to know where

276
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,440
the Sutra lies?

277
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,799
I don't comprehend

278
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,039
your so-called martial world.

279
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,440
But I do know

280
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,400
the Sutra is highly significant.

281
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,720
If I must choose someone

282
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,359
to reveal its hiding place,

283
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,920
it must be a supreme martial artist

284
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,720
who can ensure my safety.

285
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,680
After journeying together,

286
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,799
I believe you're that person.

287
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,519
Where's the Sutra?

288
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,720
Mount Hua.

289
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,279
There's a riddle to locate it.

290
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,160
It's...

291
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,440
What are you doing? Let me go!

292
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,960
Let me go!

293
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Huang Yaoshi!

294
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,880
Your Majesty,
it's Xu Hour. They haven't arrived.

295
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,160
Be patient. Wait longer.

296
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,240
Does

297
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
Know-It-All really know

298
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,119
the whereabouts

299
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,880
of the treasure?

300
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,680
Don't underestimate them.

301
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
These people

302
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,640
are well connected with vast influence.

303
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
From the lower echelons

304
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,759
to the upper reaches,

305
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,440
their spies are everywhere.

306
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,119
Consort Liu

307
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,680
secretly left the palace earlier.

308
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,359
I relied on them

309
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,839
to obtain precise information.

310
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,839
Hero Duan.

311
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:17,839
Sir.

312
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:19,720
Please.

313
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,000
It's cold.

314
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,599
Drink some wine to warm up.

315
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,240
No need.

316
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:42,020
(Duan Zhixing, Emperor of Dali)

317
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,000
What request

318
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,240
do you have today?

319
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,680
The Nine Yin True Sutra.

320
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,880
You seek the Sutra too?

321
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,240
In the martial world,

322
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,880
who doesn't crave supremacy?

323
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,799
This is no trivial matter.

324
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,119
So

325
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,839
I need you,

326
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Mr. Know-It-All.

327
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Rumors say

328
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,880
the Jin family of Xiliang

329
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,279
got the Sutra and were slaughtered,

330
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,960
leaving only a girl

331
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,279
who knows its whereabouts.

332
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
They call her the Living Map.

333
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,279
This is true.

334
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,359
Huang Yaoshi of Taohua Island

335
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,440
took this girl across

336
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,079
the Song lands.

337
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:41,960
That's true.

338
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,319
But that was

339
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,359
over ten days ago.

340
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,480
I need the Living Map's

341
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,119
current location

342
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:54,839
and route.

343
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,160
Name your price.

344
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,640
No price today.

345
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,319
Why?

346
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,119
When the deed is done,

347
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,720
we can both name exorbitant prices.

348
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,119
You cripple!

349
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,359
Can't even handle simple work.

350
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,759
In less than half a month,

351
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,200
you've broken so many bowls.

352
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,039
I'll compensate you.

353
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
With what?

354
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,079
You're a beggar

355
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,359
and refugee from Nanzhao.

356
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,400
You're broke

357
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,599
with wages docked.

358
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,519
How will you repay?

359
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,279
Why staring at me?

360
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
I hold your indenture contract.

361
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,519
I can beat you if I please.

362
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,640
Your worthless life belongs to me.

363
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,759
Over trivial matters,

364
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
you rage like thunder.

365
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,359
Spouting nonsense still?

366
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,839
Daring to curse me?

367
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,440
You pedantic scholar

368
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,559
and stray dog!

369
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,839
You're useful at nothing,

370
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,000
worse than a stinking beggar!

371
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,319
You're the stray dog!

372
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,440
What?

373
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,000
Am I wrong?

374
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,119
If I hadn't taken you in

375
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,400
and given you food

376
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,559
and shelter,

377
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,559
where could you go?

378
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,360
Did I disturb you, sir?

379
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,079
Sorry. I was just...

380
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,159
Young friend,

381
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,159
are you from Dali?

382
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,199
Yes.

383
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
How did you end up like this?

384
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,559
What's 'like this'?

385
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,519
I earn my keep honorably.

386
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,039
I feel no shame.

387
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
So blind to kindness.

388
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,760
Right.

389
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,440
Listen carefully.

390
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,519
My master

391
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,840
is a hero from Dali

392
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,519
who vanquishes evil.

393
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,039
This young man

394
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
is our compatriot.

395
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,199
If you harm him again,

396
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:51,880
I'll make you pay.

397
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,760
Understood?

398
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes.

399
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,639
Understood.

400
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,519
Take care.

401
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,536
Your Majesty.

402
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:22,760
Well?

403
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,280
I've asked

404
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,840
the waiter.

405
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,039
That man does come from Dali.

406
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,079
His family perished in the war.

407
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,760
To survive,

408
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,119
he works at this tavern.

409
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
The man who beat him

410
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,760
is the tavern's steward.

411
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,079
Not only does he bully him regularly

412
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,079
and seized his books,

413
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,880
but he also took the memento

414
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,079
left by his family,

415
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,480
two bracelets.

416
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,880
Your Majesty,
why do you show such concern

417
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,280
for this man?

418
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,559
He

419
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,199
has a scholar's integrity.

420
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,639
Where did you get these bracelets?

421
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,480
Gao Dafu

422
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,239
and Gao Yang

423
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,880
were your father and brother?

424
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,440
Yes.

425
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,880
When warriors in Dali's army

426
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,480
head to battle,

427
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
they wear iron rings engraved

428
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,599
with their names on their wrists

429
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,840
to ensure identification

430
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:56,960
if their faces

431
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,159
are disfigured in battle.

432
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,199
In Dali, there's a rule:

433
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,119
for those who die in battle,
their families

434
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,360
are exempt

435
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,039
from taxes and corvée labor.

436
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,119
There'll be burial assistance.

437
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,679
Their widows and children
will have pensions.

438
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,280
So why

439
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,840
did you become a refugee?

440
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,400
Our lands were destroyed.

441
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,360
Homes collapsed.

442
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,280
And even livestock perished.

443
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,239
Amidst the ruins,

444
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,800
there was no preferential care.

445
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,599
They sacrifice their lives,

446
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,599
yet receive no dignity.

447
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,440
Thank you, sir.

448
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,639
I was rude earlier.

449
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,760
May I ask

450
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,519
which Dali sect you're from?

451
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Never mind that.

452
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,519
Here.

453
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,079
Your indenture.

454
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,079
I've bought it back

455
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,400
from the steward.

456
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,559
Why redeem me, sir?

457
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,639
This tavern is no place for you.

458
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,920
As an educated man,

459
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,440
you deserve better prospects.

460
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,599
Here.

461
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,000
Keep the indenture.

462
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,960
This bundle contains

463
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,320
clothes and money.

464
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,480
Take them.

465
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:36,880
Return to Dali.

466
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,480
Sir,

467
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm Gao Ang,

468
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,320
from Dali's Lanchang County.

469
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,559
Years of border wars

470
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,280
reached our doorstep.

471
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,079
All my family

472
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,199
perished.

473
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,159
My right leg

474
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,679
was stamped

475
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,360
by warhorses.

476
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,760
Hence this limp.

477
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,760
But I assure you,

478
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,440
be it a servant

479
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
or groom,

480
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,599
I'll do any dirty

481
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,440
or hard work.

482
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,840
Since you hold my indenture,

483
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,280
from this day forth,

484
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,199
my life

485
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,920
belongs to you.

486
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,239
Rise.

487
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,719
Rise now.

488
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,039
This was a small favor.

489
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,800
And I need no servants

490
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,480
or grooms.

491
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,679
Do you find me useless, sir?

492
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,119
I didn't mean that.

493
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,199
But why

494
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,400
insist on following me?

495
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,679
Sir,

496
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,440
I wandered three years

497
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
through many hardships.

498
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,840
You're the first

499
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,079
kind soul I've met.

500
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:26,519
Very well.

501
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,920
So be it.

502
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,960
Let's wait until the news arrives.

503
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,960
What news are you waiting for?

504
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,679
A very important piece of news.

505
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,760
Once the news arrives,

506
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,880
I'll depart.

507
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,840
So you've accepted me?

508
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,360
I guess so.
