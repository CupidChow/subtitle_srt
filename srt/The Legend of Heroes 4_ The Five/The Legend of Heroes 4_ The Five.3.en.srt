00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:16,512
(Hong Qi, Leader of the Beggar Sect)

2
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:28,760
Sir.

3
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,280
More liquor.

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,320
Alright.

5
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,240
Your liquor, sir.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,159
Good.

7
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,520
Delicious.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,679
I'm glad you like it.

9
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,719
Enjoy it.

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,519
Greetings, sir.

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,840
Speak.

12
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
We've located Hong Qi.

13
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,079
Where is he?

14
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,120

00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:08,692
=Duel on Mount Hua=

16
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,168
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel,
The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

=The Five=
=Episode 3=

18
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,759
You said

19
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
you'd raise the price.

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,159
Now that you have information,

21
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,879
name your price.

22
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,199
10,000 taels of gold.

23
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,240
Outrageous!

24
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,879
That's exorbitant!

25
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,639
10,000 taels of gold?

26
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,080
In Dali,

27
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,719
it's the annual military budget.

28
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,120
Mr. Duan,

29
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,759
you decide.

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,759
Is the Nine Yin True Sutra

31
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,439
worth this price?

32
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,680
How about this?

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Since you're a regular client,

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
I won't push you.

35
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,840
I'll first tell you

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,599
half the info.

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
You think about it.

38
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,039
Tomorrow,

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
tell me your answer.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,319
Speak.

41
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
The Living Map

42
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,479
is currently with Ouyang Feng,

43
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,080
in Mount Baituo.

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,680
Ouyang Feng?

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,399
Isn't he with Huang Yaoshi?

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,600
They have some connection.

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
If they made some arrangement,

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
even Mr. Know-It-All wouldn't know.

49
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,040
Mr. Duan,

50
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,800
the information is confirmed.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,319
If it's false,

52
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,439
I will

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
return your gold tenfold.

54
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,519
He considers you a friend.

55
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,439
He saved you.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,000
Yet you sicced snakes on him?

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
The Sutra's

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
on Mount Hua,

59
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:43,879
but it's vast.

60
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,879
I won't tell you

61
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,680
how to find it.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,439
Here.

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,199
You're despicable.

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,240
Who knows if you

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,800
poisoned this?

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,839
Any family left?

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,680
None.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,879
All dead.

69
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:46,959
How?

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
Storytellers say

71
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,759
there are many martial artists.

72
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,279
They learn skills,

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
defend justice,

74
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,240
and help the weak.

75
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,680
But given what I've witnessed,

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,759
you martial artists

77
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,079
never protect commoners.

78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,879
Instead, you kill

79
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,560
and plunder for the Sutra.

80
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,519
You even betray kin.

81
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,920
My parents were killed

82
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,079
by villains

83
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,759
like you.

84
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,079
Storytellers' tales

85
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,160
are fictional.

86
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,720
All lies.

87
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,519
So, you admit it?

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,639
Admit what?

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,800
You're evil.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,560
Right.

91
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm evil.

92
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm Ouyang Feng, a villain.

93
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,519
But your parents

94
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,680
weren't killed by me.

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
You killed them.

96
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,199
Nonsense!

97
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,079
Your weakness doomed them.

98
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,600
You couldn't protect anyone.

99
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,879
You had to watch

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,439
helplessly as they died before you,

101
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
with no strength to resist,

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,199
nor means for vengeance.

103
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
I already took revenge.

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,920
The two guys who killed them

105
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
are dead now.

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,439
Did you kill them personally?

107
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Yaoshi helped you kill them, right?

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
That's no real vengeance.

109
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,000
They killed your parents

110
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,120
because they had high martial skills.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
Yaoshi could kill your foes

112
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,120
because he has higher martial skills.

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,160
Strength and power

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
are the ultimate truth in this world.

115
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,480
The path to mastering it

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,319
lies in your grasp.

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,839
My patience with you wears thin.

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,439
Where is the Sutra hidden?

119
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
Tell me how to find it.

120
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,199
Speak now, or I'll kill you.

121
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,360
Huang Yaoshi is powerful.

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,040
He'll surely find us soon.

123
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,399
He still needs me

124
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,199
to save his wife's life.

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,439
Kill me,

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,720
and you'll kill his wife.

127
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,600
He'll hunt you

128
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,759
till he dies.

129
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,519
The Sutra isn't a medical book.

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
It can't save lives.

131
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,720
Enough of your schemes.

132
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,680
He mentioned

133
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,319
a Healing Chapter in it.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
He wants to save his wife,

135
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,720
so he'll come here soon.

136
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,120
You'll meet your end today.

137
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,079
Move.

138
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
Let go!

139
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,039
Mr. Duan.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,559
That unscrupulous guy

141
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,399
asks too much.

142
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,519
Let's capture him

143
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,799
and press him.

144
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,159
In the martial world,

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
we should follow the rules.

146
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,000
Mr. Duan,

147
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,679
we can afford

148
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,600
the information,

149
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,440
but...

150
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,960
I know

151
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,519
Dali is a narrow land,

152
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,159
not destitute nor wealthy

153
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
in resources.

154
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:58,919
Well,

155
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,200
it's no small sum.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,080
Mr. Duan,

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,480
you must decide quickly.

158
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,639
If you want the info,

159
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,759
don't hesitate.

160
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,480
Well,

161
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,159
what about Gao Ang?

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,440
Sir.

163
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,879
Gao Ang,

164
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,120
the road ahead is perilous.

165
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,200
Since you have difficulty walking,

166
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,064
I'll send you
to Imperial Palace.

167
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,559
Imperial Palace?

168
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,360
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,159
Be thankful.

170
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,879
You are

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Duan Zhixing, Emperor of Dali?

172
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,799
Rude!

173
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,240
He's one of us.

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,919
I apologize, Gao Ang.

175
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,720
I should've told you sooner.

176
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,679
Your Majesty, one more thing.

177
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,039
Speak.

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,279
Yesterday,

179
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
I received news from Huan.

180
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Consort Liu has

181
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,399
reached Mount Zhongnan.

182
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,759
Mount Zhongnan?

183
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,720
Yes.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,519
Gao Ang.

185
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,039
I send you back

186
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,759
because dangers await.

187
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,480
Probably

188
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,639
even I may face peril.

189
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,376
Your Majesty.

190
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,759
Why do you try

191
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,120
to seek the Sutra?

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
You're not of the martial world.

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,679
So, you don't know how famous it is.

194
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,919
Martial artists are eager for it.

195
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,039
It's like

196
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,480
gourmands crave rare delicacies,

197
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,559
or tea masters

198
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,120
revere the tea art.

199
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,279
It's the supreme martial manual

200
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,679
in the martial world,

201
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
containing mysteries

202
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,879
and profound wisdom.

203
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,240
In my life,

204
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,279
if I could read it once,

205
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,159
I'd die without regrets.

206
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,519
Then, having the Nine Yin True Sutra

207
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,679
will be

208
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,720
your greatest pursuit.

209
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,159
Exactly.

210
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,759
If you never find it?

211
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,399
Keep searching

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,159
until I find it.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And if you find it?

214
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,519
Well,

215
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,159
the Sutra's martial arts

216
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,039
are quite profound.

217
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,679
I'm afraid

218
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
I can't totally comprehend it

219
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,879
in my whole life.

220
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,600
Gao Ang.

221
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:53,960
Listen to me.

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
Return to the palace
and recover properly.

223
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,960
Then,

224
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
go back home

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
and build graves for your family.

226
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,080
At least, let their souls rest

227
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,240
peacefully.

228
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,279
Thank you.

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,399
I appreciate your kindness.

230
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,720
I'd like

231
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,960
to toast you.

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,399
Okay.

233
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Poison!

234
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,120
Who are you?

235
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,679
Who sent you?

236
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,279
Your Majesty.

237
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,360
Who do you think sent me?

238
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,360
You're so weak.

239
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,919
I don't think

240
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,080
someone sent you to kill me.

241
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,279
Dali's common people sent me.

242
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,080
The soldiers sent me.

243
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,919
The dead souls sent me.

244
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,559
You're raving mad!

245
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Today's failed attempt

246
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,960
shows my inferior skills.

247
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
But there are countless people like me

248
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,480
in Dongchuan,

249
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
Heyang,

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,240
Xiushan,

251
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
and Shicheng.

252
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,399
You escaped death today,

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,559
but not forever.

254
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,879
Tell me.

255
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,679
Why do you hate me so much?

256
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,039
Why must you kill me?

257
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,440
You're guilty.

258
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,000
Absurd! I've been good to you.

259
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,120
Why am I guilty?

260
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,720
Listen up.

261
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,840
You committed three crimes.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
First,

263
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
you claim you see your people
as your children.

264
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,720
So, Dali's people

265
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,120
are all like your children.

266
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,840
Good parents love their children.

267
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,879
They care about their children.

268
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,159
They're concerned

269
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,679
about their children.

270
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,399
What about you?

271
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,200
You let your children die in battle,

272
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,080
rotting in fields.

273
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,879
You treat them as dust.

274
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,960
You let them become beasts' food.

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,480
You tell me.

276
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,759
What kind of father are you?

277
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,399
Second,

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,159
you're obsessed with martial arts,

279
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,279
neglecting governance,

280
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,919
and disgracing ancestral legacy.

281
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,080
People get impoverished.

282
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,480
The nation is in decline.

283
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,000
Resentment grows.

284
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,639
Your ancestors' legacy

285
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,279
is crumbling in your hands.

286
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,360
You tell me.

287
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,000
What kind of ruler are you?

288
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,879
Third,

289
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,559
you never knew

290
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
my deceased father and brother.

291
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,600
Yet they knew you.

292
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,448
In the autumn
of the fourth Jia Hui year,

293
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,639
a troop inspection in Dali.

294
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,360
You reviewed soldiers

295
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,159
on the commander's platform.

296
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
To encourage them
to fight fearlessly in battle,

297
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,000
you promised

298
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,840
you'd take care of their families.

299
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,200
My father and brother

300
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,919
were loyal

301
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,320
and grateful to your family.

302
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,200
Their final letter said

303
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,840
that if they

304
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
won the war,

305
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,440
they'd visit you in person

306
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,279
and receive your commendation.

307
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
Yet they both died in battle.

308
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,120
But you

309
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,919
are so blind.

310
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,600
The corrupt officials
embezzled compensation funds,

311
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,120
disappointing countless dead souls.

312
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,960
My mother

313
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,159
died from overwhelming grief

314
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,360
the same year.

315
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,480
When I was hunted by corrupt officials,

316
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,759
my right foot was crushed by a horse,

317
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,759
leaving me permanently disabled.

318
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,480
You tell me.

319
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
What kind of person are you?

320
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
Dali's people fought

321
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,360
for your family.

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,679
But what have you done?

323
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,039
You

324
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
search the martial world

325
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
for the martial arts manual,

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,679
hoping to learn peerless skills

327
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,759
and build your reputation.

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,880
How dare you call yourself a hero?

329
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,319
You tell me.

330
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,960
Now, are you

331
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,440
a ruler of Dali?

332
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,519
Or are you a man of the martial world?

333
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,839
You're right.

334
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,519
I'm guilty.

335
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,960
Even so,

336
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,839
why did you take such extreme measures?

337
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
I am

338
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,119
crippled,

339
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,759
but I have my pride.

340
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,480
The poisoned liquor was prepared

341
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,519
for you

342
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,440
and for me.

343
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,799
I foresaw this outcome

344
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,559
long ago.

345
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,359
The chance of killing you

346
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,720
is less than one in ten thousand.

347
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,440
After saying what I wanted to say

348
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,559
in front of you,

349
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,720
I can die

350
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,559
with no regrets.

351
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Future generations cannot be deceived.

352
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,160
Whether you'll be eternally vilified

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
depends on your choice now.

354
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,920
Duan Zhixing.

355
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,599
Emperor Duan.

356
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Your Majesty.

357
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,200
Please

358
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,599
choose wisely.

359
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,759
Gao Ang.

360
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,279
My brother.

361
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
May you rest in peace.

362
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,920
Your words are etched in my mind.

363
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
I promise.

364
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,519
I'll buy the info.

365
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,559
You're spending a fortune

366
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,440
recklessly

367
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,119
on the best martial arts manual.

368
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,519
No.

369
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,240
I pondered last night.

370
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,559
I've figured it out.

371
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,319
Before,

372
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
I claimed to be a hero.

373
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,599
I sought it for myself.

374
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,440
But now,

375
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,599
I seek it for Dali's people

376
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,519
to bring them peace.

377
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,960
What do you mean?

378
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
No need for details.

379
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,559
Give me the info.

380
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,480
You'll be paid.

381
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,880
Don't you

382
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,200
seek the Sutra

383
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,519
for the greatest martial arts?

384
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,200
Previously,

385
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,400
perhaps so.

386
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,039
But now,

387
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,799
I pay the gold

388
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,119
for the prosperity and stability

389
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,000
of Dali's people.

390
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,359
That's worth it.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,799
Mr. Duan, if you do it for yourself,

392
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,960
I will

393
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,680
accept your gold.

394
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,599
But if you do it

395
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,119
for your people,

396
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,359
you don't

397
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,319
have to pay.

398
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,960
Now,

399
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,079
the Living Map of the Sutra

400
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,240
is with Ouyang Feng,

401
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,279
on the road to Mount Zhongnan.

402
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,079
Emperor Duan.

403
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:18,960
Take care.

404
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,680
You all

405
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,759
return to Dali.

406
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
Select skilled soldiers.

407
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,640
Await my words.

408
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,960
If

409
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,680
I fail to obtain the Sutra,

410
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,559
I shall

411
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,920
never return to Dali.

412
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,680
Yes.

413
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,200
Release me!

414
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,759
Move!

415
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,720
What would you like to eat?

416
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,359
Anything is fine.

417
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,519
We need a quiet spot.

418
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,799
Upstairs then.

419
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:26,381
(Liu Ying, Consort of Dali)

420
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,279
I'm in a rush.

421
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Tell me the sutra-seeking word.

422
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,240
I'd rather die than reveal that to you.

423
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,839
See? Poisons from Mount Baituo.

424
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
Each one can kill you.

425
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,799
If you don't tell me,

426
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll poison everyone here.

427
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,240
Who are they?

428
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,119
Everyone here

429
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,400
except you.

430
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,279
They're innocent.

431
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,799
Heaven will smite you down.

432
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,400
In this world,

433
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,359
only good people believe in heaven.

434
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,440
Evil men never do.

435
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:14,920
Waiter.

436
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,720
Yes?

437
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,759
How much

438
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:22,640
is this tavern worth?

439
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,559
Are you that eager to die?

440
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,240
My parents are dead.

441
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,720
I've had my vengeance.

442
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,799
At worst,

443
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,559
I'll die here.

444
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,839
You're an evil guy.

445
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
If you get the Sutra,

446
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,839
many people will die.

447
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,640
Don't think your death

448
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,759
saves these people.

449
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,960
Your Majesty.

450
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,440
I ordered you to protect Consort Liu.

451
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,359
Is this how you do your job?

452
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,319
Please forgive us.

453
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,279
Emperor Duan?

454
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,759
Ying's not a martial artist.

455
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,640
She shouldn't

456
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,880
have offended you.

457
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,319
Sorry about that.

458
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,079
Apology accepted.

459
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:11,960
Now, the girl.

460
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,000
She can't leave.

461
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,000
Haven't you been

462
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,880
looking for the Sutra?

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,519
She's the Living Map of the Sutra.

464
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,200
I see.

465
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,480
What?

466
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,519
A monarch like you

467
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,079
also wants the Sutra?

468
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,440
Give her to me.

469
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,519
Be it 10,000 taels of gold

470
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,480
or 100 estates,

471
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,680
name whatever I possess,

472
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,680
and it's yours.

473
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,119
What if I want your throne?

474
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,400
My throne

475
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,839
is a cursed burden.

476
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,240
A cursed burden.

477
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,680
Then stop wasting your breath.

478
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,640
Hand her over!

479
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,440
Emperor Duan.

480
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,200
What's the point
of having a dying person?

481
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,119
You poisoned her?

482
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,480
She's the only living person

483
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,759
who knows the Sutra's location.

484
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,240
Yet you poisoned her.

485
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,519
She swallowed the poison willingly.

486
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,000
But only I have the antidote.

487
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,759
It's a poison from Mount Baituo.

488
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
She won't last long.

489
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
Let me see

490
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,200
how you'll extract secrets

491
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,039
from a dead person

492
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,799
to find the Nine Yin True Sutra.

493
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,200
Liu Ying.

494
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:49,880
Take her away.

495
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,920
Where to?

496
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,119
Just go!

497
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,000
Let's go.

498
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,720
Ouyang.

499
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,039
Sorry.

500
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,160
I have my reason

501
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,240
to get the Sutra.

502
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
Dali is in constant warfare.

503
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,599
We lack strong troops.

504
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,519
My people suffer from wars.

505
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,720
I wish to master the Sutra

506
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,519
and teach my soldiers

507
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,039
to enhance my military force

508
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,839
and protect my people.

509
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,920
You want the Sutra, don't you?

510
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,799
Stop cooking up a story.

511
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,559
If I surrendered the Sutra,

512
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,519
would the ghosts of your enemies

513
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,000
get back at me?

514
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:44,680
What I said

515
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,319
is true,

516
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,839
believe it or not.

517
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm leaving.

518
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,279
Wait!

519
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,799
What martial art did you use?

520
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,440
It's the signature technique,

521
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,488
One-yang Finger.

522
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,400
How much longer?

523
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,839
She's dying.

524
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,640
The Shenting Point.

525
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,600
Stabilize her with internal strength.

526
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,519
Emperor Duan.

527
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,519
If you hadn't refused to teach me

528
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,359
the point techniques,

529
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,079
why would I have fled the palace

530
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,400
to seize the Nine Yin True Sutra?

531
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,400
Five fen to the hairline.

532
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,319
It might help with massage.

533
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,039
Try it.

534
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,240
Can you guarantee

535
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
that the Chongyang Temple

536
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,119
is able to save her?

537
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,680
I can't.

538
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,359
But I've heard Master Chongyang

539
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,440
has many pills.

540
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,119
One pill revives the dying.

541
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,720
This is our only hope now.

542
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,279
Do you know Master Chongyang?

543
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,799
We've never met.

544
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,359
But I hear he is righteous.

545
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,680
I believe he will save her.

546
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,279
Well,

547
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
did she look better?

548
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,160
Looks better.

549
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,279
My dear.

550
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,319
You're a different woman.

551
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,079
You love martial arts and have talent.

552
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,200
I've always known that.

553
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,079
But...

554
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,400
Who is your dear?

555
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,559
Since I've left the palace,

556
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,119
I won't go back.

557
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,000
I wouldn't

558
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,200
teach you point techniques

559
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,240
for a reason.

560
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,440
What is it?

561
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,799
The point techniques are

562
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
One-yang Finger.

563
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,160
A protégé

564
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,039
can learn it.

565
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
I can't teach outsiders.

566
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,480
I took vows.

567
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,519
To be honest,

568
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
I yearn to pursue martial arts

569
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,240
and roam the martial world freely.

570
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,559
But the Imperial Palace is

571
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,680
where an emperor stays.

572
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,799
I have to act with caution

573
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,319
and weigh things out.

574
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,000
I can't behave unrestrained

575
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,960
like a hero.

576
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,759
Ying.

577
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,559
If you choose never to return,

578
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,559
I won't stand in your way.

579
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,559
But we are husband and wife.

580
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,200
So, one day,

581
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,000
when you decide to return,

582
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,680
there's always a place for you

583
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,559
in the palace.

584
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,880
Are you truly content

585
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,559
to abandon the martial world

586
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,160
and remain trapped

587
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,079
in the Imperial Palace?

588
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,200
Before coming here,

589
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,119
I encountered an orphan.

590
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,640
His entire family

591
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,720
had perished.

592
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,880
He fled

593
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,839
to the Song,

594
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,839
enduring hardships and humiliations.

595
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,279
He attempted to kill me,

596
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,839
but failed.

597
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,680
In his despair,

598
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,319
he took his own life before me.

599
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,759
Why did he try to kill you?

600
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,519
As ruler of a realm,

601
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,319
my duty is to give my people

602
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,480
a good life.

603
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,200
I know

604
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,720
I've never been a good emperor.

605
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,960
And I've never truly

606
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,920
left the martial world.

607
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,440
But this time,

608
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,440
the Nine Yin True Sutra

609
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,680
has resurfaced.

610
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,960
Perhaps this gives me

611
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,880
a perfect opportunity.

612
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,000
What perfect opportunity?

613
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,720
Have you heard

614
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,519
about Qing?

615
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,640
You mean,

616
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,880
Qing, a woman from Yue?

617
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,119
Exactly.

618
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
During the Wu-Yue conflict,

619
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,039
the Wu army had good swordsmanship.

620
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,759
The Yue was defeated,
so Fan Li invited Qing,

621
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,519
a woman who could defeat 100 foes alone,

622
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
to teach their soldiers swordsmanship.

623
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,319
After learning

624
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,599
the greatest swordsmanship,

625
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,000
the Yue conquered Wu.

626
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,720
As you know,

627
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,079
Dali

628
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,440
has endured endless wars.

629
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,599
If I obtain the Nine Yin True Sutra,

630
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,359
I will spare my people

631
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,160
from the suffering of wars.

632
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
So, the Nine Yin True Sutra

633
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,880
would save Dali.

634
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,519
Exactly.

635
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,759
By your reasoning,

636
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,519
this would

637
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,839
fulfill your obsession with martial arts

638
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,359
and save Dali's people

639
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,440
from devastation.

640
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,039
This truly is an excellent plan.

641
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,480
Speed up!

642
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,519
We must

643
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,880
save this girl's life.

644
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,856
(Chongyang Temple)

645
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,559
Open up!

646
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:34,080
(Wang Chuyi, One of Seven Masters)

647
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,360
What's it?

648
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,159
Chuyi.

649
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,639
A man came to see you.

650
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,119
Step aside.

651
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,840
Emperor Duan.

652
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,239
This girl's dying from poison.

653
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,400
Feed her a pill now.

654
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,880
This way, please.

655
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Huan.

656
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,920
Fetch hot water.

657
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,360
Yes.

658
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,159
This way.

659
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,679
Who is this woman?

660
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,400
She's the Living Map

661
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,039
of the Sutra.

662
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:11,679
What poison?

663
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,239
Mount Baituo's poison.

664
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,679
Qianyuan Pill.

665
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,199
Quick!

666
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,159
The roasted chicken smells so good.

667
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,199
Sect leader.

668
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,639
Jinzhou is half a day away.

669
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
Shouldn't we keep moving?

670
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,559
No rush. Have a break.

671
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,480
Alright.

672
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,480
Let's sit here.

673
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,079
Please sit.

674
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,719
Please.

675
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,760
Please take seats.

676
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,360
Thank you.

677
00:35:59,079 --> 00:35:59,480
This way.

678
00:35:59,480 --> 00:35:59,920
Thank you.

679
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,039
Please be seated.

680
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,599
Thanks.

681
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,079
What would you like?

682
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,119
Roasted chicken.

683
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes.

684
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:09,800
And liquor.

685
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:10,679
(Elder Xu, Elder of Teaching)
Alright.

686
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,320
One moment.

687
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,079
Our sect

688
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,039
travels to Jinzhou

689
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,679
to hold the Martial Assembly,

690
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,159
having invited many martial artists.

691
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,519
This time,

692
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,880
we will

693
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,559
make our mark.

694
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:23,880
Indeed.

695
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,960
All thanks to

696
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,000
Leader Hong.

697
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,079
(Elder Huang of the Beggar Sect)
He has unmatched skills.

698
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
And he joined the anti-Jin war,

699
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,119
saving Song's people

700
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,239
and protecting our land.

701
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,840
The martial world respects him.

702
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,000
Indeed.

703
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,280
In the past,

704
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,840
people hated beggars.

705
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:39,960
Now it's different.

706
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,679
When our sect members
roam the martial world,

707
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,440
any esteemed families

708
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,920
and famous sects

709
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,039
must respect them

710
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,719
for Hong's sake.

711
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,960
Exactly!

712
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,639
Now, the Beggar Sect is

713
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,800
the largest group.

714
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,800
Maybe later,

715
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,760
at the Assembly,

716
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,960
everyone will nominate

717
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,519
Leader Hong

718
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,679
to become the Martial Alliance Chief.

719
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,199
No need for nomination.

720
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,239
He will be.

721
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,159
Yes.

722
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:05,920
Right now,

723
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,400
the northern people

724
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,639
are governed by the Jin.

725
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,920
The southern people

726
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,280
are governed by the Song.

727
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,440
But all beggars

728
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,119
under heaven

729
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,719
are governed by me.

730
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,320
So,

731
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,679
if I meet

732
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,880
the two emperors,

733
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,880
should I bow to them

734
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,599
or not?

735
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:32,920
Either way.

736
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,840
Either way.

737
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:34,920
I'd better bow.

738
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Here's your food.

739
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,199
Here it is.

740
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,679
Roasted chicken and liquor.

741
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,039
Enjoy your meal.

742
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,360
Here.

743
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,119
Fill it up!

744
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:48,480
Good!

745
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:53,719
Have a drink.

746
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,599
Have a drink.

747
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,440
Leader.

748
00:37:59,159 --> 00:37:59,599
Leader.

749
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,400
You're...?

750
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,000
Sect Leader.

751
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,159
All major sects have arrived,

752
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,119
except

753
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,639
the Quanzhen Sect.

754
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Why?

755
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,760
Isn't it obvious?

756
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,760
They look down on us beggars.

757
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,840
Exactly!

758
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,719
Why exactly?

759
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,440
I heard

760
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,599
Wang Chongyang has obtained

761
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,840
the map to the Sutra.

762
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:32,880
Maybe...

763
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,480
Wang Chongyang?

764
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,719
I can't believe this.

765
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,360
Tell all our brothers

766
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,159
and major sects to go

767
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,800
to Chongyang Temple.

768
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,159
Yes!

769
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,239
Chuyi.

770
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,079
Chuyi!

771
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,639
Why the panic?

772
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Hong Qi is here.

773
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,119
He brought many people.

774
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,440
He's insulting Master

775
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,559
at the gate.

776
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,239
Get Ma Yu here.

777
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Yes.

778
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,448
(Sanqing Hall)

779
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,480
You go and fetch Chuji

780
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,599
and Chuduan.

781
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,360
