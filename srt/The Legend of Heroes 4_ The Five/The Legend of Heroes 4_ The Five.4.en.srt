On Mount Zhongnan lies Chongyang Temple.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,239
Deep within it hides the Sutra.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,199
Master Chongyang doesn't show up.

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,160
Cuddling the Sutra night after night.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,079
You watch and listen.

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,839
They chase fame
while claiming integrity.

7
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,000
You judge.

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,160
A lowly fly pretends to be an eagle.

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,399
Pretending to be an eagle!

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,600
Those beggars

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,600
are despicable,

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,759
defiling our sect.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,719

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,079

Mianfeng. Go!

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,320
Say it again!

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,719
Yes!

On Mount Zhongnan lies Chongyang Temple.

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
Deep within it hides the Sutra.

Master Chongyang doesn't show up.

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,479
Cuddling the Sutra night after night.

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,560
You watch and listen.

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,439
They chase fame
while claiming integrity.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,280
You judge.

Greetings, Leader Hong.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Greetings to you all.

34
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,759
Leader Hong,

35
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,680
all these years,

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,919
you've made a mark

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
in the martial world.

38
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,360
You have

39
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,520
made the Beggar Sect better.

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,599
I truly admire you,

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,479
true hero.

42
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,199
Today,

43
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,759
why did you insult us?

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,319
I've always respected the Quanzhen Sect.

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,479
I know Master Chongyang

46
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,639
pretty well.

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,199
Recently,

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,599
rumors have reached

49
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599
the martial world.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,319
Foul rumors.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,199
I couldn't tolerate it,

52
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,960
so I came today.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What rumors?

54
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,360
Mr. Ma.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
I have a question.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,120
I hear the Living Map
of the Nine Yin True Sutra

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,639
is in Chongyang Temple.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
Is that true?

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,199
What will you do

60
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,960
if that's true?

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,639
The Quanzhen Sect

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,280
leads all sects in Central Plains.

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,719
Upholding justice is our duty.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,000
That woman

65
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,360
came to our place.

66
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,240
Naturally,

67
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,479
we'll safeguard the Sutra

68
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,039
(Qiu Chuji, One of the Seven Masters)
for the entire martial world.

69
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,280
Lead all sects in Central Plains?

70
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,639
Then, the rumors

71
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,279
are all true.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,199
I heard

73
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,480
Master Chongyang
took the Nine Yin True Sutra

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,759
and secretly practiced in seclusion,

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,000
seeking martial supremacy.

76
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,680
He plans to absorb all sects

77
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,199
into the Quanzhen Sect,

78
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,920
uniting the martial world.

79
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,120
Nonsense!

80
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,079
Ms. Sun is right.

81
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,759
(Sun Bu'er, One of the Seven Masters)

82
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,399
Utter nonsense indeed.

83
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,959
But when many spread rumors,

84
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,839
your sect's reputation suffers.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,519
I think

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,120
the Beggar Sect

87
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,240
has no reputation

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
to lose.

89
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:48,959
Let us

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,199
help you guys

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,480
clean your mess

92
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,160
and keep the Sutra

93
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,319
at our headquarters in Junshan.

94
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,560
How about that?

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,959
Great idea!

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,959
Let's do it!

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
You serious?

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,079
(Tan Chuduan, One of the Seven Masters)

99
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,439
Yes!

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,920
Mr. Tan.

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,759
I sure am.

102
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,519
Let me ask you all.

103
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,160
What kind of people are numerous,

104
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,160
Taoist cultivators

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
or the destitute?

106
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,879
Speaking of followers,

107
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,199
the number of Branches,

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
and anti-Jin contributions,

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,079
my sect should be the leader

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
in the Central Plains.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,279
It's my job to safeguard the Sutra

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,839
for the martial world,

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
not yours at all.

114
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,680
Presumptuous!

115
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,199
What if we

116
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,439
refuse?

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,519
Then, I'll take it myself.

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,959
I heard you were

119
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,199
a righteous man,

120
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,199
praised by the martial world.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,519
After meeting you...

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
What does Mr. Hao think?

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
I think

124
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,839
it's both unexpected

125
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
yet makes perfect sense.

126
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,000
You were a lowly slave

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,839
and a wretched orphan

128
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,639
serving the Jin.

129
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:09,639
(Liu Chuxuan, one of the Seven Masters)

130
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,399
You learned a few martial skills

131
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,240
by chance

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,439
and earned a name in the martial world.

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
Honestly,

134
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,160
your hypocrisy and ugliness

135
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,240
don't surprise me.

136
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,079
Shut your face!

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,879
So, Mr. Liu,

138
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,079
what will you say about me?

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,839
Overestimating yourself!

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,279
You're very arrogant.

141
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,800
What can

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
you beggars do?

143
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,079
How dare you make a scene here!

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
As Mr. Wang said,

145
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,480
Quanzhen Sect has rejected my proposal.

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's settle this with combat.

147
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,319
What's your idea,

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,319
Leader Hong?

149
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,959
Since all Seven Masters are present,

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,079
well,

151
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,079
seven of the Nine Elders

152
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,720
came with me.

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Let's just fight.

154
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,800
Since you insist on fighting,

155
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,920
we will

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,720
play along.

157
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,639
Stop!

158
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,000
Elder Wu!

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,360
Elder Wu.

160
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,039
Elder Wu!

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,312
- You okay?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Poisoned needle!
Leader. They used poison!

163
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,320
Quanzhen Sect is just despicable!

164
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,360
Shut up!

165
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Quanzhen Sect

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,440
has always acted honorably.

167
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,360
We never use dirty tricks.

168
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,360
Senior.

169
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,519
Just save it.

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,759
An Anti-Jin hero?

171
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,080
I think

172
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,039
your own man

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,879
killed him

174
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,840
with hidden weapons.

175
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,759
Elder Xu.

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Take Elder Wu away.

177
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,159
Come.

178
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,360
Mr. Wang.

179
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,799
Why would we kill

180
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,879
our own man?

181
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,279
Your sect is promiscuous.

182
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,360
Who knows

183
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
your true nature!

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,799
Seven Masters!

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
I'll make you pay for that!

186
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,159
Someone!

187
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,320
Go and find Emperor Duan.

188
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,559
Get him here urgently.

189
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:51,879
Yes!

190
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,679
Beidou Formation!

191
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,639
Form up!

192
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,320
Who's it?

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,399
Mr. Duan.

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,399
It's me.

195
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,480
What did you call me?

196
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Mr. Duan?

197
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,399
Must we be so formal?

198
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,399
Call me Xing!

199
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,799
It's been a long time.

200
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,360
Indeed.

201
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,360
Why are you here?

202
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,559
I just stopped by.

203
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,799
I came to visit Master Chongyang.

204
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,000
I heard you were here with a sick girl.

205
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,720
So, no matter what, I have to see you.

206
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,639
I'm curious

207
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,399
who could make you

208
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,679
travel all the way

209
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,960
to Chongyang Temple.

210
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,159
It's my sister.

211
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,519
She's very naive.

212
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,639
She left the palace

213
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,919
to roam the martial world.

214
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,559
Unluckily,
she met scoundrels and got poisoned.

215
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,440
And this is...?

216
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,399
She's my wife.

217
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
Nice to meet you.

219
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,039
Xing.

220
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,159
I am more curious now.

221
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,639
Given the martial arts you know,

222
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,080
can't you clear the poison?

223
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,799
Why trouble yourself

224
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
to find Master Chongyang?

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,480
Mount Baituo's poison.

226
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,320
Guess what?

227
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,200
I could

228
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,919
clear that poison.

229
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,080
Really?

230
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,639
Have you forgotten? I'm a beggar.

231
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,720
Beggars have special methods

232
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,600
to clear snake venom.

233
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,279
Excellent!

234
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,639
With your help,

235
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,960
she will survive.

236
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,399
Come.

237
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,080
Okay.

238
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,360
I feel embarrassed

239
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,480
to show you

240
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,639
how I treat her,

241
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
lest you mock me.

242
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,559
Well,

243
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,759
give me a few minutes

244
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,080
to let me try.

245
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:46,799
Everyone out!

246
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,039
Yes.

247
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,559
Thank you.

248
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,039
Doesn't this seem weird?

249
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Indeed.

250
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,360
Earlier,

251
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I kept thinking.

252
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,480
Qi

253
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,039
is a famous leader

254
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,840
of the Beggar Sect.

255
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,879
And he's my old friend.

256
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,240
I trust him.

257
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,799
What worries me

258
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,960
isn't Qi,

259
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,679
but this Chongyang Temple.

260
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,559
I fear

261
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,240
we can't leave here.

262
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you mean?

263
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,240
I've heard rumors

264
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,320
that Master Chongyang also

265
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,279
seeks the Sutra.

266
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:09,840
Today,

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
to save this girl,

268
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,879
we brought her here.

269
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm concerned

270
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,080
they'll never let her go.

271
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,559
What can we do then?

272
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,679
We have no choice,

273
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,360
anyway.

274
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,919
We have to

275
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,279
play it by ear.

276
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,559
Qi!

277
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:40,919
Qi!

278
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,879
I told you.

279
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,759
He can't be trusted.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,039
He's just a liar.

281
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
About the Sutra,

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
we can't trust anybody.

283
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,400
Where's she?

284
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
Check the basket!

285
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,839
Your Majesty.

286
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,559
That girl

287
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,599
must still be here.

288
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,480
Go find her!

289
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,480
Okay.

290
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,039
Go.

291
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Your Highness. Here.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,839
Take her.

293
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,559
Yes.

294
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,240
Senior.

295
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm fine.

296
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,079
Any challengers?

297
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:48,920
Come at me!

298
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,880
Stop!

299
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,799
Mr. Ma.

300
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm late here.

301
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,160
Huh?

302
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,359
Two sect leaders?

303
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,759
Mr. Hao.

304
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,880
Who beat Mr. Liu?

305
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,799
Was it him?

306
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,839
Where's Jialan?

307
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,079
Speak!

308
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,319
Mr. Huang.

309
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,200
Hold on a moment.

310
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,000
I left

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,559
that girl

312
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,759
in a safe place.

313
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,640
It was an emergency.

314
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,519
No offense.

315
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:32,640
But

316
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
I heard someone impersonated me.

317
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,839
He tricked my sect's members

318
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,400
and made a scene here.

319
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,119
After I clear up the mess,

320
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,480
I'll explain everything truthfully.

321
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,279
So, that's how it is.

322
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,599
You hid the Living Map

323
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,359
and used a sorcerer

324
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,119
to impersonate me,

325
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,559
accusing me of hiding the map

326
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,480
to divert trouble elsewhere.

327
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,319
What a vicious scheme!

328
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,000
You stole my token,

329
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,599
copied my appearance,

330
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,559
but can't imitate my character.

331
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,079
You talk about conspiracy.

332
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,079
Yet you

333
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,680
have no dignity as a sect leader.

334
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,640
Dignity?

335
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
I brought my men

336
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
from headquarters

337
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,319
for this Anti-Jin Assembly.

338
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,599
Anti-Jin Assembly?

339
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,640
Enemies commit atrocities.

340
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,960
Anyone

341
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,880
can take up arms

342
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,319
to defend our homeland.

343
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,279
The Anti-Jin Assembly

344
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,240
is just a place

345
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,119
for you lot

346
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,440
where you eat and drink

347
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,759
and flatter each other.

348
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,559
I never do things

349
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,839
out of vanity.

350
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,559
Moreover,

351
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,599
if I host an Anti-Jin Assembly,

352
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll invite

353
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,960
Master Chongyang first.

354
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
The Beggar Sect and the Quanzhen Sect

355
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,039
could work together

356
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,400
to defeat enemies.

357
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,400
Quanzhen Sect and us

358
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,039
have never interacted.

359
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,200
Let them come if they wish.

360
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,440
Why should I invite them?

361
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,359
You explain

362
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,200
why the Beggar Sect wants the Sutra?

363
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,440
The world's greatest martial manual

364
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,319
belongs with

365
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,839
the world's largest sect.

366
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
The largest sect?
What a meaningless title!

367
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,160
The 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

368
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,400
and Dog-Beating Skills
are superb martial arts.

369
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
That's enough.

370
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,279
Why chase empty fame?

371
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,680
Mr. Ma.

372
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,359
Don't you agree?

373
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Drop the act.

374
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,640
I've been a beggar since childhood,

375
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,799
dealing with lowlifes

376
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,440
in my life.

377
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,799
I never fraternized with hypocrites

378
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,680
like them.

379
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,400
When you just came,

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,799
you bowed and apologized.

381
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,720
That's disgusting.

382
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,039
It made my men

383
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,960
laugh their heads off.

384
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,079
Elder Xu.

385
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,160
Am I right?

386
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,720
Where's Elder Wu?

387
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,799
They killed him

388
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,039
with hidden weapons.

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,359
Elder Xu.

390
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,720
Did you ever
hear of Quanzhen Sect members

391
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,359
using hidden weapons or poison?

392
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,559
No.

393
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,039
Did you see any of them

394
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,799
poison anyone?

395
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,279
No.

396
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,519
Then why claim that?

397
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,880
Is this how our sect does things?

398
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,160
Elder Xu.

399
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,279
Don't listen to him!

400
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,519
The Quanzhen Sect got him here.

401
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
Of course,

402
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
he is on their side.

403
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,599
You two,

404
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,359
let me speak frankly.

405
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,759
Hidden weapons

406
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,519
and poisons

407
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,039
are the vilest methods
in the martial world.

408
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,640
But they didn't

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,119
seem to employ

410
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,960
such dirty tricks.

411
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,279
Earlier,

412
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,880
I lost my temper
and forgot to apologize.

413
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,160
Elder Xu.

414
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,279
Have you lost your mind?

415
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,519
Yes.

416
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,680
My mind may be muddled,

417
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,519
but I

418
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,200
remember clearly

419
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,119
that when Hong Qi
first became the sect leader,

420
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,200
he was kind.

421
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,960
But recently,

422
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,640
he's become different.

423
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,319
What nonsense!

424
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,799
When did I change?

425
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,960
How have I changed?

426
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,400
Elder Xu.

427
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,240
Every word you said makes sense.

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,319
It's not a falsehood.

429
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,000
Fine!

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,039
If words fail,

431
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,200
let fists reveal the truth!

432
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,000
Impossible!

433
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,480
Their moves

434
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,680
are identical.

435
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,839
I told you!

436
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,359
The earlier one was an imposter.

437
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,680
We've found the girl.

438
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,559
Where's she?

439
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
She's safe.

440
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,279
Do you know

441
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,759
which is real?

442
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,480
The Xiaowuxiang Technique
of the Xiaoyao Sect

443
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,720
can flawlessly imitate

444
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,559
others' martial arts.

445
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:26,839
Even

446
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,960
surpassing the original.

447
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,799
Whose successor are you?

448
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,680
Wu Yazi

449
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,799
or Li Qiushui?

450
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,039
Moves can be copied,

451
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,519
but

452
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,599
internal strength can't be.

453
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,519
He's fake.

454
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,039
He's fake?

455
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,640
How so? A fake?

456
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,440
Impossible!

457
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,680
Sorcerer!

458
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,680
Any last words?

459
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,599
Mr. Huang.

460
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
Could there be a mistake?

461
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,759
Sure.

462
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
Could there be a mistake?

463
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,359
He's not real.

464
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,119
I can't tell who's real.

465
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,720
Isn't he our sect leader?

466
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:40,720
I think he is.

467
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:46,920
Sect Leader.

468
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Well,

469
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
what more is there to say?

470
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Hong Qi.

471
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,039
It's him!

472
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,599
Well...

473
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,319
I've lost.

474
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,039
But you don't deserve

475
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,039
to be a sect leader.

476
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,480
How did your skills

477
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,119
advance so rapidly?

478
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:30,720
Wait!

479
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,799
I have to ask him.

480
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,480
Sorcerer!

481
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
Why did you pretend

482
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,559
to be me and start a fight?

483
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
What did you call me?

484
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,519
Sorcerer?

485
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,000
Then what are you?

486
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,599
A righteous sect leader?

487
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:05,960
Or

488
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,960
a hero?

489
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,960
Look what you did today.

490
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,599
You are

491
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,599
arrogant

492
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,400
and frame others up.

493
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,920
Between you and me,

494
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,599
who's righteous?

495
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,759
Who's evil?

496
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,599
Who's the demon?

497
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,960
And who's the saint?

498
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:48,799
You.

499
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,480
You all.

500
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,039
Think about it

501
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,319
when you're alive.

502
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,839
He took poison.

503
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,559
I came today

504
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,200
just for the Nine Yin True Sutra.

505
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,279
I know

506
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,720
that girl came here.

507
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,079
So,

508
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,480
is she still alive?

509
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,440
That is exactly

510
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,279
what we all want to know.

511
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm Lu Jin, Manor Lord of Shijian Manor.

512
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,000
Glad to see you.

513
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,400
We also want to know

514
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,320
where the Sutra is.

515
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,280
Mr. Wang,

516
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,320
please answer us.

517
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm here.

518
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:41,344
(Wang Chongyang,
Leader of the Quanzhen Sect)

519
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:10,719
Leader Hong.

520
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,199
Mr. Wang.

521
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:15,840
Emperor Duan.

522
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,679
I didn't expect

523
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,519
Mr. Huang to be here too.

524
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,119
So many people came today.

525
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,039
Master.

526
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,840
Master.

527
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,000
Emperor Duan brought a girl here.

528
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,519
She's the Living Map

529
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,239
of the Sutra.

530
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,960
She's in the backyard now.

531
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,239
Since you're all here

532
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,199
for the Nine Yin True Sutra,

533
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,559
I'll share some thoughts.

534
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
Three years ago,

535
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,239
the Nine Yin True Sutra

536
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,440
reemerged into the world,

537
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,760
becoming the best martial arts manual.

538
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,679
But it also became a great calamity.

539
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,400
It claims lives

540
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,320
and corrupts human nature.

541
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:14,599
Today,

542
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,760
more people died.

543
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,320
In recent months,

544
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,239
I've traveled extensively,

545
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,119
tracking the Sutra's whereabouts.

546
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,840
Yet wherever I arrived,

547
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,599
corpses already littered the ground.

548
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,280
Unspeakable tragedies.

549
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,800
Long Fist Sect,

550
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,400
Shiyang Fort,

551
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,039
Qingping Gang,

552
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,119
Golden Blade Sect,

553
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:41,599
and

554
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,639
the Western Regions' Holy Cult,

555
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,960
regardless of past reputation,

556
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,559
whether righteous or evil,

557
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,079
all who wanted the Sutra

558
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,679
met tragic ends.

559
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,800
By my estimation,

560
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,719
in these three years,

561
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
in the martial world,

562
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,400
over 100 martial masters

563
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,960
have died for the Sutra.

564
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,480
Countless ordinary folks

565
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,840
died for the Sutra too.

566
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,039
He who hoards much will perish.

567
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:14,760
Do you all

568
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,840
understand it?

569
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,039
Master Chongyang

570
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,519
cares for the world

571
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,920
and helps people.

572
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,599
You're a hero.

573
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,920
I truly admire

574
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,239
you.

575
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,239
Master.

576
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,039
We barged in

577
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,159
today.

578
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,559
That's rude.

579
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,320
I apologize for that.

580
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,199
I also

581
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,079
admire you so.

582
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,480
But if your sect wants

583
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,559
to monopolize the Sutra,

584
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,480
my sect won't allow it.

585
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:56,559
Qi.

586
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,239
The Beggar Sect is already the largest.

587
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,400
Why must you

588
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,239
want the Sutra?

589
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,719
Xing.

590
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:06,880
I want it

591
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,440
not for the martial arts.

592
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,440
As you said,

593
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,320
we're the greatest sect.

594
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,719
The Sutra

595
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,239
must be kept by my sect.

596
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,000
Baituo Manor

597
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
can also share the burden

598
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,880
for the martial world.

599
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,119
Whoever

600
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,639
gets the Sutra

601
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,960
or whoever safeguards it,

602
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,559
I must

603
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,400
have its Healing Chapter.

604
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:36,960
It seems

605
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,599
the three of you must get it.

606
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,840
What about you, Emperor Duan?

607
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,679
I must have it too.

608
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,360
The guardian of the Sutra
must be convincing enough.

609
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,400
Well,

610
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,239
let's fight.

611
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,320
The victor has it.

612
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,599
Then let's fight!

613
00:38:59,119 --> 00:38:59,679
We can do it,

614
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
but not today.

615
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,679
Three days later,

616
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,519
we duel on Mount Hua.

617
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,440
The winner

618
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,440
has the Nine Yin True Sutra.

619
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Who do you think

620
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,599
will earn guardianship

621
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,679
of the Sutra?

622
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:24,840
Who knows?

623
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,960
Those qualified to compete

624
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,920
are all top masters.

625
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,400
It's hard

626
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,679
to foretell the ultimate victor.

627
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,840
In my opinion, the winner might not be

628
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,159
among the top masters.

629
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,360
New talents constantly emerge.

630
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,519
Gaining fame's easy.

631
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,360
Keeping it isn't.

632
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,199
The Central Plains

633
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,039
breed talents.

634
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:49,679
Let alone

635
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
Ouyang Feng from Western Regions.

636
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,199
He wields

637
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,400
strange techniques.

638
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
He's mysterious

639
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,440
and terrifying.

640
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,159
Ouyang Feng relies on poison

641
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,840
and sinister techniques.

642
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,719
That's a shame.

643
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,280
But if

644
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,719
he obtains the Sutra,

645
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:13,880
that's terrible.

646
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,400
Don't

647
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,679
underestimate our people.

648
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,639
His Toad Skill

649
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,159
is peculiar.

650
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
But if he thinks

651
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,480
he can win the Sutra with it,

652
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,159
that's a foolish fantasy.

653
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
If he dares ascend Mount Hua,

654
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,280
he'll never return alive.

655
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,960
He's like a toad

656
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,280
leaping into boiling oil,

657
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,480
a suicidal move.

658
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,079
Here.

659
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,719
Guys.

660
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,320
Meet on Mount Hua.

661
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,199
- See you.
- See you.

662
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,719
I can't believe you don't

663
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,480
poison them.

664
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,480
You are

665
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,800
getting more tolerant.

666
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,119
Your asthma has been cured?

667
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
Are you resolved to climb Mount Hua

668
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,480
and win the duel?

669
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,760
My brother died at Shiyang Fort.

670
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:17,920
Who are you?

671
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,840
You hate me.

672
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:23,679
I know that.

673
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,880
But let me remind you.

674
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,639
Your reckless behavior that day

675
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,119
endangered the entire manor.

676
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,360
If you had listened to me,

677
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,320
submitting to the Ming Cult,

678
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,039
it wouldn't have ended that way.

679
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,960
Unexpectedly,

680
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,159
you never change.

681
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,079
Those earlier comments

682
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:45,920
contained some truth.

683
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,280
Look,

684
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,400
years ago,

685
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,360
you returned to the Western Regions,

686
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,280
disheartened.

687
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
You said our manor

688
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,039
relied on poison mastery

689
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,679
for dominance,

690
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,719
but we

691
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,320
lacked true martial prowess.

692
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,559
The day after tomorrow,
many people will gather

693
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,519
at Mount Hua's summit.

694
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,519
- Then...
- Enough! Cut it out!

695
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,119
Must you throw away your life?

696
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,280
Isn't it good to be alive?

697
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,119
With your current martial arts skills,

698
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,559
if you don't duel

699
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,400
or come back home,

700
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,719
you can

701
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,559
rebuild Baituo Manor anywhere else.

702
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,079
There is

703
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:33,960
only one Baituo Manor,

704
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
in Western Regions.

705
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,079
Don't think

706
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,559
that practicing the Toad Skill

707
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:50,159
allows you

708
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,519
to compete here.

709
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,599
This skill harms your health.

710
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,199
One misstep,

711
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,039
and the consequences will be dire.

712
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,199
Can't you take my advice?

713
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,599
Don't duel.

714
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,440
Enough!

715
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,280
Leave now.

716
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,360
Next time,

717
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,440
I'll kill you myself.

718
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,159
Climbing the mountain is easy,

719
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,199
but you may not go down alive.

720
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,440
Life doesn't matter

721
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,440
