00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,620

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,020
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,230
I'm sorry Ji Soo...

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,920
for all of the mean things I've done.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,460
I will take all of your burdens with me

6
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,780
so that only the good things will be left with you.

7
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,600
Please be happy, Ji Soo.

8
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,810
Dad! I'm even more sorry!

9
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,370
Dad! Please tell Mom and Ji Yeong that I'm sorry, okay?

10
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,720
Dad!

11
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,910
 Dad! Dad!

12
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,080
Dad!

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,020
From now on,

14
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,820
I don't want anyone else to leave.

15
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,220
But why are you here?

16
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,830
I thought I should be next to you.

17
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,600
I felt helpless as if I was totally left alone during that time as well.

18
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,980
Don't be so sad.

19
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,120
That way, your Father will be able to leave this world comfortably.

20
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,700
 Yoon Hyeong Goo

21
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,090
 Episode 12
 - It's been a while, Seonbae.

22
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,780
Yes, it has. (TL Note: He goes from speaking informally to formally after the pause.)

23
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,730
One way or another, it seems we meet each other in a setting like this.

24
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,370
At this age, everyone meets like this at one point.

25
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,190
Let's not fight today.

26
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,030
When did we fight?

27
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,510
We have just had some conversations without hindrance.

28
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,230
It's not that you were both outspoken. It's that you were both harsh.

29
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,920
Well, do you want to see what harsh really is? Huh?

30
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,580
It's because I'm happy. I'm just glad that everyone is here.

31
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,040
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the past. I've been missing it a lot.

32
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,550
When you've had so many good times laughing the whole time we were together,

33
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,580
it's only natural that we miss that period.

34
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,870
When Ji Soo was around, everyone met up and so we had a good time.

35
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,290
Ji Soo is the flowering time of our youth. 
(also name of the show)

36
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,330
 What about me?

37
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,520
That's right. We should give you a name too.

38
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,890
Would you like to be "Video" call?

39
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,800
Or just "Fool"? 
(TL Note: The joke is derived from the word "Hwasang" which could mean video or fool depending on how it's used. The first character is also a homonym with a Korean word for flower)

40
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,250
Okay.

41
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,980
 Oh you fool.

42
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,110
Did you meet Mom and Ji Yeong?

43
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,410
You must be so happy.

44
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,060
I'm the only one left now.

45
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,570
Tell Mom and Ji Yeong

46
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,840
to appear in my dreams just once...

47
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,870
that I really really miss them.

48
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,970
♫   there are so many misunderstandings   ♫

49
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,630
I thought I would be okay.

50
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,860
♫   Don't ask me   ♫

51
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,160
I thought I'd cried all the tears I would ever cry in this lifetime.

52
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,450
♫   If it’s about the past   ♫

53
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,130
I can't stop crying.

♫   Whatever the answer is   ♫

♫   I can’t tell you the truth   ♫

63

64
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:14,070
♫   Instead of saying the words I love you   ♫

65
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,910
It's a shame someone like him has gone.

66
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,610
Indeed.

67
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,150
If he hadn't had that accident, he would have gone all the way up in the political sphere.

68
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,430
What are you talking about? He was a card we could use.

69
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm saying that it's a shame because we didn't get to fully use him.

70
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Ah, yes.

71
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,490
Although, he isn't completely useless just yet.

72
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,410
Even if a person is dead, the facts are still there.

73
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,830
- Her father's funeral? 
 - Yes.

74
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,560
Apparently, he stayed in a care center for a long time and then passed away.

75
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,650
She's really the most. He must have felt so sorry to death for her.

76
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,410
So, Jae Hyeon attended the funeral?

77
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,950
Yes.

78
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,590
Wow. I'm going to ride comfortably today because of you, Secretary Kang.

79
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,750
I pulled all-nighters for the past couple of days, my eyelids are like elevators.

80
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,110
They keep just keep coming down.

81
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,590
I will safely escort you.

82
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,900
Yes. This punk Jae Hyeon said he would come after a phone call, but why is he not coming.

83
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,990
Did he go to take a poo again? I told this fool to go to the hospital, but this fool...

84
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,010
Is everything okay with the Vice President?

85
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,880
I'm sure things will get better if he goes to the hospital.

86
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,830
No. No. About Ji Soo's father.

87
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,040
What about him?

88
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,280
Is it not? Isn't his name Yoon Hyeong Goo?

89
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,990
So what about it?

90
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,550
No. It's nothing. I'm sorry.

91
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,280
Perhaps, did you know about that too?

92
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,190
Did you know too?

93
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,250
Of course, I do.

94
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,740
Wow. How did you know Secretary Kang?

95
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,420
A couple of years ago, Vice President learned about Ji Soo's father's situation,

96
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,150
but the associated district attorney was Ji Soo's father's name.

97
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,190
Yeah yeah.

98
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,680
At first, I thought it was just a namesake, but the condolence calls confirmed it was him.

99
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,110
What are you doing. Let's go.

100
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes.

101
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,010
You must be tired.

102
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,620
You must have cried a lot.

103
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,800
Saying, "Aigoo. My poor Ji Soo."

104
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,480
You're so courageous considering you're a man who is having an affair.

105
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,750
How could you go to that woman's father's funeral?

106
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,400
Let's end this.

107
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,740
Seo Kyeong. Let's end it.

108
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,640
Alright. Do what you want.

109
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,190
That's weird.

110
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,790
Grandpa's toys are gone.

111
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,510
He gave those to me.

112
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,640
Really? When?

113
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,150
The day before he passed away.

114
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,270
I felt like he knew who I was. He wanted to give me something.

115
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,750
So he asked me if I liked the toys. I said yes.

116
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,740
Good job. Grandpa must have been happy.

117
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,810
He said to listen to you, encourage you,

118
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,570
and live happily together for a long time.

119
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,050
Grandpa's diary?

120
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,450
Yeah. I think so.

121
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,900
He had such a hard time every day. When did he have time to write all this?

122
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,390
There are a lot of Chinese characters.

123
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,690
Back then, your Grandpa

124
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,410
was the Chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

125
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,980
That's right.

126
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,910
There really are a lot of Chinese characters.

127
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,560
Totally like him. No one can't stop him.

128
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,240
 Dear Ji Soo,

129
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,310
  It's a warm sunny day with a wonderfully pleasant breeze.

130
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,710
 Today, my mind is as clear as the weather

131
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,380
 so I feel as comfortable as wool.

132
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,010
 However, all of a sudden,

133
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,730
 I start to worry about a few things.

134
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,800
 What the date was two days ago, what I ate for dinner yesterday,

135
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,820
 how I got this red stain on my sleeve,

136
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,300
 why that person sitting across from me is glaring at me.

137
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,430
 Because I don't remember anything,

138
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,150
 when my mind starts to fog up, I wonder if I made a mistake

139
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,810
 or if I did anything mean to you.

140
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,180
 I'm too embarrassed to ask others

141
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,000
 and get scared thinking about the answer I would get from them.

142
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,640
 After becoming like this,

143
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,180
 when my mind becomes sound as if waking from sleep,

144
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,950
 I think and make inferences

145
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,090
 to hold onto reality.

146
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:32,290
 I am fully aware of the struggle that you endured up to now.

147
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,230
I knew it so well that I couldn't even acknowledge it.

148
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,210
 Not too long ago when Jae Hyeon visited, I knew with one look.

149
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,750
Whether I was mentally clouded or not, it was a face that I couldn't ever forget.

150
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,800
Even after all this time, he still had his eyes fixed only on you.

151
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,080
 And looking at you smiling back, you looked like a 20-year-old young lady

152
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,580
 After watching the both of you, I had a heavy heart.

153
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,720
 When I saw you both happy together, even after this time,

154
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,880
 I don't know why my heart was heavy.

155
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,080
  On a day like today when my mind is clear,

156
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,470
 I wanted to tell you, but

157
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,730
  no matter how much courage I gather up

158
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,090
 I really couldn't bring myself to tell you.

159
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,560
 So I will leave it here in writing.

160
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,220
 You knew that he was Ji Soo's father?

161
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,020
Since when.

162
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,040
Since five years ago.

163
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,990
Hey. Honestly, the charges the prosecutor made against him made him like that,

164
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,340
but you still met Ji Soo knowing that fact?

165
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,980
When I saw Ji Soo again, I couldn't think of anything else, but her.

166
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,740
Because meeting her again felt like a miracle in itself.

167
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,860
However, after recently meeting her father at the care center,

168
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,860
all of those legal complaints in his work bag did haunt me.

169
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,880
Did only those papers haunt you?

170
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,950
After hearing that, I felt like I beat myself up thinking about your father's grim funeral.

171
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,820
Well... I can't say that I don't feel anything, but it's not Ji Soo's fault.

172
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,970
Does Ji Soo know?

173
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,510
She shouldn't ever have to know.

174
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,040
Of course.

175
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,160
That's why keep your mouth closed starting now and take on my divorce case.

176
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,360
Ah why are you doing that.

177
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
You told me to keep my mouth closed.

178
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,500
You crazy fool.

179
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,590
So you've decided to take legal action?

180
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,440
Not yet, but if it gets to that point, please do it for me.

181
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,010
While taking on cases that have come

182
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,340
and grabbing onto cases that are about to go, I have pretty much dealt with all sorts of clients from all walks of life.

183
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,080
However, for you, I really don't want to do it.

184
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,820
Is wanting to live with me a valid statement still?

185
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm glad to hear it, but why did you suddenly have the heart to do that?

186
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,490
Is it related to you leaving that school?

187
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,360
I want to make Mom happy.

188
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,170
Mom would need you to be happy, no?

189
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,600
It's because I want Mom to get married.

190
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,340
However, if I'm around, I would become an obstacle.

191
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,040
Does Mom have someone to marry?

192
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,070
It seems there is.

193
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,160
But, could you wait a little bit?

194
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,730
It hasn't been that long since Grandpa passed away,

195
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,140
and Mom is having a hard time. So I want to stay with her a little while longer.

196
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,100
Alright.

197
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,320
Is it okay for us for the other party to know that we're meeting together, just us, like this?

198
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,220
It's alright. The other party also already knows.

199
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,230
Well, at this point in time its not something to hide from each other.

200
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,580
By the way, because you converted those borrowed name accounts to your name,

201
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,200
you became the largest shareholder. I offer you my congratulations.

202
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,130
Since Hyeong Seong Holdings is the largest listed company on the stock market,

203
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,920
should I now call you Chairman Han?

204
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,650
Thank you, but I believe it's too early to exchange those greetings.

205
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,070
The shares in favor of Chairman Jang are even without the pensions and dividends from the shares bought and managed by our board of directors.

206
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,160
And even if we exclude the small shareholders, it is 36.8%.

207
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,400
Our side with the two of you combined with mine are 35.65%

208
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,830
By the next shareholders meeting

209
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,330
I can amass about 1.2% more in shares.

210
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,360
I can amass about 2%.

211
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,890
Then... hold on a moment. Then

212
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,210
we become 38.85% and Chairman Jang 36.8%.

213
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,760
Literally it is like walking on thin ice.

214
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,100
Additionally, the other side has a strong card left.

215
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Up to now the difference in shares is 1.15%.

216
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,930
We are ahead 2.19 million shares according to current market prices.

217
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,050
Look here, can you say we are ahead with a percentage point of 1.15?

218
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,810
On the surface it looks like that.

219
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,210
But the Hyeong Seong holdings employees and their  9% of director-managed shares are on your side.

220
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,060
The pensions and the collective investment scheme shares from banks have no reason to side with VP Han.

221
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,640
So, the defense of management rights can without burden—

222
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,950
Look. What did you say last time?

223
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,440
If Jae Hyeon were to take those shares he would need to pay out several dozen billion won in taxes,

224
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,910
so he would crawl back to us himself.

225
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,290
But what happened. He paid it well and took it all.

226
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,790
That Seoul Bank would lend all that money—

227
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,280
I knew it would be like that.

228
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,300
We should have called the reporter and state, "I was unaware of the changed expectations of the people."

229
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,520
"I'm sorry. I will give all of my assets to a scholarship fund."

230
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,200
If I were to say something along these lines at most it would've been only a few months.

231
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,670
It would have been better to be in the slammer (jail).

232
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,770
I am sorry.

233
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,210
Who did you say were backing Jae Hyeon?

234
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,870
Yes, the confirmed figures are Lee Hyo Sin from Changwon, South Gyeongsang province

235
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,350
and Song In Soo from Gwangju City, Gyeonggi Province.

236
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,240
Both are famous super-ants (ants: individual investors who have amassed billions in profits) amongst those in the know in finance—

237
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,040
What super-ant, super-ants freeze and die.

238
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
They don't attempt to do something with a single company.

239
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,740
Instead they are thieves plotting to raid the whole corporate group.

240
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,430
Wow. I have to spend my efforts on these low-life beggars.

241
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,740
I can show my anger daily, yet it doesn't end.

242
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,410
Look. Listen well.

243
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,170
Han Jae Hyeon. He's not one to trifle with.

244
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,590
Just because I pay them an income, the employees of this company are on our side.

245
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,630
Because we've dealt with our core investors for a long time, they will side with us.

246
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,370
These kinds of empty words, pack them away.

247
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,760
From now, think from the perspective of Han Jae Hyeon.

248
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,010
Think of all probabilities and hold your territory. Do you understand?

249
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,750
Yes.

250
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,440
Hak Seo, prepare what I told you to last time.

251
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Yes.

252
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,990
Additionally, ants need to be trampled to death for them to become of sound mind.

253
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,020
 Confirmation Notice of Dissolution of Marriage

254
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,110
 Husband Han Jae Hyeon, Wife Jang Seo Gyeong

255
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,360
 Confirmation Notice of Dissolution of Marriage

256
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm not sure if you can utilize this.

257
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,270
What?

258
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:01,910
Yoon Ji Soo's father is the enemy of Jae Hyeon's father.

259
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,800
Jae Hyeon and that woman, if they were to know all the details,

260
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,650
it would be difficult for them to see each other while smiling.

261
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,410
Tell me thoroughly.

262
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,060
I was hoping to meet tomorrow. If you're busy I will go to you.

263
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,650
 Confirmation Notice of Dissolution of Marriage

264
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,480
Jae Hyeon gave this to me. What should we do?

265
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,160
I have no intention to divorce.

266
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,060
Ms. Yoon Ji Soo, you also seem to not have any intention to leave Jae Hyeon,

267
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,310
so live your whole live as a mistress and adulterer.

268
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,960
I had told you that I do not have a hint of grace.

269
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,120
Insulting others and trampling on them, I'm very good at those.

270
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,070
I know well because it's not something easily forgotten.

271
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,960
Do you have anything else you'd like to add?

272
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,070
I guess you'd like to demonstrate that you're strong,

273
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,410
but I'm not sure if you'd be able to keep up that facade after hearing this news.

274
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,680
I don't like beating around the bush, so I'll tell you directly.

275
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,740
Did you know

276
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,920
that your father had caused Jae Hyeon's father's death?

277
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,180
If you can't believe me, look up the old documentation.

278
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,320
Which power line of prosecutors indicted Jae Hyeon's father.

279
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,820
You go ahead with your style of doing things.

280
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,550
I'll forge ahead in my style.

281
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:07,550
I gave our divorce documents to Yoon Ji Soo in shreds piece by piece.

282
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,020
Don't worry, she'll probably return it taped

283
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,460
if she wishes for you, honey, to be divorced.

284
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,980
I have made you, honey, into a monster.

285
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,190
This is how I am.

286
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,270
Because you both are acting like this, it keeps occurring to me I should live the way I was made.

287
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,150
 Did you know that your father made Jae Hyeon's father die?

288
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,930
 No matter how much I tried to muster the courage,

289
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,640
 I could not bear to say it in words,

290
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,190
 so I wrote it down like this.

291
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,570
 It was the most barren funeral in the world.

292
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,900
 No one came.

293
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,850
 Why he had made such a decision,

294
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:40,590
 neither I nor my mom knew anything at all.

295
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,050
 Until I had seen the many reports and legal files of complaint in my father's work bag.

296
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,990
 The hatred and fury I felt about my father's death

297
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,180
 were actually longing and apologetic feelings towards my father.

298
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,840
 As more time passed, I felt even sorrier

299
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,470
 and missed him more.

300
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,910
Are you going somewhere?

301
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,250
You haven't left yet?

302
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,130
I was organizing something in the car. If you're going somewhere I will drive you there.

303
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,620
I just wanted to walk.

304
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,120
Yes.

305
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,700
- Head off work .
 - Farewell.

306
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,510
♫   The stars in the sky resemble me   ♫

307
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:03,340

308
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,830
♫   They always remain in the same place   ♫

309
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:16,020
♫   Lingering by your side   ♫

♫   If you just love    ♫

311

 If you're tired, you can plop down.

317
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,580
 I'll run while carrying you.

318
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,580
 Just don't ever run away.

321
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,800

322
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,660
 Loans will probably be difficult.

323
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,110
 Your credit score is very low and you don't have a job with the four insurances (regular workers must have health, employee insurance, worker's comp, and pension),

324
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,740
 and you also don't have your four insurances registered with a workplace.

325
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,810
 Most of all, you have a lot of collateral loans, so for you to get a bank loan is also difficult.

326
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,910
I saw it well. Please tell the owner that I had a good look.

327
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,890
Yes, understood.

328
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,910
How was the house?

329
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,400
Are we moving?

330
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,690
I thought maybe.

331
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,150
Why?

332
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,390
Your grandfather told me I must become happy

333
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,770
so I thought, why not start with what's in front of me.

334
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,960
Do what?

335
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,980
Hello.

336
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,530
Long time no see, Yeong Min. Where did you come from?

337
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,000
We saw a house.

338
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,370
A house to move to.

339
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,020
Oh. You didn't go to school?

340
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,540
I don't go to school now.

341
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,160
Why?

342
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,410
I resigned.

343
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,250
It must be great Yeong Min, not going to school.

344
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,710
Was there anything you wanted to do if you didn't go to school?

345
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:51,210
What was it for you? The things you wanted to do with grandma and aunt?

346
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,590
He asked to say the things you wanted to do. Why did you ask me?

347
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:00,410
Since there was a lot you couldn't do because of me, you should do what you want.

348
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,850
He's all grown up.

349
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,360
There were so so many things.

350
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,690
Grandfather was strict so I couldn't do anything until college.

351
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,320
Then when I became a college student, your aunt was a high schooler.

352
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,660
Later, when your aunt had proudly been accepted to a really good school, I was busy.

353
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,690
I even left home because I hated your grandfather.

354
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,290
Really?

355
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,000
With your grandmother and aunt,

356
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,040
I wanted to go to the hair salon, the department store, pubs,

357
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,900
and take some photobooth photos that were all the rage back then.

358
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,100
And go to the noraebangs (karaoke rooms) that had just started doing business.

359
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,020
We also promised to go to a theme park together.

360
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,440
Fine! Let's go!

361
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,730
♫  I like everything about you  ♫

362
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,970
♫  I wanna stay with you tonight  ♫

363
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,210

365

367
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,800

♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

371
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,540
Does Hyeong Jae Hyeon also know that you're moving?

372
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,730
Not yet.

373
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,410
Why?

374
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,640
I'm reminded of the past.

375
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,360
When I lived in the country, you and Hye Jeong came to visit.

376
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,990
Goodbye.

377
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,400
 Spring 1996

378
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,770
Ji Soo!

379
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,510
You horrible girl.

380
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,450
You're really bad.

381
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,330
I looked for you so much!

382
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,330
I worried about you so much! Yoon Ji Soo you're really something!

383
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,940
Seriously.

384
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,970
Cheers!

385
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,580
I just felt it. This kid Joo Yeong Woo knows!

386
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,190
So I tailed him for a few days, and what do you know? He goes to the outer city bus terminal.

387
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,320
She plopped down right next to me on the bus.

388
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,260
I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my chest!

389
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,720
You should be happy I came here with no incident. I was determined to murder you.

390
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,790
My only fault was doing what Ji Soo asked.

391
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,350
You're right. This girl's the problem!

392
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,580
Because dad had to quit work in a bad way there's no pension.

393
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,400
He's not in a good place emotionally,

394
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,530
so my uncle (dad's younger brother) said that he would steward the compensation well.

395
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,670
Since then, I haven't been able to reach him.

396
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,250
Heol. That's crazy.

397
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,160
So we don't have anything. No money, nor people.

398
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,960
That's why you should come to Seoul. I'll be there with you.

399
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,410
It's comfortable here.

400
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,220
The cost of living is cheap. If you go out a bit you can see the ocean.

401
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,680
Moreover, there's no department store.

402
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,990
This place is too salty (to make me tear).

403
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,720
Yoon Ji Soo is salty. The ocean is salty.

404
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,930
It's a heaven for salt.

405
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,830
Please say something if things are hard.

406
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,710
Hye Jeong is here for you and me too.

407
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,870
That's true.

408
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,610
That's why I'm okay.

409
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,830
What do you mean you're okay.

410
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,380
You're peeling garlic with hands that used to play the piano.

411
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,940
It's actually kind of cost-efficient.

412
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,350
 That summer, the zinnia flowers had survived.

413
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,290
 It weathered a storm. Again a storm. After it didn't fall

414
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,020
 like the hail falling down, it bore red flowers.

415
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,390
 That summer I was in the middle of a storm.

416
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:57,320
 That summer, my despair also bore red flowers as if by some cruel joke.

417
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,710
 Again, even with subsequent storms, they didn't fall.

418
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,630
 When they fall, they rise

419
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,900
 into full fire, those hardy buds

420
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,830
 cover the small yard about forty square meters or so in a bed of fire.

421
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,490
 Like some stunt, my despair also came to an end.

422
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,390
 Ji Soo, the difficult times that you are enduring,

423
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:29,420
 by today, even by tomorrow morning,

424
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,560
 I pray with my whole heart they will end.

425
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,930
 Until we meet again, I hope you will always be yourself.

426
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,850
 From Chuncheon, Mr. Han Jae Hyeon

427
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:47,030
 sent this poem, "That Summer's End" by Lee Seong Bok along with his radio shoutout.

428
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,350
 The requested piece is André Gagnon's "Comment au Premier Jour" (Like the First Day).

429
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,610
If you think about Jae Hyeon, it's something that's heartbreaking.

430
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,570
It happened in the past.

431
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,780
Seonbae is still having a hard time even now.

432
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:02,550
He didn't even know anything until his father became that way

433
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,050
and didn't do anything about it.

434
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,800
But all of that is because of me.

435
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,830
He was arrested by the police because of me.

436
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,940
He was dragged into the army because of me.

437
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:27,850
He would look for me during his off time because I had disappeared.

438
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,810
- It's all because of— 
- Then it's all because of me.

439
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,060
How Hyeong Jae Hyeon became that way.

440
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,050
It's honestly because of me.

441
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,310
What are you talking about?

442
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,520
I was the one who reported him when he was on the wanted list.

443
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,780
Why would you?

444
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,930
I didn't want to see you having a hard time

445
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,840
because of Hyeong.

446
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,590
Whether it be in the past or now,

447
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,390
seeing you struggle is the hardest thing for me.

448
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,890
But, after Jae Hyeon was arrested,

449
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:11,460
and seeing you ultimately separated, instead of thinking to myself how fortunate and great it was,

450
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,360
I was so tortured.

451
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,580
Since what sticks around longer than a wound is guilt.

452
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:28,530
That guilt prevented me from properly confessing my feelings to you.

453
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,170
While on my way back from reporting Jae Hyeon, I thought

454
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:39,820
it would be hard for me to end up happy with Ji Soo.

455
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:47,120
That's why you shouldn't harbor any guilt.

456
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,400
I just know better than anyone about that.

457
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,230
 There is something I need to tell you.

458
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
Ji Soo isn't picking up her phone, right?

459
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,670
Did something happen to her?

460
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:35,590
Ji Soo knows about what happened between your father and her father.

461
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,020
Ji Soo told me never to tell you, but—

462
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,620
Then why are you telling me?

463
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,390
You knew about the situation between the fathers, correct?

464
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:58,400
After hearing about it for the first time, I did think about Ji Soo, but I also thought about you a lot, Hyeong.

465
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:05,510
About how you could have endured all this time with those scars you have.

466
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,710
Are you really okay?

467
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,270
If that question is asking if I can endure, then the answer is yes.

468
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,650
Everything is okay now.

469
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:27,230
When I see you and Ji Soo, you two seem like you are living in another dimension way ahead of me.

470
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:33,170
A place I can't go or even think to live in.

471
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,860
That's why, even though there isn't really anything I can do,

472
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,920
I always think, "Why do those two always have to go through so many hardships?"

473
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,650
"Why are they so alike?"

474
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,170
Just say it comfortably, that our destinies are really strenuous.

475
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,000
 Seonbae, I'm near your work. Are you perhaps not there?

476
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,730
 I'll head over there.

477
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,870
 Where are you?

478
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,850
 In front of your place

479
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,150
 Then let's meet in the middle. That park we went to last time.

480
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:40,490
I wanted to give you this. It's my dad's diary.

481
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,950
I thought you would need it more than I do.

482
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,300
Why are you giving this to me?

483
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,160
I thought it would help you with your long battle.

484
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,840
There is some information regarding Chairman Jang in there.

485
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,930
Also, I want to finish my battle as well.

486
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:07,660
While reading the diary, I found out that my father indicted your father.

487
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,220
After that day, I kept fighting with myself.

488
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,390
Mostly with Ji Soo 1 and Ji Soo 2, but sometimes Ji Soo 3 showed up, too.

489
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,050
I debated with myself if I should leave, act like I didn't know,

490
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,350
or just say everything and wait for my sentencing.

491
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:35,380
All these scenarios I grappled with back and forth, in my head, but there is no conclusion.

492
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,360
Now...

493
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,150
I really don't want anyone else to leave.

494
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,140
I thought if it would b e better to seek advice from you.

495
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,490
I've even thought about senseless ideas like that.

496
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,550
Now, after seeing you, I can't even bring myself to look at you.

497
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,490
Ji Soo.

498
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:13,260
If we are going to add the words, "because of someone" to my father's situation, it should be placed on me.

499
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:21,320
A couple of days before he passed away, your father summoned me.

500
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,070
He remembered all of the things that happened before and told me about them.

501
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:33,880
The person your father despised the most was me.

502
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:42,640
 If I hadn't run away with you that time, your father wouldn't have harbored a deep hatred towards me,

503
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,330
 and that hatred wouldn't have translated into the indictment of my father.

504
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:56,110
I was so foolish five years ago, I wasn't aware of such dynamics, so I couldn't piece those things together.

505
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:01,580
I couldn't hate nor forgive. I was muddled here and there.

506
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,180
 5 years ago 
  Your father, who was in a predicament both outside and inside the company,

507
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,180
was charged on grounds of suspicion of destroying the labor union,

508
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,600
then he gave up on his last bit of hope.

509
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,770
Did you find out which prosecutor charged my father?

510
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,500
Yes. However, they did mention that this was an unusual scenario.

511
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,770
The prosecutor who was further developing your father's case

512
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,390
suddenly was transferred to a provincial region (outside of Seoul-Gyeonggi) and the attending prosecutor was changed.

513
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,720
Your father was immediately indicted afterward.

514
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,190
Typically, they say this type of thing happens when the attending prosecutor contradicts his higher-ups.

515
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,480
Anyway, the prosecutor who has been replaced is named Yoon Hyeong Goo who is in the direct line at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

516
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,720
Who did you say the prosecutor was?

517
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,890
 Seoul Central Disctrict Prosecutor Yoon Hyeong Goo

518
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,650
  It is Chief Prosecutor Yoon Hyeong Goo.

519
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:57,130
After meeting you, and after meeting your ailing father,

520
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:03,630
my heart started to become conflicted like before. That's when your father had summoned me.

521
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:10,000
That day, aside from your father talking about apology and forgiveness,

522
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,640
what stuck with me the most was his plea to not let an already injured finger (soft spot) become more injured.

523
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:29,690
♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

524
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:38,660
To me, you are someone who is also such a very pained finger,

525
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,310
and since your father's heart and my heart are the same in that regard,

526
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,000
You becoming happy, I realized

527
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,910
in that moment, would be the end of all of this suffering.

528
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:59,010
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

529
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,950
Since I need to become happy,

530
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,100
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

531
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,710
♫  If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

532
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:15,940
I don't want to make the most painful mistake I've ever made twice.

533
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:26,230
♫  I would embrace you once and tell you  ♫

534
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:33,440
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

535
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,790
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

536
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:49,930
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

537
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,390
It's a lot darker than before and the pathway is steep.

538
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,000
But the main doorway is pretty.

539
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,090
Is it? I guess we need to install them again—the CCTV and a door lock.

540
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,420
I need to bring them from my previous house. They are so expensive.

541
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,490
Since Yeong Min is in middle school, he needs a room and I need one too.

542
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,810
In the spare room, I am going to achieve my dreams.

543
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:28,120
I'm going to open a piano school. Not a hakwon (after-school academy or cram school), but an actual school.

544
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,510
You've achieved your dreams faster than most.

545
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,380
It seems so. I was usually quick with everything I did.

546
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,120
- You're not going?
 - Yeah

547
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,950
 Hyeong Seong

548
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,980
I heard that the house was already signed over.

549
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,000
Would it be possible to get the security deposit from the house I'm living in now?

550
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,400
I'm not sure. They said they couldn't say how much it was signed for.

551
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,650
When will I be able to have a drink with my son?

552
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,500
You said that you don't want me to grow up too quickly.

553
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,060
That's right.

554
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,440
I still feel like it's such a waste seeing how you've grown this much.

555
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,410
But, what about the piano school?

556
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,070
You don't even have a piano.

557
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,690
I have money to buy a piano.

558
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,480
Really?

559
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,140
Yeah. If I grind out a lot of lessons for the next couple of days.

560
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,000
How many days?

561
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,260
About a month?

562
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,970
Then, you moved here without a plan?

563
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,690
I've been busy lately, that's why.

564
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:37,660
My heart has been so muddled here and there. I've just been pulling those emotions together and consoling myself.

565
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,980
Are you okay now?

566
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,280
From now on, together in this new house, with a new heart,

567
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,010
let's live to the fullest.

568
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,900
Shall we cheer?

569
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,960
 Hendrix
 Guitar Specialty Store

570
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,720
 Acoustic Guitar. Electric Guitar. Classic Guitar

571
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,020
Excuse me, but

572
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,990
Do you watch "Love Letter" too, Seonbae?

573
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,930
You don't have work?

574
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,950
Ah, I'm really busy.

575
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,330
Do you like me that much?

576
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,820
You came to buy a guitar?

577
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,020
No, a piano.

578
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,710
Why a piano?

579
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,250
I want to donate it to a piano hakwon I know

580
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,850
I have a piano.

581
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,810
- Lies. 
- It's the truth!

582
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,710
You didn't have one at your old house.

583
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,450
I bought a new one.

584
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,720
You just barely rented the house. How could you buy a piano so quickly?

585
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,320
You looked into it, didn't you? You're a stalker. A real stalker.

586
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,640
How were you able to afford the house?

587
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,430
After speaking with the owner, we agreed on only paying half the security deposit.

588
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,440
In other words, it's a monthly rental.

589
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,510
Then, you're going to have a hard time every month.
(Many Koreans pay a 2-3 year housing deposit only and live rent-free. Then get the housing deposit back in full.)

590
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,190
When have I ever not had a hard time?

591
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,180
That's why I'll donate a piano.

592
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,450
I don't want it.

593
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:24,890
You can just pay me back while you run the hakwon. How much will the hakwon fees be?

594
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:30,330
Since I don't have to pay rent or employees, uh about 50,000 KRW?

595
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,310
How much do the other hakwons charge?

596
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,420
120k won? 130k won?

597
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,020
Then just pay me back slowly.

598
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,590
Wait a second. Let me calculate this.

599
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:44,160
I got a used piano that's worth around 1.8 million, in addition, let's say 50k a month,

600
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,460
and let's say 5 people join thats 250k,

601
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,210
and if I were to pay back 100k a month, in a year...

602
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,760
Are you just going to pay for the piano with your month's wages? Huh?

603
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,740
Wait. Wait.

604
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,920
Let's just go take a look for now. How about it?

605
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,550
Let's go.

606
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,830
It looks good on you.

607
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,940
I forgot about it. I was only trying it on.

608
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,300
Keep it on.

609
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,820
I don't want to. It burdens me.

610
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,310
You already know that if you don't wear it, it needs to be thrown away.

611
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,390
You know that there are no such things as returns or exchanges in my dictionary.

612
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,500
I'm going to check every day.

613
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,380
I should only wear clothes that go up to my neck from now on.

614
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,920
Then, I'm going to want to find out more.

615
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:15,320
 Demolish

616
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:25,700

617
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,480
♫   If you just love    ♫

618
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,000
♫   Don't hesitate   ♫

619
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,330
♫   If you feel the same as me   ♫

620
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:40,410
♫   Then even if a painful tomorrow comes   ♫

621
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,390
 When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower

622
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,360
 What you are trying to is illegal.

623
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,850
 I'm going to continue bothering you and intimidating you

624
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,440
 until you leave Jae Hyeon.

625
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,020
 Be next to Ji Soo. Don't make her stand there alone.

626
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,780
 Because we can't be in the same house while going through a divorce.

627
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,910
 Do what you want.

628
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,060
 Since when did your relationship progress more deeply?

629
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,250
 Who cares? We were going to throw him away anyway.

630
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:12,830
 Even if it becomes a dog fight, even if I have to gnash or bite, I will do whatever it takes to win.
