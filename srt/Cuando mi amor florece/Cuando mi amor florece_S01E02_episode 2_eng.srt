00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,060
  When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,170
I found you.

4
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,720
Yoon Ji Soo.

5
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,420
  I found you. Yoon Ji Soo.

6
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,460
I should have found you earlier.

7
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,460
I'm really late.

8
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,450
Find me? What are you saying?

9
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,670
We had ended it, that's all.

10
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,430
How could I not try to find you?

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,900
Back then, when you had to hide,

12
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,930
I both understood and resented you for it.

13
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,870
But breaking up like this, not being able to do anything

14
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,900
and feeling helpless,

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,760
it hurt all my life as if a fishbone was stuck in my throat.

16
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,990
Sorry,

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,170
but I don't really remember the old days.

18
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,870
And truthfully, I don't really remember much about you either, Sunbae.

19
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,200
Thank you for what you did about the school incident.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,280
And I apologize about your son getting hurt.

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,680
His name is Yeong Min, you said?

22
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,010
He seemed like a nice and lovely kid.

23
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,580
I don't really know yet why the children fought like this.

24
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,200
So let's bury it. And there's nothing you should feel sorry

25
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,780
or thankful for.

26
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,200
Well, anyway. Thank you.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,170
I'll be going.

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,590

  Episode 2

30
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,180
Even if I'm just a sunbae you don't really remember, I can be useful as a guide.

31
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,700
I've done a lot of volunteering for rural communities, so I know these countryside roads.

32
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,740
- Who's there? 
 - Oh my!

33
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,560
I won't ask you to hold my hand, so just stay close.

34
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm alright.

35
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,830
Alright. Keep up with me, using my footprints.

36

37

 ♫ I messed up... ♫

62
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,960
  Why aren't you coming out?

63
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,000
  Look at yourself, mister. Why are your eyes closed?

64
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,470
  You're really making a spectacle of yourself here.

65
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,680
I think that's mine.

66
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,980
I found you. Yoon Ji Soo.

67
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,700
You know my name?

68
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,500
It was written in big letters on the music score.

69
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,480
Ah, you memorized it.

70
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,370
It's because of the handkerchief since it's an expensive one.

71
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,080
It doesn't look that expensive.

72
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,990
It's a present my mother gave me for getting into university.

73
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,140
Ah, I'm sorry. I was going to give it back, anyway.

74
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,760
It's fine, you keep it.

75
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
Why?

76
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,110
It has your snot and hair grease on it. It's dirty.

77
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,640
It didn't touch my hair. You called me just before I could tie it.

78
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,670
And it's a gift from your mother, so how can I take it?

79
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,340
I have five more since it was a set.

80
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,470
So stop loitering around our department room and go study.

81
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,630
- But no one was studying. 
 - What?

82
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,390
The sunbaes are doing protests all the time, and the freshmen are drinking. No one is studying.

83
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,330
You only learned the bad things, I see.

84
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,470
We study a lot. We read books and go to seminars every day.

85
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,980
Then if I also study diligently, will you date me?

86
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,580
N-No.

87
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,230
The cassette tape.

88
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,620
It had fallen down on the lawn last time.

89
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,440
I didn't listen to it.

90
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
Give it to me.

91
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,250
But, if the chords are too difficult, why don't you change the key?

92
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,390
Forget it.

93
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,400
But I memorized all of it.

94
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
Still, forget it.

95
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,850
I don't want to.

96
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,710
The song was nice, and the you from inside the tape was better.

97
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,210
You seemed more human.

98
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,130
And contrary to when you're doing protests, you also seemed quite cute.

99
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,120
You ... From now on, don't act like you know me.

100
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,070
You claim you don't remember?

101
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,870
When you carry around that handkerchief that's over 20 years old?

102
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,750
Do you really think I don't remember?

103
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,180
I remember it all, even the song.

104
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,920
♫ I want to try dating and being ♫

 Lodging

109
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,080
She still sweeps her feet as always.

110
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,110
Bride, please carry this.

111
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,220
This is breakfast for you two, but I have some scorched-rice water on the pot right now.

112
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,080
So please carry this.

113
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,810
The taste of the scorched-rice water is great.

114
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,310
Are you two in the flirting stage ("some") or something?

115
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,800
Would a married couple use separate rooms?

116
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,460
And if this is adultery, you definitely wouldn't.

117
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,820
We are not like that, we are just friends.

118
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,220
Don't make me laugh. How can a man and a woman be friends?

119
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,930
Of course they can. Female friend.

120
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,950
But how do you know so well, Elder? You even know what "some" is.

121
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,900
I watch dramas every day before the 9 o'clock news.

122
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,750
And the stories are all about these things. People commit adultery and slap each other,

123
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,810
and sometimes, they even slap each other with kimchi.

124
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,240
Aigoo, goodness.

125
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,480
I wish it would snow more, so we wouldn't be able to leave.

126
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,270
Can I take a look?

127
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,350
Just a moment.

128
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,040
Point some light at it.

129
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,960
It's not coming out.

130
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,050
It's alright now.

131
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,070
I'm almost done.

132
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,250
I got it.

133
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,950
Your family is very worried, aren't they?

134
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,580
They said it's fine and I can take my time coming home.

135
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,950
That's good.

136
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:11,050
Seeing your child, your husband seems like a good person. Can I ask what he does?

137
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,510
He's a lawyer.

138
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,190
Oh, I see.

139
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,940
Then he must have majored in law like I did. Is he from our school?

140
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,770
Sunbae,

141
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,110
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.

142
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,030
I am grateful for yesterday and today,

143
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,970
and if you need compensation, I will give it to you. And that's it.

144
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,730
I hope that we end this as fellow parents of students at the same school.

145
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,310
And it's awkward for me to hear about the past that I can't even remember well.

146
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,610
Right, you can feel that way.

147
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,760
It's daytime now, so let's go our separate ways.

148
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:30,870
♫  Spring&nbsp;blossoming in our hearts  ♫

149
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,720
♫  My trembling heart waiting for you  ♫

150
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,720
♫  Our fluttering gazes  ♫

151
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,540
 Seoul Station

152
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,740
You came a long way

153
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,680
I will take you home first, then go down to get your car.

154
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,880
♫  The longing welled up in my brow  ♫

155
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,760
♫  All of this is a new experience of you  ♫

156
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:24,210
♫  Our hearts are colored with autumn  ♫

157
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,190
 Hey, Jae Hyeon.

158
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,110
Yes, hey. How much do lawyers earn these days?

159
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,610
 Why, you want to become a lawyer?

160
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,890
No, I was just wondering if it's hard to live (on a lawyer's salary).

161
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,950
 They should be paid decently, I guess.

162
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,840
If one is a human rights lawyer or a government employee,

163
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,650
they could be struggling economically, right?

164
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,200
 Hey, are you getting fired, perhaps? That old man is kicking you out?

165
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,170
 This is why I kept advising you to have some money saved up on the side.

166
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh, you punk. Never mind.

167
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:09,310
♫  I worry&nbsp;we’ll grow apart during winter  ♫

168
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:15,230
♫  At night my heart aches with longing  ♫

169
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,610
♫  It's our season now  ♫

170
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,700
Secretary Kang.

171
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,680
Yes?

172
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,130
The person who dropped this handkerchief...

173
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,670
Oh, you had that, Vice President? I was looking for it so I could throw it away.

174
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,000
What kind of work did you think the owner of this handkerchief did?

175
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,290
I'm not sure. She had a bunch of 500 mL bottles of water. Maybe she sells things?

176
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,800
Anyway, you know those typical ajummas? Rough, with a hearty face.

177
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,130
But she was actually quite beautiful. I imagine she was quite popular when she was young.

178
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,670
Find more out about that ajumma.

179
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,070
Pardon?

180
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,820
Oh, Vice President, come on. Is it because I said she was beautiful?

181
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,680
You want to do nothing when we almost hit an innocent person?

182
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,800
Is that a person's duty? Did I teach you to be like this?

183
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,670
No, no.

184
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,380
But I have no information at all.

185
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,780
- I have some.
 - You do?

186
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,280
She is a parent at Joon Seo's school.

187
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,630
What? Really?

188
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,520
  Nursing Ward

189
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,640
  I've tried to talk to Yeong Min,

190
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,040
  but he won't say why he did it.

191
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,130
Yeong Min isn't saying anything.

192
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,370
He's such a gentle boy, like a cotton ball.

193
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,610
But he threw a chair at someone.

194
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,140
And I'd forgotten about that completely.

195
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,780
From yesterday evening until now.

196
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,020
I'm a really bad mom, aren't I?

197
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,800
It snowed then, of all times.

198
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,840
And so much, so maybe that was why.

199
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,230
Those damn seasons really take a toll on you.

200
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,890
It would be nice if we only had one.

201
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,500
But since there are four,

202
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,610
and each one of these four is pretty and makes your heart flutter,

203
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,420
the seasons come in holding that person's hand.

204
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,630
One day, it's the wind,

205
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,940
another day, it's flowers,

206
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,040
and another day, it's rain.

207
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,450
I close my eyes, trying to not see it, but it comes to my thoughts even more vividly.

208
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,510
I drink out of sorrow,

209
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,330
and then he appears in my dreams without warning.

210
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,320
He would appear even when I drank every day,

211
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,350
so I couldn't live.

212
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,380
No.

213
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,920
Actually,

214
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,650
that's why I could live.

215
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,690
I imagined our reunion over a thousand times,

216
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,220
but among all of these, none of them were like yesterday.

217
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,720
Why, of all times, did we meet again at the moment

218
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,030
when I was the most pathetic and miserable?

219
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,630
It's my wife

220
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,730
and my daughter.

221
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,800
They are beautiful, aren't they?

222
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,500
Still, I was happy to see Sunbae.

223
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,080
So I understand  how much you must be hurting, Dad.

224
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,750
 Vice President, Madam is here.

225
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,030
Stop there.

226
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,080
Are you doing charity?

227
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,110
Haven't you made enough donations and such, already?

228
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,400
Tell me in a way I can understand.

229
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,880
Who said you could let such a thing go?

230
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,610
Who told you to show mercy?

231
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,670
What, should I have put him in jail?

232
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,430
Of course. How dare they touch my son?

233
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,190
It doesn't merit this kind of reaction. And he's still a young kid.

234
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,230
The fact that he's a kid is a bigger issue.

235
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,990
That kid is bullying others at such a young age!

236
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,650
Did you not think of what could have happened if

237
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,080
he had been severely hit by the chair?

238
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,630
Verify with Joon Seo first. Make sure he didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,640
Even if he did, I don't care.

240
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,840
It annoys me to death that a thing like him is attending the same school and benefitting from free lunch there.

241
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,010
Settlement? Mercy?

242
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,170
There won't be any of that, ever!

243
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,960
You will be doing a disservice to Joon Seo.

244
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,570
There are things I've seen and heard (about what you did last time), so please do not do this again.

245
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,220
  Lee Yeong Min's mom, let's meet up.

246
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,950
I don't like to beat around the bush, so I'll say it directly.

247
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,750
I wish you would quit your position as the parents' representative.

248
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,610
It will be awkward if we get involved, so you should tell the school that you don't want to do it anymore.

249
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,920
It's not like I was doing it because I wanted to, so I can do so.

250
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,870
But can I ask the reason?

251
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:28,220
I heard about Yeong Min, but it isn't entirely because of him.

252
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,350
The problem is with you.

253
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,030
You should keep the lies to a minimum.

254
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,960
Being a divorcee is a matter of your private life, so I understand that you could hide it.

255
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,190
But don't you think working at a supermarket is a bit much?

256
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,300
You were doing a protest in front of the supermarket's headquarters.

257
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
Yeon Yi's mom said she saw you. Was she mistaken?

258
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,210
Do I have to tell all of you

259
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,900
about my private matters?

260
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,740
You shouldn't have deceived us, at the very least.

261
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,130
If you felt I was deceiving you, I am sorry.

262
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,800
I didn't want to say it if I didn't have to, because I was afraid it would cause prejudice against Yeong Min.

263
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,460
Honestly, wasn't it because you were ashamed?

264
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,220
You knew that you didn't match with us.

265
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,520
I think it's true that I didn't match with you.

266
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,080
Being the parents' representative and the hotel brunches were burdensome to me.

267
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,280
Very well then, I will tell the school.

268
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,050
Hold on. Why are you so bold? Aren't you going to apologize?

269
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,110
You've already forgotten? I told you just 30 seconds ago.

270
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,260
 Lee Se Hoon

271
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,610
What is the problem?

272
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,060
What is it that you couldn't say over the phone?

273
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,280
Aren't you being rude? You didn't even knock.

274
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,270
Manners are for other human beings, you see.

275
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,050
Is there anything going on with Yeong Min?

276
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,680
There is nothing.

277
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,920
Really?

278
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,860
Nothing's wrong.

279
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,700
That is strange.

280
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,790
Then, why has Yeong Min's phone been turned off for two days now?

281
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,040
You haven't tried contacting him?

282
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,740
He contacted me with his friend's phone to say that his phone is broken.

283
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,530
I see.

284
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,500
From now on, let's have such conversations over the phone.

285
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,170
I can't see your eyes when we're calling.

286
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,620
Eyes do not lie.

287
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,130
I won't be coming here anymore.

288
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,830
Figure out how to detect a lie through the voice.

289
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,750
 Floor 1, Room 6 
 Prisoner #2931

290
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,120
If you agree to a settlement, an acquittal is possible.

291
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,040
I won't settle.

292
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,720
 Summer 2004  
If your intent is verified, you could receive a prison sentence.

293
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,780
Your actions do not merit that at all.

294
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,100
It wasn't an accident, and it wasn't a mistake.

295
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,720
He downplayed the accident and mocked the survivors.

296
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,860
He was neither remorseful nor apologetic.

297
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,870
So I acted with clear intentions.

298
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,840
I will let the whole world know

299
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,340
exactly what he did.

300
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,950
  The phone number you are trying to reach is turned off...

301
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,620
  Homeroom Teacher

302
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,930
  Your call cannot be connected at this time...

303
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,650
  Dismissal is murder. Dismissal must be withdrawn.

304
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,850
  Withdrawn! Withdrawn!

305
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,670
  - Unjust dismissal must be withdrawn.   
   - Withdrawn! Withdrawn!

306
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,430
 Hyeong Seong Mart Management, open your eyes!

307
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,440
 Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

308
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,650
It's about the lady you asked me to look into yesterday.

309
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,190
Yes, did you find anything interesting?

310
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,850
She is a divorcee.

311
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,010
Sh-She's divorced?

312
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,120
Yes, since three years ago.

313
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
That's not possible.

314
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,410
In her family register, it is just herself and her child.

315
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,640
So that means she is raising her child alone?

316
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,430
Yes, it appears so.

317
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,030
Okay, and her ex-husband?

318
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,720
Is he paying child support?

319
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,090
Her ex-husband is lawyer in a law firm.

320
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,540
During the divorce proceedings, in her battle for full child custody,

321
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,490
she forfeited both child support and alimony.

322
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,290
Does she have a job?

323
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,680
No, she doesn't quite have a job.

324
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,480
It seems she does some part-time work here and there.

325
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,350
 Please make sure to turn on your headlights

326
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,860
Hello, Teacher.

327
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,020
 Did you call me earlier?

328
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,560
Yes, Yeong Min's phone is off.

329
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,000
I was wondering if something happened.

330
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,580
 Nothing happened. He was good in class, too.

331
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,980
Is that so?

332
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,020
 I'll tell Yeong Min to give you a call.

333
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,200
Yes, please do.

334
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,360
And... I have one more thing to ask.

335
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,920
 Yes, what is it?

336
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,380
If Yeong Min's dad calls,

337
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,530
can you keep Yeong Min's situation a secret?

338
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,100
I don't want him to worry.

339
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,150
Yes, thank you.

340
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,110
 Classroom 1-2

341
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,140
Why? Do you have something to say?

342
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,550
It seems I lost all sense of fear since I hurt my head.

343
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,210
Since that was your fault, please understand.

344
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,890
♫&nbsp;When the day brightens into dawn ♫

345
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,730
♫&nbsp;The red sun rises ♫

346
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,120
♫&nbsp;Deep resentment turns into anger ♫

347
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,920
♫&nbsp;And turned into an enormous wave ♫

348
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,700
♫&nbsp;Even if security and police come rushing ♫

349
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,780
♫&nbsp;We'll defeat them and become one ♫

350
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,790
Also, how are we going to deal with the temporary workers that have been protesting for almost a month?

351
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,590
I think you have to make a decision.

352
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,250
What do you think we should do, Director Park?

353
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,460
Well, we didn't do anything to breach the contract.

354
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,570
But those people are saying the contract itself is unjust.

355
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,140
- So, I think we should handle it by law— 
 - You should read the room a bit.

356
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,210
Those people are mainly housewives in their 40's and 50's.

357
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,170
These days, if we just blow them off, they can start petitions and other bothersome things.

358
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,260
Then, what should we do?

359
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,510
Just leave them alone.

360
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,970
The mood is cheerful and peaceful, they seem like ajummas enjoying a picnic.

361
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,850
I doubt they would break down the company doors and storm in.

362
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,230
Right.

363
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,520
Talk to the legal team and bring me a plan!

364
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,730
Stop asking me as if it were a quiz.

365
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,880
Okay.

366
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,410
We're going to buy time pretending to negotiate and then forcefully disband them.

367
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,770
Illegal labor protests, trespass of property, disruption of business, etc.

368
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,030
Collect anything that might back up the forceful disbandment.

369
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes.

370
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,590
Why don't you marry, Mister?

371
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,840
Or have you already tried it before?

372
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,470
Are you saying a good looking guy like you didn't have anyone?

373
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,720
I'm sure he had someone.

374
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,760
You couldn't choose because there were too many, right?

375
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,180
I had one, but

376
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,600
she didn't realize it for 25 years because she only looks forward like a horse at a derby.

377
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,480
It's not too bad.

378
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,220
At least she doesn't ask to break up.

379
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,150
- You can sit here. 
 - Excuse me?

380
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,520
We're all done.

381
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,980
- You don't look finish— 
 - Hope you have good business!

382
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,150
- Let's go. 
- Fighting!

383
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,840
Why are they cheering for you?

384
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,850
For me to have good business.

385
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,120
Is it that noticeable that I drink a lot?

386
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,160
It's kind of noticeable. You kind of smell like alcohol, too.

387
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,060
Really?

388
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,230
 Department of Law

389
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,720
 May, 1993

390
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,560
It's you, right?

391
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,260
It is you. The beauty queen who came to see Jae Hyeon.

392
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,050
Did you come to see him again?

393
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,820
Yes, I have something to give him.

394
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,760
Give it to me. I can give it to him for you.

395
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,900
I don't want to.

396
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,650
There is a way for you to see Jae Hyeon every day.

397
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,680
Join our club.

398
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,150
What club is it?

399
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,910
A philosophy club called Philosophy Solidarity.

400
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,240
The name is kind of...

401
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,450
The name is kind of grandiose, but we just study philosophy.

402
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,220
I don't know much about philosophy.

403
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,470
We don't really know either. That's why we're learning.

404
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,310
It's a non-major-specific club, so you can join, too.

405
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,250
Jae Hyeon is the main speaker, so he comes into the seminar every week.

406
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,430
Jae Hyeon is usually in the club room more than the Law Department.

407
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,620
Is that so?

408
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,270
We write notes here telling people where to come.

409
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,500
Oh, it's Sunbae Jae Hyeon!

410
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,380
That's Jae Hyeon's favorite pub.

411
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,570
I can find out where he is if I look here.

412
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,630
Some people use code to hide where they're going.

413
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,260
But generally, everyone's welcome.

414
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,360
It's an "Everyone who wants to drink, come out. Let's drink to our death" kind of feel.

415
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,000
Oh, Jae Hyeon is also a regular at this bookstore.

416
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,220
 Today's Books

417
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,600
♫  Oh baby  ♫

418
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,250
♫  I like everything about you  ♫

419
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,660
♫  I wanna stay with you tonight  ♫

420
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,900
♫  Tonight, it’s you and me, will you stay?  ♫

421
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,100
♫  You know you’re my everything  ♫

422
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,330
♫  I’m falling for you  ♫

423
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,380
 Today's Books

424
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,920
Excuse me, have you seen a tall and handsome student?

425
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,930
The kids who come here are all generally tall and handsome.

426
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,620
There's one is noticeably good looking even among those.

427
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,920
Law major Han Jae Hyeon, class of '91.

428
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,260
- Oh, Jae Hyeon. 
 - When does he come?

429
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,420
It's hard to say.

430
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,070
Then what kind of books does he usually buy?

431
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,260
Oh, what a coincidence!

432
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,890
Do you come here often, too, Sunbae?

433
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,930
- Move. 
 - What?

434
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,260
You're blocking the way.

435
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,060
Oh, right...

436
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,350
Thank you.

437
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,060
Take care.

438
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,250
- Student?
 - Yes?

439
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,200
Jae Hyeon asked me to give this to you.

440
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,950
 The End of That Summer

441
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,490
 Closer to You 2

442
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,760
 I keep lifting my heels,

443
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,900
 but I still cannot see you.

444
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,940
 As the waiting grows longer,

445
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,990
 feelings of resentment appear.

446
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,210
 In the remote sky, feather-like clouds float by.

447
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,130
 What song must I sing for it to reach your ears?

448
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,810
 Since we never met, there is no need to separate.

449
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,190
 But although we did not separate, we cannot hold each other's hands.

450
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,920
 The deeper the waiting becomes,

451
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,090
 the feelings of resentment grow.

452
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Did something happen?

453
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,620
What is it?

454
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,710
I am trying to decide the order

455
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,600
of the things I have to tell you.

456
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,790
I've decided.

457
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,420
So hurry and tell me.

458
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,070
Yeong Min is coming home the day after tomorrow, but I haven't done the grocery shopping.

459
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,600
Oh, you, really...

460
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,110
I should hurry before the store closes.

461
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,810
She sure is consistent.

462
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,500
Why won't she wear gloves, anyway?

463
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,880
Her clothes are so thin, too.

464
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,070
Who is this for?

465
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,350
It's for me. Ow, ow, what?

466
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,950
Why would you guzzle down a whole bottle of liquor like that?

467
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,810
- Then what should I do?
 - About what?

468
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:12,920
I already can't sleep well, but now it's about to get worse.

469
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,480
Why?

470
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,200
This isn't the time for me to be doing this.

471
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,760
It wouldn't be enough to be completely alert, but I keep thinking about it.

472
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,860
So I'm really having a hard time, Grandma.

473
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,410
Where are you?

474
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:05,030
Did you go to buy some water and end up drowning? Why aren't you coming?

475
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,520
Why aren't you coming? Come quickly, geez.

476
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,670
Thank you.

477
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,890
Here.

478
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,960
Let me carry this for you to your door.

479
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,260
No, please don't.

480
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,100
It's quite heavy.

481
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,280
Thank you.

482
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,730
Don't mention it.

483
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,940
Have we met before, by any chance?

484
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,500
I have a very common appearance, so I hear that a lot.

485
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,960
No, it's not that common.

486
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:52,660
Is that so? But why do people say that? How strange.

487
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,900
Goodbye, then. Be well.

488
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,410
- You've worked hard.
 - It was nothing.

489
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,990
She went inside, so shall we go now?

490
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,110
- Yes, let's go.
 - Yes.

491
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,800
But may I ask what your relationship with her is?

492
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,420
No, don't ask.

493
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,320
Yes, sir.

494
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,290
- Hey, Joon Woo.
 - Yes?

495
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,240
Starting tomorrow, come here to work for the next few days.

496
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,240
I'm sorry?

497
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,270
See where that woman goes and what she does.

498
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,790
Yes.

499
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,300
It's not stalking, it's not a crime. Think of it as good intentions.

500
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,380
Yes, I understand.

501
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,800
She's a junior from my college. She was smart and a good person.

502
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,940
 To Sunbae Jae Hyeon

503
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:21,700
♫  Don’t ask me  ♫

504
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:28,200
♫  If it’s about the past  ♫

505
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,590
♫  Whatever the answer it is  ♫

506
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:41,470
♫  I can’t tell you the truth  ♫

507
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:47,400
♫  Just bury them in your heart  ♫

508
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,400
♫  Words you wanted to say  ♫

509
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,790
♫  That we called love  ♫

510
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,000
 I... think I can endure because of those moments that were beautiful like flowers. I am sorry and I am grateful, Sunbae.

511
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,080
♫  Even the scattered memories  ♫

512
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:14,900
♫  We’ll see each other again  ♫

513
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:21,750
♫  Give me a hug, then  ♫

514
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:29,400
♫  Though I couldn't bring myself to do it today.  ♫

515
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:36,810
♫  Do that instead of saying your sorry.  ♫

516
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:47,650
♫  Instead of saying the words I love you  ♫

517
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,780
These are the gloves you spoke of. They are the latest models.

518
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,190
Yes.

519
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,200
They are gifts for your wife, aren't they?

520
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,890
No.

521
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,990
I understand.

522
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,640
No need to tell her about it.

523
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,600
Yes, of course.

524
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,420
Give me these, please.

525
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,460
Yes.

526
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,950
Yeah.

527
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,150
Yes, Vice President?

528
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,700
Yes, are you looking well?

529
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,140
I am looking well, but Yoon Ji Soo right now...

530
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,730
What now?

531
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,710
She is in front of our company right now.

532
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,070
What?

533
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,360
 Dismissal is Murder! Withdraw the Dismissals!

534
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,290
 Yeong Min, you are reading my messages, but you won't reply?

535
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,210
 This is cheating, you know.

536
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,850
 Murderous Corporation Hyeong Seong, Chairman Jang San...

537
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,380
Shall I keep watching her?

538
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,890
Let's stop now.

539
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,070
I understand.

540
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,420
Good intentions, bulls**t. We are stalking her.

541
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,310
Sorry for asking you to do this, Joon Woo.

542
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,570
Oh, not at all.

543
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,340
- Shall I cancel your engagement today?
 - What engagement?

544
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,350
The President of Seoul Bank.

545
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,240
Well, I suppose I should work.

546
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,580
Yes.

547
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,200
It's pretty.

548
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,410
"A chaebol son-in-law, handsome and middle-aged, you want to call him 'my man...'"

549
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,140
Such B.S.

550
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,100
But he cuts a fine figure, he could be an actor.

551
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,630
- He's young, but he's already a vice president.
 - I know.

552
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,650
- Don't you know this?
 - What?

553
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,150
He is CEO Jang Seo Kyeong's husband. Jang Seo Kyeong, Jang Seo Kyeong.

554
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,400
Oh, that's right.

555
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,970
The chairman fiercely opposed their marriage.

556
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:10,170
But Jang Seo Kyeong threw a fit like she would die, so they finally got married.

557
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,900
He went to prison in the chairman's stead and was recently released, I think?

558
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,340
What? Where?

559
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,080
- Let me see.
 - Hey, come on, hey!

560
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,000
 "A chaebol son-in-law, handsome and middle-aged, you want to call him 'my man...'" 
Hyeong Seong Group Han Jae Hyeon Vice President

561
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,570
We could just take turns looking at it.

562
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,070
 "A chaebol son-in-law, handsome and middle-aged, you want to call him 'my man...'" 
Hyeong Seong Group Han Jae Hyeon Vice President

563
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,830
 The meeting between the owner's only child and a clerk, a drama-like love story

564
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,930
I will never agree to a settlement.

565
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,780
Please call a hearing regarding school violence.

566
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,370
But his father said we must not.

567
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:17,700
So you should have stopped him, Principal.

568
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,670
Even if Joon Seo's grandfather came, not Joon Seo's father, you should have blocked it.

569
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:26,310
I apologize. I did tell him in earnest that we must not do that.

570
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,030
But he said he was still a young student, so—

571
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,500
I'm saying this just so you don't misunderstand

572
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,980
but even if my child was not the victim, I would have asked you to follow procedure.

573
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,780
To just overlook these kinds of incidents is a bad look for the school.

574
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,000
And this school should seem more special than other ordinary schools, shouldn't it?

575
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,140
Wouldn't that be the reason that parents are sacrificing a lot to send their children here?

576
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,930
And it's the same reason that I donate such a large amount to this school.

577
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,000
 "A chaebol son-in-law, handsome and middle-aged, you want to call him 'my man...'" 
Hyeong Seong Group Han Jae Hyeon Vice President
 The meeting between the owner's only child and a clerk, a drama-like love story

578
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:25,680
Yes, Teacher?

579
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,650
 Mother, what shall we do?

580
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,420
Has something happened?

581
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,920
 It seems a hearing for Yeong Min will be opened regarding school violence.

582
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Out of the blue?

583
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,840
 Joon Seo's mother visited the school.

584
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:46,990
 Joon Seo's mother requested that her contact information not be given

585
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,520
  to anyone.

586
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,030
 It seems she is not interested in any kind of compromise.

587
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:54,310
I understand.

588
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:59,640
Then, could I receive the contact information for his father? Can you tell him I will call...

589
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,790
 I'm sorry, I can't tell you his contact information either.

590
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,230
 I'm really sorry about this.

591
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,130
Then when will the hearing take place?

592
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,140
This will be a big opportunity for Seoul Bank as well.

593
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,910
I understand. Go ahead and proceed.

594
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,990
Thank you.

595
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,540
It's alright, please take it.

596
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,490
Then please excuse me.

597
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,250
Yes, what's the matter?

598
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,840
 Dad, are you with Mom?

599
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,300
No, why?

600
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,440
 I wanted to ask Mom what happened.

601
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,920
What are you talking about?

602
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,350
 They are opening a hearing regarding school violence because of Mom.

603
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,120
President of Seoul Bank?

604
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,280
Got it.

605
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,930
What scam is this boy pulling?

606
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,380
May I meet with the CEO, by any chance?

607
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,210
- Do you have an appointment?
 - Actually, no.

608
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,200
Then you cannot meet her. You have to make an appointment.

609
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,930
But is she upstairs, in any case?

610
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,850
I cannot tell you.

611
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,920
Then what about Vice President Han Jae Hyeon?

612
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,600
It is the same for him as well. You cannot meet them without an appointment.

613
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,910
Oh, Yeong Min.
  (T/N: It's rural custom to call a mom by her first child's name)

614
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:36,120
What's going on?

615
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,360
You cannot do this here.

616
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,450
But this isn't about the protest. Please let me at least call them.

617
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,200
You cannot do this here, please come out right away.

618
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,400
No, it's not that...

619
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,930
- No...
 - Out, right now.

620
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,970
What are you doing?

621
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:53,220
I definitely told you to not do this again.

622
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,690
And why must I do that?

623
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:57,050
This isn't a big enough deal to ruin someone's life over.

624
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:02,300
Firing employees and suing them for disrupting business is easier for you than eating a meal.

625
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,450
Why would you care about anyone else's life?

626
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,660
He's just a child. He's only 14 years old.

627
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:14,000
You must have fired a truckload of heads of households who have children who are even younger.

628
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,900
I just want to follow official procedure.

629
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,920
I'm not trying to just punish the boy who touched my child.

630
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,560
Although, I can't say that is 100% true.

631
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,710
So, Yeong Min, please tell me why this happened.

632
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:42,460
It doesn't matter if they open a hearing regarding school violence.

633
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,250
Why doesn't it matter? You liked this school.

634
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,490
You said you liked the teachers and the lessons were fun.

635
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:54,390
Yeong Min, I do not think that you were really in the wrong.

636
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:58,470
I did that just because I was annoyed. Everything is annoying.

637
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:03,050
Just because? You can do that, just because?

638
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:08,820
I'll be in eighth grade soon. I'll be an eighth-grader.

639
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,890
They say this is how "eighth-grader disease" (puberty) is.

640
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,620
But how can you do that, even if you are almost in eighth grade?

641
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:19,150
But tomorrow is the day that Dad comes. What do we do?

642
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:54,500
 Mom

643
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,980
 Mom...

644
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,750
 Apartment Building #2

645
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,190
Where is Seo Kyeong?

646
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,790
Oh, she just left saying she will go to the school.

647
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,600
You have nothing to worry about.

648
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,820
I will make sure that nothing gets leaked.

649
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:29,290
Of course you should. To be honest, being rumored as the victim isn't a good thing, either.

650
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,900
Yeong Min's mother.

651
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,030
I request that you please give this one more thought.

652
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:04,730
- A child's future—
 - I am doing this for the sake of your child's future, ma'am.

653
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:09,300
Isn't it the duty of adults to correct the child when he does something wrong?

654
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,630
Having committed a crime, refusing to accept punishment and just getting past it,

655
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,600
that cannot be good for the child's education, can it?

656
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,590
And what about the way it looks to the other students as well?

657
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,300
If, by chance,

658
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:29,370
your intention to reopen the hearing is because someone touched your son—

659
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,760
What did you say?

660
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,370
Please take your anger out on me instead.

661
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:39,500
The crime of having raised my child badly lies with me.

662
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,380
So I will accept all your anger or insults, or whatever else.

663
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,610
Whatever else, you said?

664
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:57,050
Yes. Whatever else, all of it.

665
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,210
Then, give it a try, whatever it is.

666
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,140
Whatever it takes to quell my anger.

667
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,350
Please.

668
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:52,130
Just once, please show me your mercy.

669
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,450
Get up, please.

670
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,280
What are you doing right now?

671
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,490
Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!

672
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:52,290

673
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,400
 When My Love Blooms
 Preview

674
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,080
 I do think of the past.

675
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,950
 Ji Soo.

676
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:11,090
 It's been so long.

677
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,050
 Sleep well, Ji Soo.

678
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:21,580
 Just know that I will keep my eyes on that woman.

679
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,100
 So am I the only one being exempt?

680
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,050
 I just don't want you to get hurt.

681
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,980
 I don't want that.

682
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,440
 I want to protect you.
