1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,210
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,560
What brings you here?

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,650
I have something to give you.

5
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,830
Why did you bring a guitar?

6
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,080
I was supposed to buy one for you back then. I suddenly remembered that.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,380
You know that I won't accept it.

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,850
I know. I know it well, that you won't accept it.

9
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,540
But still, this is a promise from the past, so I thought maybe it would be okay for you to accept it.

10
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,880
But more than that, to be honest

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,260
it's because I wanted to see you.

12
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,090
 My child and Yeong Min are in the same class.

13
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,990
 Since his father is here, I'm going to leave.

14
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,520
 Han Jae Hyeon

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,600
 The meeting of an employee and the owner's only daughter, a drama-like love story

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,820
It's quite far to your house from the bus stop.
 Episode 6

17
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,640
It's okay. I even get some exercise.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,030
Is it okay for you to walk around like this? I thought someone was tailing you.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,850
I'm in disguise right now.

20
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,550
It doesn't look like you did anything.

21
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,450
I did.

22
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,890
Dong Jin and I are just like that. We're practically "dumb and dumber."

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,210
Is Sunbae Dong Jin doing well?

24
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,840
He is well. As off as ever, speaking bad English.

25
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,660
Movie Club. Classic Showings
 I'm telling you to go. 
  May, 1994

26
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,270
-  Why are you being like this? 
 - I told you to wear it.

27
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,350
I said I'm not going.

28
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,660
You crazy guy. Your girlfriend is on a blind date right now.

29
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,030
How can you demonstrate leisurely?

30
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,910
She just went as a substitute for her friend.

31
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,650
Does her forehead say that she's just subbing? Does someone not get picked because she's a substitute?

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,820
On top of that, are the guys just ordinary guys?

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,970
Are you fitter than them or richer than them?

34
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,430
- You have to wear this too.
- What is this?

35
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,700
It's something that's pretty.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,220
Am I the DJ of a ddeokbokki restaurant?

37
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,160
You tacky, country bumpkin kid. What would you know about fashion?

38
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,760
For a rock cafe like Space,

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,160
do you think you'll be able to get in with this old-style kiddy outfit?

40
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,070
Think about it. Raise this too.

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,500
Let's go. You look good. Don't worry.

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,280
 The Space Rock Cafe

43
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,460
You like basketball, right?

44
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,200
- Of course.
- I really like it.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,010
No.

46
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, what meaning can there be in basketball?

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,490
- Right?
 - Yeah.

48
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,090
I also don't like basketball that much.

49
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,100
I guess you don't like sports at all.

50
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,000
Because of your majors—

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,010
No, I like sports.

52
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,630
So you do like sports?

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,680
Then what sports do you like?

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,820
Student movements. 
 (Sports and movements are homonyms in Korean)

55
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
What is with you?

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
He says he has something to say.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,500
Say it loudly.

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,920
What do you have to say?

59
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,340
By chance, are you Ji Soo's boyfriend?

60
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,830
No, she's just someone I kno—

61
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,890
He's my husband.

62
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,690
Hey, you're the best, Yoon Ji Soo.

63
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,900
Let's go, Sister-in-law.

64
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,130
If I were to go back to the past, that's one of the top three moments that I want to change.

65
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,580
Because I walked through Sinchon, the school, and even to a Rock Cafe, looking like that.

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,310
It's the top three, but not I guess it's not number one.

67
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,590
Which moment is the number one moment?

68
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,940
Going to my first protest with a sunbae.

69
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,170
If it weren't for that day, I might not have become a student protester.

70
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,990
Do you regret protesting?

71
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,250
In the end, I couldn't change anything,

72
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,780
and while going around protesting, I couldn't even protect the things that were truly important to me.

73
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,200
 A moonmin (name of Roh Tae-woo administration, which "means" civilian though he was the protege of the previous authoritarian dictator) government

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,780
 that suppresses the labor movement needs to change its ways!

75
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,830
 Wake up! Wake up!

76
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,680
The freedom of protesting must be assured

77
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,980
and those who were arrested must be freed.

78
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,600
Free them! Free them!

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,890
A civilian government that suppresses labo–

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,430
  A civilian government that suppresses

81
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,120
  labor movement, needs to awaken!

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,850
  Wake up! Wake up!

83
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,270
  A civilian government that suppresses

84
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,760
  labor movement, needs to awaken!

85
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,310
  Abolish it! Abolish it!

86
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,020
  A civilian government that suppresses the labor movement ...

87
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,540
  Fire!

88
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
I won't worry.

89
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,510
The smart and kind you are doing this,

90
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,600
so it must be for something good.

91
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,730
But even if it isn't for good, that's okay.

92
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,460
Must children only do loving things to be loved?

93
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,550
On top of that,

94
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,720
you've never done any hateful or bad things not a single thing.

95
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm really okay.

96
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,810
Father.

97
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,920
You're back?

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,780
Why are you outside?

99
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,230
To go on a date with my son.

100
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,840
Protesting is not the same as what it used to be, so it's probably uglier.

101
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,170
To be honest, I...

102
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,530
wish you wouldn't at times.

103
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,690
You're doing something good, I know that very well.

104
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,600
But I wonder if the world will collapse just because my kid isn't partaking.

105
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,240
You're ashamed of me, right?

106
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,800
No, Father.

107
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,990
You remember everything from the past,

110
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,330
why don't you live like that?

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,830
I know right.

112
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,130
I have to return to a place that doesn't have guitars or protests.

113
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,190
Could we be together again?

114
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,450
Even if we're together again, we won't be able to smile together.

115
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm fighting against people like you.

116
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,230
 Mom, Dad found out about what happened at school.

117
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,140
 Missed calls - Lee Se Hoon (2)

118
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,410
 My son

119
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,520
 The person you are trying to call...

120
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,810
 Yeong Min, I'm sorry, I just saw your message.

121
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,380
 Can you call and let me know what happened?

122
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,540
 Even if we're together again, we won't be able to smile together.

123
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,630
 I'm fighting against people like you.

124
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,850
Why do you call?

125
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,110
I heard what happened. Don't even think of using this incident at school to your benefit.

126
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,260
It was just a simple accident and it's all taken care of now.

127
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,830
I know. I don't intend to use it.

128
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,010
I'm the kid's dad, not some lowlife.

129
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,310
My heart hurts wondering what led my son to do such a thing,

130
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,940
and I wonder how much more my son's mother must be hurting.

131
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,840
I know you don't mean it, but keep up the act until the end.

132
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,370
If you change your mind, I won't forgive you.

133
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,090
Though my words to you are kind, I don't receive kind words.

134
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,950
His car and clothes changed.

135
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,040
Looks like he's being followed.

136
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,630
  A restaurant part-timer?

137
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,570
Yes. The victim was a regular there, 
  Summer, 2004

138
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,310
but he regularly belittled the bereaved family. 
  Yoon Ji Soo - 2710

139
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,170
What did he say?

140
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,200
"Beggars" and "greedy for money."

141
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,350
So she poured the tray of food on the victim.

142
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,980
All it'll take is a settlement, but the victim insists on making her eat rice with beans, 
  (T/N: i.e. send her to prison)

143
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,230
and the woman keeps insisting she'll just go to jail.

144
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,090
  Gosh...

145
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,150
If you settle, you can even be cleared of all charges.

146
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,420
I will not settle.

147
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,650
If your intent is verified, you could receive a prison sentence.

148
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,730
This incident definitely does not warrant that.

149
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,030
It was neither accidental nor a mistake.

150
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,730
He belittled the incident, and mocked our bereaved family.

151
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,760
He showed no signs of remorse or apology.

152
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,510
I acted with clear intent.

153
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,950
I'm going to tell the world what that person did.

154
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,980
I understand. I will figure something out.

155
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,620
Here. 
  (T/N: tofu, customarily given to those out of prison)

156
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,810
Being on probation is different from a normal release.

157
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,270
There are many things to be cautious about.

158
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,240
If you cause a similar accident, then you'll really be imprisoned.

159
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,970
You will receive a heavier sentence as well.

160
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,720
It doesn't matter.

161
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,900
I knew you'd be like this.

162
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,650
If I leave you be, you'll do the same thing a hundred, no a thousand, times over.

163
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,370
I... I like you.

164
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,690
I'm not pressing you to do anything now.

165
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,710
I just know you're struggling a lot right now.

166
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,030
Your father is sick, and you don't have anyone to lean on—

167
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,350
I'll pretend like I didn't hear what you just said.

168
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,770
If even the person I am grateful to is gone, my life will become too dreary.

169
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,600
 Hyeong Seong Group's impending prosecutorial investigation, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon risking imprisonment.

170
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,160
Joon Seo must be quite big now.

171
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,560
Yes. He's quite big so he's quite good at not listening to me.

172
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,620
You were like that too.

173
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,550
Must your children do lovely things to be loved as such? No, you adore them because they're your children.

174
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,250
I have a long way to go to catch up to you.

175
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,440
About what?

176
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,240
Because he did things that weren't lovely, I didn't adore him.

177
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,530
Oh, goodness. Go ahead and eat.

178
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,700
This is totally broken.

179
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,220
What should I do? I can't do without a radio.

180
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,020
I have one at home, but that one's pretty old too. I don't know if it'll work.

181
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,860
It's fine, forget it then.

182
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,680
Mom, should I sing a song for you? One that you like.

183
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Na Hoon A? Jo Yong Pil? Lee Mi Ja?

184
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,470
In that case, what about the song you used to sing often?

185
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,370
'Because I Love You'? That one. 
  (T/N: Yoo Jae Ha, 1987)

186
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,670
♫ The day you left my side ♫

187
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,620
♫ the pink rays that I had embraced in my heart ♫

188
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:40,000
♫ those countless memories ♫

189
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,920
♫ faded into blue  ♫

190
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,660
♫  Yesterday, I hated myself   ♫

191
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:02,390
♫  for not being able to forget you who had left  ♫

192
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:11,530
♫  But now I realize  ♫

193
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,070
♫  I was only yours.  ♫

194
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:25,820
♫  For you, who returned to me  ♫

195
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:33,870
♫  I will give you my everything.   ♫

196
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:42,250
♫  For us to be like this forever,  ♫

197
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,940
♫ We shall not be apart ♫

198
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,920
Mom, this song is too sad.

199
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,990
What do you mean, sad?

200
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,550
It's saying to never be apart now, since they've met again.

201
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,420
That would be good, but it's not working out so easily.

202
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,310
Jae Hyeon, by chance, did you meet her?

203
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,780
Yes.

204
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,640
Is she doing well?

205
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,200
Not really.

206
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,770
Even if she looks pitiful and heartrending,

207
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,320
even so, you shouldn't do that.

208
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,960
I know.

209
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,620
I used one of my precious days off, and you bring me here again?

210
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,160
I can't say anything about it though, because it's heaven. 
  (Korean chain restaurant called 'Kimbap Heaven')

211
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,370
I have to eat quickly and head back in.

212
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,570
Say, have you been online today?

213
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,880
No, why?

214
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,150
Well... someone you know well is on the news.

215
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,600
 Search warrant for Hyeong Seong Group, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to be investigated by prosecution

216
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,480
When he became the son-in-law of a conglomerate, I thought he was a lucky guy.

217
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,170
But when I see things like this, I think nothing is for free.

218
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,440
I met him.

219
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,080
Who?

220
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,090
Sunbae Jae Hyeon.

221
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,990
Gosh, how?

222
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:51,210
At Yeong Min's school. I discovered his son is in the same class as Yeong Min.

223
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,180
So?

224
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,400
What, no way.

225
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,230
It's not that, right?

226
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,140
It's not something like, "let's start again," right?

227
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,850
You better hold firmly onto your consciousness.

228
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,490
Do you know who his father-in-law is?

229
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,700
Okay, say we put his father-in-law aside. Did that guy say he'll get a divorce and throw away all he has?

230
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,970
Fine, say he gets a divorce. What are you going to do about Yeong Min?

231
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,430
Is he going to leave his own son, who is the same age even, and live with someone else's son?

232
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,460
You're done eating, right? Let's go.

233
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,120
Even if I were going to eat more, I can't. I lost my appetite.

234
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,570
Hye Jeong.

235
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,160
Don't worry.

236
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,360
How can I not worry?

237
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,720
I won't ever go toward the path where I'll get hurt.

238
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,690
Okay, if you think you're going to get hurt, claw at them with your hands first.

239
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,280
That way the other person can't hurt you.

240
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,500
Try it. Practice right now. Like this.

241
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,450
I have to grow out my fingernails first.

242
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,910
Should I tell you a place that's great for nail manicure?

243
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,900
- Yes, Chairman.
 - Where are you?

244
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,810
I'm at my mother's house.

245
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,810
- I told Seo Kyeong to go to the villa.
 - Okay.

246
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,490
This is the first time she's dealing with something like this, so she might not know what to do.

247
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,300
You go and get her prepared.

248
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,220
I understand.

249
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,970
 Search warrant for Hyeong Seong Group, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to be investigated by prosecution

250
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,830
Wait a moment.

251
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,810
Yes, Ji Soo. The chief prosecutor is consistently clear-headed today.

252
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,120
You don't have to worry. He ate well too.

253
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,910
Yes.

254
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,120
He's been working as the chief host of the student union since the last fall semester. 
 February 1995

255
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,020
He is quite active, as his faction finally entered the student union after four years.

256
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,580
He is also the president of a philosophy circle called "Philosophy of Solidarity."

257
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,870
I think that is where they educate other students about their ideology and recruit members as well.

258
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,220
Miss Ji Soo has also joined.

259
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,560
What about his family situation?

260
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,010
His father works at a steel company in Incheon.

261
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,880
But I am told he is one of the militant labor union members.

262
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,900
Starting from his family tree, he's not ordinary at all.

263
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,630
His mother is running a small fish stall in the market.

264
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,250
He's the son of typical urban poor family, but he's a case of a dragon born in a brook. 
  (T/N: a great person from humble upbringing)

265
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,050
Ji Soo is caught up with a highly virulent guy.

266
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,810
But that student isn't the virulent type.

267
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,130
Rather, he gives off a gentle and soft feelin—

268
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,520
That's why it'll be harder to take him off of her.

269
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,920
There's a power that the good-hearted ones have.

270
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,240
Hyung Jae Hyeon, something bad happened.

271
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,680
What bad thing again?

272
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,550
The engineering kids came out yesterday, but they said there was Jae Hyeon's name.

273
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,840
Where?

274
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,630
On the wanted list.

275
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,770
What is he wanted for all of a sudden? This guy hasn't done anything these days.

276
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,040
Creation of an anti government group.

277
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,320
Bullshit.

278
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,710
Hey, did you form any new groups?

279
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,530
Then what is it?

280
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,690
It can't be the student union. Could it be the philosophy group?

281
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,280
Dammit. Then won't we get dragged along too?

282
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,840
But why would they suddenly do this?

283
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,830
Now that they've caught the student union, they must be checking everything.

284
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,690
They might be snooping into past groups as well.

285
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,540
Is it not here?

286
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,440
I guess not.

287
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,590
The judicial exam? You, Sunbae?

288
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,890
It doesn't suit me, right?

289
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,690
It's not that, but I thought you had no thoughts of doing it.

290
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,410
I have to make a living.

291
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,790
Can't you do it in Seoul? Like in a gosiwon. 
   (T/N: cheap room typically for people preparing for a state examination.)

292
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,730
I don't have money, and I want to try being in a place without a TV or a PC.

293
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,960
Then, what about me? Can't I go with you there?

294
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,810
There won't even be a melodica, not to mention a piano.

295
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,490
That's okay. I'll be by your side to cook and do your laundry.

296
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,370
Why would you use those talented hands to cook meals for a guy like me?

297
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,870
It's not as if I'm fighting for the independence of our nation.

298
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,420
Then I'll go there every week.

299
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,510
You'll be in the way.

300
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,910
I'll just go with you now.

301
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,580
I'll contact you when everything is a bit settled, for both me and my surroundings.

302
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,060
No matter how remote of a mountain valley it is, wouldn't the radio work?

303
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,190
I told you I'm going to study.

304
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,490
How can a person only study?

305
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,840
Listen to it when you're taking a break. You can listen to the radio playing the movie soundtracks that you like.

306
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,890
Hey, you wanted criminal!

307
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,350
Sorry?

308
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,390
How did you know I'm wanted?

309
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,440
The punks that come here are either students preparing for the exam or wanted guys.

310
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,640
Your facial composite look is just like that of a wanted criminal.

311
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,110
- What is it? I guess well, don't I? 
 - Yes.

312
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,430
For your information, I don't like wanted criminals.

313
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,730
You have no money, and when I see you get arrested later on,

314
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,560
it just puts my mind in turmoil.

315
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,620
So, the second I feel something is off with you, I'm going to call 112 right away.

316
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,840
Got it?

317
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,210
Yes.

318
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,440
 Hyeong Seong Holdings Main Stakeholder List

319
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,540
What's happening with the company now?

320
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,910
What is Jae Hyeon doing these days? They say he isn't going to the office.

321
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,780
He said he's going on vacation to clear his mind before the prosecution investigation.

322
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,930
Did he say that?

323
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,300
Why? Is he not doing that?

324
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,380
I told you...

325
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,550
everything I inherited from your grandfather,

326
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,600
I put all of it under borrowed names, right?

327
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,370
Someone must've leaked that information,

328
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,530
because prosecutors and the press keep digging around for it.

329
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,410
I temporarily put it under Jae Hyeon's name

330
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,490
and told him I'd give it to you when things get quiet.

331
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,950
But I think he has different thoughts about it.

332
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,740
Why would he?

333
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,010
How much do you believe in Jae Hyeon?

334
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,920
How can I live if I don't believe him?

335
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,210
I also thought that he was a puppy that listened well

336
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,680
and even acted cute once in a while.

337
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,150
But it seems like he's done a lot of preparation for a long time.

338
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,210
What preparation?

339
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,370
Preparation to swallow the company whole.

340
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,990
Everyone he's meeting these days, they're all shareholders.

341
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,860
He's meeting shareholders to win them over into being his white knights and shore up his side.

342
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,350
And I think he's the one who leaked the borrowed-name shares to the press.

343
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,700
We need to make him take responsibility for the things he did.

344
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,790
I know well that Jae Hyeon is the only one for you.

345
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,670
But starting now, start letting him go, bit by bit.

346
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll be going now.

347
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,660
Yeong Min, if something happens again, let me know.

348
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,170
Dad is a lot stronger than Mom.

349
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,990
Okay?

350
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,850
Hi, Mom.

351
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,340
I'm about to go to class.

352
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,080
Dad left.

353
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,950
Yeong Min, if something happens, you have to tell me first okay?

354
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,920
Dad just said the same thing to me, to tell him first.

355
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,370
Just do as you want. If you want to tell me, tell me.

356
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,030
If you want to tell Dad, tell him. If you don't want to tell anyone, then don't.

357
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,760
Well, actually you shouldn't do that...

358
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

359
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,010
Here, try some.

360
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,240
Enjoying coffee outdoors. It's a kind of small luxury.

361
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,300
- It's quite good. 
 - Right?

362
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,310
Do you happen to know who that is?

363
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,950
- Why? 
 - He keeps following us.

364
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,380
Do you think the Chairman is tailing us?

365
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,770
Probably.

366
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,170
Won't he try to take back all the people we've been trying to win over?

367
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,530
It'll be a long battle anyway.

368
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,420
You were still alive. I'm proud of you.

369
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,210
March, 1995.

370
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,220
You have a small face and you're unbelievably cute.

371
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,170
You're just like my Ji Soo.

372
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,180
Jae Hyeon!

373
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,820
How is it here?

374
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,410
I like watching the flowers. I hike so well now, I was nicknamed the 'flying squirrel.'

375
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,160
The monk that watches over me is a comedian.

376
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,470
Quit lying. I know you feel stuffy being here.

377
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,360
How did you know?

378
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,460
The school feels empty without you. The number of people who come out to protest plummeted.

379
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,870
That's embarrassing.

380
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,130
The age of blue blades have passed,

381
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,090
but I'm still running away like some criminal. 
  (Korean saying meaning something dangerous - describes poison on a blade)

382
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,840
The blade is still blue, they're just more discreet about it now.

383
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,750
How long do you think I'll have to stay here? Until I'm not on the wanted list?

384
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,750
If I stay on that list forever, will I shave my head and become a monk?

385
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,820
Just endure a bit longer.

386
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,780
If you collapse, all the weaker ones will run away.

387
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,880
You know, Hwa Jin.

388
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,620
Right now,

389
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:50,110
I don't know when to get off the bike or where to go,

390
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,260
so I'm just pedaling with all my strength.

391
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,290
Because I don't want to fall down.

392
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,280
We'll be going.

393
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,910
Yeah.

394
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,360
There's a pay phone near the entrance.

395
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,910
I just bought it, so there's a lot of money on it.

396
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,270
Thanks.

397
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,760
Call Ji Soo.

398
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,010
Do you know what Jae Hyeon's been doing?

399
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,610
Don't you know? He went to study for the bar exam.

400
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,680
Where did he go?

401
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,060
A monastery in the mountains.

402
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,250
At least that part is the truth.

403
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,320
If he knew I told you, he'd get so angry.

404
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,110
He's on the run right now.

405
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,770
Why?

406
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,160
He got put on the wanted list recently.

407
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,380
- Why? 
 - What do you mean, why? He did something wrong.

408
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,390
What did he do that's wrong?

409
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,700
Creation of an anti-government group.

410
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,090
But Ji Soo, it's weird no matter how I look at it.

411
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,890
He's not the one who created the philosophy group.

412
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,310
Sure, he made the movie group, but it's not that type of group at all.

413
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:41,580
And the student union is totally legal, so they can't arrest him for that...

414
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:48,240
You're telling me this for a reason, right?

415
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,990
You really are smart.

416
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,640
I'm hoping that's not it, but your father does have that kind of job.

417
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,220
You did it, right?

418
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,890
Putting Jae Hyeon on the wanted list.

419
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,320
He didn't do anything that warrants an arrest.

420
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,930
What do I have to do?

421
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,220
It's called an 'opportunity cost.'

422
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,190
You can't have everything in life.

423
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,460
If you choose one, you must give up another.

424
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,260
Make the right decision.

425
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,310
You can do what you want to do most

426
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,340
or avoid what you fear the most.

427
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,340
If you promise to not meet Han Jae Hyeon again,

428
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,190
I will release him from the wanted list.

429
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,760
If you keep meeting him, I will arrest him

430
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,880
and make him rot in the cells for years.

431
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,500
You can live while taking care of him in prison.

432
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,990
Not as Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter Yoon Ji Soo, but as Han Jae Hyeon's woman Yoon Ji Soo.

433
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,790
Instead of grasping onto both like a greedy young child and crying out of pity for yourself,

434
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,460
give up one or the other!

435
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:35,770
Give up Han Jae Hyeon, or give up being Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter!

436
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,500
 "Ride the bike. You're going down your own path now."

437
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,420
 This is the last line in the movie 'Running on Empty.'

438
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,450
 At times, like that father. At times, like River Phoenix, the son.

439
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:43,030
 "I want to send these words to my lover, who is struggling alone.'

440
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,990
 "I want to tell Sunbae to go down his own path now."

441
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,590
 One of our listeners sent us this story.

442
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,730
 The song they requested is 'Goodbye' by Kim Chang Wan.

443
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,460
♫  Goodbye, my cute friend.   ♫

444
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:16,420
♫  When you hear the ship's horn from faraway,  ♫

445
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:24,870
♫  will you for me, without anyone knowing  ♫

446
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:30,940
♫  in the room alone, while everyone else sleeps.  ♫

447
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:38,650
♫  Goodbye, my small love.  ♫

448
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:46,430
♫  When the stars twinkle from far away,  ♫

449
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:55,140
♫  you should say, so no one can hear you  ♫

450
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,190
♫  that you went far away, as you cry  ♫

451
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,830
A client gave it to us, but there isn't anyone who will ride a woman's bicycle.

452
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,020
I don't believe that.

453
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,320
I also said that you definitely wouldn't believe it.

454
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,270
But he just loaded it in the car and pounded it, telling me to go.

455
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,300
He said that you always drop things when you go grocery shopping, so you should put them into the basket.

456
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,390
And if you keep carrying heavy things, it's not good for your hands.

457
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,520
Please take it away.

458
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,620
This can't be refunded, and if I take it back, I'm going to be fired for sure.

459
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,860
It's hard to find jobs these days. Just think of it as doing a good deed and accept it.

460
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,050
And you know that it's a waste of money if you don't use it, right?

461
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,620
 I'm Yoon Ji Soo's ex-husband, Lee Se Hoon.

462
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,320
 I have something to discuss with you. Can we meet?

463
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,300
Why did you send this to me?

464
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,230
If you're trying to get money, you should have sent it to my husband.

465
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,020
Although, I don't know if such a scenic photo will work as a threat.

466
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,040
I'm not here to threaten you. I'm here to ask for your cooperation.

467
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,250
I must seem easy since we've been all over the news.

468
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,760
Cows and dogs are trying to barge in.

469
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,100
It's not because you seem easy.

470
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,380
I'm here because it appears that we have the same goal.

471
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,520
I hate it when people beat around the bush.

472
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,580
I heard you put a tail on your husband.

473
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,850
So?

474
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:52,230
I want to get my wife back, and you want to get your husband back.

475
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,110
Isn't that right?

476
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,360
 He said that you always drop things when you go grocery shopping, so you should put them into the basket.

477
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,260
 And if you keep carrying heavy things, it's not good for your hands.

478
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,730
 Seoul Central District Court

479
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,920
 Special Delivery

480
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,810
 Child Custody Return Notice

481
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,510
I thought you wouldn't use the school incident.

482
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,980
I changed my mind.

483
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,140
You do this and still insist you aren't a lowlife?

484
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,570
He had thoughts of dying, and what did you do about it?

485
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,500
When that innocent child picked up and threw a chair, there was obviously something wrong.

486
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,960
Did you bow your head and kneel in front of them without finding out the cause?

487
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,910
Did you want to move on from it because it was your old lover's son?

488
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,390
Does someone who left their child alone in a rural area to enjoy romance in Seoul

489
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,130
have the right to raise a child?

490
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,610
Isn't it your greed to keep both child custody and love?

491
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,890
Give up your custody. I'm being considerate of you.

492
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,530
It'll be hard since he's married, but try and do well with him.

493
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,900
Whether I date, get married, or die alone, I will raise Yeong Min.

494
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,400
I won't leave him to grow up as a monster under your care.

495
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,920
Then, let's fight properly.

496
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,720
What's so serious that you can't even have a drink?

497
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,020
- Ji Soo.
 - You graduated from law school, right?

498
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,480
Do you know any lawyers?

499
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,430
You're not going to tell me what it's about?

500
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,140
I received a notice for return of child custody from Yeong Min's dad.

501
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,680
All of a sudden? Why? What's his reasoning?

502
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,530
Yeong Min's school violence issue.

503
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,540
Is he saying you don't have the right to custody because the kids fought a bit?

504
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,860
Even though I didn't really study law, I do know the basics.

505
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,530
No matter how good the lawyer is, you'll win that case.

506
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,120
He's saying I'm committing adultery.

507
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,050
You—

508
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,730
Is it Jae Hyeon, by any chance?

509
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,060
No way, there's no way it's true.

510
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,890
There's some sort of misunderstanding, right?

511
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,900
He has a picture of us together.

512
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:59,860
But Yeong Woo, if having my heart shaken is adultery,

513
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,320
then I can't say it's not true.

514
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,420
 Sunbae Jae Hyeon

515
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:48,020
Why did you want to do something like this?

516
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,140
I saw it on TV and it looked fun.

517
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,080
You leave a house as big as a whale and sleep in a tent the size of a booger?

518
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,730
Also, do you call this food?

519
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,690
It's better than anything from a 5-star hotel.

520
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,160
Why are you being like this?

521
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,770
I feel bad about him always playing by himself.

522
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,860
- Dad.
 - Yeah?

523
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,670
This is burning. Flip it, quickly!

524
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,730
It burned a lot.

525
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,960
- Will we be able to eat it?
 - Of course.

526
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,990
If you use what I give you in a different way, I won't stay still.

527
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,410
Of course.

528
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:54,260
I'm only thinking of using it for our mutual goal.

529
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,560
You can consider it camaraderie or say that misery loves company.

530
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,260
It seems like both you and I are in pitiful love.

531
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,580
Everything we're doing is out of love, in a way.

532
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,700
You're funny.

533
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,160
You think what you're doing is out of love?

534
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,760
It doesn't seem that way to me at all.

535
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,000
I've been keeping tabs with the news that involves you,

536
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,350
on the internet and the news.

537
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:41,650
I'm pretty sure there wasn't anything positive, but how are things with you?

538
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:46,280
I quit the company and set up an LP bar.

539
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,500
That's quite romantic.

540
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,940
Well, I don't have a family, so it's just something to pay the bills.

541
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,650
You didn't marry?

542
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,880
Is there a specific reason why?

543
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,820
Things just happened that way.

544
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:10,600
It's been a while since we met, but I'm only saying stuff that make you uncomfortable.

545
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,060
Now it's my turn to say something uncomfortable.

546
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,570
I was the one who did it that time.

547
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,900
Reporting you to the police, on April Fool's Day.

548
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,100
1995, March 31st

549
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,930
Thanks.

550
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,050
But, will you be okay? I saw a lot of police there.

551
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,260
That's why I'll be taking the road.

552
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,830
But, where are you going?

553
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,720
To Ji Soo.

554
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:58,040
 Ji Soo was having such a hard time going between you and her father

555
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,640
 but you looked so carefree.

556
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,880
Even so, Ji Soo never thought about herself and always thought about you.

557
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,940
I got angry and jealous.

558
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,360
So why are you telling me all this now?

559
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,740
I want to be more upfront with you.

560
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,100
That way I can criticize you, and ask you for favors, too.

561
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,030
I already knew that you were the one who reported to the police, Yeong Woo.

562
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,460
So you don't have to be sorry. Just say it.

563
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,650
How are you feeling today?

564
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,470
Would you like to criticize me or ask something of me?

565
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,770
Both.

566
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,730
Give up on the custody battle.

567
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,720
Legal action hasn't been taken yet.

568
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,240
If you don't give up, Han Jae Hyeon will take a big fall.

569
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,590
Open it, it'll be interesting.

570
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:45,190
If you give up custody, this video will disappear from the world.

571
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,910
If you don't give up custody,

572
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:53,890
while Han Jae Hyeon is being investigated by the prosecutors, this video will be released to the world.

573
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,180
 Running On Empty

574
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,270
Don't get off the bike, Sunbae.

575
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,400
I'm not going to see you anymore.

576
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,120
I know now, that you didn't go to study for the bar exam.

577
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,510
I'm sorry for lying.

578
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,190
Whether you lied or not, this isn't going to work.

579
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:07,170
There's no way my dad will accept a protester and wanted person.

580
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:12,690
- Ji Soo.
- To be honest, I can't handle it either.

581
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,920
Sunbae,

582
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,900
you go on your path.

583
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,290
I will go on my own path.

584
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,500
 I met you on the day the flowers bloomed.

585
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,780
 And we separated on the day the flowers wilted.

586
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,860
 That meeting wasn't the first meeting.

587
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,280
 That separation isn't the first separation.

588
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,350
 March 31, 1995. FM Movies and Music

589
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,850
 This is the final broadcast.

590
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,820
 I should give my greetings now.

591
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,670
 My final greeting will be a song from the movie, 'Happiness Does Not Come In Grades.'

592
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:21,150
 It is 'Goodbye' by Kim Chang Wan.

593
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,300
 Then, goodbye to our avid listeners.

594
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,310
 Up until now, it has been Yoo Jeong Hwa.

595
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,280
 April 1, 1995

596
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,090
 Prosecution Service

597
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,210
 Do you acknowledge all charges?

598
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,110
I guess you thought really hard about it, seeing how your face is sunken.

599
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,600
After that day, I kept thinking about it.

600
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,480
About why you are being like this.

601
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:54,570
You were someone who had extramarital affairs before Yeong Min even learned how to walk.

602
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,550
You also gave up custody without a second thought in court.

603
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,290
Why are you suddenly talking about the right to custody?

604
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:11,960
If you suddenly developed a love for your son after giving way a hundred times,

605
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,150
then you would have brought up my affair and incompetence in court to win.

606
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,190
But why is the effort to get your son back

607
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:23,200
less than the effort to ruin the person I'm having an affair with?

608
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:30,730
How could custody over your child and the man Han Jae Hyeon be put on the same level?

609
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,990
Did you find the answer to that?

610
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,080
There's something my dad told me 25 years ago.

611
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,690
About opportunity cost.

612
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:50,000
If you choose one, you have to give up the other one.

613
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:57,710
Either you pick what you want to do most, or you avoid what you fear the most.

614
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,740
Give up one for the other.

615
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,610
So?

616
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,480
I...

617
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,470
decided to avoid what I fear the most.

618
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,060
Back then and now,

619
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,570
the thing I'm most afraid of

620
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,630
is that person getting ruined because of me.

621
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,800
Whether my choice is right or wrong,

622
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,000
I will go back to you.

623
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:59,490

624
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:05,150
♫  Just bury them in your heart  ♫

625
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:12,160
♫  Words you wanted to say  ♫

626
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,920
♫  That we called love  ♫

627
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,160
 When My Love Blooms

628
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,980
 I wanted to protect him.

629
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:28,520
 If you don't give up Ji Soo, you will rot in prison for several years.

630
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,700
 Why did you make that decision?

631
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,260
 Even though so much time has passed, I think the reason why  we're still feeling sorry and longing for each other

632
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,620
 is because we never broke up properly.

633
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,360
 You're going to lose everything you have.

634
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,300
