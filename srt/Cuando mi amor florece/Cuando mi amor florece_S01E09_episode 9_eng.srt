1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:08,960

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,980
 When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower

3
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,060
The Leon you planted was still there.

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,540
Someone kept looking after it I guess.

5
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,620
That's fascinating. How can that be?

6
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,030
Actually that's not Leon.

7
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,990
Right?

8
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,860
No wonder.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,830
I planted it recently.

10
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,100
Deliberately, at this place.

11
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,940
I had forgotten what this place was.

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,730
Because it is an asylum,

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,440
where the world's eyes and feet cannot touch...

14
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,760
So, for just a moment...

15
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,220
I was afraid to be held back by the days of the past,

16
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,610
so I walked diligently forward without ever looking back.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,690
But once I stopped, this is where I was.

18
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:31,030
Perhaps I walked all those years, to reach this place.

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,250
Now, my legs hurt,

20
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,290
so for today, I'll just stay here.

21
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,860
If it's here

22
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,750
we'll be okay.

23
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,060
 Episode 9

24
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm going to head back.

25
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,200
Good night Ji Soo.

26
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,440
Go safely.

27
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,740
Would you like to eat ramyeon before leaving?

28
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,410
You don't eat ramyeon anymore?

29
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,770
Well, not often.

30
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,100
As expected, those higher-ups from that neighborhood don't eat it.

31
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,920
I guess the ramyeon you would've eaten for a lifetime is now halved.

32
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,250
Is that how it is?

33
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,860
Are you going to leave some?

34
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,230
Huh? No.

35
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,310
Since we ate ramyeon and drank coffee at a convenience store,

36
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,050
it's like we went on a date just like young kids nowadays.

37
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,680
If we were to speak like them, is today our "day 1" (first day of dating)?

38
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,970
We... might get stoned.

39
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,990
I'm not afraid of getting stoned

40
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,030
but if we get stoned, there are those who will also get stoned with us.

41
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,930
I can take all the hits.

42
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,770
You're not some kind of Iron Man, Sunbae.

43
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,390
How can you endure with all those hits?

44
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,290
I can. Because you are here.

45
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,580
You are my Iron Man suit.

46
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,510
If I'm that suit, doesn't that mean I get all those hits, too?

47
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,950
Is that how it is?

48
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,000
About 20% of the time, he is completely lucid.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,430
About 50% of the time he is a patient and gentle elder.

50
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,590
The rest, well, he doesn't even have the strength to talk and is a sick senior.

51
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,330
It must be hard on you.

52
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,920
The person who first taught me piano was my father. "The Island Baby."

53
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Did your father also play piano?

54
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,010
Only one hand. Tinker tinker.

55
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,630
While living I never understood my father. Now I do somewhat.

56
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,520
He lived as a tiger for 50 years and now he's become a kitten.

57
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,150
He must be so astounded when he becomes clear of mind every so often.

58
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,810
So, that's why he probably throws things at me and shouts at me. I understand a bit why.

59
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,650
Though I understand, I don't just take it

60
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,920
because I also get mad, too.

61
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,320
Listening to old songs on the radio is her sole hobby.

62
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,910
Your mother was also a beauty.

63
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,670
Last time, because the radio was broken, I sang to her directly.

64
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,720
- Really?
 - Yeah

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,530
Which song did you sing?

66
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,900
"Because I Love You" (singer Yoo Jae-ha).

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,260
How did it go? Did you do well?

68
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,240
Not really. I just sang it ignoring all the pitch and rhythm etc.

69
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,490
Sing for me too.

70
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,340
I can't sing.

71
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,570
Lies. I know that you sing well, Sunbae.

72
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,860
In the past I did, but I forgot.

73
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,220
Really?

74
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,890
Yeah.

75
00:07:51,020 --> 00:08:00,500
♫  Spring blossoming in our hearts  ♫

76
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:07,130
♫  My trembling heart waiting for you  ♫

77
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,000
♫  Our fluttering gazes  ♫

78
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,180
♫  The ticklish whispers of summer emotions  ♫

79
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,910
My head was heavy right?

80
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,530
It was light.

81
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,060
That's not a compliment you know.

82
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,000
Hurry inside.

83
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,450
I really will now.

84
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:52,760
♫  Our hearts are colored with autumn  ♫

85
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,890
♫  With your smile that is like a cool breeze  ♫

86
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:09,450
♫  And those facial expressions I'm seeing for the first time  ♫

87
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:21,970
♫  In unfamiliar scenery not yet lived  ♫

88
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,060
♫  I’ve never faced such beauty  ♫

89
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,580
♫  I had thought such beauty would never exist again  ♫

90
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:42,090
♫  our season, now  ♫

91
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,160
Who is it?

92
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,400
It's me Secretary Kang.

93
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,320
What is it?

94
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,340
There.

95
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Oh here.

96
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,600
- This is right, right? 
- Yes it is.

97
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,850
This door lock has the best specs in existence.

98
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,310
Bio-identification, Indestructible, Motion-sensing. Directional. Waterproof. Circuit-breaker proof.

99
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,620
Even if all the burglars and the strongest ones came as a huge gang, they wouldn't be able to open it.

100
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
Yeah, Ji Soo.

101
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,010
The people who are here won't listen.

102
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,770
You tell them, Sunbae to leave.

103
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,920
Until the police come to drag them away, they won't go those people.

104
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,780
Sunbae

105
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,390
It's all because of me, not you.

106
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,800
Because I want to sleep soundly with my legs stretched out.

107
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,670
Now if you're to stay up nights, you need to be sure to eat a lot of good things.

108
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,240
You find me objectionable don't you?

109
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,110
Pardon?

110
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,030
It's not work-related, nor family-related.

111
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,710
And all the things others would point fingers at, those are the things I keep having you do.

112
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,990
Oh, that.

113
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,170
Your body must be tired and your heart must be uncomfortable as well.

114
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,830
Of all the people in the Republic of Korea, I am probably number one for knowing how you've lived, Vice President.

115
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,220
Not Ms. Yoon Ji Soo, not Madame, not Chairman,

116
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,580
but I am the one who knows the most about how you've lived, sir.

117
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,920
I am on your side, sir. I don't ask questions or quibble.

118
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,040
Wow. You've grown a lot!

119
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,010
I am on the tall side, but because I hang around with you.

120
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,270
You know how to kid around, too.

121
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,070
My apologies.

122
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,930
Thanks.

123
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,350
 Care Center

124
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,290
It's "The Island Baby."

125
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,390
My kid was good at piano.
  All Things Care Facility Family Day.

126
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,880
What did you say, Dad?

127
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,480
My child was good at playing the piano, ma'am.

128
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,320
Good day?

129
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,020
Hello.

130
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,590
What's that?

131
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,980
I didn't think it would fit inside your home.

132
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,340
I also knew you definitely not accept it, so that's why I donated it here.

133
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,250
I said that it would also help the patients, so the director agreed.

134
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,780
I took all of my non-existing imagination to come up with this. So isn't it great?

135
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,120
No, it's not. It's not like it costs a few farthings.

136
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
I said to let anyone come and play.

137
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,950
I said that, but I still hoped you'd be the only one playing the whole time.

138
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,920
Have a go. Father's memory might come back.

139
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,290
Hey, by the way, are you under investigation with detention or without?

140
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,780
I wouldn't know.

141
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,960
What are we doing? Laying down the rhymes? You wanna have a go with me, right?

142
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,380
Oh. Oh. Arrest and now that even being cornered isn't enough.

143
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,730
You even got sued for an incident from five years ago.

144
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,550
Can you be so free man? Yeah? Ho.

145
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,150
What are you doing? Huh? Geez.

146
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,740
Ah. I see you don't know this.

147
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,270
Yeah. If I don't know should I pray? That I don't get detained?

148
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,370
Well, if you were in your right mind right now, that would mean you were still crazy.

149
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,820
I'm doing really well nowadays.

150
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,930
Look at this crazy guy.

151
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,690
Look. He's crazed. Look.

152
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,440
- Hey. 
 - What?

153
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,570
When do you get off work?

154
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,290
You wanna drink?

155
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,690
Then let's flex now.

156
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,980
The soundproofing here is good, right?

157
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,860
Soundproofing? Why are you asking?

158
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,820
Hey, let me use this room at night.

159
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,340
Wait. Hold up.

160
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,440
So at night, soundproofing?

161
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,390
You with Ji Soo?!

162
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,400
Whoa. Your imagination is incredible.

163
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,070
- The problem is that it's towards the gutter.
 - Yo yo yo yo my man.

164
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,740
Hey be honest. Then I'll let you borrow it, kid.

165
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,010
What did you say? Geez.

166
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,140
Emergency Medical Services 119

167
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,720
Can you make some time for me in the evening?

168
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:33,190
♫   At night when the stars swim, I hear your voice   ♫

169
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:41,870
♫   I want to turn into pollen that breaks away   ♫

170
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:49,680
♫   And lands on your flower   ♫

171
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,360
♫   If you were to leave my side   ♫

172
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,270
♫   I would follow you to the ends, the very ends my love  ♫

173
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:15,700
♫   Come stay in my arms   ♫

174
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:24,530
♫   Let's share a dream of love   ♫

175
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,480
Ji Soo

176
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,060
I will go back to you

177
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,900
I won't stop nor turn back.

178
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,570
During these past few days and now today,

179
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,810
I felt like I had become some protagonist in a movie.

180
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,920
Amongst those days, today was the best scene.

181
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,000
However, as I keep walking alongside you Sunbae, my footsteps grow heavy.

182
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,260
The things I had learned from you Sunbae, I cherished in my heart,

183
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,180
just in case I ran into you so that I wouldn't be ashamed.

184
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,480
For you, and towards anyone, I will walk a path without any shame.

185
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,120
I won't deceive anyone anymore.

186
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,710
I have some things to organize which is why it might take some time,

187
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,000
but I will return to you.

188
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,410
Deputy Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol

189
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,670
The sun just rose and everyone is so busy.

190
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,160
- Let's start.
 - Yes.

191
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,490
That kid Jae Hyeon, to what extent does he plan on increasing the stakes?

192
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,350
According to the Deputy Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol, Kang Seung Ho,

193
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,780
under the auspices of Real Name Financial Law, violation of both Free Market Laws and Payment of National Taxes

194
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,750
is what the warrant was issued under.

195
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,830
Aside from the borrowed-name accounts,

196
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,300
even the slush funds are probably...

197
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,350
Wait. How did that kid know even about that?

198
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,610
I believe he was preparing since his time at the planning and development board.

199
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,680
That's why at that time I had wanted him to--!!

200
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,150
If it weren't for Seo Kyeong, I would have

201
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,570
It is certain that the one who leaked the borrowed-name accounts to the press is him,

202
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,980
though I told him to go to jail.

203
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,680
Yet that he prepared to pay taxes

204
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,590
means he intends on swallowing those shares.

205
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm sorry.

206
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,560
The best attack is the best defense.

207
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,740
A fight means to win by taking down the opponent.

208
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,210
Enduring and holding on is not how it's won.

209
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,230
Find a fighting ring,

210
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,440
one not where he lies in wait, but

211
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,950
one where we can summon him.

212
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,700
There is a place that he puts in a lot of effort.

213
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,580
 Days of Being Wild

214
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,300
Because you watch  Love Letter  or only this movie,

215
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,690
I watched it once.

216
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,060
But it wasn't fun.  Days of Being Wild.

217
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,940
So I plan on getting rid of this room.

218
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,420
Whether it will be a dressing room or a wine bar, I'm debating.

219
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,350
I think it's because you keep reminiscing down memory lane here that we've become the way we have.

220
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,070
Since before I met Ji Soo,

221
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,750
our marriage was over.

222
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,850
I was indifferent and you met another man.

223
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,480
When my fight with Father-in-Law finishes,

224
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,550
only one person will pay the price.

225
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,840
Whether it be me or Father,

226
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,270
it'll be hard for you to endure.

227
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,080
It's all in the past. Must you go this far?

228
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,380
Being thrown away after being used is an order that was already planned for a human like me.

229
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,730
No part anywhere in this fight is your responsibility.

230
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,210
Yet you will get hurt.

231
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,480
So what is the best thing I can do for you,

232
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,220
I'm ruminating on it.

233
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,800
There's only one thing I want.

234
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,060
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can divorce you. 
 (In Korea, both parties must agree to a divorce.)

235
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,070
I am crying like this, so that woman must also.

236
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,650
If if I don't have love, she shouldn't have any.

237
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,400
It might seem monstrous,

238
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,330
but my love is still love, too.

239
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,380
You are Ms. Yoon Ji Soo, right?

240
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,260
What is it?

241
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,270
Could you give me some time?

242
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,430
Our chairman hopes to meet with you.

243
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,460
Chairman?

244
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,480
You look very much alike

245
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,950
What are you talking about?

246
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:05,210
Prosecutor General Yoon Hyeong Goo's only remaining child

247
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,600
his dearest child.

248
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:17,320
The world is quite small, Ms. Yoon Ji Soo.

249
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,640
Have you ever heard about me from your father?

250
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,820
Before that incident, we were in a relationship without barriers.

251
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
Did you know your father wanted to get into politics?

252
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,860
Politicians need money, and a corporation needs the networking relations of the prosecutor's office,

253
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:44,350
so we often hung out, drank, and went golfing.

254
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,930
His daughter went to Seoul National University, so he was always so proud.

255
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,170
Is that you, Ji Soo?

256
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,580
I don't think you called me to reminisce about old times.

257
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,780
You might misunderstand because I'm smiling as I speak,

258
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,330
but I'm not a face that always smiles.

259
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,980
If it weren't for that incident, he would have been great at politics,

260
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,340
becoming a national assemblyman and even prime minister.

261
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,610
But why is that such a respected person's daughter is seeing my son-in-law?

262
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,160
Do you perhaps need money?

263
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,780
Then tell me. Because of my relationship with your father,

264
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,980
I can give you some, with no strings attached.

265
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,250
I told even my son-in-law multiple times,

266
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,130
if it concerns my kid

267
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,430
I can't control my temper.

268
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,160
It's a warning if we call it one.

269
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,780
So I hope that you act wisely.

270
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,210
I report the Murderous Hyeong Seong Corporation's misdeeds! Shameless Chairman Jang family repent!

271
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,970
Since when has he been like that?

272
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,790
Pardon? Whom?

273
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,460
The guy who Lee Se Hoon is representing in the lawsuit.

274
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:45,740
Ah, that man. It was a bit before you, sir, were imprisoned, so it's a bit over four years.

275
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,900
And also, the person who threw eggs at you is also him.

276
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,660
I report the Murderous Hyeong Seong Corporation's misdeeds! Shameless Chairman Jang family repent!

277
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,230
Sir? The prosecution that you asked about earlier, I looked into it.

278
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,570
Did you know he was that fellow's father?

279
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,600
That fellow?

280
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,730
Kwon Hyeok Soo.

281
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,610
Ah. Kwon Hyeok Soo.

282
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,480
If you come here without an appointment, it makes us uncomfortable.

283
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,880
In last year's labor negotiations, we agreed on an increase of 20% in base pay and 50% increase on bonus pay

284
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,920
and that 50% of the subcontracted workers would become regular employees.

285
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,650
It has all been agreed upon. Now a year later, none of that has been kept.

286
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,510
We didn't even start this year's negotiations.

287
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,090
I time and time and again asked for a meeting, yet there was no response, so—

288
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,470
No answer is the response, but you keep asking for—

289
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,560
In the agreement, there were stipulations about the implementation

290
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,380
that if the finances of the corporation become difficult the agreed upon terms become null?

291
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,080
Listen, without properly investigating supply the investment itself

292
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,380
into the Australian steel business was a strain itself then the corporation was in straits.

293
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,800
Then that was our fault?

294
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,080
When that was being decided upon you had never consulted us once.

295
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,890
Decisions based on investment are the sole responsibility of management

296
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,770
not something to be negotiated with labor.

297
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,160
You people make the decisions, yet want us to take responsibility?

298
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,400
It is because of steel that the entire corporate holding group is in a difficult position.

299
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,410
At this point, the best we can do is to wait and endure until the shipbuilding and construction do better.

300
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,000
The joy is relished last while we are the first to bear difficulties.

301
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,790
Is that the management philosophy of Hyeong Seong?

302
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,020
Think what you wish.

303
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,040
The "enduring" that you speak of so easily

304
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,310
is a matter of life and death to us.

305
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,970
Since it's a matter of survival, you should decide for yourself all the more, before someone else decides for you.

306
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,910
Han Jae Hyeon was the Hyeong Seong Group's strategics chief at the time.

307
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,800
From what I gather, right after Hyeok Soo met with Han Jae Hyeon

308
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,620
he ruptured the labor and management negotiation and resolved to a general strike.

309
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,970
But the strike didn't quite last a day.

310
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,300
It didn't.

311
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,600
My conclusion, as of now, is that Hyeok Soo

312
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,020
was used by the company.

313
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,140
What?

314
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,320
The reason they ceased the strike was that Hyeok Soo brought a new offer from the company.

315
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,420
They offered to increase pay and accept other demands.

316
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,910
They persuaded the union members with that

317
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,500
to end the strike and drop all the charges and suits against the management.

318
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,640
Afterwards, the company changed their stance.

319
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,100
The strike leaders all underwent structural layoffs and even simple participants

320
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,090
were scattered and sent to other subsidiaries.

321
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,950
Hyeok Soo was the only one who stayed in the same position during that process.

322
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,950
He was even promoted to operations manager,

323
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:02,710
but we don't know how those who stayed and left treated Hyeok Soo.

324
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,450
Our Hyeok Soo. I feel so bad for him.

325
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,480
We need to make them pay.

326
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,040
The person who played the biggest role in this tragedy.

327
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,920
Yeong Min, is everything alright with you?

328
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,380
Yes.

329
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,490
Then why did your grades drop?

330
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,900
I'm sorry.

331
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,500
If you're sorry, work harder.

332
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,870
Yes.

333
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,400
Do you want to study abroad, Yeong Min?

334
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,530
Abroad?

335
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,140
A company that does a lot of good deeds

336
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,500
has a program where they send students with good grades to study abroad.

337
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,850
You got picked this time.

338
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,430
But my grades dropped a lot.

339
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,050
It has nothing to do with your grade.

340
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,800
You did well before.

341
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,640
Doesn't it cost a lot of money?

342
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,090
All you have to do is say you want to go.

343
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,500
It doesn't cost money.

344
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,480
The company will pay for your tuition and all living costs.

345
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,430
Hi, Yeong Min.

346
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,800
Mom. I got chosen as a study abroad scholarship student!

347
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,660
Study abroad?

348
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,540
It's a scholarship from Hyeong Seong.

349
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,700
It's like a Hyeong Seong scholarship program. It will be advantageous for getting a job there later, too.

350
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,020
Isn't that kind of thing for college students, though?

351
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,740
It is. I was really surprised when I heard Yeong Min got chosen, too.

352
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,680
But it means that Yeong Min is that exceptional, right?

353
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,900
I see.

354
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,720
I can tell you more in detail if you come by this weekend.

355
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,300
Okay.

356
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,600
I gained.

357
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,590
Share some information.

358
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Is the rumor true?

359
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,280
No, it's not true.

360
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,470
I know, right?

361
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,860
Yeong Min.

362
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,010
I have a bit of a bad aftertaste.

363
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,760
About what?

364
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,160
Being a Hyeong Seong scholarship recipient.

365
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,330
Why?

366
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,100
There's no such thing as free food in this world, except for mom's food.

367
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,790
If you eat outside of the home, you naturally have to pay.

368
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,200
That's why if I receive something too big, whether it's feelings or objects,

369
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,250
I start to worry about how I'm going to repay them.

370
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:12,240
I worry that you're going to get indigestion after eating because you're worried about the price of the food.

371
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,530
Are you disappointed?

372
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,670
A little, but I had a feeling I couldn't go.

373
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,910
Why?

374
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,460
Because I can't take you with me.

375
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,120
Why would you take me with you? You go alone to places like that.

376
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,860
I'm stuck to you like glue.

377
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,210
- Dad, let's go home now. 
 - Yeah?

378
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,740
Okay.

379
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,700
Aren't you cold?

380
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,950
I was really cold.

381
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,310
When I'm out on the streets for the strike

382
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,680
I feel so cold no matter how many layers I wear.

383
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,200
 My son did not commit suicide.

384
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,130
 The company and Vice President Han Jae Hyeon made him die.

385
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,000
 According to Mr. Kwon, the father of the chief executive of the Hyeong Seong Steel Industry's labor union who passed away five years ago,

386
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,050
 Han Jae Hyeon, who was the strategy planning chief at the time...

387
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,480
  I report the brutality of the murderous company, Hyeong Seong!

388
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:15,100
Are you wanting to confirm? I can confirm for you

389
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
all the things Han Jae Hyeon did.

390
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,750
If what you're saying is true, he'll receive the appropriate legal judgment he deserves.

391
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,750
I'm not going to blindly take his side.

392
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,070
I'd like to see if you'll still be able to say that later on.

393
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,390
Are you targeting Sunbae because of me?

394
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,880
Han Jae Hyeon was at the heart of that case.

395
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,880
He was the one in charge of all the decisions regarding the labor union at that time.

396
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,410
To be honest, I did start because of you.

397
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,710
But now, I've become interested in Han Jae Hyeon himself.

398
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,870
There are a lot of stories aside from that man.

399
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,260
The genre is close to Noir.

400
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,180
Did you anticipate the dismissal of the arrest warrant?

401
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,020
Are the borrowed-name stocks really yours?

402
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,390
What are your thoughts on the allegations of slush funds?

403
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,730
Is there anything you would like to say?

404
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,160
How are you feeling about this?

405
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,370
Why, why, why are you wanting to drink at a place like this? Are you really poor?

406
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,710
I came a few days ago and really liked it. It feels better than drinking at a hotel and costs less.

407
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,600
Then at least order some eel or chicken gizzards!

408
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,840
This is so lame. I get off the sides more than the alcohol.

409
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,310
Okay, okay, I'll set up a buffet for you. An entire buffet.

410
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,500
Alright!

411
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
- Ajumma! 
 - Bring us a buffet!

412
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,350
I wonder if time is to blame for what's happening to us now.

413
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,400
We didn't have to study as hard as now.

414
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,940
We didn't have to go on crazy strikes like in the eighties.

415
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,600
There were so many good movies, books, and songs.

416
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,060
Exactly. No matter how much I think about it,

417
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,070
those were some good times.

418
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:24,300
But those were some insanely cruel times, too.

419
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,390
A lot of good people were lost.

420
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,130
And good people became bad people.

421
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Hello?

422
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,690
I'm Kim Mi Hwa. Do you remember me?

423
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,280
Yes, Unni. Hello, are you doing well?

424
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm doing well. How about you?

425
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,880
I'm doing well, too. But did you need something?

426
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,820
We heard from Seon Hee. Can you play the keyboard for us, too?

427
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,440
The keyboard?

428
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,800
We have a separate market labor union and we're doing a culture festival, too.

429
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,210
Of course, I'll go. I'm part of the family, too.

430
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,500
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

431
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
Jae Hyeon.

432
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,780
Sunbae, get up.

433
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,530
You're here?

434
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,800
How much did you drink?

435
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,190
Dong Jin keeps seducing me too, that Dong Jin.

436
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,080
Why would you come here? You should've gone home.

437
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,200
The road home was too difficult.

438
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,370
It bothers me that the elder who used to always protest isn't at his usual spot anymore

439
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:38,410
and that his son died so unfairly.

440
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,470
I think about my mother, too,

441
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,590
and her stupid son.

442
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,180
I think about Seo Kyeong,

443
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,480
and Joon Seo.

444
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,850
And Ji Soo...

445
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,080
and Yeong Min.

446
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,430
I promised to go to you,

447
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,460
but things keep holding my feet on my way to you.

448
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,470
It's because I live in a harsh place.

449
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,160
Its a bumpy and difficult stony path

450
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:39,580
so it's really difficult to come to me.

451
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,130
Why is it that your lashes still so pretty?

452
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,870
 Seoul Car Service

453
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,230
I don't think you'll be able to get up.

454
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,460
Where's Secretary Kang's number?

455
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,940
This is not a person, but a carpet.

456
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,260
This isn't me offering him any ramen, but an unavoidable situation.

457
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,650
I'm going to sleep with my door locked.

458
00:42:51,450 --> 00:43:03,190
♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

459
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:16,960
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  ♫

460
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:25,070
♫  Steeped in love, everything has passed by  ♫

461
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:32,210
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

462
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:38,510
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

463
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:45,670
♫   If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

464
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:53,050
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

465
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:59,560
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

466
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,820
 Next time, I'm going to let you freeze to death on the street.

467
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,000
 I think it'd be best for you not to drink.

468
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,120
It's so worn down.

469
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,150
 Garam International Middle School

470
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,620
Is something really going on between Yeong Min's mom and Joon Seo's dad?

471
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,990
There must be.

472
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,800
Right? It did seem like there was something between them that day.

473
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,840
That day?

474
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,630
I mean, when they were here on the weekend,

475
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,850
the way they looked at each other was something else.

476
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,820
They did that even at school?

477
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,900
They're so bold.

478
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,400
Yes?

479
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,520
It's Secretary Kang!

480
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,340
I didn't even get to properly greet you earlier.

481
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,160
You're looking good!

482
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,480
- Really? 
 - Yea.

483
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,950
Are you dating someone? How did your face brighten up so much? Is it botox?

484
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,860
What do you mean, botox? She was always pretty.

485
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,910
Earlier, when she was playing the keyboard, she looks so sophisticated and pretty.

486
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,020
It's all because your face suits that, and your fingers are so slender too.

487
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,260
I used to play when I was younger,  but I had to quit because I kept hitting the keys in twos.

488
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,230
Just head on out now.

489
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,290
Why did the lights go off now?

490
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,340
♫ Happy Birthday to you!♫

491
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,230
♫ Happy Birthday to you! ♫

492
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,690
♫ Happy Birthday dear Mi Wan, ♫

493
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,500
It's delicious.

494
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,830
This was such a great pick!

495
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,700
The strawberries are so good.

496
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,440
Let me try some.

497
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,580
It's so good!

498
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,630
What a relief that my birthday and his visit day overlap.

499
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,550
What are you doing?

500
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,490
You're taking everything. 
  June 29, 1995.

501
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,410
Where are you going?

502
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,490
She's probably going to her boyfriend.

503
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,960
Where are you going on your birthday? You should eat with us.

504
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,200
We can eat right now.

505
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,340
Your father already left for work.

506
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,600
Then what can I do?

507
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,310
Dad wants to eat dinner. That's why we haven't even bought a cake yet.

508
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,830
Dinner doesn't work for me.

509
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,030
You should still try to make it back on time. Should we eat by ourselves when it's your birthday?

510
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,310
You're never around otherwise.

511
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,580
Okay, I'll come back as soon as I can.

512
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,460
What about the cake? Which do you want?

513
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,130
Whichever.

514
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,790
I'm going to the department store with mom to fix my watch. Should we buy a strawberry cake there?

515
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,990
Do whatever you want.

516
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,880
Come back soon, or else your father will get angry.

517
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,900
Okay!

518
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,920
Look at her, leaving without even properly showing us her face.

519
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,500
Unni, your face will tan!

520
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,150
This cake is great.

521
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,400
This cake.

522
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,490
Delicious.

523
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,220
Yeong Min's mom, why aren't you eating the cake?

524
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,850
Oh, that's...

525
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,090
Why? Does it not taste good?

526
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,410
I'm just so full.

527
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:08,530
You don't look too good. Are you feeling sick?

528
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,340
No, I'm fine.

529
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,040
Shall we pack some for you to take home? It's a birthday cake, it's meant to be shared.

530
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,760
Package it.

531
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:58,360
♫  The stars in the sky are like me  ♫

532
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:04,120
♫   so they revolve around you   ♫

533
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:12,550
♫   Don't hesitate just saying you love me   ♫

534
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,340
♫   if you're like me  ♫

535
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,820
 While looking around your space without your permission,

536
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,880
 I learned something new.

537
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,970
 I've realized what kind of life you've lived, and why you left me.

538
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,840
 If I were you, I would have done the same.

539
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,920
 So don't blame yourself for anything,

540
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,410
 and make sure you become happy, Ji Soo.

541
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,680
♫  If you love me  ♫

542
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,540
Aren't you going to eat any egg?

543
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,420
What are you doing here?

544
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,290
I'm on my way to school.

545
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,970
Why are you riding the train?

546
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,900
It may seem like a lie, but Secretary Kang is on vacation.

547
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,500
Then you could just drive.

548
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,520
This may seem like a bigger lie, but my car's undergoing routine maintenance.

549
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,920
How did you know I would get on this one?

550
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,010
Well, I've been waiting at the station since dawn.

551
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,900
Why would you do that?

552
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,430
I just wanted to.

553
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,480
You're at home alone, you eat alone,

554
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,750
and you always ride the train alone. Those things kind of tugged at me.

555
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,530
Why am I alone? I have my dad and Yeong Min.

556
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,840
 Garam International Middle School

557
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,330
Daham Care Facility Family Dinner

558
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,630
What happened?

559
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,040
Did the electricity go out?

560
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,070
What is it?

561
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,350
I need to go home...

562
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,240
This is trouble...

563
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,930
 Dear Passengers, our train will be slightly delayed due to an issue with the generator.

564
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,030
 We will depart as soon as the issue is resolved.

565
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,520
 We apologize for the inconvenience.

566
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,490
Are you okay?

567
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,420
It's raining. I need to go find my daughter.

568
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,730
She's going to be cold in the rain.

569
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,580
Ji Young! Honey!

570
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,680
Ji Soo...

571
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,540
Just one moment.

572
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,920
 What's happening?

573
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,880
Your mother is a great chef.

574
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,140
Does it not look like I made it?

575
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,300
Nope, it doesn't.

576
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,860
How'd you know?

577
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,190
You've really tanned. It's really hard, right?

578
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,680
It's okay since I ran around so much during school.

579
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,520
Is it really okay for you to be here on your birthday?

580
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,020
 This is an emergency. There has been another collapse.

581
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,620
 This afternoon, the Seoul Department store collapsed.

582
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,640
 Currently, many fire trucks and ambulances have arrived on site.

583
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,060
 The search and rescue operation is taking place.

584
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,600
 Ah, I'm going to the department store with Mom to get my watch fixed.

585
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,090
 Shall we buy you a strawberry cake there?

586
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,360
 We predict there will be many injuries.

587
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,090
 We will get more detailed information from our reporter at the site of this incident.

588
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,950
Ji Soo! Wait, look at me.

589
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,430
It hasn't been confirmed yet, so—

590
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,730
My dad's office keeps calling me to hurry up and come.

591
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:32,330
They won't tell me why, but just to come.

592
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:35,950
I'm sure nothing's wrong. It'll be okay.

593
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,190
I think I should go.

594
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,320
I'm sorry.

595
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,130
 Stop

596
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,630
I'm sorry.

597
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,060
Can I just leave for a moment?

598
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,190
Go back in!

599
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,400
Please. Please let me leave.

600
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,140
If you leave now, you'll be expelled from service.

601
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,490
Then so be it.

602
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,510
Please, let me go!

603
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,950
Let go!

604
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:26,100
Ji Soo! Ji Soo...

605
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:47,220
 Dear Passenger, our train will pause momentarily to maintain a safe distance with the train in front of us.

606
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,930
 We apologize for the inconvenience.

607
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,340
 Pull

608
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,220
Oh no...

609
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,550
Why won't this open?

610
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,640
I need to go!

611
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,460
Please open this!

612
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,070
It's all my fault...

613
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:06,440
Because I was too late.

614
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,730
I told them I would go quickly.

615
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,960
What happened to Mom?

616
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,390
Please open this!

617
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,340
Please open this!

618
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,270
I need to go!

619
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:30,270
Please open this!

620
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,700
Ji Soo. Ji Soo!

621
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,650
Ji Soo.

622
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,690
I can't remember.

623
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:58,090
I remember everything that happened that day.

624
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:05,400
But the last time I saw Mom and Ji Yeong's faces,

625
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:09,920
no matter how much I try, I cannot remember.

626
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:08,700

627
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,720
 When My Love Blooms

628
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,830
 I still haven't been able to step away from that day.

629
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,900
 Mom! Look over here!

630
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,300
 Deep wounds are also deep longings.

631
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,030
 How could you make such a decision so easily?

632
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:27,890
 Nothing has been easy for me, because I had to give it my all.

633
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,700
 How could you only now realize that?

634
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,810
 This is all because of your mom!

635
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,220
 I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

636
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,630
