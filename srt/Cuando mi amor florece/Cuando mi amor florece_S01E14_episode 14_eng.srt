1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,230

2
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,000
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,380
Don't you think it's cowardly?

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,750
Why are you making Ji Soo stand on the ledge, while you're just watching her from behind?

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,420
Are you going to pick her up and run only after she falls?

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,500
Why aren't you thinking of how she's alone in such a scary place?

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,740
Ji Soo is suffering so much that I can't even stand to watch her from afar.

8
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,340
I...

9
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,500
There's nothing I can do.

10
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,180
If there was, I would do whatever that be.

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,860
But there's nothing I can do.

12
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:01,060
Please stay next to Ji Soo. Don't make her stand there alone.

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,580
Whether it snows, rains, or blows heavy winds,

14
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,810
if the two of you endure together

15
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,200
then I too...

16
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,640
I think I can live, too.

17
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,050
 Now I'm also going to do what will cause you the most pain.

18
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,770
 Something that you can never do, even if you were to pour

19
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,470
 all your power, money and time.

20
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,190
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

21
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Where did you say that woman went?

22
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,370
The hotel where the Vice President is.

23
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,890
What about Jae Hyeon? Where is Jae Hyeon?

24
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,030
You're crazy too.

25
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,310
Seo Kyeong.

26
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,070
What's wrong?

27
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,050
What's wrong?

28
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,860
Where did you hide her?

29
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,720
What are you talking about?

30
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,310
I'd rather wish you disappear.

31
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,270
I've really hit rock bottom.

32
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,740
You seemed to be aloof, but you've just caught me in tricks. You're no different from me.

33
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,620
That's the only way you'll get hurt.

34
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,670
Why are you doing nothing, after coming all the way here?

35
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,070
I told you why I came here.

36
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,890
I'm not someone that only receives.

37
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,320
I'll return it all to you multiplied by many. Will you be able to handle it?

38
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,300
If it's something I'll be the only one receiving, I don't care what it is.

39
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,490
It's something I brought upon myself. I need to take responsibility for it.

40
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,280
However, if you harm others around me, I won't hold back.

41
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,220
And if you don't hold back?

42
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm going to fight with all my might. In the upright and fair ways.

43
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,110
Is being here right now upright?

44
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,040
I'm not going to do anything that you may be imagining right now.

45
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,820
That's my way.

46
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,410
This is my way. Breaking everything.

47
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,370
If you break things like this and hurt others,

48
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,000
do you feel comfortable and relieved?

49
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,010
I tried that, but I don't find that it does.

50
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,020
It actually makes me hurt more and feel distressed.

51
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,290
Can you handle a woman that has such a strong sense of justice?

52
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,540
There are things that you've done.

53
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,740
 Se Hwi

54
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,920
I have no strength right now.

55
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,380
Come and drive for me.

56
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,680
I wanted to hurt Jang Seo Kyeong

57
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,700
because too many people have been hurt by her.

58
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,640
You should've splashed her with water while you were at it. Or grabbed her hair.

59
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,940
The two of them suit each other. It's annoying.

60
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,800
That's why you were angered.

61
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,810
Why did you leave first? What if the two of them do something.

62
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,770
There's no way they would.

63
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,270
Adults can't be wandering around like this. You only do that in your 20's.

64
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,790
You'll develop a deep-rooted sickness. Aren't you cold?

65
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,760
It's a bit cold.

66
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,080
Do you think you can walk all the way home like that time?

67
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,990
I don't think I can do that.

68
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,320
There's a rock in my heart.

69
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,350
I'm wondering if there's any method other than these shows I put on to aggravate her.

70
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,150
When I heard that Seon Hee, who isn't involved in this at all, got dismissed,

71
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,980
something in my head just snapped

72
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
and I lost my rationality for a moment.

73
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,700
Please forget the me from today.

74
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,170
I don't know if that'll work out.

75
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,980
You were right.

76
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,500
♫  The stars in the sky resemble me  ♫

77
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:27,400
♫  They always remain in the same place  ♫

78
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,820
♫  Today as well I am like yesterday  ♫

79
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,610
♫  Lingering by your side  ♫

80
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,560
♫  If you just love  ♫

81
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,900
♫  Don’t hesitate  ♫

82
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,300
♫  If you feel the same as me  ♫

83
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,490
♫  Then even if a painful tomorrow comes  ♫

84
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:06,800
♫  I could embrace all those moments we are together  ♫

85
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,970
♫  If you just love  ♫

86
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,700
 Chairman Jang asked me to ignore your father's allegations against Hyeong Seong.

87
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,620
 But I didn't do only that.

88
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,730
 I actually made your father to be prosecuted.

89
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,900
 The prosecutor who was investigating your father's complaint file against Hyeong Seong

90
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,590
 was suddenly appointed to a post in the countryside, causing the primary prosecutor to be reassigned.

91
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,990
 After that happened, your father was indicted.

92
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,640
 I heard that happens when the primary prosecutor is insubordinate to a superior.

93
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,750
I want to find someone.

94
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,120
 Yes, who should I find?

95
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,950
The person who first took on my father's case before being replaced.

96
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,760
Yeong Min, what are you doing?

97
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,430
Yes?

98
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,390
Mom.

99
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,450
How dare you come here?

100
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,120
Stay here.

101
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,550
Yeong Min, let's go. I know you don't want to see me,

102
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,980
but let's go home and talk about it.

103
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,400
Mom, did you call me?

104
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,540
I messaged you. Didn't you get it?

105
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,720
What are you doing?

106
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,500
It seems like you intercepted my messages, but whether you file for a return of custody or not, I have it right now.

107
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,080
Your rights to visitation are once every two weeks, and cannot surpass two days and one night.

108
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,550
Yeong Min, gather your things and come out.

109
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,100
You're known across the whole nation as a woman with an affair,

110
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,900
and yet you shamelessly want to keep raising my baby?

111
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,130
I have both custody and parental rights.

112
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,110
Yeong Min has been here for over four days which is clearly illegal.

113
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,720
- This little— 
 - Mother.

114
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,930
If you even touch a hair on my body, I will file for assault as well.

115
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,890
Please don't touch me in front of my son ever again.

116
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,010
Yeong Min, let's go.

117
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,270
Until when do I have to put up with this?

118
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,610
Yeong Min.

119
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,640
Do you really not want to live with me?

120
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,580
If you really want that, I can let you go. But if you're doing it for me,

121
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,240
then I can't let you go.

122
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,220
I know the reason you didn't say anything about what was happening at the school was because of me, too.

123
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,910
Why do you have so many worries in that small head of yours?

124
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,530
If only I could, I want to find all of them and erase them for you.

125
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,700
I'll think about it. There's something I've told dad.

126
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,170
It's hard for me to make a decision right now.

127
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,800
Shall I push you? I'm good at pushing the swings.

128
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,700
You used to make a whole loop around when I pushed you on the swings.

129
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,280
Why do you keep telling more fibs?

130
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200
To make you smile.

131
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,390
They're just continuing to purchase more shares.

132
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,400
That's why we're at 36.8%, while Vice President Han is at 38.85%.

133
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,870
Once we proceed with the recapitalization by stock issuance to third party, our shares will increase to 56.8%.

134
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,540
What did you find out about the court?

135
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,800
Even if they file a lawsuit claiming the recapitalization was unjust,

136
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,130
if we just follow your orders there will be no issues according to the law.

137
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,630
The prosecutor's office has already confirmed it.

138
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,740
It's unacceptable if the purpose of the recapitalization is to protect my management rights,

139
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,600
but if it's for improvement of the financial structure, it's all right.

140
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Isn't that funny?

141
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,160
You're the chairman indeed. How did you think of that?

142
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Section Chief Lee, how long do you think the prosecutor's investigation will take?

143
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,830
Vice-President Han shouldered the borrowed-name shares, and  as family you are exempted from accountability over share dividends.

144
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,310
- I don't think you have much to worry about but..
 - But what?

145
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,570
I'm bothered by the fact that the prosecutor in charge is Kang Seung Woo. He's quite malicious.

146
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,330
I've been looking into him, here and there.

147
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,250
But what did Seo Kyeong do that things have been so noisy?

148
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,140
She dismissed an employee in the distribution plant suddenly, and without a reason.

149
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,380
 Labor Relations Committee

150
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,840
I could've just come alone.

151
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,400
How could I just watch when this happened because of me?

152
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,910
It's not just because of you. I knew something was coming for me sooner or later.

153
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,200
Why? Who else works as hard as you?

154
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,900
What would someone who worked as a cashier know about a distribution plant?

155
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,930
They needed to reinstate me, but they didn't like me no matter what.

156
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,240
So they just gave me any weird position.

157
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,260
They probably thought I would quit earlier than this. I bet you they didn't know I'm tougher than a whale's tendon.

158
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,500
They say relief orders are given easily for situations like this, so don't worry too much.

159
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,510
I shouldn't worry.

160
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,090
So I can eat and sleep well.

161
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,010
- Yes, Hye Jeong? 
 -  Where are you?

162
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,620
I'm on my way home.

163
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,970
 Stop by. Dong Jin got his incentive today, so he's treating us.

164
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,260
 I know you're not in the mood to celebrate, but I'm not saying to eat and drink till we die today.

165
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,540
 I want to help brighten your mood because I thought you'd be feeling frustrated.

166
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,310
Are you sure you don't just want to eat something?

167
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,200
 Is it obvious?

168
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,060
I brought this thinking of you! I heard you go crazy over these.

169
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,940
This punk... Are you challenging me again?

170
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,820
Do you want me to create a traumatic memory with chocolate cakes for you, too?

171
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,780
I don't like those either. I haven't had even one after that day.

172
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,120
Die! Die, chocolate cake!

173
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,220
 July 1994

174
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,690
I feel like I'm going to die.

175
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,830
What weeds? There are bamboo shoots.

176
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,360
If it's this bad, don't you think we should pick the barley out and grow the weeds?

177
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,540
You were slacking off the whole time.

178
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,750
Forget it.

179
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,300
Hey, can you take off my boots for me?

180
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,860
- I don't want to. 
 - Come on!

181
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,390
Goodness, my blood sugar is dropping.

182
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,900
Let's eat.

183
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,970
Can we eat this?

184
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,040
Why not? Didn't they buy it for us to eat?

185
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,910
I was going to die because of low blood sugar, but now I feel alive.

186
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,290
Eat it, punk. Eat.

187
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,420
What are you guys doing?

188
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,010
What are you eating?

189
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,700
Chocolate Cake.

190
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,780
Why are you eating that?

191
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,980
Because I want to.

192
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,440
Are you the only ones that want to eat?

193
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,900
It's not just chocolate cake. Don't you know that the elders gave it to us to share?

194
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,340
Then you can eat one too! Why are you making a fuss about what I eat?

195
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,760
How is this rural volunteering if you're just eating whatever you want? That's just an MT!

196
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,100
We'll stop our assessments here for today.

197
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,960
Lastly, regarding what happened this afternoon.

198
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,720
What? Me?

199
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,990
Hey. Cut it out.

200
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,830
Who speaks informally during a meeting?

201
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,900
I'm telling you to cut it out...

202
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,450
please. (using formal speech) Is eating one piece of cake because I was hungry something to make this much of a fuss about?

203
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,210
If there are no rules or regulations, rural volunteer work will become a mess in just an instant.

204
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you think we wrote that as decoration?

205
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,240
You snack whenever you want, sleep whenever you want,

206
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,570
and wash up whenever you want? Did we come here to play?

207
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,990
I'm sorry. This won't happen again.

208
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,740
I mean, it's not like we ate every day. It was just once... (changes to formal speech at the very end)

209
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm telling you I only ate one. Ma'am.

210
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,350
We found three empty packages.

211
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,810
I mean... I was just so tired toda—

212
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,050
Who here wasn't tired?

213
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,810
Today's project was so difficult that even the elderly find it challenging.

214
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,820
On top of that, the presidents only got three hours of sleep yesterday because they were in a meeting.

215
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,120
Mr. Lee Dong Jin. How many times did you straighten out your back when we were pulling the weeds?

216
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,050
Just a fair amount. Why?

217
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,240
Do you know how many times the elders next to you straightened their backs?

218
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,770
Wouldn't it be weirder if I knew the answer to that question?

219
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,360
And you? Were you watching that instead of working?

220
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,380
They don't straighten out their backs even once.

221
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,960
The students are only here for show. They're more of a nuisance.

222
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,760
They were just here to laugh, eat, and drink. If we're going to hear things like this,

223
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,520
it's best you pack up your belongings and head back immediately.

224
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,620
If you eat like that whenever you want,

225
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,060
there will be people who can't eat. It'll make us cry.

226
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,730
So what? What do you want me to do about it?

227
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,860
The two of you will cook breakfast and dinner tomorrow.

228
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,650
You will also have one additional round of picking weeds.

229
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,550
- Hey. (informally) 
 - Hey?

230
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,450
In this heat of summer, you expect me to—

231
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,450
Look, Mr. Han. Can I just throw it up?

232
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,040
Okay. If you throw it up exactly as it was found I'll acknowledge it, Mr. Lee Dong Jin.

233
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,830
- I'm going to leave. I'm leaving. 
  - You're leaving?

234
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,220
When are we going to finish all of these, huh?

235
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,320
Stop complaining.

236
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,410
Do you think this is complaining?

237
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,540
They shamed me so much for eating just one chocolate pie.

238
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,680
Ji Soo! What's wrong? Why is she like this?

239
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,860
She fainted. I'll be right back.

240
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,190
Let me down! Let me down!

241
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,220
- Please let me down. 
 - I'm not tired. Just stay still.

242
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,630
No, let me down.

243
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,940
- Why are you being like this? 
 - That's what I should be saying to you.

244
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,770
- You fainted. 
 - I didn't faint.

245
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,110
Let's just say you did and go rest in the village hall.

246
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,950
Why? We can't do that. How can I be the only one that rests?

247
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,420
You're not okay right now.

248
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,040
They all want to rest. How can I rest alone?

249
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,560
We're not at an MT! Is resting when we want and sleeping when we want rural volunteering?

250
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,770
I'm going back.

251
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,620
Ji Soo. Ji Soo, you're sick.

252
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,820
Hurry up and work.

253
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,810
They say a novice shaman kills a man. 
  (T/N: Recklessly taking action when one doesn't have the skills to solve an issue can cause trouble)

254
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,990
After that, Ji Soo would come over every time anyone relaxed and say,

255
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,370
"How is this rural volunteering? How is this volunteering?" Her nagging was just—

256
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,140
That's what I'm saying! After she got back from that, she always talked about it.

257
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,680
I thought she had gone to the navy or something.

258
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,330
I thought it was kind of unfair. I didn't get to even properly eat it.

259
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,730
 That's right. Yeong Woo spit it out right after he took a bite.

260
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,690
 You dumb punk. I told you to eat it quick and discreetly.

261
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,810
What's rural volunteering?

262
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,880
I think they're talking about volunteering in helping out rural communities with their farm work.

263
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,970
Have you been to that?

264
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,320
No. That wasn't in my major.

265
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,430
Is it like camping? Camping isn't much fun either.

266
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,950
Let's stop it now.

267
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,160
What are you talking about?

268
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,610
Wire-tapping and taking secret footage. I want to stop it.

269
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,260
I'm sick of it.

270
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,620
Long time no see. It seems we're the same.

271
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,470
If you're not trying to be friends with me, just get to the point.

272
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,790
I want to check something. I heard you were in the middle of a divorce suit.

273
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,110
So?

274
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,280
Do you really want to get a divorce?

275
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,900
Why do I have to tell you that?

276
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,170
Let's say it's out of respect for someone you cooperated with before.

277
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:47,350
Do you still have lingering feelings for Han Jae Hyeon?

278
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,200
What about you?

279
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,140
Have you not given up Yoon Ji Soo? What about custody?

280
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,910
I'm no longer interested in things like custody or remarriage.

281
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,380
The only thing I want is for Han Jae Hyeon and Yoon Ji Soo,

282
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,870
for these two people, I wish misfortune.

283
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,340
Hyung.

284
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,690
Yeong Woo.

285
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,600
Thanks for calling me.

286
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,040
She seems like she's still having a hard time.

287
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,050
Thanks for telling me not to leave Ji Soo alone, too.

288
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,120
If you're grateful, then come often. Business isn't that great these days.

289
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,660
Okay, okay. But I'm not strong with alcohol.

290
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,910
You have Ji Soo.  She's 100 for your 1.

291
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,180
But are you okay?

292
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,340
Of course, I am. Not okay.

293
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,130
But still. It's something I chose, so I have to take responsibility for it.

294
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,000
Well, I don't think it's all over yet.

295
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,620
- Really? 
 - Who knows when you'll slip up?

296
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,840
Maybe Ji Soo's pea pod will fall off her eyes one day. ('pea pod' used in Korean as an expression for 'blind for love')

297
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,500
Why did you come to pick me up?

298
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,270
Because it's raining, and I felt like my energy wasn't so great.  (T/N: Quoting a 1994 song from Lim Jong Hwan, "I just walked.")

299
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,590
Such an old person.

300
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,600
Seeing how you know that song, you're such an old person as well.

301
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,210
Talking about the old days made me miss you, so it's good.

302
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,390
No wonder my ears were burning.

303
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,010
The patting sound of the rain is comforting.

304
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,690
Still, you shouldn't get wet. Stick close.

305
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,710
Your shoulder is getting drenched too, come in closer.

306
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,570
It'll get drenched anyway since I'm a shoulder gangster  (a colloquialism for broad shoulders).

307
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,370
You covering me with the umbrella feels really cozy.

308
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,090
Well, the ceiling is indeed high.

309
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:32,770
♫  If we can reach that day, that time  ♫

310
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,820
It'll be tiresome for me if you catch a cold, that's why.

311
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:46,240
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

312
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,560
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

313
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,170
We received an order from the Labor Relations Committee yesterday to provide relief regarding the wrongful dismissal.

314
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,390
It's about Choi Seon Hee's dismissal case.

315
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,700
And so, what do they want us to do?

316
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,410
If we do not follow the order, a penalty will be imposed to compel execution of the relief.

317
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,020
Otherwise, we can also apply for a retrial.

318
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,830
But the reason for dismissal is too big a disadvantage to us.

319
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,350
We can just give them money.

320
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,660
There might be opposition from the labor union or the stockholders.

321
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,270
I don't care.

322
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,840
The CEO says she has no intention whatsoever to reinstate  Choi Seon Hee.

323
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,200
That should raise some issues, though.

324
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,990
We received an order of relief from the Labor Relations Committee, but she said she would rather pay the penalty.

325
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,180
 Revealing the brutality of murderous corporation Hyeong Seong

326
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,480
Elder.

327
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,640
I was unaware you had started protesting again. I am ashamed to appear in front of you.

328
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,660
In my whole life, I have never done anything for my wife.

329
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,530
And I couldn't even keep my last promise to her.

330
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:16,430
Are you talking about the promise to relieve your late son's resentment?

331
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,900
I was pondering on what I should do for the time I have left to live.

332
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,240
But this was the only thing I could do.

333
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,570
After the lawsuit, Han Jae Hyeon didn't even give a word of apology, did he?

334
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:43,180
He had the time for an extramarital affair, but not for an apology, apparently.

335
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,490
- An affair? 
 - Yes.

336
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,810
And still, it looks like he is coveting the wealth of his wife's family.

337
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,640
There is a rumor that Hyeong Seong will soon become his company.

338
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,110
Even when your son's unfair passing is all that man's doing.

339
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,770
While I was investigating the matter for the lawsuit, I found that there were several such instances.

340
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,900
There is no end to his greed.

341
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,530
In order to accomplish his desire for money, he wouldn't distinguish water from fire (would push ahead regardless of circumstances).

342
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,550
I feel the heavens are showing much indifference.

343
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,580
He will be punished.

344
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,960
Sorry?

345
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,140
- Yes, Unni? 
 -  Yeong Min's mom, what should we do?

346
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,930
 They say that Seon Hee collapsed.

347
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,120
- Brain surgery? 
 - Yes.

348
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,400
Well, they said it's not a big operation

349
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,620
and that it went well.

350
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,360
Then why all of a sudden...

351
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,360
It wasn't really all of a sudden. She also collapsed once before while working at the company.

352
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,170
How could she be fit to work at the distribution center when she used to be a cashier?

353
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,850
She was being slow and kept getting remarks about it.

354
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,050
So she pushed herself and worked until late into the night, and that's how this happened.

355
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,810
She has to get the medical certificate, apply for industrial accident, and also protest against her wrongful dismissal.

356
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,570
Maybe it's because of the tense atmosphere, but no one is willing to take action.

357
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,170
The labor union seems to be reluctant as well. These days, you really have nowhere to go after being fired.

358
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,700
What family does she have?

359
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:42,000
Her elderly mother and a son in middle school. There isn't anyone who can earn money.

360
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,560
Seon Hee.

361
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,120
Come on in.

362
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,460
Why are you sitting up? You should be lying down.

363
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,720
It's just that I was a bit scared

364
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,360
that I'd stay lying down forever.

365
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,590
How can you say such a thing?

366
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,590
I enjoyed drinking with you.

367
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,390
I'll make it even more enjoyable. So get better soon.

368
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,160
Will I be able to do that?

369
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,160
When I'm like this?

370
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,810
There is nothing wrong with you. You should get better very soon.

371
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,500
You also made a promise with me that you wouldn't lose easily.

372
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,330
I wish I could at least lose.

373
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:03,810
Because I feel like I might not even have another chance to fight.

374
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,740
Issuing stocks only to your side in order to protect your management rights

375
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,130
is not allowed by the Korean court of law.

376
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:19,550
Then shouldn't we file a lawsuit as well?

377
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,850
There are some cases where capital increase by allotment of stockes to third parties is allowed.

378
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,400
Improvement of financial structure.

379
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,670
Chairman Jang will say he made such decision for the sake of improving the financial structure.

380
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,630
Then what do we have to do?

381
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,560
We should file a lawsuit for now, even if it doesn't lead to the ruling we want.

382
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,100
And regardless of the result,

383
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,200
we should spread the rumor of a competition for shares over the company's management rights.

384
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,410
Why is that?

385
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,210
Be it through the lawsuit or the rumor, the dispute over management rights must become a trending topic.

386
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,660
If the stock value goes up due to the rumor, the shares will have to keep increasing.

387
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,790
But even at the current price, buying any more stocks is difficult.

388
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,090
So how do you expect to handle things if the rate gets even higher?

389
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,790
We won't need to buy a lot of them.

390
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,620
We just have to make it look as if we are constantly buying more shares.

391
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,520
If they proceed with the issuance of stocks to third parties, they will have over fifty percent of the shares.

392
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,100
What would be the use of competing over shares in that situation?

393
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,440
This game will be one where losing at the beginning

394
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,230
means winning later on.

395
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,510
Please excuse me.

396
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,460
 Let's meet up briefly, Sunbae.

397
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,670
Let us end our meeting here today.

398
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:40,870
Ah right, I heard that the wrongful dismissal of an employee here is causing quite a stir.

399
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,870
It looked like they were demanding reinstatement and compensation for industrial accident as well.

400
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,840
If you grant them one, it becomes two later,

401
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,990
and then ten of them.

402
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,620
Ji Soo.

403
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,560
In Unni Seon Hee's case, it's a clearly unfair dismissal.

404
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,100
The hospital also confirmed the cause was due to overwork.

405
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,670
I know, but it's not easy, Ji Soo,

406
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,850
since human resources are under the CEO's authority.

407
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:42,480
There have been multiple suggestions to chance the CEO, but Chairman Jang won't do a thing about it.

408
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,770
And the investors on our side are sensitive to things like recognition of industrial accidents and union strife.

409
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,690
Why?

410
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,720
They're people who want to ultimately own the company,

411
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,700
so they don't want to side with the employees.

412
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,940
Without those people, I cannot win

413
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,770
in the fight against Chairman Jang that I've been preparing for years.

414
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,380
Other than punishing Chairman Jang,

415
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,140
is ownership of the company what you want as well?

416
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,240
Why? That wasn't yours to begin with.

417
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,060
It's both revenge and a reward.

418
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,370
Is it difficult to understand?

419
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,760
So is it okay then, in order to reach your goal, to sacrifice a few powerless people?

420
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,050
For the main character,

421
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:48,060
it can't be helped, but for the nameless soldiers in the frontline to fall?

422
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:58,890
Whether it be the general or officer, the main protagonist always relays commands while standing in the middle.

423
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,230
On the frontline, the nameless infantry take the bullets,

424
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:10,110
and even if they are lucky enough to survive from it, they fall at the enemy general's sword or gun without a sound.

425
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:17,610
But no one in there deserves to just be taken down by a gun or sword.

426
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,670
Before they fell like that, they were all the main protagonists in their own lives.

427
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,800
It wasn't Jang Seo Kyeon, Yeong Min's dad, or the children.

428
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,750
This was the biggest obstacle between us.

429
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:43,990
I will still continue loving you, as always and forever,

430
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,520
but I will do the things I believe are right,

431
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,250
and I'm going to take the side of those with whom nobody else will side.

432
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,350
Just like we were able to love again,

433
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,340
I hope you can return to those times again.

434
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,490
 Maybe it's because of the tense atmosphere, but no one is willing to take action.

435
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:58,110
 I feel like I might not even have another chance to fight.

436
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,840
 Without those people, I cannot win

437
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,340
 in the fight against Chairman Jang that I've been preparing for years.

438
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,450
 Petition

439
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,230
 Ms. Choi Seon Hee, a former colleague who used to work under a temporary position at the supermarket with us

440
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,620
 and was then an employee at Hyeong Seong Distribution's warehouse, without any justification from the company's owner...

441
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,960
It's really okay.

442
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,140
I'm also really fine.

443
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,160
The taste is so-so, but I have quick hands.

444
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,910
I already cooked breakfast for my son.

445
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,880
I mean, still. Can I take all of these?

446
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,750
It's nothing compared to what Unni Seon Hee's done for me.

447
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,940
So please don't feel burdened by it at all.

448
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,900
Son! You can be my son for the time being.

449
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,540
 Labor Legislation Office 
 Labor Attourney Kwan Tae Keun

450
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,270
Wait a minute.

451
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,890
What are you doing?

452
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,670
I thought you wouldn't come out even if I asked to meet.

453
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,410
You said you wouldn't meet me regarding Choi Seon Hee.

454
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,910
It's a petition from everyone I used to work with.

455
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,280
You can keep it. It's a copy.

456
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,380
I'm going to court with the original copy.

457
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,170
So what are you telling me to do?

458
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,480
I'm going to file a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal.

459
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,250
There was neither a good reason nor a 30-day notice.

460
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,080
If the wrongful dismissal is acknowledge by court, the payment of her wage for the duration of the dismissal will be enforceable.

461
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,250
The Labor Relations Commission can also press criminal charges for disobeying the order to provide relief measures.

462
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,060
And also, I plan on going to the broadcast station.

463
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,510
What did you say?

464
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:41,490
Thanks to you, I am widely known now, and I even have a story.

465
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,800
The broadcast station will welcome me with open arms.

466
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,370
Are you saying you, Jae Hyeon, and I can all just die together?

467
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,200
I told you I would fight with everything I've got.

468
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,730
In the fair and upright ways.

469
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,520
I'll give you three days.

470
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,370
I'm sorry. I heard this from CEO Jang's driver,

471
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,870
but apparently Yoon Ji Soo went to her house this morning. 
 - What for?

472
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:32,510
She said she'll start a lawsuit regarding Choi Seon Hee's situation and go to the broadcast station to expose her.

473
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,750
 The person you are trying to call...

474
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,990
I don't think she's home.

475
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,580
Would it be possible to find out which hospital Choi Seon Hee is staying at?

476
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,810
Yes, I'll look into it.

477
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,170
 Hyeong Seong

478
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,470
Vice President. I found the prosecutor you were looking for last time.

479
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,340
Oh really? Where is he?

480
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,900
He's set up a law office in Incheon.

481
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,650
All these materials the district attorney gave are true.

482
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,110
I understand.

483
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,280
Let's see. Your father's case

484
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,540
is one of the most painful memories I have of the time I worked in the prosecutor's office.

485
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,130
The materials that your father brought me

486
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,620
were clear evidence of the wrongdoings of Hyeong Seong's management board.

487
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,700
So the start of the investigation went very smoothly,

488
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,400
but as the investigation continued, the number of phone calls I got,

489
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,240
and the people asking for me, kept increasing.

490
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,040
They were all from different places, but they all had the same request.

491
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,230
Close the investigation in its early stages,

492
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,330
and then erase the name of Hyeong Seong and Chairman Jang from this investigation.

493
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,050
While I was a prosecutor,

494
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,980
there was one thing I kept in my heart.

495
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:08,770
"Even if justice cannot be protected, let's not compromise."

496
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,220
Well, that's why I'm living like this.

497
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,130
Anyway, I started doing internal investigations on the people

498
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,980
who were giving me orders and requesting that I do these things.

499
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,430
I was curious as to why these people

500
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,340
were so protective of Chairman Jang.

501
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,520
But once I looked into things,

502
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:38,040
they were all tied together with Chairman Jang right in the middle. No matter how much I dug into it, there was no end to it.

503
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,400
These are the results of that internal investigation.

504
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,730
As soon as I reported these findings to district attorney Yoon Hyeon Koo,

505
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,490
my time as a prosecutor came to an end.

506
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:07,330
It's a bit late, but you'll be able to uphold justice now as well.

507
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,760
 I will do the things I believe are right.

508
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,710
 and I'm going to take the side of those with whom nobody else will side.

509
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,900
 Just like we were able to love again,

510
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,160
 I hope you can return to those times.

511
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:52,210
Why, why, why is it here again? It makes me uneasy.

512
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,270
But I don't see the chicken gizzard.

513
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,830
Huh?

514
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:02,510
What are you planning on telling me that you keep smiling like that? Is it something surprising?

515
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,310
Okay. Let me take a Cheongsimhwan (Korean herbal pill to clear the mind).

516
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,120
I'm going to return.

517
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,460
To where?

518
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,440
The place I was long ago.

519
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,170
Eat up and then study, okay?

520
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:36,080
Aren't you tired? You've been cooking every day for them these days.

521
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,420
Don't you think that when you were having difficult times at school, if someone helped you

522
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,910
or if someone had taken your side, it would've been less difficult and lonely?

523
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,630
I'll be back.

524
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,930
 I have something to tell you. I hope you'll come to meet me.

525
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,860
 It's something important.

526
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,560
 Nine o'clock. At the snack cart where we met last time.

527
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,490
Deliver this to Reporter Jeong Yoon and head home for the day.

528
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,730
Yes.

529
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,370
What should I tell him this is?

530
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,900
He'll know if you say it's the second Pandora's Box.

531
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,170
I will.

532
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,620
Hello.

533
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,540
Which flowers would you like?

534
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,500
I was thinking roses.

535
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,810
 August 1994

536
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,070
You guys argue sometimes too?

537
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,860
Why did you argue?

538
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,900
It's been like this since we came back from the rural volunteering trip,

539
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,280
but he keeps treating me like a child, not letting me do anything difficult.

540
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,700
He keeps looking after me, and it makes me feel bad toward others.

541
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,860
Goodness, I'm  so annoyed.

542
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,050
I got a page!

543
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,610
 I'm in front of your house. I'll wait until you come out.

544
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,730
You laughed after you cried.

545
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,670
What's all this?

546
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:24,450
They said that white and red roses together symbolize reconciliation.

547
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,370
Who said that?

548
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,020
Dong Jin.

549
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,460
It's too difficult to argue.

550
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,310
For me too.

551
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,660
Let's not argue anymore.

552
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:46,450
If we think we'll argue, let's raise our right hands.

553
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,920
If the other person raises their right hand, we should think "They must be upset at something."

554
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,090
"We could argue again, let's stop."

555
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,880
Like this?

556
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,140
If you have something else to tend to, you should go.

557
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,440
That's not it.

558
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,660
I'm going to watch a drama.

559
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,840
It's bothersome if someone else is here.

560
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,490
I'm really okay.

561
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,840
Are you my husband or my child?

562
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,800
Why are you here every day? It's really bothersome.

563
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,720
You being like this is all because of me.

564
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,080
Why is my sickness because of you?

565
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,550
Anyway, I'm really fine for today.

566
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,180
Really.

567
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,760
I'm fine.

568
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,070
Hello.

569
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,940
Yes, hello.

570
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm the father of Kwon Hyeok Soo, who died unjustly because of you.

571
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,870
Why?!

572
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,780
Oh no! Oh no!

573
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,050
Oh my goodness! Oh no!

574
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,630
What should I do?

575
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,280
Ji Soo.

576
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,270
Oh no...

577
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:41,230

578
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,540
♫  If you just love  ♫

579
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,030
♫  Just the way you are now  ♫

580
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,420
♫  If you feel the same as me  ♫

581
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,030
♫  Then even if a painful tomorrow comes  ♫

582
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,370
 When My Love Blooms

583
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,570
 I know over a hundred reasons why he needs to wake up.

584
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:08,200
 If there are many good people like you, a better world will be made.

585
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,810
 Don't let anyone that's not family come into this room.

586
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,570
 It's a great opportunity for us.

587
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:17,260
 Even if it's really just a hound, shouldn't you not do this?

588
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,300
 I can get on my knees, too. I beg of you.

589
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,370
 Please give up on him.
