1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:08,050

2
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,970
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,860
You must have given it lots of thought,

4
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,220
judging from how sunken your face has become.

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,610
After that day, I kept thinking about it.

6
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,520
Why you would be doing this.

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,780
You're someone who had an affair before Yeong Min could even walk.

8
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,150
Even at court, you're someone who had signed off on the custodial papers without hesitation.

9
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,970
Why are you suddenly talking about reclaiming custody rights?

10
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,570
Why are your efforts to bring down the person I'm having an affair with,

11
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,990
greater than your efforts to actually bring back your son?

12
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,940
How could your rights to custody over your son have been placed on the same scale as Han Jae Hyeon?

13
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,220
Have you found the answer to why that was?

14
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,940
Twenty-five years ago, my dad told me about opportunity cost.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,180
To choose one, you must give up another.

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,120
You can either pick the thing you want the most or avoid the thing you fear the most.

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
To pick one or the other.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,900
And?

19
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,180
I...

20
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,070
decided to avoid what I feared the most.

21
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,540
Then and now,

22
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,050
the thing I dread the most

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,120
is that person becoming utterly broken because of me.

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,350
Whether my choice is correct or not,

25
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,530
I will return to you.

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,010
 When My Love Blooms

27
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,100
 Episode 7  
 It's not like you're being dragged into hell.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,970
Your sad expression is a bit much.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm sure it'll get better.

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,490
I'm sure you've changed, but so have I.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,030
My head isn't slow enough to make the same mistake twice.

32
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,470
What shall we do about the marriage?

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,510
Do whatever you want.

34
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,550
I'll give you some time, so take care of anything you need to.

35
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,490
Especially things like long-fermenting relationships.

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,550
We're breezing through because you're speaking so well.

37
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,840
After your meal, let's confirm the investigation. What would you like, seolleongtang (ox bone soup) or seonji haejangguk (cow blood soup)?

38
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,110
I'll have seonji haejangguk.

39
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,950
 Hyeong Seong Group Vice President Han Jae Hyeon in prosecution for borrowed-name shares.

40
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,280
You shouldn't have sought out Ji Soo.

41
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,680
He filed for a return of custody.

42
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,860
Ji Soo's ex-husband did.

43
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,410
Is it because of what happened at school?

44
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,940
No. It's because of you, Hyeong.

45
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,790
He said he suspects an affair.

46
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,210
It's basically green onion soup.

47
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,510
I love this green onion so much, so I always eat like this.

48
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,110
It's crunchy but refreshing. There's no lingering aftertaste.

49
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,580
Green onion is the best for getting rid of excessively oily tastes.

50
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,180
I started putting in more and more green onion as I worked here.

51
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,560
Vice President, when are you going to reveal the next big card?

52
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,220
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,730
You shouldn't belittle the Republic of Korea's prosecutors.

54
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,370
See!

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,110
On one bright, cool sunny day,

56
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,990
a few files about Hyeong Seong Group or whatever arrived to our prosecutors' office.

57
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,060
It was organized so well that it was easy to read and understand in a glance. Like so.

58
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,900
We were wondering what this was.

59
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,250
Then a few days after,

60
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,360
the same things were being discussed in the newspaper and on a broadcast.

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,120
If someone didn't know any better, they might think we released the news ourselves to season things.

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
As an unofficial report.

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,650
Is that what happened?

64
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,340
Since then, we went on as we usually would,

65
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,020
and that led to us bringing you here, VP, for an investigation.

66
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,190
You, who ended up here,

67
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,740
came alone, without a lawyer that all rich people commonly have attached to them.

68
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,740
You've spoken freely about this whole case, without any mistake or mismatch with the evidence we already have.

69
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,520
I didn't need any of these questions I had prepared ahead of time.

70
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,000
If investigations were always like this, being a prosecutor would be easy.

71
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,210
Don't you think these details add value to the picture? It's not a mere coincidence.

72
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,510
The prosecutors of this country are not like buses or subway trains that travel a set path according to schedule.

73
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,600
We're definitely not like some taxi that comes and goes at someone's beck and call.

74
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,840
Won't you tell me now... what your next card is?

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,210
Eat up... before your green onion gets cold. 
 ('green onion soup' sounds like the word for collapse/destruction in Korean)

76
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,410
Let's move on.

77
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,250
Sir, do you have anything to tell us?

78
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,490
Are you really involved in this?

79
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,510
Please tell us something!

80
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,690
How did it go?

81
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,220
It went well.

82
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,580
Who did it go well for?

83
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,240
What are you talking about?

84
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,430
Did it go well for you, or did it go well for my dad?

85
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,290
Which side is better for you?

86
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,940
Me, I hope it went well for both sides.

87
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,440
Both together well without conflict.

88
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,610
In the immediacy, there will be no big issues for either side.

89
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,180
Are there any other issues?

90
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,660
Other things, not related to work.

91
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,830
I wish you would act as you always have.

92
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,730
Sure. Beating around the bush isn't my style, so I can't do it either.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,070
Yoon Ji Soo. Is there nothing going on with that woman?

94
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,650
A pending file to return custody.

95
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,620
I know about that much? Is that good?

96
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,570
For now.

97
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,950
Child, what happened to your feet?

98
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,360
I walked around so much.

99
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,650
Why did you do that?

100
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,790
Because I disliked them.

101
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,150
Who is it this time?

102
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,040
Me.

103
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,160
You sure have a temper.

104
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,550
Goodness, you're in such horrible condition.

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,780
Your feet, so small, look just like they belong to a princess.

106
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,250
Why do you use them so carelessly, without holding them dear?

107
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,990
You have to cherish yourself for others to cherish you, too.

108
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,440
Granny, can you be my mom?

109
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,930
Why would I be your mom?

110
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,120
Just because...

111
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Because I miss my mom so much.

112
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,250
I want a mom to call me crazy bitch,

113
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,420
and smack some sense into my back.

114
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,160
Is...something truly wrong?

115
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,090
It hurts because we applied ointment.

116
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,930
Hold through.

117
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,210
It'll get better soon.

118
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,670
Where is there a wound in the world that won't heal?

119
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,510
Granny, you're really smart.

120
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,680
Did you only just realize?

121
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,660
You shouldn't laugh while crying!

122
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,290
-Yes? 
-  Is this Ms. Yoon Ji Soo?

123
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,470
Who may this...?

124
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,110
 Hey! Ji Soo you don't even remember your bro's voice?

125
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,370
Sunbae Dong Jin?

126
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,160
Wow. Our Jisoo hasn't changed a bit.

127
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,620
The top three beauty of the class of '93 seems to still fit you well.

128
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,130
You too.

129
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,600
Of course. I don't look my age at all.

130
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,550
In fact, my problem is that I am constantly getting younger.

131
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,130
I feel like I'm going to become a baby at some point.

132
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,810
And in any case, my skills are also amazing.

133
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,160
Speaking of which, I will take this case for you. The child custody case.

134
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,860
Divorce is my specialty, so I can deal with the child custody case with my eyes closed.

135
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,820
"I never want to lose to my spouse." That is my firm's slogan.

136
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,830
Anyway, consider yourself really lucky because, with me, I can make a divorce into a winning lottery ticket.

137
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,490
- Sunbae. 
- Ah don't worry about it.

138
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,890
No need to thank me. Especially with a relationship like ours.

139
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,980
I'm not going to sue.

140
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,530
You're not? Ah, is it because of the fees?

141
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,750
Although it is true that I am the most expensive divorce attorney in all of Korea,

142
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,680
for you, especially, free of charge.

143
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,530
How could I take money from you?

144
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,810
I am grateful for your consideration.

145
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,910
However, I truly decided not to sue.

146
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,360
She canceled it? Why all of a sudden?

147
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,490
I wouldn't know.

148
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,740
You should have figured out exactly why.

149
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,820
Isn't it good news if she decides not to take action?

150
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,810
It would be weirder to quibble about why she won't be pursuing it.

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,610
- Hey Joon Woo 
- Yes.

152
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,390
It looks like you will have to tail someone.

153
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,030
I'll say that you took a vacation, so I'll use someone else for the time being. Move inconspicuously.

154
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,120
Yes. I understand. But, who will I be following?

155
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,520
Attorney Lee Se Hoon. Ji Soo's ex-husband.

156
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,680
From the time he leaves his house until the time he comes back

157
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,110
find out what he's doing, who he meets, and what he does without missing a single detail.

158
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,020
Yes. I understand.

159
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,270
Welcome.

160
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,140
- Hello. 
- Why do you greet me like that every time like we're strangers?

161
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,110
You should say "I'm home" instead.

162
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,810
Go wash up.

164
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,070
That boy is so much like a girl.

165
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,410
Is it because he's always with his mom?

166
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,720
We've decided to get back together.

167
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,220
What?

168
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,010
- Do what? 
- Reconcile.

169
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,720
Have you been swayed by that thing again? I told you to just bring the child.

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,490
It's been decided that way, so please deal with it.

171
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,090
If you show your discontent to Young Min, I won't see you, Mother.

172
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,700
We enjoyed seeing it.

173
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,910
How is this place?

174
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,220
I think it's nice.

175
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,320
You like it here and you liked the previous place too. You like them all?

176
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,050
You lack backbone for a boy, son.

177
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,520
One second. Keep playing okay?

178
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,880
 Dad said this is the house we will be living together in.

179
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,380
 Ji Soo

180
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,250
 - Hey, Hye-Jeong.  
 -Yeah?

181
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,800
When you have free time

182
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,300
what do you when you start to have too many thoughts because you have nothing to do?

183
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,810
I go home and hit the sack.

184
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,470
A lesson got canceled, so the time to go home is inconvenient.

185
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,050
Go drink coffee.

186
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,210
I won't be able to sleep then. I have trouble sleeping as it is.

187
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,650
Then just drink.

188
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,010
I'm not crazy though.

189
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,260
  Think about it carefully. It could be so.

190
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,480
Hey. What about Hon-Co-No?

191
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,590
Hon-Co-No?

192
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,570
Is that for boxing? Blue corner, red corner, something like that?

193
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:49,180
Goodness. "Alone Coin Karaoke." Don't you know? 
 (Hon-Co-No = Honja-Coin-Noraebang)

194
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:58,240
♫  Tonight,   ♫

195
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,310
♫  I couldn't tell you.    ♫

196
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:12,780
♫  Forgive me for expressing   ♫

197
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,820
♫  these feelings on paper  ♫

198
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:26,680
♫  For a long time  ♫

199
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,580
♫  I loved you so much I was scared.   ♫

200
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:40,720
♫  Now,   ♫

201
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:48,010
♫  I might regret that.  ♫

202
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:55,120
♫  But dear you,  ♫

203
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,220
♫  even if you forget everything else  ♫

204
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,530
♫  I hope you remember  ♫

205
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,460
♫  just this one thing.   ♫

206
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,760
♫  Just how much   ♫

207
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,350
♫  I ...   ♫

208
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:32,850
♫   love you, even now.  ♫

209
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:40,480
♫  How much I love you.  ♫

210
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,900
Are you okay?

211
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,190
You're getting remarried?

212
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,840
That's not something to be proud of when you live poorly.

213
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,090
You have to hurry and clean it up. You'll get hurt.

214
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,100
What's your real reason?

215
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,530
Is it Hyeong Jae Hyeon again?

216
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,840
It's not. It's because of Young Min.

217
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,730
But you got a divorce because of Young Min.

218
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,040
You know too much about me. I should keep my distance.

219
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,330
You... know nothing about me.

220
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,560
- Me? Hey, I even know what girls are your type— 
 - Ouch.

221
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,730
Does it hurt to press on it?

222
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,660
Maybe the glass got embedded, let's see.

223
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,540
Shine the light for me, please.

224
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,220
I don't think anything's in there, so why does it hurt?

225
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,630
It hurts because of you.

226
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,470
What are you saying?

227
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,810
I hurt because of you.

228
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
Because I like you.

229
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,320
I... like you.

230
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm not against your remarriage because that takes away my chance with you.

231
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:47,040
If that was the case, I wouldn't have just watched from afar for all these years.

232
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,630
There's no glass, so raise your hand above your head.

233
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,980
I saw in a movie

234
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,570
that if you finger is above your heart, it'll stop bleeding.

235
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,440
I just lost a friend.

236
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,860
Will you listen to me if I stay as a friend?

237
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,420
I didn't confess because I also didn't want to lose my only friend.

238
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,920
It wasn't too bad, because we had no reason to split up.

239
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,190
But I want to stop now.

240
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,730
I want to move from behind you to alongside you.

241
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,020
I can't watch you plod step by step into a hellish fire like that.

242
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,020
I'm going to interfere with your life, doggedly and severely.

243
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,510
Yeong Woo...

244
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,950
I don't think we can see each other anymore.

245
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,900
I won't be able to come here once I return to Yeong Min's dad,

246
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,090
but we're saying farewell earlier than I expected.

247
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,130
Put some ointment on it, instead of just a bandage. It won't be good if there isn't air to flow to it.

248
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,740
Push a vacuum and be sure to mop the floors.

249
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,530
Anyway, I'll be going now.

250
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,750
Thank you for everything, Yeong Woo.

251
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,980
And I'm sorry.

252
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,810
 Liberation of Labor

253
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,050
Okay.

254
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,950
 April 1995.   
 These are all things from your rented club room where you board.

255
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,290
Are you still not part of an anti-government group?

256
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,730
They are books about the history of philosophy.

257
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,310
And cultural books that are used in the school's electives.

258
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,980
"Building Socialism Through Worker Solidarity."

259
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,490
It's written here so blatantly, but it's an 'elective'?

260
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,010
Freedom of thought and conscience is protected by even the constitution.

261
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,980
How can it protect an ideal that wants to overturn society?
(The People Liberation student groups also sought to reconnect with North Korea. To this day, even so much as surfing a North Korean website is illegal.)

262
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,240
Ji Soo... has always been kind and full of affection since she was young.

263
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,120
As such, she couldn't be the lesser person, and as such, she didn't have a strong heart.

264
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,920
She's always let others ahead of her, endured losing out,

265
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,500
giving others whatever she had.

266
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,370
But what she got in return was always manipulation, betrayal, and empty hands.

267
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,320
Being that she always tugged at my heart as a pained finger, it was even more infuriating.

268
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,470
I was always worried that she might tread a thorny path.

269
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,620
If you don't give up Ji Soo,

270
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,960
you will rot for a few years in jail.

271
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,980
You won't be able to graduate or get a job in a company.

272
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,920
Are you using your public power for personal matters right now?

273
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,090
Well, you could think that.

274
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,550
I won't stay still.

275
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:26,780
I will tell the world you used your power as a prosecutor to censor and avenge personal matters.

276
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,330
Your parents are also here.

277
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,080
Ji Soo and your parents have said they will do anything for you.

278
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,370
What are you doing for them?

279
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,860
Are you doing something so great that their sacrifices

280
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,870
are something to be taken for granted?

281
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,080
Jae Hyeon.

282
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,690
Are you okay?

283
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,260
 Seoul Metropolitan Prosecutors Office

284
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,610
 Ji Soo and your parents,

285
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,070
 they have said they will do anything for you.

286
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,310
 What are you doing for them?

287
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,510
 Are you doing something so great that their sacrifices

288
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,580
 are something to be taken for granted?

289
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,130
Goodness...

290
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,290
  Warning
 Restricted Zone

291
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,640
Oh, Mother.  May 1995

292
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,490
Jae Hyeon doesn't need tofu because he wasn't actually in jail.

293
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,470
Still...

294
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,640
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

295
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,150
You're not going to jail anymore, right?

296
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,120
You will be able to graduate properly, too?

297
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,310
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

298
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,890
 Hanair, Frankfurt

299
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,190
Jae Hyeon and I both gave each other up.

300
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,810
So why do I have to study abroad?

301
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,930
I'm sorry, but I don't trust you.

302
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,330
"Out of sight, out of mind."

303
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,360
I trust this phrase more.

304
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,830
Now, you may feel like dying without him.

305
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,040
I guarantee in a month, you'll forget him.

306
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,350
On top of that, your major is classical music.

307
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,010
Go to where it originated and into the bigger world

308
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,230
to take your studies seriously.

309
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,330
Since when have you been so considerate of me?

310
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,740
Don't waste your money on a daughter that doesn't even please you and let me stay here.

311
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,960
Even if Chopin were to return from the dead, I wouldn't want to go.

312
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,230
If you know you haven't been pleasing me, then from now start doing as I say.

313
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,640
I really might die, you know.

314
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,840
That's too bad.

315
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,680
Why do you keep coming here instead of going to school to study?

316
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,130
I don't want to go to school.

317
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,390
Why? You practically lived at school before.

318
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,430
I don't want to see all my protesting juniors and seniors.

319
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,690
Why not? Do they say something to you?

320
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,550
It's because they don't say anything to me. They whisper behind my back.

321
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,010
What do they say behind your back then?

322
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,920
That I've been corrupted because of a girl.

323
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,620
That's not true.

324
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,810
You told me you broke up with her.

325
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,160
Are you okay?

326
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,230
I'm not going to school to try to be okay.

327
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,270
If I go to school, then Ji Soo is everywhere.

328
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,830
Ji Soo,

329
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,200
when you arrive at the Frankfurt airport, the homestay owner will be waiting for you. He's Korean.

330
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,610
Unni, apparently he's super good looking. You're so lucky!

331
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,810
Who cares if the homestay owner is good looking?

332
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,220
- Not the owner. 
 - Ji Yeong!

333
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,460
- What are you talking about? 
 - Huh?

334
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,780
It's nothing.

335
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,850
Won't you tell me?

336
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,080
He's the youngest son from the Seongkuk Industry, and I heard he's studying abroad near you.

337
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,940
Is this the Joseon Dynasty? Do you want me to get an arranged marriage?

338
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,450
What do you mean, marriage? I'm just saying try meeting him just once.

339
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:29,750
♫   Perhaps, someday we will remember   ♫

340
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:44,870
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  ♫

341
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:51,860
♫  Steeped in love, everything has passed by  ♫

342
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:59,060
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

343
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:05,160
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

344
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:12,420
♫  If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

345
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:19,980
♫  If we can reach that day, that time  ♫

346
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,080
  I've found you.   
 ♫  I would embrace you once  ♫

347
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,970
♫  and tell you  ♫

348
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,760
  I've found you.   
 ♫  Someday, far in the future  ♫

349
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,840
  Yoon Ji Soo  
 ♫  even after time has passed  ♫

350
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,520
I wondered whether or not to tell you...
 ♫  You are no longer a memory, but my everyday  ♫

351
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,380
But I think you should at least see her before she leaves.

352
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,140
I heard from another music major student

353
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,900
that Ji Soo is leaving the country today, to study abroad in Germany.

354
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:05,600
♫  We have perhaps passed by the same place  ♫

355
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:20,830
♫  Longing for a tomorrow that is the same, but also different  ♫

356
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:27,570
♫  The seasons come each time, calling you to me  ♫

357
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:34,150
♫  The seasons come each time, calling you to me  ♫

358
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:41,420
♫  If we can reach that day, that time  ♫

359
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,990
♫  I would embrace you once and tell you  ♫

360
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:55,340
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

361
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:05,190
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my everyday  ♫

362
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,200
But what is in Gangchon?

363
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,750
There is an inn run by a Sunbae I know

364
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,640
I could just stay at your house.

365
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,780
If I were your parents, the first place I'd look for you is at my house.

366
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,450
We could stay at the inn for a few days.

367
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,000
A few days won't be enough, though.

368
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,780
You are not planning to go back home?

369
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,170
I am not.

370
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,460
What do you plan to do then?

371
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,620
I plan to marry you.

372
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:55,030
  Gangchon

373
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,970
- Let's write here too 
 - Write what?

374
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,330
Jae Hyeon and Ji Soo were here.

375
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,620
Let's not do things like that.

376
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,560
I hear Germany's Heidelberg Castle is covered with Korean tourists' graffiti.

377
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,240
Don't talk about Germany.

378
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,250
  Hyeong Seong

379
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,980
It looks like he's planning to move.

380
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,110
- He's looking at houses. 
 - Houses?

381
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,670
Yes. Mainly single family houses in the suburban area.

382
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,180
He takes his son with him, when he goes to look at houses.

383
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,440
He takes Yeong Min?

384
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,710
Yes. It appears like they might live together.

385
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,410
  I'm hurting because of you. Because I like you.

386
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,350
 I... like you.

387
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:23,950
  I will give you time. If you need to tidy up anything, do so.

388
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,480
 Especially things like long-fermenting relationships.

389
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,110
  Dad said it's the house where we will live together.

390
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,410
Nothing is easy.

391
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,600
It's okay. It's okay.

392
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,840
You seem hurt.

393
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,550
I bumped into something.

394
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,190
Are you okay?

395
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,930
Yes, I am fine.

396
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,630
But then, why did you want to see me?

397
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,320
There is something I wanted to confirm.

398
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,490
I heard your ex-husband wanted to file for return of child custody.

399
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,910
I am sure that is why you sent Sunbae Dong Jin to me.

400
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:06,750
I heard the plans to file were canceled. Did your ex-husband decide to drop the complaint?

401
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,240
No.

402
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,980
We've decided to remarry.

403
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,820
Why would you choose to do such a thing?

404
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,620
Because I want to protect something.

405
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,800
What do you want to protect?

406
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,030
Yeong Min?

407
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,790
Will that really protect Yeong Min?

408
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,900
He is at an age where he needs his father,

409
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,050
and perhaps because he is a boy, there are limits to what I can do for him.

410
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,140
I will head off now.

411
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,710
Look after yourself, Sunbae.

412
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,160
People may not be tailing you, but many people have their eyes on you.

413
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,350
What do I mean by okay?

414
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,790
I can't even make decent ramyeon. How is it okay?

415
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,050
Nothing is okay.

416
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,040
I am a complete wreck.

417
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,740
I hit my head on something.

418
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,880
Why couldn't she just live a normal and relaxed life like them?

419
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,030
You must be busy with others things these days, yet I'm being burdensome again.

420
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,620
- Please accept a drink from me. 
 - Thank you, sir.

421
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,940
What do you mean, troublesome? Not at all.

422
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,410
All I did was put in word for them to follow proper procedure.

423
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,120
So it's exactly as you mentioned before, right?

424
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,570
In our country, whistleblowers who report

425
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:13,430
internal issues such as borrowed-name funds, accounting fraud, and embezzlement,

426
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,570
are not eligible to have their anonymity protected.

427
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,730
What kind of law was made so perfectly?

428
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,580
Of course, if the country protected those who aren't loyal

429
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,500
it would be difficult to do business.

430
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,360
There are no plea bargains in our country either,

431
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,910
so there's no way to negotiate with the prosecutor like they do in movies.

432
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,960
One must follow the laws and regulations to be considered a developed country.

433
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,980
Good work, Director Kim.

434
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,210
- Give him another drink. 
 - Yes, sir.

435
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,790
Sir, will it be okay to do that to your son-in-law?

436
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,420
They say you have to raise your children with the rod for them to mature properly.

437
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,410
The same goes for a dog you raise at home.

438
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,860
I was wondering how things were going.

439
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,410
We're going to remarry.

440
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,590
Did Yoon Ji Soo agree as well?

441
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,360
Of course.

442
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,500
I don't have a good feeling about this.

443
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,160
What are you talking about?

444
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,080
I think things are going the wrong direction.

445
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,020
They'll bend back.

446
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,980
Do you fully trust Yoon Ji Soo 100%?

447
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,140
I don't fully trust her, but I do fully know her.

448
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,300
Because she knows what she might lose, she won't try to go back on her word.

449
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,280
Is it... because of Jae Hyeon?

450
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,090
I agreed to work with you because I was desperate,

451
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,570
but what you call "love" is a little frightening to me.

452
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:56,350
How can you live with someone who says they will give up themselves for another man?

453
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,990
I thought you of all people would understand, CEO Jang.

454
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,860
Was I wrong?

455
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,130
Lee Se Hoon met with CEO Jang.

456
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,530
- Seo Kyeong? 
 - Yes.

457
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,880
I thought the black box camera in our car looked a little different,

458
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,330
so I took a look at it...

459
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,690
Where are we going today?
  Spring 2000

460
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,950
The Bundang location.

461
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,120
Gyeonggido? You're taking a car, right?

462
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,160
The subway.

463
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,020
Are you trying to save transportation fees for meal later?

464
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,460
You can't buy food to eat just because you have transportation fares left over.

465
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,470
 Bundang

466
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,480
What happened to your shoe?

467
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,720
How would I know?

468
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,520
I told you I didn't want to ride the subway!

469
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,910
Where did you lose it?

470
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,210
I don't know.

471
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,940
I'm going to call Driver Kim.

472
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,260
Where did you find it?

473
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,410
Where did you lose it?

474
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,560
I think it fell off as I was coming up the stairs.

475
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,010
I found it on the platform.

476
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,970
What happened to your face?

477
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,970
What's wrong with my face?

478
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,900
It's ugly.

479
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,370
What do you mean, it's ugly?

480
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,940
Everyone, fill your glasses.

481
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,600
We're starting a wave. Starting with me!

482
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,630
Clockwise.

483
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,810
I'm not going to drink.

484
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,530
- Be her Black Knight. (Drink it for her.) 
 - What?

485
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,350
Okay, we'll skip Seo Kyeong and start from Jae Hyeon.

486
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,550
That's not a wave then.

487
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,090
Seo Kyeong seems to be weak with alcohol, so drink it for her.

488
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:43,160
You acted like you were a stickler to the rules, arguing that it wasn't a wave or whatever.

489
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,610
Is it okay for you to be out here like this during your work hours?

490
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:50,100
Staff dinners are an extension of your work, I hear.

491
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,450
What is it? Why are you being like this?

492
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,560
There's something I've lost.

493
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,740
Lost? What is it?

494
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,730
Money?

495
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,720
A person.

496
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,220
I lost something, too.

497
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,140
My mom.

498
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:10,560
 From Ji Soo, back to Jae Hyeon. 1994

499
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,800
 I want to protect it.

500
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,960
 The End of That Summer

501
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,000
 Lee Se Hoon

502
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,220
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right?

503
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,510
I know.

504
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,590
You know what to prepare?

505
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,490
Yes.

506
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,710
  Certificate for Donation of Goods

507
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,450
  Hopeful Sharing Flea Market

508
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,660
 Sunbae Jae Hyeon

509
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,280
Do you have time to meet each other today?

510
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,730
I'll go to where you are.

511
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,510
No.

512
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,160
I'm a bit far away.

513
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,950
 The subway is approaching Gangchon.

514
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,090
 We are arriving at Gangchon station.

515
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,010
 Gangchon

516
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,970
 Jae Hyeon ♡ Ji Soo 
 They will be in love for a million years. May 12 1995

517
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,460
You must be tired, go ahead and sleep.

518
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,030
I'm not that tired.

519
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,310
Then shall we go out and exercise?

520
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,680
That's what they meant by the stars are covering the sky.

521
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,060
Aren't you worried?

522
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:45,370
I am worried about what else my dad might do.

523
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,160
Why is he going to such lengths?

524
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,850
He's a prosecutor now, but his goal is to get involved in politics.

525
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,240
So he needs money.

526
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:03,690
Getting me married into a wealthy family was his long-cherished dream.

527
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,120
He called you his dearest child...

528
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,590
Who?

529
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,890
You.

530
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,500
To whom?

531
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,620
Me.

532
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,450
Why?

533
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,830
Because I'm sorry.

534
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,910
Why are you sorry?

535
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,430
Because I love you.

536
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:44,160
♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

537
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:56,400
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  ♫

538
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,670
What did you say? I didn't hear it.

539
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:01,990
Forget it.

540
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:06,030
Come on, I really didn't hear. Can you say it one more time?

541
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:10,150
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

542
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,150
It's the last time. Listen carefully.

543
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,150
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

544
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,370
♫  the longing that is you  ♫

545
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:26,620
♫  if we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

546
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:33,880
♫  If we can reach that day, that time  ♫

547
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:40,410
♫  I would embrace you once and tell you  ♫

548
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:47,730
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

549
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:55,600
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

550
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,440
 Line 4 - to Yong San, Cheongnyangri

551
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,680
Ji Soo.

552
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,080
I found you again.

553
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,860
Good thing you're here.

554
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,610
 Report of Marriage

555
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,740
 Yoon Ji Soo

556
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,960
 Seal or Signature

557
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,250
 Report of Marriage

558
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,050
 Can we meet tomorrow? I have something I want to check.

559
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:53,370
Sunbae, we should

560
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,370
really end things between us now.

561
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:04,050
Even though so much time has passed, the fact that we still regret and long for each other

562
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,260
I think it's because we never properly broke up.

563
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,890
So, a real breakup.

564
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,540
Let's have a perfect goodbye.

565
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,790
I can't do that, Ji Soo.

566
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,750
I want to protect you.

567
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,560
♫  Please don’t say anything   ♫

568
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,590
It's not because I'm sorry,

569
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,690
and it's not because of regret or some sort of hope.

570
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,250
And it's not that I wished to have protected you.

571
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,190
I want to protect you.

572
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,510
And because of this one thing...

573
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,290
Like you did in the past.

574
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,770
♫  Don’t ask me   ♫

575
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,560
 This is the last train to Yong San.

576
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:08,250
♫  If it’s about the past   ♫

577
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:14,510
♫  Whatever the answer is  ♫

578
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:20,630
♫  The truth cannot be conveyed  ♫

579
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:27,490
♫  Just bury them in your heart  ♫

580
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:34,500
♫  Words you wanted to say  ♫

581
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:41,300
♫  What we called love  ♫

582
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:48,130
♫  Even the scattered memories  ♫

583
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:54,970
♫  We’ll see each other again  ♫

584
00:57:54,970 --> 00:58:01,760
♫  Give me a hug, when we do  ♫

585
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,700
♫  Although we could not today.  ♫

586
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:15,230
♫  Do that instead of saying you're sorry.   ♫

587
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,960
 In love for a million years. May 12 1995

588
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,570
 a love that flowers for a million years

589
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:29,370
♫  Instead of saying the words I love you  ♫

590
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,770
You were holding me hostage without me even realizing it.

591
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,270
You should have been more careful if you were going to do greater things.

592
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,160
You know what kind of world we live in.

593
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,450
You're going to need to stop what you're doing.

594
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,760
I don't have any plans to do that.

595
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,320
The video. You can release it to the world.

596
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,530
Are you sure it'll be okay? You're still under investigation.

597
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:18,700
I don't care. I have something to gain from this as well.

598
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:28,370
Take the child from the mother who committed adultery.

599
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,920
And Ji Soo who lost her child, I will take her.

600
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:45,180

601
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:56,420
♫  the season that is you  ♫

602
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,330
♫  such beauty I have never encountered before  ♫

603
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,260
 When My Love Blooms

604
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,360
 I've decided to interfere in Ji Soo's life.

605
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,380
 Right now, I'm afraid that Ji Soo will disappear.

606
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,350
 Goodbye, Sunbae.

607
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,740
 I realized what it is you lost.

608
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,280
 Did you know Jae Hyeon has a woman?

609
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,070
 What if something happens to you while I'm gone?

610
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:28,910
 I'm not going to avoid it. I'll confront it.

611
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,380
 Whether it be someone or fate.
