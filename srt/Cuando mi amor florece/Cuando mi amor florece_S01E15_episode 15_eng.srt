 When my Love Blooms

3
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,650
 I will still continue loving you, as always and forever,

4
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,790
 but I will do the things I believe are right,

5
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,900
 and I'm going to take the side of those with whom nobody else will side.

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,520
 Just like we were able to love again, I hope you can return to those times.

7
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:12,450
 - I'm going to return. 
 - To where? 
 - The place I was long ago.

8
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,830
 I have something to tell you. I hope you'll come meet me.

9
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,960
 It's something important. Nine o'clock. At the snack cart where we met last time.

10
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,260
Ah really.

11
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,500
Hello.

12
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,290
Yes, hello.

13
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,030
I'm the father of Kwon Hyeok Soo, who died unjustly because of you.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,040
- Sir— 
 - Why?!

15
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,160
Oh no! No! Oh my goodness!

16
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,440
Ji Soo.

17
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,070
Oh no...

 Episode 15

20
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,620
Sir. Come to your senses.

21
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,470
You were arrested on the scene and with the weapon, so the warrant will be issued right away.

22
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,300
If the victim dies, you will be indicted for murder without delay.

23
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,740
If you know a lawyer, you should call that person right now.

24
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,700
- Are you his guardian? 
 - Pardon?

25
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,350
Are you not the patient's spouse?

26
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,080
No.

  Yeonhui University Hospital

29
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,560
What happened?

30
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,630
He is the father of an employee who suicided some years ago.

31
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,410
He sued the Vice President not long ago and lost the case.

32
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,400
It seems he was harboring a grudge over this matter.

33
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
And what about him?

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,380
They said he was arrested at the scene.

35
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,140
You weren't together with Jae Hyeon?

36
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,830
My apologies.

37
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,630
Then this happened while Jae Hyeon was alone?

38
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,250
I was together with him.

39
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,200
Secretary Kang. Don't let anyone who isn't his family come into this room.

40
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,010
If I go there, will it change a thing, revive the dead or kill the living?

41
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,710
 Okay, I got it.

42
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,820
Come back home, you too. Will anything change because you're there?

43
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,170
Sunbae. Go in first.

44
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,100
Okay, come quick.

45
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,850
Ji Soo.

46
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,770
What do I do, Hye Jeong?

47
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,560
What if he doesn't wake up?

48
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,550
Why are you crying out here, instead of going inside?

49
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,970
I called the ambulance right away, but... He'll be fine, right?

50
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,790
It's all right.

51
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,720
It took me some time to find my phone and call. He'll really be fine, right?

52
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,700
What will happen to him?

53
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
He will wake up for sure.

54
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,200
Yes, he will.

55
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,280
I know over a hundred reasons

56
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,850
why he needs to wake up.

57
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,250
I also know five or six reasons.

♫  Beyond that hill the sun leans on  ♫

65
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,740
But why did you cry? 
  (Song: "On such a day", Jo Dong Ik and Lee Byeong Wu - duo 'Someday', 1989)

66
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,640
Who cried? Me?

67
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,410
Who do you think?

68
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,150
Why would I cry?

69
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,020
It's fine. I cry all the time.

70
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
I really like you being like this.

71
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,250
You go from using super violent words like "fight," "damage," "rebuke,"

72
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,880
to crying over a sweet movie or song.

73
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,190
It's so cute.

74
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,150
Wh-What's with you?

75
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,090
Cute. Let's go together, cutie pie.

Ji Soo.

79
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,730
Yes.

80
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,540
Are you in a lot of pain?

81
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,770
Lets talk outside.

82
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,740
Everything is over at Hyeonjeo-dong.

83
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,720
What are you talking about?

84
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,260
In the end everyone got kicked out.

85
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,900
It looks like they were completely determined when they came this time.

86
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,850
Is that how he got hurt?

87
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,710
What about you? Are you okay?

88
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,720
There was nothing we could do.

89
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:23,950
Nevertheless, if there are more people like you, the world will get better.

The surgery was successful, but we have to wait for him to regain consciousness.

100
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,510
- Is there some kind of problem? 
 - No, it's not that.

101
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,790
It's just that everyone's recovery speed is different.

102
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,960
I see. Thank you.

103
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,210
- The surgery is over. 
 - How did it go?

104
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,890
- He has been moved to a ward but he's not yet awake. 
 - Why?

105
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,060
They said it's because everyone's recovery speed is different.

106
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,800
So we don't know yet.

107
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,480
Let's go back first, okay? Or else you might even die before Sunbae Jae Hyeon.

108
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,960
I'll go after I see him wake up.

109
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,180
It might take a few days, you should go home.

110
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,240
- Look at how cold your body is. 
 - I'll just stay a little while.

111
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,040
Do you want to be buried here?

112
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,860
Let's go. I said let's go.

113
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,580
Let's go.

114
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,050
 I wish you would rather disappear.

115
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,970
Since when did you start listening to me.

116

 Hyeon Seong Distribution Vice President Han Jae Hyeon in critical condition after attack by unidentified assailant

117
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,780
Hello.

118
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,620
  Is this  Lee Se Hoon?

119
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,860
It is, how can I help you?

120
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,680
 Do you know Kwon Pil Ho?

121
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,990
Yes I do, what is this about?

122
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,730
He said that you are his lawyer, is that right?

123
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,270
No, I'm not.

124
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,990
 My son didn't commit suicide.

125
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,440
 He was forced to death by this company and Han Jae Hyeon.

126
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,120
 I'll let you see for yourself what Han Jae Hyeon did.

127
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,180
Jae Hyeon, what is going on.

128
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,580
What about the surgery?

129
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,130
They said it went well.

130
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,420
All that is left is for him to wake up. Don't worry too much.

131
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,530
Have you been well?

132
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,310
Does it look like I've been well?

133
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:08,630
Is seems like Jae Hyeon was overly loyal and he did things he wasn't asked to.

134
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,400
And with that, he made himself enemies everywhere.

135
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,530
It seems like you're uncomfortable, I'll come back later.

136
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,390
This is a very good opportunity for us.

137
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,630
While he is lying down there, let's prepare all the things that need to be prepared and do everything that needs to be done.

138
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,380
Dad.

139
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,710
Even if he's just a hunting dog like you said, shouldn't you  not  be doing this?

140
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,640
Then what do we do?

141
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,790
It's exactly because he was acting as your hunting dog that he ended up like that.

142
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,890
If you look after him with your most earnest devotion,

143
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,820
do you think that when he wakes up he'll want to work things out with you?

144
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,010
Do you think he'll say, "I'll live as a loyal hunting dog for the rest of my days"?

145
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,740
Get your head on straight.

146
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,100
There may not be guns involved but this is a battlefield.

147
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:22,260
I was worried that you'd live a lonely, sad life like your father.

148
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,410
So I pretended not to notice, even if you lived as if you were another person.

149
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,670
But it looks like that came back to you in this way.

150
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,700
I know that you were in charge of the lawsuit filed by the elder who was doing a one-man protest.

151
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,080
What about that?

152
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,500
That man stabbed Jae Hyeon.

153
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm aware of this. It was on the news.

154
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,680
The news didn't say who the culprit was.

155
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,810
This won't just pass by without a hitch.

156
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,370
Are you implying that I did something?

157
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,740
When the security guards destroyed his picket sign,

158
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,140
he just turned around and sighed. He's that kind of person.

159
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,840
He's not someone who would deliberately chase after a person to harm them.

160
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,640
Are you his family member?

161
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,620
How many times have you seen him that you are this certain?

162
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,270
We'll just have to see about that.

163
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,150
Did you come here to threaten me?

164
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,170
No, I came here to confirm something.

165
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,700
 Hello, Sir. I went out to get a drink and I'm calling you from there.

166
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,650
 I saw someone I wasn't happy to see.

167
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,390
  Han Jae Hyeon seems to be living a nice life as usual.

168
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,260
 This is a bar in front of Hyeong Seong headquarters.

169
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,760
 Yes.

170
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,690
Are you okay?

171
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,150
You had surgery. Do you feel pain anywhere?

172
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,320
Are you looking for someone?

173
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,450
There's no point looking for her. She can't come here.

174
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,250
As of now, I'm still your wife and it's my duty to nurse you.

175
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,540
You can't stay in a hotel in your current state.

176
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,960
If you're really worried, I'll deliver the message.

177
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,430
that you woke up.

178
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,870
Should I tell her?

179
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,400
- No. 
 - I understand.

180
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,830
I'll go get Joon Seo and bring him here. In the meantime, keep Jae Hyeon company.

181
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,920
I understand.

182
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,370
In Kwon Pil Ho's call history,  you should find Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

183
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,670
We already looked through his call record, of course. Did you come all the way here to say this?

184
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,250
I'm here to tell you about Lee Se Hoon's relationship

185
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,810
with both parties involved in this case.

186
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,890
 I'm the father of Kwon Hyeok Soo, who died wrongfully because of you.

187
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,000
You shouldn't sit up yet, though.

188
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,670
- It's time for you to go home. 
 - It's alright, I'm okay.

189
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,390
I'm not okay.

190
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,030
Does love change?

191
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,680
What on earth are you talking about?

192
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,040
Why do you keep putting up a wall with me?

193
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,940
I'm feeling distressed by the fact that I didn't protect you.

194
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,060
So please don't push me away.

195
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,460
It seems like you are able to understand me now.

196
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,830
Then I'll step outside for a while.

197
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,540
I'm going to come back.

198
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Come here, Joon Seo.

199
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,650
Why are you crying?

200
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,130
Dad, I thought you were going to die.

201
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,800
I didn't die, so stop crying. Come here.

202
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,470
My dear son.

203
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,680
I am here as Kwon Pil Ho's lawyer, the suspect in Han Jae Hyeon's assault.

204
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,000
Have a seat.

205
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,580
- Lee Se Hoon? 
 - Yes.

206
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,290
You can't be Kwon Pil Ho's lawyer.

207
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,800
What do you mean?

208
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,080
We had planned to summon you as a testifier, actually.

209
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,220
You made a phone call with Mr. Kwon Pil Ho two hours before the event, is that right?

210
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,600
I called to see how he was doing. Is that a problem?

211
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,540
If it's his last call before the assault, then it is indeed a problem.

212
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,610
There was discord between you and the victim, too.

213
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm on my way to your house, so come out in around ten minutes.

214
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,920
Will you really not go?

215
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,880
They said he woke up, why would I go there? It's not like I'm a doctor.

216
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,220
And I am?

217
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,570
If you're going to beat yourself up and tear your hair out, let's go together before you get bald.

218
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,670
I won't. My hair is precious.

219
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,820
Will you really be okay if you don't to go?

220
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,710
Alright, don't worry about anything.

221
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,880
The way I see it, he'll soon be on his feet and be running everywhere.

222
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,720
Go on.

223
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,260
He woke up. He's awake.

224
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,190
I kept telling them not to come, but they still did.

225
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,710
- Why would you come all the way here? Seriously. 
 - They have a beautiful heart.

226
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,850
It's so embarrassing.

227
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,610
Why did you come all the way here, really? Welcome, anyway.

228
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,640
Ji Soo couldn't come.

229
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,690
Something came up.

230
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,920
- Doesn't your stomach hurt? 
 - Of course it does.

231
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm okay.

232
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,130
Isn't it something where you need a good fart to get it over with?

233
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,780
- Sunbae, come on. 
 - What? This is really important!

234
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,040
- When you get your stomach cut open and sewn back, it's important to let it out, be it a small or a big one. 
 - That's enough.

235
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,720
Let's take a picture together, to celebrate you getting better.

236
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,920
What are you talking about? Why a picture, out of the blue?

237
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,700
I've become addicted to social media these days, you see. Okay, anyway.

238
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,640
- Gather around, quick. 
 - Why take a picture in front of a bedridden person? 
 - Come on, gather around.

239
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,090
- Ah seriously, so annoying. 
 - Look here, one, two three.

240
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,540
 Sunbae looks alright, see?

241
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,720
 Incoming call: Jang Seo Kyeong

242
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,200
Yes?

243
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,720
  I'm in front of your house. Can you come out for a moment?

244
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,770
What is it about?

245
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,260
Jae Hyeon woke up.

246
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,780
If you were worried to death like this, how did you manage to stay apart all this time?

247
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,560
Did that happen while you were with Jae Hyeon?

248
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,060
You can resent me.

249
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,920
If I'd only gone there a bit earlier...

250
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,790
I could have prevented it.

251
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,360
Had I known there was someone like you,

252
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,760
then I wouldn't have chased after Jae Hyeon from the start.

253
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,120
I'm sorry.

254
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,570
I realize that I've never properly apologized to you.

255
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,900
I am really sorry.

256
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,870
If you are sorry, please give up.

257
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,730
I'm also tired of saying this,

258
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:15,630
but then I won't throw hostilities and I'll stop tormenting the people around you.

259
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,810
I am desperately asking this of you.

260
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,970
I can also get on my knees.

261
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,910
If I get on my knees, will you give up?

262
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,630
There's something I promised to Sunbae.

263
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:43,130
That I would never disappear without a word.

264
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:51,090
That we wouldn't be thrust apart, be it by fate or by someone else.

265
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,580
Then just live like that.

266
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,250
Since I can't ever give up either.

267
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:31,340
Stay home at least until you are fully recovered.

268
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,270
I'll stay at my mother's house.

269
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,090
It'll be hard on you to go back and forth there.

270
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,240
I think it's better.

271
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,340
Is it because of Yoon Ji Soo?

272
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,560
She said she'd give you up.

273
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,870
I met her to tell her that you woke up.

274
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,530
She said that you getting stabbed and you're family being wrecked

275
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,130
all felt like it was her fault.

276
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,230
Really. She said she will leave.

277
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,780
I'll stay at my mother's house.

278
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,840
My mother wishes I can be by her side, too.

279
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,140
Are you not going to contact Yoon Ji Soo?

280
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,860
She seemed very shocked.

281
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,470
She was at the scene with you, and she got on the ambulance as well.

282
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,350
She cried a lot.

283
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,620
Do you really think she said she would leave?

284
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,220
That can't be true.

285
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,040
But I want to first put down my burden, and then take my time to see her.

286
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,870
I should first see my mother, the elderly man, and Chairman Jang.

287
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,950
As expected. Elders first.

288
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,480
You've grown up, uh?

289
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,840
Why did you come again today?

290
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,570
I'm stuck to you like chewing gum.

291
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,690
Thank you for all you did, Ji Soo.

292
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,110
I know you've been going to my house every day.

293
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,370
And I know you gathered signatures for the petition, too.

294
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,350
I've been so busy these days that I couldn't take care of the lawsuit.

295
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,900
I plan on getting back to it. Everything is ready.

296
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,500
I can take over now, really.

297
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,810
Well, that's one thing.

298
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,670
On that day, you went to meet him, right?

299
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,630
The day you kept looking at the clock of the hospital ward.

300
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,280
Yes.

301
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,280
And you two, it's true?

302
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:59,920
I didn't even know that and was cursing him out, called him vicious and a bad guy. You must have hated me in your head.

303
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,680
I didn't.

304
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,660
Everything you said was true, after all. He's vicious and a bad guy.

305
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,690
How did you manage to fight all this time? Against the person you love.

306
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,050
I learned to fight like that.

307
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,610
And since I learned that when I was young, it's even harder to unlearn.

308
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,510
Who was your teacher? That person must have had very firm teaching ways.

309
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,300
 Jae Hyeon was discharged.

310
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:44,670
We should be careful that Joon Seo's feelings don't get hurt too much.

311
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,670
I'm scared he'll go around doing mean things again, if his father isn't around.

312
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,920
I won't bury myself in work like I used to.

313
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,370
I plan on hanging out and playing with him more often than when we lived together.

314
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:08,940
No matter how much you do for him, it'll always feel windy in his heart.

315
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,170
I'll probably come here often with Joon Seo.

316
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,020
Would you?

317
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:25,420
When I'm here like this, I feel like the wind is calming down and my mind becomes at ease.

318
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,190
My mom is so pretty.

319
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,330
 A happy correction for a happy nation.

320
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:05,610
I lost my mind at the thought of my son and my wife.

321
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:16,180
Elder, my father also passed away like your son.

322
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,300
He was working at Hyeong Seong as well.

323
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,660
He liked people and cherished the company that allowed him to see these people every day.

324
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,280
For the people he liked and the company he cherished,

325
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,350
he worked extremely hard.

326
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,920
He went through the same thing as Hyeok Soo.

327
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,290
And like Hyeok Soo, he left this world.

328
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,480
After losing my father in this manner, I lived carrying a knife in my heart (harboring vengeful thoughts).

329
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,290
If there is someone in this world who can understand you better than anyone else,

330
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,440
that would be me.

331
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,460
All the time I was bearing that knife, my wounds didn't heal.

332
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,650
And I couldn't cut it off either.

333
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,630
I could neither grab that knife

334
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,660
nor let go of it and was carrying it inside.

335
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,030
I lived with it until now.

336
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,010
I didn't know this.

337
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,750
I am sorry.

338
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,850
Do not be, Elder.

339
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,460
On the contrary, I want to thank you.

340
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,120
That knife I couldn't let go of all this time,

341
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,840
you made me put it down.

342
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,310
 Battle for shares in Hyeong Seong Group, stock value shoots up with the whales fight.

343
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,930
How much did the stock price increase?

344
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,990
It increased by 30% compared to yesterday. It's reaching the upper limit price every day.

345
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,210
What's the cause?

346
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,080
The stock market sees our capital increase as a dispute over management rights.

347
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,930
The opposing side also filed for an injunction to stop the capital increase,

348
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,190
and they even made a public declaration of purchase, saying they will keep buying stocks.

349
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,320
How much more money do you think we'll need to achieve the recapitalization?

350
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,090
At this rate, at least three times more...

351
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,680
Do you know how much that amounts to? It's over a trillion won ($1B USD)!

352
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,080
I don't have that kind of ready money!

353
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,120
This matter started because of shares, and I can't sell my shares.

354
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,110
My apologies.

355
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,590
How many shares is their side purchasing?

356
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,160
They announced that they are buying a thousand every day.

357
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,200
Do we have the money to continue with the recapitalization?

358
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,930
That is the question.

359
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,970
From the start, he never intended to prevent the recapitalization!

360
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,470
It also seems like they will request an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders.

361
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,830
A stockholders' general meeting?

362
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,210
That means he wants to settle things once and for all.

363
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,790
Call that guy here.

364
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,170
He is currently on sick leave after his discharge—

365
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,820
What sick leave, I can't believe this!

366
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,190
That guy has a lifeline that's as long as a rope! He even got over being stabbed!

367
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,730
By the way, shouldn't you have been the ones to do what that old man did, in the first place?

368
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,770
The dogs have their stomach full,

369
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,620
so the master is worn out.

370
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,540
Kwon Pil Ho finally talked.

371
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,060
He told us what you spoke to him about on the phone that day.

372
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:02,740
I said that I saw someone, what he was doing, and where&gt; Is that a crime?

373
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,010
You can figure out whether it was a crime or not when you go to court.

374
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,670
But why did Kwon Pil Ho suddenly change his mind?

375
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:14,140
Well, I don't know about that. Even if I did, I cannot tell you.

376
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,930
Come in. You went through a lot, didn't you?

377
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,190
How is it, are you feeling better?

378
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,330
Yes.

379
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,350
I went to visit you at the hospital myself. Your wife told you,  I suppose.

380
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,260
Yes, thank you.

381
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,580
Let us take a seat to talk.

382
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,060
Seeing how I cannot easily call you a hunting dog,

383
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,540
I guess you grew up quite a lot.

384
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,010
You think you've become something important?

385
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,110
Seeing that you are being careful with your words, I guess I have indeed become something important.

386
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,860
Having pushed your way this far is your talent.

387
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,430
I should value you highly for that.

388
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:27,730
Tell me. Have you done a lot of thinking while you were lying down in the hospital?

389
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,880
I couldn't do anything else besides think.

390
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,920
We've shown our cards on both sides now,

391
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,700
so now tell me yourself. What do you plan on doing now?

392
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,530
You should step down now.

393
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,880
Step down?

394
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,830
You're telling me to step down from my position as chairman?

395
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,010
I know very well you cannot keep up with the recapitalization through to the end.

396
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,420
It's not that I cannot, it's that I choose not to. Do you know why?

397
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,670
Because Hyeong Seong Group was mine from the start. Why would I need to exert myself to demonstrate that?

398
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,950
As the largest shareholder, I will apply for an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders.

399
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,810
To change the chairman? Do you think you will win?

400
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,810
Even if I cannot win, I won't lose easily.

401
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,360
Did you come all the way here to play with words?

402
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,690
I will do my best.

403
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,640
And that will be my last best.

404
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,860
 Seoul ↔ Yangpyeong

405
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,140
 He said he's staying at his mother's house. In Yangpyeong.

406
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,890
By chance...

407
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,520
It's you, right?

408
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,750
The one my Jae Hyeon liked.

409
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,180
You haven't changed one bit.

410
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,900
You are still as beautiful as when you were young.

411
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,800
I heard a little bit about you from Jae Hyeon.

412
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,510
You went through many hardships, but you stayed upright.

413
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,260
That's not true. I became really twisted.

414
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,460
I was very disobedient, too.

415
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,290
There are people like that.

416
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:00,850
People who are so unbelievably kind. People like you.

417
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:09,920
Even if the world seems to be moved by the wicked and violent people,

418
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,690
the truth is, it's those kind people that are constantly pushing the world forward.

419
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,750
That's what I think.

420
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,260
Ji Soo.

421
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,520
Are you all right?

422
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,060
I thought I was going to die.

423
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,540
Me too. I thought the surgery went wrong.

424
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,680
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

425
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,440
The reason I came

426
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,180
is that last time you asked to meet because you had something to say.

427
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,780
I was curious about that. I'm someone who cannot hold in her curiosity.

428
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,910
I didn't ask, though.

429
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,400
You didn't?

430
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,790
I thought you did.

431
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:05,210
When I walked all night with you back in the days, I thought we would walk like that forever.

432
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,210
But it took so long for us to come back here.

433
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,410
Will you really come back?

434
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm almost there already.

435
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,250
Thanks to someone.

436
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,210
I probably wouldn't have been able to come on my own.

437

00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,050
- I can just go to a hotel. 
 - Will you be fine?

♫  If you just love  ♫

460
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,190
Go in.

461
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,760
Go ahead first.

462
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,160
No, you go in first.

463
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,650
I'm already here, so I'll go in after seeing you off.

464
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,760
Then let's both go at the same time.

465
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,160
Turn around when I count to three, okay?

466
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,950
One, two...

467
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,500
Three!

468
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,510
Don't eat dinner. Let's go eat out somewhere nice.

469
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,020
I don't eat dinner late. You know that, right?

470
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,160
I'll be back soon.

471
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,130
I've made the stockholders' title closure announcement.

472
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,100
It's until June 5th, and the extraordinary stockholders meeting is twenty days later.

473
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,890
What about the meeting with those people?

474
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,150
It's today at three.

475
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,260
There he is!

476
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,060
Chairman Jang!

477
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,860
Chairman Jang!

478
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,800
Why are there so many of those things?

479
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,590
I'm sorry.

480
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,470
Tell them we'll pull all our ads if they release any weird articles.

481
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,320
Yes, understood.

482
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,010
Chairman Jang, just a word, please!

483
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,570
Do you acknowldege the charges?

484
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,480
How much do you plan on revealing today?

485
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,400
Do you acknowledge the charges?

486
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,310
- What do you have to say on the matter? 
 - Do you acknowledge the charges?

487
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,860
Please look this way!

488
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,290
Chairman Jang, just one word, please!

489
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,630
Hello, Chairman.

490
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,820
I'm Prosecutor Kang Seung Won from Seoul Central District's Special 2nd Division.

491
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,960
Prosecutor Kang, it's nice to meet such a famous man.

492
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,780
I ask you to look out for me today. I have some plans for the evening.

493
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,570
I'm the one who should be asking for your favor. I have a lot of things to ask you, too.

494
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,050
Today's going to be quite a busy day.

495
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,460
  Our marriage had been over since before I meet Ji Soo.

496
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,440
  I was indifferent. You were seeing another man.

497
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:03,510
  When my fight with your father is over, one of us will be paying for our sins.

498
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:09,460
  Whether that's me or your father, it will be hard for you to handle.

499
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:14,730
  If you look after him with your most earnest devotion, do you think that when he wakes up he'll want to work things out?

500
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:20,170
 Do you think he'll say "I'll live as a loyal hunting dog for the rest of my days"?

501
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,840
  There's something I promised to Sunbae.

502
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,670
  That I would never disappear without a word.

503
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,430
  That we wouldn't be thrust apart,

504
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,270
 be it by fate or by someone else.

505
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,430
 Looking for friends at the Sparkle Sparkle Piano House

506
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,820
Mom.

507
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,920
The things I've inquired about so far have been matters for which the statute of limitations have expired or are special cases between relatives

508
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,890
where we have a record of a criminal offense but cannot indict you.

509
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,200
However, your confirmation was in line

510
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,950
with the results from our internal review.

511
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,260
You've worked hard, Prosecutor Kang. Now.

512
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,460
One moment, Chairman.

513
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,930
From this moment forward, Hyeong Seong Group's Chairman, Jang San,

514
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,180
Executive Director Hwang Ak Soo, and Department Head Im Yeong Geun of Management Support

515
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,560
are under investigation for bribery, embezzlement, professional negligence,

516
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,890
violation of National Tax Collection Act, Capital Market Law... There are so many.

517
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:43,750
The Labor Standards Act, and the Labor Union Act. You are now suspects for the aforementioned charges.

518
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,540
I'm not sure if you know this, but Jae Hyeon is trying to take our company.

519
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,590
Simply put, it's stealing.

520
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:04,430
He's trying to drive out the original owner and gain power and riches.

521
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:08,650
Don't self-righteous people like you dislike this kind of stuff?

522
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,030
It is exactly on the opposite side

523
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,430
of what you and your colleagues want.

524
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,970
 Will you really come back?

525
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,520
 I'm already almost there.

526
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,900
 Thanks to someone.

527
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,000
- Chairman. 
 - Yes.

528
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,910
They say Vice President Han Jae Hyeon has called together the joint labor-management council representatives and labor union executives.

529
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,620
That jerk.

530
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,080
I wonder what he's thinking.

531
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,500
He's trying to move our shares!

532
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,650
All while I'm not around!

533
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,690
This ungrateful...

534
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:07,200
 Hyeong Seong

535
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,100
So what is it that you want to say?

536
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,900
Unless your principle is to overlook the faults of the one you love,

537
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,020
please stop Jae Hyeon.

538
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:31,000
You're the only person who can stop him.

539
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,010
 Confirmation of Intent of Divorce

540
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,870
If you stop Jae Hyeon, I will leave.

541
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,880
Completely.

542
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:25,630

543
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:36,300
  When My Love Blooms

544
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,930
 There's only one thing I want.

545
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,210
 For you to change.

546
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,340
 I am going to request the dismissal of CEO Jang Seo Kyeong.

547
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,800
 Why did you marry me?

548
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:54,190
 I thought love could work with effort, too.

549
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,490
 I want you to be happy.

550
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,490
 Will we be able to meet again?

551
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,520
 We'll be able to meet again.

552
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:08,710
♫  We can't know where the beginning ends  ♫
