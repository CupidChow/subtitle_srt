 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,310
 Jae Hyeon♡Ji Soo
will love each other for a million years. 1995.5.12

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,210
 The most beautiful, happiest time of our lives for a million years

5
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,910
Sunbae,

6
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,380
we should really end things between us now.

7
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,020
Even though so much time has passed,

8
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,060
the fact that we still regret and long for each other,

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,340
I think it's because we never properly broke up.

10
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,900
So, a real breakup.

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,030
Let's have a perfect goodbye.

12
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,550
I can't do that, Ji Soo.

13
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,710
I want to protect you.

14
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,400
It's not because I feel guilty,

15
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,190
and it's not because of regret or some sort of hope.

16
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,840
And it's not that I wished to have protected you.

17
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,730
I want to protect you.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
And because of this one thing...

19
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,500
Like you did in the past.

20
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,020
Only twenty-something years out of a million years?

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,390
We've only just taken one step. We can't end things now.

22
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,940
I know why you made the choice that you made.

23
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,800
You made that choice because of me, so I'm going to make it right.

24
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,390
You were holding me hostage without me even realizing it.

25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,110
You should have been more careful if you were going to do greater things.

26
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,010
You know what kind of world we live in.

27
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,500
You're going to need to stop what you're doing.

28
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,810
I don't have any plans to do that.

29
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,010
The video. You can release it to the world.

30
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,360
Are you sure it'll be okay? You're still under investigation.

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,630
I don't care. 
  Lee Se Hoon - L&amp;J Law Firm

32
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,450
I have something to gain from this as well.

33
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,140
Take the child from the mother who committed adultery.

34
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,020
And Ji Soo who lost her child, I will take her.

35
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,580
A long time ago, Jae Hyeon

36
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,260
said he had lost something.

37
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,640
He had really sad eyes.

38
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,710
That something is you, Yoon Ji Soo, right?

39
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,960
It must be true if you're not denying it.

40
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm curious.

41
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,620
Why did you guys break up when you loved each other so much?

42
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,220
You guys are taking turns making fools out of us.

43
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,980
It's as if you guys planned this, saying you'll give yourselves up for each other.

44
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,570
If you loved each other so terribly, why did you break up?

45
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,190
I've told you my intentions, so I'll excuse myself now.

46
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,440
I left him.

47
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,150
Can I ask why you did that?

48
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,420
My life crumbled to pieces in an instant.

49
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,360
My anger and despair was so intense and on edge

50
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,270
that I felt like I would hurt him, too.

51
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm not too sure, but if it was that hard, couldn't you share your suffering with him?

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,020
If I shared my suffering, instead of the suffering becoming less,

53
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,590
we would have both become monsters.

54
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,580
Let me go to that bar you run.

55
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,900
Are you sure you'll be okay?
  Episode 8

56
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,820
You can't hold your drink.

57
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,610
Why do you remember stuff like that?

58
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,160
Because you were my idol.

59
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,390
I liked you, you were cool, and I wanted to be like you.

60
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,250
I only joined the student movement because you did it.

61
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,540
I didn't care whether the world changed or not.

62
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,950
But what you're doing now

63
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,060
only looks greedy, selfish, and lingering on regret.

64
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,900
I decided to intervene in Ji Soo's life.

65
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,420
What are you going to do?

66
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,040
She can't be with that other guy, but

67
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,210
she also can't be with you, Hyung.

68
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,410
So it can only be you?

69
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,210
It doesn't have to be me

70
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,560
as long as Ji Soo becomes happy.

71
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,210
Yeah.

72
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,100
It's what you and I both want for her, but it's so difficult.

73
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,540
Hyung,

74
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,730
did you mean what you said in front of Lee Se Hoon, earlier?

75
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,020
I meant it, Yeong Woo.

76
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,120
If that situation arises, I'm going to take Ji Soo.

77
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,020
 Family Relations Certificate

78
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,930
 You haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right? And you know what to prepare?

79
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,320
 I know why you made the choice that you made.

80
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,330
 And I know that it's a choice you made for me, so I'll be the one to make it right.

81
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,850
 Where are you right now? I'll come to you.

82
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,590
 Jae Hyeon Sunbae

83
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,030
 Don't do it, Ji Soo.

84
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,120
 If you make another foolish decision,

85
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,270
 I'm going to make a foolish decision, too.

86
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,220
If you move forward with the remarriage,

87
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm going to release the video to the public.

88
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,390
You're going to lose everything you have.

89
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,890
I'll probably lose everything, yes.

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,430
I might get rocks thrown at me on the streets.

91
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,930
 But Ji Soo, try to remember

92
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,690
why we broke up.

93
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,630
But do you really know how to cook?
  May 1995

94
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,810
I started cooking for myself since middle school

95
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,740
because my mom and dad were both at work.

96
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,240
You had to be mature at an early age.

97
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,330
Kids who are alone tend to mature quicker.

98
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,320
It makes me feel kind of bad, but

99
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,280
I also think it's good too. How should we raise our kids in the future?

100
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,950
- Are you okay? 
- We would like to interrupt for just a moment.

101
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,240
You are Han Jae Hyeon, correct?

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,780
You are currently on the wanted list for disobeying a summons to your mandatory military enlistment.

103
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,430
On May 20th, 1995 at 11:05 am you are being arrested.

104
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,460
Grab onto him gently. You're hurting him!

105
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,940
Don't worry and just go home.

106
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,420
It's because of me. I think my Dad did this.

107
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,830
You said you deferred your enlistment.

108
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,390
Take care of my things that are at the persimmon tree house.

109
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,410
They're expensive, so don't just take them and run away okay?

110
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,880
Just for a short time. I'll see you later after a very short time.

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,580
Where are you?

125
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,300
I'm sorry for going back on my words,

126
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,190
but I don't think I can go back to you.

127
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,110
Instead of being forced by anyone,

128
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,900
I want to face it myself, whether it be someone or fate.

129
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,810
 Is your marriage registration finished?

 Lee Se Hoon

131

  Han Jae Hyeon came looking for me.

132
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,750
Did he come knowing something?

133
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,690
He knew about the video and the fact that we planned to remarry.

134
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,970
So?

135
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,650
If the video is released, he said that he will take Yoon Ji Soo.

136
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,720
 Also, it seems he's done something to Yoon Ji Soo.

137
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,370
She said that she can't remarry me.

138
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,370
I found out what you lost.

139
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,730
If you ended up finding it,

140
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,760
I was going to congratulate you in a big way, but I can't bring myself to do it.

141
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,750
But, why aren't you saying anything

142
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,190
when you know that I was the one who gave him the video?

143
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,920
Because I'm the one who is in the wrong. So, Seo Kyeong—

144
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,640
I said I lost her, on purpose.

145
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,450
That I lost her. Not that I was abandoned.

If you're thrown away once, you blame the person who did it to you,

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,360
but if you're thrown away twice, you start to blame yourself.

150
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,180
So... don't throw me away.

151
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,970
It really hurts my self-esteem.

She told me to throw them away.

157
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,680
I'll throw them out myself.

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,700
 Kim Hyeon Shik, Zoo, One Day  
 (old Korean songs)

159
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,450
Do you think I can find a cassette tape player for these?

160
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,750
I'm sure a quick internet search will work. The 90's trends are quite popular these days.

161
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,060
Can you find one for me?

162
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,520
Yes, I'll do that.

163
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,780
But I guess you also go online to Tapgol Park?

164
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,540
Where is that?

165
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,610
It's... not a place, but a website.

166
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,720
A website where you can watch music shows from the 90's and relive nostalgic times.

167
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,530
Hey, you're dissing me, aren't you?

168
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,860
No, not at all. How could I?

169
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,260
I know what kids say these days. "Keuk-hyum." 
 (Korean abbreviation meaning extremely displeasing)

170
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,570
Is that funny?

171
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,070
 Kim Hyeon Shik

172
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,380
 I don't think you would have done it,

173
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,000
 but I'm wondering what happened.

174
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,570
 I decided not to return to him.

175
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
 What a relief.

176
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,560
 I think it would be best to not see you either.

177
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,470
 I want to protect you.

178
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,620
 That's my sincerity and my goal.

179
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,440
 Whether I can see you or not, I'm going to try my best.

180
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,210
 I will try my best to distance myself from you.

181
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,790
 Garam International Middle School

182
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,020
Yeong Min.

183
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,880
You look like Leon.
  (T/N: from the movie, "Leon: The Professional")

184
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
What's a Leon?

185
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,190
He's just a really cool guy.

186
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,960
They gave one to everyone at school. I want to grow it at home.

187
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,470
What about we grow it somewhere bigger?

188
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,480
If it's stuck in the pot, it can't extend its roots.

189
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,260
Sounds good.

190
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,380
It would've been nice if you could live in a bigger house, right?

191
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,320
Like the house you went to see with Dad.

192
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,500
Are we really going to live with Dad?

193
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,640
Yeong Min, can you forgive me just this once?

194
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,520
I did something bad.

195
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,890
I told you we would go live with Dad without even asking for your opinion,

196
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,530
and then I went back on my words, saying I couldn't.

197
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,200
So we're not living with him?

198
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,830
- I'll forgive you. 
 - Is that really okay?

199
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,850
I think not living together is a bit better anyway.

200
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,360
Why?

201
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,210
It's something you don't like. That's why you split up.

202
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,660
That's why you said to live together, and then decided you couldn't.

203
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,570
I know you're in middle school now, but aren't you still being too reasonable about this?

204
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,460
Actually, it's an emotional response. I felt scared and uncomfortable, too.

205
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,740
My baby is growing up too fast.

206
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,770
Is it really because he's an only child?

207
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,770
 Leon the movie - original sound track

208
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,460
 February, 1995   
 I must've cried too much during that movie. I can't see.

209
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,310
Sure. Take your sunglasses off.

210
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,830
It's really so dark.

211
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,120
Did you really cry?

212
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,660
Of course!

213
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,140
My heart hurt because of my brother, Leon.

214
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,850
My brother, who is so terribly unlucky.

215
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,750
Mathilda's last line was so sad.

216
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,220
What was that again?

217
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,230
She replants their plant in the park and says,

218
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,360
"We will be okay here, Leon."

219
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,350
If the place is here, we'll be okay.

220
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,580
Our Ji Soo is quite good at 'English speaking,' huh?

221
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,070
- That's listening, not speaking. 
 - Forget it.

222
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,040
On that note, shall we draw inspiration from our brother Leon

223
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,340
and drink not milk, but makgeolli (Korean rice wine) which is similar?

224
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,820
You said you would leave after watching the movie.

225
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,350
Am I a plane? Why do you keep telling me to take off?

226
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,470
You think that's funny? What a horrible joke.

227
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,080
There's something that I want.

228
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,350
Hey, let's go drink makgeolli! What is there to buy?

229
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,850
What is it?

230
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,300
Leon.

231
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,700
You can't become Mathilda just because you're holding a plant.

232
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,800
Someone as pretty as she might show up only once in a hundred years.

233
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,530
Ji Soo is way prettier.

234
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,570
Those punks. Do you think I'll be envious?

235
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,280
Of course, I would. Totally.

236
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,350
Why are we planting it here?

237
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,270
This is a bit of a special place.

238
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,590
What's special about it?

239
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,920
God is here, Mary is here,

240
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,170
and a lot of priests and believers as well.

241
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,490
I guess at least it won't be lonely.

242
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,810
Let's water it.

243
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,940
♫  Perhaps, someday  ♫

244
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,660
 June 1995

245
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,470
♫  we will remember  ♫

246
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:59,810
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our faded memories  ♫

247
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,160
 I finally moved Leon to somewhere more spacious.

248
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,540
 Without any hesitation, I put him at that place.

249
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,880
 "We will be okay here, Leon."

250
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,590
 If the place is here, we'll be okay.

251
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,580
♫  but appearing suddenly  ♫

252
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,700
 To: Recruit Han Jae Hyeon 
 Chuncheon Reserve 102, Division 15 
 ♫  the longing that is you  ♫

253
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:29,010
♫  If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

254
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,920
♫  If we can reach that some day, that some time  ♫

255
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,700
It looks like this is the right one, but also not...

256
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:50,160
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

257
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:59,270
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my everyday  ♫

258
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,820
Is this something to feel disappointed by?

259
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Good night, Ji Soo.

260
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,890
Bye, Sunbae.

261
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,900
Jang Seo Kyeong!

262
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm glad you came. I wanted to have a drink with you, Dad.

263
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,510
Why are you like this again?

264
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,360
This is all because of you.

265
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,680
Why? What did I do?

266
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:06,290
My love life is like yours because I take after you.

267
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:15,200
Mom, who never smiled in front of you,

268
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,640
smiled once at that amusement park.

269
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,410
She smiled so beautifully.

270
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:32,690
Just like Mom, the ice-cold Jae Hyeon

271
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,300
told that woman he can leave everything and go to her.

272
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,340
That woman?

273
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,490
He must have smiled for her.

274
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,900
Every day.

275
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,720
So beautifully.

276
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,690
What about Seo Kyeong?

277
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,830
She said she doesn't want breakfast because she drank a lot yesterday.

278
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,440
Can we talk?

279
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,350
I've said everything I wanted to say.

280
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,170
I can't act like everything's okay when I did something wrong.

281
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,250
The video won't get released,

282
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,450
so you won't have to be responsible for that woman.

283
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,800
Nothing changes.

284
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,510
Leave now. I feel nauseous.

285
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,430
You were assigned to the distribution center?

286
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,900
Yeah.

287
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,510
Isn't it tiring?

288
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:02,010
It is tiring. I went from being a cashier to heavy lifting at the distribution center.

289
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,810
Is this like a retaliation assignment?

290
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,500
Probably.

291
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,830
At least, I like that I was able to apply to the labor union because I became a full-time employee.

292
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,230
That's a relief.

293
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,360
How about you? Are you doing well?

294
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,140
I'm doing really well.

295
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,120
Still busy?

296
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,720
It's harder for people like us if we're not busy.

297
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,560
That's true.

298
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:32,910
Would it be alright for me to ask you a favor?

299
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:38,210
I'm part of the cultural department of our labor union and we're holding a cultural festival,

300
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,950
but we don't have anyone to play the keyboard.

301
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,240
So I thought of you.

302
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,920
Is it okay even if I'm not a member of the union?

303
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,850
Yes, it's fine. We often recruit from outside.

304
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,690
- I'll do it. 
 - But it won't pay much.

305
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,000
You don't need to pay me.

306
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,770
That's not okay!

307
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,720
I've always wanted to donate my skills.

308
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,080
Did you want me to buy you some more food?

309
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,310
Prosecution investigation officers are in the lobby with a warrant for a second search and seizure.

310
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,750
They also have a summons for you, Vice President.

311
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,920
It seemed really intense. Is something going wrong?

312
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,560
If they want me to go, I'll go. Diligently and sincerely.

313
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,060
I'm more nervous because you're so calm. What will you do if they put you in jail again?

314
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,830
Stop overreacting and make the appropriate preparations.

315
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,370
The real game starts now.

316
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,610
 Hyeong Seong Group Labor Union Cultural Festival

317
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,250
What is this sound?

318
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,330
They're holding a labor union cultural festival right outside.

319
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,960
They're really trying to get on the chairman's nerves...

320
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:15,710
♫ Let's live like a rock ♫

321
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:21,580
♫ Even if harsh winds and rain blow around ♫

322
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,800
♫ We won't waver to any temptations ♫

323
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,690
♫ Let's live like a rock ♫

324
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:41,160
♫ What sways in the wind are reeds with thin roots  ♫

325
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,290
What are they going on about now?

326
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,930
Can't you call the police to take them all away?

327
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,820
They got approval from the ward office.

328
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,840
- But Yoon Ji Soo is there, Chairman. 
 - Who?

329
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,020
The Vice President's woman you told me to look into.

330
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,600
Oh, why is that woman there?

331
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,410
I'll look into it.

332
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,560
Which one? Where?

333
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,440
The one playing the keyboard.

334
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,400
She doesn't look ordinary even from far away.

335
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,790
♫  Call me when you need someone 
 I'll always come running  ♫

336
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,830
♫  Daytime is good, night time is good  ♫

337
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,930
 Twentieth Floor

338
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,430
 Cancel

339
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,810
 Thirtieth Floor

340
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,540
Vice President, I need to go to the twentieth floor, not the thirtieth—

341
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,690
Oh, I'm going to the thirtieth floor. With you, Department Manager.

342
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,360
I noticed you taking pictures of the labor union festival.

343
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,100
Yes. The chairman wanted to see them.

344
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,150
Can I see them, too? I need to know which employees are taking part in the labor union.

345
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,750
I'll send it to you by email.

346
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,130
I would have to see it now.

347
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,600
Department Manager?

348
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,380
 Delete

349
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,920
 Deleting

350
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,840
Ji Soo.

351
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,200
You don't have to avoid me. I came for work-related reasons today.

352
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:17,560
As a member of the board, I want to ask you not to take part in events like today.

353
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,100
I'm not an employee, but even if I was, you can't tell me that as a member of the board.

354
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,950
Why are you there when you aren't even an employee?

355
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:32,650
I did it as a favor for my previous coworkers and I enjoyed it.

356
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,940
I always felt bad because I felt like I ran away by myself like a coward.

357
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,020
Like I wanted a better world for free.

358
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,670
This isn't much, but at least I'm paying something.

359
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:52,010
On top of that, it's the thing I can do best.

360
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,400
Instead of being a keyboard warrior that blabbers online with their fingers,

361
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,170
I'm going to be a real keyboard warrior, fighting with piano keys.

362
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,560
You said you're busy making a living, how are you going to be a warrior on top of that?

363
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,550
I'm only able to do this much because I'm busy making a living.

364
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,840
And I'm ashamed of it, too.

365
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,850
So you're still there?

366
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,730
Because there are still people there.

367
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,730
So it wasn't that people weren't there...

368
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,590
I just turned a blind eye.

369
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,090
How is school, Joon Seo? Is it fun?

370
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,640
Well, it's just, whatever.

371
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,190
It's no fun?

372
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,140
It's just a bit annoying.

373
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,270
Why? Is something wrong?

374
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,810
The facilities are the best, and the teachers have been hired among the best, too. What's the problem?

375
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:01,390
Grandpa, didn't you know? Some jerk threw a chair at me.

376
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,620
How could you hide something so grave from me?

377
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,170
I'm sorry, Chairman.

378
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,360
It's not even like he hit someone. He got hit.

379
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,700
At the time, I tried to make things widely public and punish them properly,

380
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,060
but Joon Seo's parents came and said they would be generous and let things go quietly.

381
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,360
Seo Kyeong said that?

382
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,980
His mother wasn't willing to compromise,

383
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,560
but his father said this could absolutely not go to the school violence committee.

384
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,120
  Murderer Company 
 Reporting the brutalities of Hyung Sung Group!!

385
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,530
 Love Letter

386
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,710
Hello?

387
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,580
 Hello, I'm Hyeon Woo's mom.

388
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,150
 Are you coming to parent's observation day at school tomorrow?

389
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,980
I do want to go, but I'm a bit uncomfortable about something.

390
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,020
I think Joon Seo's dad met with her because he's so soft-hearted.

391
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,740
He had no other choice but to be kind to her since she was begging him, and she was his junior in college.

392
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,240
Oh my goodness. How could something like that...?

393
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,310
It's embarrassing, but I am telling you because I was frustrated.

394
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,430
I'm glad you told me.

395
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm not much myself, but I am looking over the other moms.

396
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,080
This is truly a worst-case scenario.

397
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,010
My face is flushed.

398
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:13,820
Anyway, I don't think I'll be able to go. I don't feel comfortable to see Yeong Min's mom.

399
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,980
How can you say such a thing?

400
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,760
Why do you have to avoid her? She's the one that did wrong.

401
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,530
I'll take care of it.

402
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,880
I can't ever forgive these types of things.

403
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,250
If rumors get out, the school's image will falter, too.

404
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,320
You're getting another prosecutorial investigation?

405
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,500
What if you end up eating rice with beans in prison again?

406
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,470
Are you some kind of brand ambassador for rice with beans?

407
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,870
This is something I'd anticipated ever since I envisioned my plans. That I could go to prison again.

408
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,330
At the time, I wasn't afraid of going to prison at all.

409
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,900
It's only difficult going the first time.

410
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,670
Right now, I'm afraid.

411
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,330
What is it this time?

412
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,510
I'm scared Ji Soo will disappear.

413
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,750
That again, she'll have to suffer through something alone while I'm gone.

414
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,090
Is it possible to face something like that twice in life?

415
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,380
Why are you guys so pitiful?

416
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,730
When you guys were together, it made me wonder how you two could even exist,

417
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,430
because you two were so precious.

418
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,260
 Open Class Day for Parents Observation

419
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,030
You're here?

420
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm glad you came.

421
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,780
- Yeong Min's mother. 
 - Yes?

422
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,960
Do you have some time?

423
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,580
- Why? 
 - We have some things to discuss.

424
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,260
The other moms are all there already.

425
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,030
Welcome, Yeong Min's mom.

426
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,160
We already ate, but you should order something.

427
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,290
I'm okay.

428
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,230
Alright then. We don't have much time anyway, so let's just get it over with.

429
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,990
It's not like I don't understand your situation, but there are still things you should and should not do.

430
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,340
I hate beating around the bush.

431
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,560
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

432
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,470
How could you make a move on another parent from school?

433
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,720
- She made a move on someone? 
 - She really hit on a parent?

434
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,940
I heard you used that to stop the school's violence committee.

435
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,640
Sure you may have been desperate, but resolving things like that?

436
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,590
It's only a matter of time before the school's image is ruined once rumors start to float around.

437
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:13,720
If you want to call yourself a mom, you should at least have some dignity.

438
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,320
How can you look Yeong Min in the eyes after doing something like that?

439
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,880
He might already know. Kids are quite good at picking up on things.

440
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,500
I heard it's a lie that your husband is a famous lawyer in Gangnam.

441
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,880
You even protested after getting fired from some supermarket.

442
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,410
How could you trick us all like that and not offer an ounce of apology?

443
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:37,150
If you have something to say, say it, instead of just sitting there like a mute who ate honey.  
  (T/N: Idiom, someone unable to express their thoughts.)

444
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,760
I guess you didn't find out about the "red mark" (criminal record) on my family register.

445
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,860
A criminal record for assault causing injury.

446
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,400
It was at a place just like this. How nostalgic.

447
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,920
Are you threatening us right now?

448
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,760
How dare you say such an abhorrent thing here?

449
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,440
I understand you're trying to act like Jang Seo Kyeong's maid to reap some benefits for yourself,

450
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,620
but you picked the wrong target.

451
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,720
Maid? You—

452
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,990
Don't bite me. I'll bite you right back.

453
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,570
None of the stories you're making up are true, and if you spread false rumors to your children,

454
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,240
I'll draw another red mark to my name and go to jail again.

455
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,070
Oh my goodness.

456
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,390
Well, it doesn't seem like she was the only one attacked.

457
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,760
 Prosecutor's Office

458
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,030
- Turn off the recording. 
 - Yes.

459
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,720
Today was a bit quieter on your way over, right?

460
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,710
You called me so suddenly, there was nobody on the ground floor

461
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,020
yet.

462
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,090
Whenever we ask you to come, we do everything to maintain confidentiality,

463
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,980
but this is a place where there's constant talking.

464
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,770
There must be a lot of birds and mice. 
 (Korean phrase meaning there are always people watching and listening)

465
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,420
Vice President,

466
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,690
things have become quite complicated.

467
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,940
It'll be difficult to protect you as the anonymous whistleblower.

468
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,100
In our country's laws, there are a lot of loopholes around whistleblowers.

469
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,650
The net we're using to catch the fish is big, but so is the mesh of the net itself.

470
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,200
So it will not be easy to catch a large fish.

471
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,920
This is different from what you told me before. So it must not be your idea.

472
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,150
It appears that the fish are still a bit stronger than the net.

473
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,800
So it seems like in order to catch a big fish, we need to get into the water ourselves.

474
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,820
Are you talking about something other than the borrowed-name shares?

475
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,180
There are more issues to borrowed-name shares than the taxes and shares itself.

476
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,540
As we've told you before, we have been looking into things as well,

477
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:35,030
but there are too many things that have been hidden and buried, and the ocean is as deep as it is wide.

478
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,060
I'll help you.

479
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,840
Vice President, I'm not someone that sees only what I want to see.

480
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,630
I see everything as it exists.

481
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,900
After I've seen it, I move according to the rules.

482
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,360
If we go any deeper than this, it'll become more difficult for you as well.

483
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,900
It can't be helped. This is something that required my firm resolve from the start.

484
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,390
You're... quite strong.

485
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,590
I have many things to sort out. So let us get started.

486
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,590
Thank you.

487
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,880
So these borrowed-name funds.

488
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,500
Yes.

489
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,530
- Please say a word!  
 - Do you have a word to share?

490
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,900
We are ashamed of you!

491
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,930
 Eradicate the corrupt conglomerates!  
  Tax evasion expert!

492
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,820
 Return Ill-Gotten Profit and Stop Nepotism in Businesses! 
  Was your wealth not enough that you used borrowed-names?

493
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,310
 Imprison Han Jae Hyeon to Achieve Economic Democracy

494
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,600
 Han Jae Hyeon, Vice President of Hyeong Seong Distribution, Arrest Warrant Decision Next Week

495
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,810
 Five years ago, during the labor strike at Hyeong Seong Steel,

496
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:21,010
 former employee Mr. Kwon Hyeok Soo committed suicide after a labor dispute with the company. His bereaved family members

497
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,120
 filed charges today against Han Jae Hyeon, Vice President of Hyeong Seong Mart.

498
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,890
 Kwon Hyeok Soo's death was not an incidental accident arisen from personal reason.

499
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:35,020
 We intend to reveal that this tragic sacrifice was a result of unfair labor practices on the company's side.

500
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,690
 Five years ago, Han Jae Hyeon, who indiscriminately committed inhumane layoffs and called them rational business decisions,

501
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,780
 is the focus of who we suspect bears the blame.

502
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:52,800
The attorney who filed the suit against you is Lee Se Hoon.

503
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,730
Perhaps this is each person's "best effort?"

504
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,600
What day of the week is it today?

505
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,560
Wednesday.

506
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:47,360
March 1995
 Labor freedom, labor freedom...

507
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,260
Suppress them! Suppress them!

508
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,330
Suppress them!

509
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,140
The body of Christ.

510
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,380
The body of Christ.

511
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,120
Amen.

512
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,470
The body of Christ.

513
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,730
The body of Christ.

514
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,860
The body of Christ.

515
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,260
The body of Christ.

516
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,690
The body of Christ.

517
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,340
The body of Christ.

518
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:46,030
The body of Christ.

519
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,250
The body of Christ.

520
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,640
The body of Christ.

521
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,560
You can take it and just say "amen."

522
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,360
Amen.

523
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,150
May Christ be with you.

524
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,940
Follow that person, please.

525
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,680
The body of Christ.

526
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,580
Amen.

527
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,700
Asylum was trampled.

528
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,320
Asylum?

529
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,090
It's Latin for 'sanctuary.'

530
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:58,600
It's a sanctuary where wrongdoers and runaways cannot be captured.

531
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,850
Although they were all captured today.

532
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,300
Then I will become your asylum.

533
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,080
Come to me at any time, and I will hide yo= so no one can take you away.

534
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,950
"We will be okay here."

535
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,330
If it's this place, we will be okay.

536
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,970
You are making good use of that line.

537
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,190
The body of Christ.

538
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,250
The Leon you planted was still there.

539
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,760
Someone kept looking after it I guess.

540
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,780
That's fascinating. How can that be?

541
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,000
Actually that's not Leon.

542
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,970
It's not, right? No wonder.

543
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,930
I planted it recently.

544
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:41,210
Deliberately, at this place.

545
00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:01,030
I had forgotten what this place was.

546
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,690
Because it is an asylum,

547
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,390
where the world's eyes and feet cannot touch...

548
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,640
So, for just a moment...

549
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,330
I was afraid to be held back by the days of the past if I turned around,

550
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,600
so I walked diligently forward without ever looking back.

551
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,670
But once I stopped, I realized it had always been this place.

552
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:59,110
Perhaps I walked all those years to reach this place.

553
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,060
Now, my legs hurt,

554
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,070
so for today, I'll just stay here.

555
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,890
If it's this place,

556
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,730
we will be okay.

557
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:42,690
♫  Spring blossoming in our hearts  ♫

558
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:49,420
♫  My trembling heart waiting for you  ♫

559
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:56,460
 For I have lived on waiting for you,
And my heart was only your footsteps.
 "The Footsteps" by Paul Valery

560

♫  The ticklish whispers of summer emotions  ♫

561
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:14,890
♫  The longing welled up in my brow  ♫

562
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,890
♫  The newness you give to me  ♫

 When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower

564
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,080
 I can't be sure

565
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,930
 what is real and what is right.

566
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,680
 Let me confirm for you,

567
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,420
 what terrible things Han Jae Hyeon did.

568
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,800
 It's about survival, so it's all the more something to decide for yourself.

569
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,890
 I think it's because you've changed, Sunbae.

570
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,720
 You resemble him a lot.

571
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,190
 Haven't you heard about me from your father?

572
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,770
 You said you were curious about why I left, didn't you?

573
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:52,840
