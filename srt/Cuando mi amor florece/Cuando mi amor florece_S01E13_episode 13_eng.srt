1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,420

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,530
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,660
 For Demolition

4
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,170
The owner changed?

5
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,710
 Episode 13  
 -Yes. I think the new owner is trying to demolish it.

6
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,810
Wait, they're demolishing it without letting the tenant know?

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,250
It hasn't even been a month since I moved here.

8
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,470
I know. But this new owner isn't picking up their phone.

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,210
Then what do we do?

10
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,360
Wait a little bit.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,230
They wouldn't demolish right away.

12
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,860
I sent you my address by text. Can you confirm the certified copy of register?

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,020
Hold on. Didn't you check it when you moved?

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,490
- Of course, I did. 
 - Then why are you checking again?

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,000
 Online Registry Office  -  Browse

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,470
Let's see.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,570
- Huh? 
 - What?

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,560
You signed with this woman?

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,860
Who is it?

20
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,350
The owner is Jang Seo Kyeong.

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,800
 Maxim Brazil Santos

22
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,430
Thanks.

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,530
They say the CEO took Secretary Kim on her Guam trip.

24
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,370
I find it odd because it's not even a business trip.

25
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,970
When is she coming back?

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,760
When I asked the secretary's office, they said she didn't buy a return ticket.

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,280
 This is me.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,130
 I keep thinking I should live the way I am because you guys keep doing this.

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,490
 Yoon Ji Soo

30
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,570
 For demolition

31
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,220
She was determined in leaving.

32
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,420
Left?

33
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,760
I asked the company and they said she's on a business trip overseas that Jang Seo Kyeong.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,670
 You live by your style.

35
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,760
 I'll live by mine.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,970
- Seonbae Jae Hyeon... 
 - He can't know.

37
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,390
Exactly. Since Seonbae Jae Hyeon shouldn't know,

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,580
I called an almost professional.

39
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,620
Hey!

40
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,860
Hurry, sir!

41
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,450
I'm not someone who goes to rugged places like this, nevermind walking.

42
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,150
It would be much easier if you didn't speak.

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,450
Why... why are you doing this to me?

44
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,460
You've arrived, Seonbae?

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,620
I think you guys called the wrong person. I'm a divorce attorney.

46
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,640
Call me when you get a divorce. I'm off.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,570
We'll make sure to call you when we get a divorce, too. But for now, let's go in.

48
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,560
Wait, wait.

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,850
Grandpa.

50
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,280
Oh, come in, come in.

51
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,570
Why, do you need money?

52
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,950
Can't you plead with them, Grandpa?

53
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,020
About what?

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,640
Mom and Dad's divorce.

55
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,020
Why should I do that?

56
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,440
It's embarrassing if they get divorced.

57
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,330
Embarrassing?

58
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,100
It is embarrassing.

59
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,680
Let me tell you everything, since you're old enough to understand now.

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,360
This divorce is not your mom wanting it, but what your dad wants.

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,950
It's not just a divorce. It's because he has a woman he likes outside of this family.

62
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,840
Even if this is a corrupt world, that's the kind of bastard your dad is.

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,110
On top of that, the company that started with your grandfather's grandfather, he's doing all kinds of things to take

64
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,530
he's doing all kinds of things to take it for himself!

65
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,810
I took a guy who walked in with only his underwear and made him human.

66
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,330
Instead of laying prostrate for the rest of his life, he  dared plunge a knife into my back.

67
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,610
Stop the divorce? Why stop it? Why?

68
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,730
Hey, we should change your name to Jang Joon Seo while we're at it.

69
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,380
Why? You don't want to? Then you can follow out with your dad.

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,890
So there's no point in even asking a high-end attorney like me about this situation.

71
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,610
It's 100%. 100% purely illegal. Ouch, that's hot.

72
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,330
Jae Hyeon's wife goes with the outlook "Illegal or not, I'll compensate for everything, so bite down hard

73
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,910
because I'm going to punch you in your grill."

74
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,340
Isn't there some more professional expression than stuff like 'grill'?

75
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,160
Yeah, uh, right.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,860
If you want to tell a tenant to leave, you can file something called an eviction suit,

77
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,070
but it's been less than a month since she moved in.

78
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,480
It's not like you're late on rent or did anything illegal,

79
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,200
so it isn't easy either. And it would take her a really long time.

80
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,930
Yeah, that kind of stuff!

81
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,800
Ji Soo. There's an expression you learn as soon as you go to law school.

82
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,540
"Those who sleep on their rights cannot be protected."

83
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,160
Joon Seo.

84
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,360
Do you have something to say?

85
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,080
No. I'm just bored. Mom isn't around, either.

86
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,100
You want to do something together?

87
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,330
No...

88
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,480
Do you want to sleep here?

89
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,420
I don't know.

90
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,740
Wow, I get to sleep with my son for the first time in a while.

91
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,050
We used to sleep together and bathe together in the past.

92
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,280
What about it...

93
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,160
 A famous department store in Seoul city center has collapsed.

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,610
 I'm going to the department store with Mom to fix my watch. Should we buy a strawberry cake from there?

95
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,330
 For Demolition

96
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,910
 Those who sleep on their rights cannot be protected.

97
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,610
You've really troubled yourselves coming here.

98
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,170
But what you're trying to do is completely illegal.

99
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,670
If you start the illegal demolition

100
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,070
you'll be charged for trespassing and destruction of property.

101
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,280
What is that woman doing?

102
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,590
If I press this, they'll be here right away.

103
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,630
I won't be moving an inch from this place.

104
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,310
Get out of the way before we drag you out!

105
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,960
The CCTV is recording everything.

106
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,650
 For demolition. Demolition Notice.

107
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,200
 September, 1994

108
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,840
Wipe it better.

109
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,710
 The Kids' School by the Train Tracks

110
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,870
- A 
 - A, B.

111
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,070
- Who knows how much this is? 
 - Me!

112
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,110
 I hope the Kids' School by the Train Tracks lasts a long time.

113
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,960
 It probably won't last long. Two months at best.

114
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,630
 I have a new dream, thanks to you.

115
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,170
 I've been playing since I was little.

116
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,180
 People said I had talent, and I liked going to a good college, so I decided to major in it.

117
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,880
But I had never thought about what I would do after graduating.

118
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,220
I want to teach children. Not just at a private institute for piano lessons.

119
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,480
A place like our Kids' School where kids who have talent, but aren't able to learn

120
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,050
can get free lessons and play. That kind of piano school.

121
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,810
That's commendable.

122
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,130
 Kids' School by the Train Tracks

123
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,380
 Warning: This building is being demolished. Obstruction of the demolition is liable to charges for criminal act and damage.

124
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,580
What happened?

125
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,890
Those jerks.

126
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,820
The kids were all crying, but they kept throwing all the chairs and desks.

127
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,270
Sunbae, do we just take this?

128
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,580
Should we make Molotov cocktails? Or should I go find some wooden planks?

129
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,770
This girl, seriously. You're going to cause trouble.

130
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,090
Aren't you going home?

131
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,990
How can I go? What if they come back?

132
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,360
There are so many kids in the remaining houses...

133
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,820
Weren't you scared?

134
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,860
Normally, I would have been scared, but the kids were there.

135
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,480
I was their guardian.

136
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,770
They were all counting on me, so I couldn't think of anything else.

137
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,630
Did you feel this way when you were bringing me around, too?

138
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,270
It was harder. At least kids listen.

139
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,740
You talk back every time.

140
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,260
Me? When? I listen well.

141
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,000
Hand.

142
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,350
Good job.

143
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,040
However, Ji Soo.

144
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,430
Don't come here anymore.

145
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,200
Why?

146
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,720
It's going to get more dangerous. The school's gone now anyway, so you don't need to come.

147
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,380
What about you?

148
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,820
I have to come. We don't know when they'll come pillaging again.

149
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,120
Why do I always get to choose to do only the easy and comfortable stuff?

150
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,680
Because I'm a girl?

151
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,880
But do women not go through injustice?

152
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,950
Mister!

153
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,300
Mister! Mister!

154
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,500
What should we do? That was the last bus.

155
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,920
Should we take a taxi?

156
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,890
I bought food for the kids earlier, so...

157
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,220
What do we do?

158
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,940
I guess we don't have a choice, we can't go home.

159
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,880
Always looking for opportunities.

160
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Then what do we do?

161
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,010
Hand.

162
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,360
Are you tired?

163
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,920
Not really.

164
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,630
Tell me if you get tired. I'll carry you.

165
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,610
No, you'll be too tired.

166
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,440
I only make you go through trouble because I don't have any money. Why do you like me so much?

167
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,650
Because you're kind.

168
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100
In my major, there are plenty of rich kids,

169
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,580
kids with cars, and kids who wear expensive clothes.

170
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,330
There are kids who are even good looking.

171
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,490
But none of them is as kind as you.

172
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,640
Not just kind, but

173
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,450
you tug at my heart.

174
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm like in "Misery." I only have eyes for you.

175
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,850
That's why I know what kind of person you are.

176
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,740
I fell for it again.

177
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,660
I thought you were "Misery," but you were just a dummy.

178
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,260
I am a dummy. Dummy for Jae Hyeon.

179
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll give you a piggyback ride, my Dummy.

180
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,990
I'm not tired at all because I'm walking with you

181
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,860
and I'm not scared at all even though it's dark.

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Ji Soo.

183
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,510
Don't forget that.

184
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,160
When we're together, we don't feel tired at all, and we don't feel scared no matter how dark it is.

185
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,250
That's why I'm going to the demolition area again tomorrow.

186
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,660
Hey, it's really pretty here.

187
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,260
I've never seen the Han River like this.

188
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,710
Wow, it's so black!

189
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,300
It's really hard to see, huh?

190
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,600
Mom.

191
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,640
Were you scared, mom?

192
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,230
No. It was fun.

193
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,790
But your hand is shaking.

194
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm telling you it's not.

195
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,190
Did you quit drinking? You haven't bought alcohol lately.

196
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,970
- I won't get any. 
 - Aigo, look at that.

197
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,020
You've matured. You leper girl.

198
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,860
When you live with a kid, you can't drink much. I'm busy cooking.

199
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,170
Why does your face not look good?

200
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,490
Granny. It's not one thing coming for everyone that goes, in my case.

201
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,000
When one goes, a whole crowd comes after me, like zombies.

202
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
Those zombies are indeed vicious.

203
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,540
They bite you hard, like this!

204
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,980
You're a hip granny, knowing what a zombie is.

205
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,980
I search for and watch all the things my son watches.

206
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,400
Granny, then should I come live here? I'll do all the housework and watch the store.

207
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,770
You can just watch TV.

208
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,510
- Not you. 
 - Why not?

209
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,560
The light reflects off all the alcohol bottles here. If you see it with your eyes, you're bound to drink again.

210
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,080
 The piano will be arriving at your house soon.

211
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,820
Granny, I need to go. Think about living  with me, okay?

212
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,450
Don't run! You're going to trip and split your head open!

213
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,480
 For Demolition

214
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,610
What's this?

215
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,820
Yeah, did you try contacting the landlord?

216
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,330
Yes but the landlord...

217
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,050
What about the landlord?

218
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,950
It's CEO Jang.

219
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,690
What? Seo Kyeong?

220
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,130
Yes, sir.

221
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,110
How can that be?

222
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,810
She purchased it a little while ago at double the original cost.

223
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,250
Did you tell Sunbae?

224
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,620
Yes.

225
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,810
Those people won't come anymore.

226
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,330
How did you do that?

227
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,500
The Vice President took action.

228
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,590
What action?

229
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,670
Who knows. I'm not too sure.

230
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,630
The vice president paid the cost of the demolition but told the team to stop.

231
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,050
Stop hiding behind Jae Hyeon's back like a coward and come out.

232
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,830
Aren't you the one that was hiding?

233
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,750
I'll go to you since your words aren't wrong.

234
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,300
Oh, Dong Jin.

235
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,220
I shall come whenever the client asks me to come. Since I'm at your service.

236
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,830
Sure, sure sure.

237
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,990
- I'm sorry. 
 - No worries, sir.

238
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,300
- It's because I'm a bit busy. 
 - Yes, sir.

239
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,740
Why did you suddenly ask me to come?

240
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm going to have to ask you to submit lawsuit files.

241
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,430
Are you finally crossing over to the riverside from which you cannot return?

242
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,650
Grabbing on won't be any good for Seo Kyeong.

243
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,380
Does getting a divorce not impact your fight with the old man?

244
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,280
It won't impact my plans, but I'm sure I'll get cursed at like there's no tomorrow.

245
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,170
They'll call me the bastard who abandoned his wife and son, and who betrayed his father-in-law.

246
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,360
You've already been called those things! Isn't that practically your name now?

247
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,480
This crazy punk.

248
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,980
How did you know my name?

249
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,960
Goodness, you're such a crazy punk.

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,710
I heard you found out about Ji Soo's house?

251
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,160
If you knew earlier, why didn't you tell me?

252
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,070
Ji Soo did everything she could to me, from threats and blackmail to coaxing,

253
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,080
telling me not to tell you.

254
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,740
She said it was something your wife did, so you'd have a difficult time.

255
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,910
Chairman, the Board of Directors meeting just finished.

256
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,160
The resolution you desired was passed unanimously.

257
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,110
We will make the results public as soon as the market closes in the afternoon today.

258
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,370
Why did you come all the way to report to me the obvious?

259
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,190
We also got contacted by the prosecutor's office just now.

260
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,250
They request you make an appearance before noon two days from today.

261
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,470
We're contacting Chief Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol at the moment.

262
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,190
Don't worry about him now.

263
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,020
Leave.

264
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,450
I said leave.

265
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes, sir.

266
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:21,660
This country... is wrecked.

267
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,230
Vice President. An emergency board meeting was held today and they decided on a recapitalization by stock allotment to third parties.

268
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,630
They're due to make an official announcement after the market closes.

269
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,060
Who is the designated party?

270
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,820
"Shin Il Asset Management". It isn't very well known, not even in the financial hub of Yeouido.

271
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,800
Look into that company, and hold a meeting with all of our investors.

272
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,920
Yes, will do.

273
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,710
You must've bought this house without even coming here.

274
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,230
Of course. I only have one reason for buying it.

275
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,850
To shake Yoon Ji Soo.

276
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,520
Even if you're the homeowner, it's illegal to demolish the property without letting me know beforehand or giving me monetary compensation.

277
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,640
That's why I came, to let you know.

278
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,990
I'm going to demolish this house.

279
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,220
We're good now? As for your compensation, the amount of your deposit should work.

280
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,710
The amount didn't even warrant a trip to the bank. I've also included enough for you to move.

281
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,870
Are you not going to take it?

282
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm going to follow the rules. I'm supposed to receive the deposit when I move.

283
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,800
Anyway, I let you know and told you I would even compensate you, so move out as soon as you can.

284
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,970
Since I'll proceed as I planned.

285
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,550
I'll look into it as soon as possible, so please stop the demolition for now. This is all illeg—

286
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,260
I don't want to. I'm going to keep bothering and threatening you.

287
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,780
I'm sorry, but I'll continue even if you move somewhere else.

288
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,980
Until you leave Jae Hyeon.

289
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,520
- Yeah, Ji Soo. 
 - Hello, I'm Yeong Min.

290
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,100
Oh, it's Yeong Min. What's wrong?

291
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,230
I think my mom is really sick.

292
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,860
She ate some medicine, but her fever won't go down. She might have to go to the hospital.

293
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,790
Auntie Hye Jeong won't pick up the phone.

294
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,730
Just come here for a bit. Come here.

295
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,420
If I just get a good night's rest, it'll be fine.

296
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,100
I don't think it's something that'll be resolved with a night of rest.

297
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,720
I know my body well. Plus, I can't leave Yeong Min alone...

298
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,060
Yeong Min, you can lock the door and stay here alone right?

299
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,660
Yes.

300
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,260
Okay.

301
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,160
Okay, one minute.

302
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,280
I'm really okay.

303
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeong Min, lock the door.

304
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,560
I really don't need to go to the hospital.

305
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,420
 October, 1994

306
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,400
You...

307
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,010
Why would you come to school when your fever is so bad?

308
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,490
It was a wish of mine to study with you at the library.

309
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:03,410
We just barely made plans. So what if I'm a bit sick?

310
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,740
It must be because we walked around all night that day.

311
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,590
Where are we going?

312
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,770
We should go to the hospital and then go home.

313
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,060
- I don't want to. 
 - You really...

314
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,820
It's our first time studying at the library together.

315
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,440
You didn't even study.

316
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm not going. I mean, I can't. The weather is so good, too.

317
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:44,560
♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

318
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:59,220
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  ♫

319
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:06,170
♫  Steeped in love, everything has passed by  ♫

320
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:13,340
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

321
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,540
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

322
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:27,040
♫  If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  ♫

323
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
No, you'll catch my cold.

324
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,920
That's the aim.

325
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,610
♫  I would embrace you once and tell you  ♫

326
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:47,950
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

327
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:58,370
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

328
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,530
Your fever has gone down a bit.

329
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,860
It's because I slept well.

330
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,890
Just stay lying down here a bit longer.

331
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,990
It's suffocating, I want to leave.

332
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:48,230
They say your face is the mirror of your heart. I can see how much you've been struggling.

333
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,230
Is my face really not that great?

334
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,960
Your pretty face has become half its size.

335
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,760
But I don't think it's a mirror into your heart.

336
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,490
I'm so happy right now.

337
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,520
It must have been hard because of your house.

338
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,950
Does love feed you?

339
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,120
When it was hard for me to live day by day, I thought of that.

340
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,230
There's no such thing as a love that comes from tossing away your spoonful of rice.

341
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,640
But now, I'm not in a period where I have to worry about

342
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,070
how little rice I can get from tossing away love.

343
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,840
Love became both the rice and the side dishes,

344
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,880
and it can even be a sweet dessert.

345
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,800
I'm grateful enough with just that.

346
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,610
I hope you'll gain a lot of weight.

347
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,990
Not that.

348
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
  Seoul Family Court

349
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,160
  Application for Divorce

350
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,790
What are you trying to do?

351
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,790
I can't stay in the same house with you when I've filed for a divorce.

352
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,200
I'm not going to take anything from you with this lawsuit.

353
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,830
I plan on doing the things you want, as much as possible.

354
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,630
Okay. Do whatever you want.

355
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,650
But I don't know what a kind argument is.

356
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,630
It'll become a dog fight or a mud fight.

357
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:22,870
Whether with scratches or bites or by whatever means necessary, I'll defeat you.

358
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,590
Call Secretary Kang.

359
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,230
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,140
Secretary Kang. One moment please.

361
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,040
- Secretary Kang. 
 - Yes?

362
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,740
- Where's Jae Hyeon? 
 - He's in his office.

363
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,770
I'm asking where he's been living.

364
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,500
If you don't tell me, I'll fire you.

365
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,790
The Bell Hotel.

366
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,790
Keep putting people to monitor the Bell Hotel and Yoon Ji Soo.

367
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,590
  Piano House   
   A school to learn the piano in a fun way!

368
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,330
  Anyone who wants to learn the piano, call us by this number!

369
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,990
 Han Jae Hyeon

370
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,970
 Hyeong Seong Group's son-in-law Vice President Han Jae Hyeon dating a Single Mom Beauty.

371
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,260
They're here!

372
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,970
He's here.

373
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,300
Is it true that you're dating a single mom?

374
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,520
It is true that you were a campus couple in the past?

375
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,620
When did your relationship become deeper again?

376
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,700
- Please say something! 
 - Wait!

377
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,110
- Wait! Do you recognize the facts? 
 - Please say a few words!

378
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,270
 Hyeong Seong Group's son-in-law Vice President Han Jae Hyeon dating a Single Mom Beauty.

379
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,920
He put crap on his own face.

380
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,110
It's upsetting because I think some of the wastewater might splash on Seo Kyeong and me,

381
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,270
but what can I do? We were going to get rid of him anyway.

382
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,340
On the contrary, you or Miss will be flooded with sympathy votes later on—

383
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,070
Why shall I receive sympathy votes? It's useless!

384
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,730
That isn't what I meant, sir.

385
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,350
Anyway, put out headlines that say he's incompetent of directing the company,

386
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,790
and that above all, there is definitely an ethical issue.

387
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,610
Our team members will not take this matter lightly.

388
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,620
Yes, I understand.

389
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,100
I can go alone.

390
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,230
Your dad must've seen the article too. It'll be hard by yourself.

391
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,790
I'll go and tell him.

392
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,030
But I think that man is taking pictures of us.

393
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,620
Oh? What are you doing?

394
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,490
Are you aware you taking pictures of us is illegal?

395
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,200
What are you— What do you think you're doing right now?

396
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,970
You took pictures of us. If these get published somewhere, I'm going to use my pictures to sue you.

397
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,580
- Mom, the bus is here. 
 - Let's go.

398
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,760
Yeong Min, head in first.

399
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,100
Yes.

400
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,170
See you in two days, Yeong Min.

401
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,170
I don't care about the article. I already knew about it anyway.

402
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,310
The issue is that Yeong Min cannot be in such a dangerous environment any longer.

403
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,210
It's something Yeong Min and I will figure out. We're already discussing it plenty.

404
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,890
I heard he decided to live with me?

405
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
What are you talking about?

406
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,110
Do you not know much about your son?

407
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,290
Or did you not have the time to pay attention to him because you were too busy dating?

408
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,460
He says he thinks he'll only be a disturbance to your marriage.

409
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,750
That's why he said he'll let mom go and live with his dad.

410
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,700
There's no way he would say that. Even until just now—

411
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,560
He said you'll have a hard time because your father passed away.

412
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,190
So he asked me to give you some time, and that's why I waited until now.

413
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,420
But I don't think I can wait anymore.

414
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,890
I heard your late father said this,

415
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:02,210
That if you pick one, you must give up another.

416
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,390
I'm going to give you up now.

417
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,210
In return, I'm going to bring Yeong Min to me as fast as I can.

418
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,500
 You said Yeong Min won't be home today, right? I'll sleep with you today.

419
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,210
 Aren't you scared they'll come to demolish your house?

420
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,960
 I already told my husband.

421
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,610
 Thanks to you, I'm a free wife tonight!

422
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,500
Our little Yeong Min was so pretty when he was younger.

423
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,240
What's the point of saying the obvious?

424
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,440
Even recently, I got contacted about making him a child model.

425
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,790
So are you going to hug his pictures and cry yourself to sleep every day?

426
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,780
No. I'll have to talk about it with Yeong Min.

427
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,720
What if he really says he'll live with his dad?

428
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,010
- Then I have to accept that. 
 - Huh?

429
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:20,960
But I'm going to tell him

430
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,490
not to force himself to do something he doesn't want, just to benefit someone else.

431
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,670
He's smart, so he'll understand.

432
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,450
When I'm next to you, my throat goes dry.

433
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,190
Why?

434
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,090
Because you're so pitiful it squeezes all the water out through my eyes.

435
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,430
Yoon Ji Soo is so pitiful.

436
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,390
Is this the Chairman Jang card you mentioned last time?

437
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,270
Yes. It's issuing new stocks exclusively to a specific party, instead of to the entirety of existing stockholders.

438
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,550
It's a capital increase by allotment to a third party.

439
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,930
The recipient of that will be on Chairman Jang's side, I'm sure?

440
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,760
That company called Shin Il Asset Management.

441
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,500
That's the company that used to take care of Chairman Jang's slush funds.

442
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,130
So what are your plans, Vice President Han?

443
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,280
The board of directors and the management rights are still in the hands of our opponents.

444
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,400
It doesn't seem there are any options left.

445
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,010
Your morality being under question is a problem for us as well.

446
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,730
Excuse me for a moment.

447
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,500
Hello?

448
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,190
 Vice President, please look at the texts I sent you.

449
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,890
Min Ji, head in first for a moment.

450
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,610
Okay.

451
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,120
Min Ji, you did well today.

452
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,460
- Good bye. 
 - Bye.

453
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,220
Please have a seat for a moment.

454
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,160
We'll stop taking lessons after today.

455
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,330
You gave me the months lesson fees in advance last week.

456
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:27,910
It's okay. Please just think of that as a token of gratitude.

457
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,860
Can I ask the reason?

458
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,820
Well, I just want to be careful since my daughter is a girl after all.

459
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,980
Yeong Min, don't look at your phone for the time being.

460
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,020
Why?

461
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,760
You have to study. I'll keep it for you.

462
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,750
Mom will probably call me.

463
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,080
If she does, I'll let you talk to her.

464
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,820
Give it.

465
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:05,040
I'm going to find the first publisher and arrest them for violation of portrait rights and slander.

466
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,320
But the first publisher of the video could be CEO Jang...

467
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:21,430
I'm sorry but, if that's the case, that's beneficial for us. Though this does seem to be turning into a dogfight.

468
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,740
She's eating well and working as normal, too?

469
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,690
It does seem like she's been having a lot less work.

470
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,420
Yoon Ji Soo isn't one to run away when things get difficult for her.

471
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,490
Yes, she seems to be more tenacious than she appears.

472
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,480
Instead, those kinds of people cannot stand inconveniencing others.

473
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,310
 Yeong Min, I'll go pick you up tomorrow around 1.

474
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,360
Where's Yeong Min?

475
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,770
Yeong Min saw your articles and that video.

476
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,690
He says he doesn't want to see you for the time being.

477
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,520
Let me call Yeong Min.

478
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,020
He said he didn't want to call you.

479
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,210
I'll call you as soon as Yeong Min calms down.

480
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:34,780
I'm planning on filing for restoration of the right to custody as soon as I can.

481
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,650
I know that the reason Yeong Min dropped out of school was because of you and that person.

482
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,950
I'm telling you there are an overflowing number of reasons why I should get custody.

483
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,930
Yes, Unni.

484
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,990
 Yeong Min's mom, are you busy right now?

485
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,640
No, I'm free.

486
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,890
 Shall we meet up for a bit?

487
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,360
Right now?

488
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,690
It's about Seon Hee.

489
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,520
By any chance, did I not get a call from mom?

490
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,870
Your mom must be busy.

491
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,800
Okay.

492
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:48,910
I considered just not telling you,

493
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,500
but I thought it's something you should know.

494
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,430
And I knew Seon Hee wouldn't tell you.

495
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,400
Did something happen to Unni Seon Hee?

496
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,330
She suddenly got a notice of dismissal.

497
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,640
Why?

498
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,290
Well, officially it was for poor job performance,

499
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,000
but apparently CEO Jang ordered it herself.

500
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,210
 The person you are trying to call...

501
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,120
 I can't pick up

502
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,390
 If you have something to say to me, come to my office tomorrow.

503
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,060
I'm in the lobby.

504
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,460
 Ah, Yeong Min's mother. But why did you call me yesterday, by the way?

505
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,960
I won't stay still about Choi Seon Hee's situation. It's definitely illegal, and—

506
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,750
If you're coming to talk about that, then I'm sorry, but I have no plans of meeting you.

507
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:57,530
Other than Choi Seon Hee, weren't there many cashiers who were reinstated back then?

508
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:02,280
Is it Yeong Min's mom, by chance?

509
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,920
She says she's in the lobby.

510
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,680
Goodness, isn't that just too shameless?

511
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,980
Let's just drink our teas and not worry about it.

512
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,180
Long time no see, Yeong Min's mom.

513
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,390
What are you doing?

514
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,110
How are you going to take responsibility for soiling the school's reputation?

515
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:57,160
Rumors are everywhere that the two of you first met as fellow parents of our school's pupils.

516
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,220
But you're still walking around trouble-free, so shamelessly.

517
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,210
Why are you looking at me like that?

518
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,630
What? Are you going to twist my arm again?

519
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,010
Unni, let's just go now.

520
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,970
Ji Soo.

521
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,230
Yeong Woo.

522
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,220
Is something wrong?

523
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,980
What's all this?

524
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,890
It's late. I'll see you later.

525
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,020
Who did this?

526
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,210
I did.

527
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,440
 I don't want to.

528
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,410
 I'm going to keep bothering and threatening you.

529
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,890
 Yeong Min saw your articles and that video.

530
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,490
 She suddenly got a notice of dismissal.

531
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,320
 Apparently CEO Jang ordered it herself.

532
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:05,380
 Other than Choi Seon Hee, weren't there many cashiers who were reinstated back then?

533
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,600
Don't you think you are being cowardly?

534
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:17,920
Why are you making Ji Soo stand on the ledge while you're just watching her from behind?

535
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,510
Are you going to pick her up and run only after she falls?

536
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:27,670
Why aren't you thinking of how she's alone in such a scary place?

537
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,220
Ji Soo is suffering so much that I can't even stand to watch her from afar.

538
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,800
I...

539
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:44,870
There's nothing I can do.

540
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,200
If there was, I would do whatever that be.

541
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,540
But other than acting like this towards you,

542
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,270
there is nothing I can do.

543
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,490
Please stay next to Ji Soo.

544
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,170
Don't make her stand there alone.

545
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,870
Whether it snows, rains, or blows heavy winds,

546
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,220
if the two of you endure together,

547
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,630
then I too...

548
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,050
I think I can live, too.

549
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,790
 Now I'm also going to do what will cause you the most pain.

550
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,780
 Something that you can never do, even if you were to pour

551
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,630
 all of your power, money and time.

552
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,520
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

553
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,220
Where did you say that woman went?

554
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,190
The hotel where the Vice President is.

555
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,330
What about Jae Hyeon?

556
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,750
Where's Jae Hyeon?

557
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,130
You're crazy too.

558
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:14,960

559
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:23,220
♫  If you just love, just the way you are now  ♫

560
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:29,690
♫  If you feel the same as me, then even if a painful tomorrow comes  ♫

561
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:34,390
♫  I could embrace   ♫

562
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,320
♫  all those moments we are together  ♫

563
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,990
 When My Love Blooms

564
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,140
 That's the only way for you to get hurt.

565
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,940
♫  If you just love.  ♫

566
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,660
 This is my way.

567
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,930
 Breaking everything.

568
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:50,420
 Are you telling me to step down from my position as Chairman?

569
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,060
 I'm going to try my best.

570
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,490
 This was the greatest obstacle between us.

571
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,520
 It's both a revenge and a reward.

572
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,140
 Like we were able to love again, I hope you'll be able to return to that time again.

573
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,390
 I'm trying to return

574
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,130
 to that place I was long ago.
