1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,120
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,310
I request this of you.

4
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,110
Please reconsider, just once.

5
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,050
If the reason to open the school violence hearing

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,360
is because someone touched your son,

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,950
please take that anger out on me.

8
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,170
The sin of having raised my child wrong lies with me,

9
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,860
so your anger or insults, I will accept them all.

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,520
So then try it, whatever it is.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,180
Whatever would quell my anger.

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,980
I request this of you,

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,690
just this once, please show your mercy.

14
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,750
Please get up.

15
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,090
What are you doing right now?

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,140
Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!

17
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,850
Explain what this situation is.

18
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,280
- What is this situation?
 - Joon Seo's Mother—

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,170
Please take Mother and give us some time to talk.

20
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,900
Yes.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,810
I think I told you to not make this into a problem again.

22
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,330
A child's life, and whatnot.

23
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,430
Acting all righteous, but it turns out it was about a woman, huh?

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,500
What is she to you, that you are calling her name and acting so affectionate?

25
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,360
College junior.

26
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,520
First love? You mean like in that darn "Love Letter" or something?

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,660
I didn't want to involve the adults' problems in the children's matter,

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,760
but you just don't listen, no matter how much I tell you.

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,340
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,370
If you don't cancel the school violence hearing, then Se Hwi?

31
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,800
That guy named Se Hwi, he won't ever work as a model again.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,780
He has nothing to do with this.

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,510
But he does have something to do with you.

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,010
So you're going to ruin a promising boy's future over something this trivial?

35
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,760
Yes, that's exactly what I want to say to you.

36
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,170
Do you know how much money they have donated?

37
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,460
If Joon Seo transfers to another school,
  Episode 3

38
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,250
we will have to immediately halt the construction of our school's gymnasium, that's how much they gave us.

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,190
And we would have to fire four to five teachers, too.

40
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,710
Why did he mess with Joon Seo, of all kids—

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,830
But I am thinking that my Yeong Min may have felt a bit lonely.

43
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,250
Of course, our school is out in the countryside,

44
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,280
so everyone feels lonely and everyone gets homesick.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,220
But do all kids resort to violence because they are lonely?

46
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,330
What about Madame?

47
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,010
We have come to an understanding that the school violence hearing will not be held.

48
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,510
And Madame agrees with that—

49
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,710
If this happens again, we will transfer to another school.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,030
Let me give you a ride back.

51
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,220
It's alright.

52
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,140
You must have had a difficult time traveling since early this morning because of us.

53
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,040
I know, right? It does hurt a bit.

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,100
My wrist hurts, and my knees hurt, too.

55
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,380
So get in. When your joints hurt, it is better to ride in a car.

56
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,980
No, it's not my joints...

57
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,720
Hey, I'm not that old.

58
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,570
I know.

59
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,950
Huh, really.

60
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,960
Please let me get off here.

61
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,850
I can just go from here.

62
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,150
I'll let you off at Seoul Station.

63
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,350
No, I want to get off at this station.

64
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,370
There isn't any place here to buy shoes.

65
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,640
I can just go like this.

66
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,430
If I hadn't seen that, it's one thing. But I can't let you go in this state.

67
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,390
It's not as if you're an impoverished child.

68
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,320
Why would a grown adult walk around with such worn-out shoes?

69
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,370
But are things alright?

70
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,780
About what?

71
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,900
Joon Seo's mother.

72
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,970
Are you alright?

73
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,550
You bowed your head twice, and today, you even got down on your knees.

74
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,740
Something like that, I can do it 100, even 10,000 times

75
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,650
if only I could prevent my child from crying.

76
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,570
To me, that is love,

77
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,920
to make sure he doesn't cry.

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,710
So I can understand Joon Seo's mother.

79
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,110
Her method of protecting her loved one is simply different.

80
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,880
But, I'm saying this just so you won't misunderstand,

81
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm not stopping this school violence hearing because it's you.

82
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,300
He keeps saying it isn't the case, but I think Joon Seo has been giving Yeong Min a difficult time.

83
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,470
Even in elementary school, he was always trying to be a group leader and tormented other children, and it became a problem.

84
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,990
His mother was indifferent to it,

85
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,760
and his maternal grandfather always took his side, so he was afraid of nothing.

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,190
This is a shameful and embarrassing thing to say, but I will try to speak to Joon Seo myself,

87
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,760
and you should talk with Yeong Min, too.

88
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,560
 When My Love Blooms: The Moment Living Becomes a Flower

89
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,140
We should go to the front of your home, how can you, with those shoes?

90
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,980
If I run, it will only take one minute from here.

91
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,190
I think I have some shoes in my car, hold on.

92
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,630
I am really alright.

93
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,460
 Give this one to me, please.

94
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,070
These are for men, so they will be a bit big.

95
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,060
But I think they will be better than those shoes.

96
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,770
I'm really alright. And it will be a hassle for me to return them to you.

97
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,350
You don't have to return them. Just use them at home when you take out the trash.

98
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,820
It's not at all expensive, so don't feel burdened, okay?

99
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,620
But I feel burdened...

100
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,800
 December 1993

101
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,060
Are you Jo Yong Pil (famous singer)? Who do you think you are, to show up last?

102
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,920
My dad said I can't go on overnight club trips, so I had to sneak out...

103
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,290
You're always falling down, how can you do protests?

104
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,190
Keep up with me! Don't get distracted.

105
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,140
Follow my footprints.

106
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,680
Are you alright?

107
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,350
What now?

108
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,020
Wow, your face looks like it's going to explode.

109
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,410
Everyone thinks you can hold your liquor, Sunbae.

110
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,450
You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me.

111
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,970
Because I'm looking only at you.

112
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,840
You,

113
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,670
are you "Misery" (a movie)?

114
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,560
How did you know?

115
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,900
I thought you were "Love Letter" (a movie),

116
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,630
but you were "Misery."

117
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,790
That's what everyone thinks,

118
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,050
but I really lean more toward horror, thriller, and psychopath genres.

119
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,030
Of course, that doesn't mean I don't like "Love Letter."

120
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,790
It's so good, and the last scene is so moving.

121
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,790
And in the snowy field, it was so sad...

122
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,800
♫  Thinking of you again today  ♫

123
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,250
Your eyelashes are so pretty.

124
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,690
♫  About that night I was with you  ♫

125
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,190
♫  My feelings are slowly growing  ♫

126
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,750
♫  My footsteps toward you  ♫

127
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,200
♫  Feel like they’re walking on a cloud in the sky  ♫

128
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,090
♫  When did this start?  ♫

129
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,650
♫  Whenever I’m next to you  ♫

130
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,420
♫  I laugh for no reason  ♫

131
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,730
♫  Oh baby  ♫

132

♫  I like everything about you  ♫

133
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,860
♫  I wanna stay with you tonight  ♫

134
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,020
♫  Tonight, it’s you and me, will you stay?  ♫

135

♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

138

♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

139
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,130
♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

140
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,680
♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

141
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,890
Sleep well, Han Jae Hyeon.

142
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,090
So cold.

143
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,220
 Jae Hyeon ♡ Ji Soo

144
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,880
So let's hear it, "Love Letter" by Han Jae Hyeon.

145
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,730
I like melo movies a lot, too.

146
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,070
So tell me.

147
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,510
I found out that she was the other child's parent when I went to the school because of Joon Seo.

148
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,940
And that although the child is ranked first in his class, his family is not prosperous,

149
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,010
so she took care of him with some difficulties.

150
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,150
And so I thought that if her child had a problem, she would struggle even more.

151
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,170
Is that the end?

152
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,550
How about making a decent person out of Joon Seo first?

153
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,680
It seems he's doing what he did in elementary school.

154
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,570
So you're saying he did that because of Joon Seo?

155
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,090
There is a high possibility.

156
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,340
So, that's why

157
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,750
I told you to pay more attention.

158
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,220
I'm not someone who can make someone into a decent person.

159
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,640
I will pay more attention, and if possible, I will go to pick him up on Saturday.

160
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,560
You should have done this before.

161
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,730
But, Honey,

162
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,840
why won't you ask me about it?

163
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,820
About that model?

164
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,720
You don't care?

165
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,580
Of course, it's not something I should applaud,

166
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,640
but I think some of the blame lies with me, too.

167
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,860
I was in prison for four years, and I was busy before that, due to work.

168
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,150
Is that all? Aren't you even angry?

169
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,070
You seem like you have something you want to say, so I will ask you.

170
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,450
Why did you meet another man

171
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,080
while I was locked away in the dark, of all times?

172
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,520
Because I was lonely.

173
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,410
Do I have any friends or any siblings?

174
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,580
All I have is Dad and you.

175
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,560
But both of you were gone from my side, so...

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,570
So, don't make me lonely.

177
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,480
I can't stand being lonely.

178
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,360
Things to be enjoyed alone, they're all so squalid.

179
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,180
Vice President always looks so good in suits,

180
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,330
I think a basic style like this would suit him well, too.

181
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,630
Jae Hyeon does look good in suits, it doesn't even need to be said.

182
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,830
But he has too many of these basic styles.

183
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,210
So it should be made of a different material, or the design should be unique.

184
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,670
Yes, I will speak to our team leader when she comes.

185
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,360
But did the gloves he bought last time fit you well?

186
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,080
What are you talking about?

187
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,150
Vice President came last time, and—

188
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,040
Jin Yeong.

189
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,850
What is she talking about?

190
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,280
He bought something here?

191
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,170
Jae Hyeon did?

192
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,330
Was it for a woman?

193
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,860
Uh, about that...

194
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,700
Bring it to me, and let me see what my husband's tastes are.

195
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,400
 College junior.

196
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,650
 Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!

197
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,690
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

198
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,550
What's wrong?

199
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,840
Number 1, you knew where Ji Soo was, but you hid it from me.

200
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,340
Number 2, you liked Ji Soo. So which is it?

201
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,940
Oh, stop saying nonsense. So you met the real Yoon Ji Soo?

202
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,120
She's living well, isn't she? Without many problems?

203
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,480
Her son attends the same school as Joon Seo.

204
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,930
Wow, so our Ji Soo married into a rich family, huh?

205
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,450
I thought she might be divorced, and she would be really poor, and maybe her husband was beating her.

206
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,400
I was so anxious, expecting the story to go in that direction.

207
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,040
So, she's still pretty as ever, right?

208
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,240
So it was Number 2, you punk.

209
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,420
Number 3, actually.

210
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,940
What is Number 3?

211
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,200
I think Ji Soo liked me quite a lot.

212
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,140
Didn't she ask about me?

213
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,260
No.

214
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,230
Wait, hold on.

215
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,260
Take your time. If you rush, it won't come out (poop).

216
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,050
 Introduction to Political Economy

217
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,150
Yes, hello?

218
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,090
Yoo Ri's not available today for lessons?

219
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,330
Oh well, then.

220
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,070
That's alright.

221
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,330
Yes, thank you.

222
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,530
Hello Madam?

223
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,620
I'm calling because you said last time that Ha Yeong's younger sibling wanted to take some lessons.

224
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Is that so?

225
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,400
Well, it can't be helped. Please give me a call next time.

226
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,680
Yes, thank you.

227
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,600
Ji Soo.

228
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,810
Wow.

229
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,220
Long time, no see.

230
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,350
How long has it been?

231
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,780
About four days, maybe?

232
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,990
Oh, really?

233
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,390
Wait.

234
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,210
My car will be here soon. Just wait a little bit.

235
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
I know you're fine, but let me just lend you an umbrella.

237
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,730
It's really fine. I can just—

238
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,960
You could just run, but it's cold today.

239
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,360
Just wait a little bit. It won't be long.

240
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,930
Just so you know, I'm not here for weird reasons.

241
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,460
I bailed while drinking with a friend.

242
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,450
I didn't ask.

243
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,050
Right? Right, you didn't.

244
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,370
I thought you asked.

245
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,640
♫  Please don't say anything  ♫

246
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,910
♫  If it’s about the past  ♫

247
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,740
♫  In all our many stories  ♫

248
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:57,120
♫  there are too many misunderstandings.   ♫

♫  Don’t ask me  ♫

252
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,930

It'll be a hassle to return.

258
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,480
You don't have to return this either. I have lots of umbrellas.

259
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,140
Then...

260
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,870
Thank you.

261
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,720
I'll be going now.

262
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,730

264

265
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,400
Yoon Ji Soo.

266
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,180
What about the shop?

267
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,140
- I closed early.
 - Why?

268
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,480
Because of the rain. I'm in the mood for some drinks that someone else serves me.

269
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,620
Hyung Jae Hyeon?

270
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,690
Where? How?

271
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,410
His son goes to the same school as Yeong Min.

272
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,030
The school is high class, then. Hyeong Seong (Corporation)'s grandson attends it.

273
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,690
You knew?

274
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,990
Who he was married to?

275
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,320
I read it in a magazine. In an interview.

276
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,780
Oh, that?

277
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,200
I saw that too.

278
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,550
Did you meet him?

279
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,900
How is he? Still as cool as always?

280
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,870
Not even. Even he couldn't help aging.

281
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,820
He seemed like he would be cool even as he got older.

282
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,680
Like those handsome middle-aged  Hollywood stars.

283
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,390
He does look a bit like George Clooney.

284
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,920
That's taking it too far. What about them look alike?

285
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,700
Their eyes! The way his eyes wrinkle when he smiles.

286
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,300
Is there anyone of that age whose eyes don't wrinkle when they smile?

287
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,780
They're not regular wrinkles. They have depth.

288
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,390
Of course, they're deep because  he's old.

289
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,240
Nope.

290
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,770
Something is sexy and dignified about them.

291
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,630
Yoon Ji Soo's love blindness really does last a long time.

292
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,990
  December 1993

293
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,700
Okay, I acknowledge my mistake.

294
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,380
Isn't he just so good looking?

295
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,510
You drive me crazy. What's so good looking about him?

296
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,420
He's so skinny, he looks like a dried-up beansprout.

297
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,400
Look at the lines he draws with his body.

298
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,600
Whenever he gets a pass, it looks like ballet instead of foot volleyball.

299
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,480
No wonder he's so bad. It must be because he's trying to do ballet instead.

300
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,470
- Okay, serve! 
 - My ball, I got it, I got it!

301
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,770
What are you doing? Ballet?

302
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,300
Can't you receive the ball properly?

303
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,840
- You said, "My ball!" 
 - When did I, you moron? It didn't even come in my direction!

304
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,780
Sunbae Jae Hyeon really looks like a college student now.

305
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,830
Sunbae Jae Hyeon, Sunbae Jae Hyeon. Are you a flounder? Can you only see him?

306
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,470
I wish he would play sports all the time instead of protesting.

307
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,380
Stop dreaming. A dog won't quit pooping. 
 (T/N: Korean saying meaning one won't stop a habit easily.)

308
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,650
Where can you find a dog as good looking as him?

309
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,360
This isn't just love blindness. You have a disease!

310
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,750
You should head in.

311
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,030
Should I go with you to get Yeong Min? Taking the train is tiresome.

312
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,040
Forget it.

313
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,040
My love blindness is a disease, too.

314
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,070
An incurable disease.

315
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,770
Hello, Dong Jin?

316
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,300
 Where are you, you punk?!

317
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,710
You haven't left yet?

318
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,770
 I thought you went to take a dump. Did you bail because you didn't want to pay for the drinks?

319
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,780
 Are you really broke these days?

320
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,020
Asking about how much lawyers make,

321
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,830
why are you doing things you didn't use to? It's ruining your character.

322
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,890
By the way, Dong Jin,

323
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,470
do you want piano lessons for your kids, by chance?

324
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,500
My kids? Should we?

325
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,420
Now that one is about to turn one year old, and the other one is three, so it's about time, huh?

326
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,290
Especially because they're both boys?

327
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,740
Yea, exactly.

328
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,830
What do you mean, exactly?

329
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,560
By the way, Dong Jin...

330
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,190
 What now?

331
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,640
When do you think it'll rain again?

332
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,780
 What kind of dog sound (nonsense) is this now?

333
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,300
 Ask the National Meteorological Administration, prat! You good-for-nothing.

334
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,990
 Class Ranking - 11th out of 31 
 School Ranking - 50th out of 150

335
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,460
 Son, has your grade report not come out yet?

336
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,320
Yeah, Joon Seo. Dad is here, so come down.

337
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,170
Okay.

338
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,690
You are Yeong Min, right?

339
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you perhaps remember me?

340
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm Joon Seo's dad.

341
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,070
Hello.

342
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,610
Do you not like me very much?

343
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,170
Are you scared I might be on Joon Seo's side?

344
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,750
Not every father is automatically on their son's side.

345
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,170
I'm on the loser's side.

346
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,810
I really wanted to tell you this.

347
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,700
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,950
But I'm the one who did wrong.

349
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,370
Winning and losing, right or wrong, it isn't all there is.

350
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,590
Looking at it this way, you probably aren't the only one in the wrong.

351
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,600
How do you know?

352
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,650
I just do.

353
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,080
When you get to my age, there are some things come in sight even if you aren't looking at them.

354
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,790
By the way, it looks like you are having some worries, Yeong Min.

355
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,030
Is Joon Seo still tormenting you, perhaps?

356
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,160
I see.

357
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,860
It isn't the only reason.

358
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,300
My grades have dropped a lot.

359
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,150
Yeong Min.

360
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,750
Mom stayed up all night making this using Chefs Kim Su Mi and Baek Jong Won recipes. 
  (T/N: cooking show celebrities)

361
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,880
Try it.

362
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,230
I'm not hungry.

363
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,290
Come on, you should still do me the favor of eating it.

364
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,290
Even though the school cafeteria gives you a lot of food, it isn't anything tasty.

365
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,690
Wait!

366
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,630
Aunt Hye Jeong bought it for you, saying you should grow very tall.

367
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,500
It's tasty, isn't it?

368
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,530
Joon Seo's dad.

369
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,890
He seemed very different from Joon Seo.

370
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,580
Did he?

371
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,150
What did he seem like?

372
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,490
He was nice and seemed warm-hearted.

373
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,550
To me, he looked a bit cold, though.

374
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,720
I am absolutely not envious of Han Joon Seo for being rich,

375
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,520
but I'm a bit envious of his dad.

376
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,110
But instead, you have an amazing mom, don't you?

377
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,470
But, Yeong Min,

378
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:10,310
I wish you would have worries fitting to your age.

379
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,950
What do you mean?

380
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,650
"If I do it like this, what will happen?", "I can't do that, right?",

381
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,090
"Alright, let's endure it for a bit."

382
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,170
Stop having these kinds of thoughts now.

383
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,790
Say it hurts when you're in pain,

384
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,970
say things like "Why is everyone bothering me, really!"

385
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,050
Be like that a little bit, is what I'm saying.

386
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,930
For you to throw a chair at Joon Seo,

387
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,790
he must have thrown something at you as well.

388
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,700
But you are keeping that to yourself,

389
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,990
and all the adults are talking about your chair only.

390
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,620
Yeong Min.

391
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,670
You aren't an adult.

392
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,720
Why would you endure and hold everything in by yourself?

393
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,630
That's cheating, and worse, it's even illegal.

394
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,640
But you're alone, Mom.

395
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,850
You have to make money by yourself,

396
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,220
and you also have to raise me alone.

397
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,860
Grandma isn't here, and as for Grandpa, it's pretty much like he's not here either.

398
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,040
You have to do everything by yourself.

399
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,640
If something happens to me,

400
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,440
you can't do anything about it and have to come alone.

401
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,310
That's even more reason why you should tell me everything.

402
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,240
Because I only have you and you only have me.

403
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,960
That's what I'm saying. You only have me,

404
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,830
but if I get kicked out of school, Dad might take me away from you.

405
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeong Min.

406
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,150
No one can take you away.

407
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,130
Actually, you don't really know,

408
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,240
but I, uhm, just like the Black Widow and Captain Marvel you like,

409
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,130
I'm as incredibly strong as those ladies.

410
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,090
Pew! Oh my!

411
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,240
Are you all right?

412
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,010
Does it hurt?

413
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,770
I'm not crying because it hurts.

414
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,150
I hear that you work at the company now, so why has nothing changed?

415
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,440
It's been a while since I told you to clean up those (protesting) ajummas.

416
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,420
Are you protesting against me now?

417
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,110
No.

418
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,450
Why make Jae Hyeon do things like that? What about the other employees under him?

419
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,110
Who is better at cleaning up people?

420
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,120
- What, you don't want to work?
 - No, I do.

421
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,720
Then clean it all up in one week.

422
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,540
Will it do for the company to look so messy when we have foreign buyers coming and going all the time?

423
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,380
I understand.

424
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,730
You leave alone the ajummas I told you to clean up,

425
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,420
but why are you meeting with the president of Seoul Bank? Do you need money?

426
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,910
I don't think he's having me followed, yet.

427
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,930
 From the Majority Leader to the madam of a brothel in Cheongdam,

428
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,760
 the old fart's network is said to be no joke. I guess it turned out to be true. d

429
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,720
Well, it's not surprising, considering this is how he made this company.

430
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,420
It seems the police CCTV will be greeting you.

431
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,680
So in order to avoid that CCTV,

432
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,290
we have to move without moving. We can do that, right?

433
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,360
 Yes, we must become invisible, I guess.

434
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,440
Oh, and send me the list of temporary employees who have been dismissed.

435
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,970
There is someone I need to look into.

436
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,320
 Job Application Resume - Yoon Ji Soo

437
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
What's with this woman?
  Seonghun Girls High School: Graduated
 Yeonhui University, Piano Major: Dropped Out

438
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,230
With this, it appears she approached him on purpose, no?

439
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,120
She began working at the supermarket while Vice President was incarcerated.

440
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,490
- So it's vague.
 - Does Jae Hyeon know?

441
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,010
It wouldn't have been easy for him to find out unless she told him herself.

442
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,360
There are nearly 1,000 temporary employees who have been dismissed.

443
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,330
He must continue to not know about this.

444
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,730
If he finds out about the divorce, supermarket, and even the dismissal,

445
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,500
he will die of pity for her, knowing his personality.

446
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,180
It wounds my pride to see him have an affair with a woman like this.

447
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,530
It seems like he really loves her or something.

448
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,050
Alright, raise your son well and be healthy.

449
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,220
I'm so sorry.

450
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,190
You've worked hard, Ji Soo.

451
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,050
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,140
We know it all, you don't have to say it.

453
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,500
Just don't forget about us after you leave.

454
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,120
I won't forget, I will never forget.

455
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,430
 Hyeong Seong Market's management board, wake up!

456
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,320
 Wake up! Wake up!

457
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,390
Dismissal is murder! Withdraw the dismissals!

458
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,480
Withdraw! Withdraw!

459
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,450
 Hyeong Seong Market's management board, wake up!

460
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,700
 It says it will rain tomorrow, can we meet briefly?

461
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,200
 I need that umbrella.

462
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,500
 And I have some things I wanted to talk about with you.

463
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,980
How strange, it definitely said it would rain.

464
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,530
I used it well.

465
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,210
Is it alright even if we don't have a meal?

466
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,130
I already ate.

467
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,390
But, what you had to tell me.

468
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,710
- Is it about school?
 - No.

469
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,580
Then, what...

470
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:39,250
I don't know if you already know this, but I am the vice president of Hyeong Seong Mart.

471
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,910
And the fact that you worked as a temporary employee there and were dismissed,

472
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,480
I found out, recently.

473
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,410
You don't have to tell me what your situation was, however,

474
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,830
I hope you don't participate in the protests in front of the company headquarters.

475
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,330
Why must I do that?

476
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,010
I was dismissed unfairly, too.

477
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,530
The corporation will take legal action.

478
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,960
And based on what I looked into, we did not violate any laws.

479
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,340
I just hope that you are not harmed.

480
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,090
I can find another job for you, too.

481
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,800
So you're telling me that I should be the only one to escape?

482
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,300
No.

483
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,850
I think raising Yeong Min will be more important than anything, for you.

484
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,540
So you found out everything.

485
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,730
Did you look into my background or something?

486
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,190
Sunbae, you seem like a different person.

487
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,570
Different from the person I knew.

488
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,200
Yes, I am a completely different person.

489
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,140
I am unspeakably selfish and materialistic.

490
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,860
And those temporary employees protesting right now,

491
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,080
using tactics like illegal demonstration, property trespass, disruption of business,

492
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,530
I will mow them all down with that.

493
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,020
So, I think it will be good for you to stay out of it.

494
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,550
No.

495
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,460
Is it loyalty to your colleagues?

496
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,630
Or what? Is it your sense of justice?

497
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,620
It won't even earn you money.

498
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,300
So why?

499
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,160
Because I learned from you.

500
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,040
That the losing side... is our side.

501
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,250
  January, 1994.

502
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,500
- Ji Soo. 
 - What's the matter?

503
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,350
Jae Hyeon and the others are out at the slum we were helping in Hyeonjeo-dong.

504
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,700
- They just called about something urgent.
 - A slum?

505
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,540
Yes, it's similar to volunteering in rural areas, but in slums instead.

506
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,980
You guys do that kind of work too?

507
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,670
We may look shabby, but we're very active. I'll be off now, I don't have much time.

508
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,250
Oh yeah, sure.

509
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,650
Hey! Give me my ttakji back! 
  (T/N: ttakji is a toy, a folded paper tile)

510
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,420
Give it back, give me my ttakji back!

511
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,790
Get out of the way!

512
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,870
Just knock it all down!

513
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,080
 Yah!

514
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,890
 These rascals! Break it all down!

515
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,810
 This...

516
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,840
Did Yeong Woo not tell you?

517
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,620
What?

518
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,850
He didn't tell you what we were here for?

519
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,830
Your attire...

520
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,290
Sorry, I didn't know.

521
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,940
You must've ruined your nice clothes.

522
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,440
Good work.

523
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,080
Why do you protest...

524
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,340
Why do you participate in demonstrations?

525
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,110
You don't have time to study or even to have fun like other people.

526
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,320
You're constantly chased and getting hurt.

527
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,190
How can you live like that every day?

528
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,460
I want to call the losing side, my side.

529
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,940
Everyone always wants to call the winners side their side.

530
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,400
So the losing side is always lonely and sad.

531
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:03,770
Those who always lose no matter how many times they fight... I want to take their side.

532
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:20,010
Taking the side of the ones who always lose no matter how many times they fight.

533
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,680
That's what I learned.

534
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,470
Do you have the leisure to take someone's side?

535
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,730
You could end up losing too.

536
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,010
I don't care.

537
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,720
All this time, I haven't had much experience winning, anyway.

538
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,100
I may have never won, but I've also never been ashamed.

539
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,520
I don't want to change that. Especially if that's because of you.

540
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,760
It was around here.

541
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,110
What do you mean?

542
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,700
Hyeonjeo-dong.  Where I last had my conscience.

543
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,470
The fine dust levels are high today, Vice President.

544
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,230
If it's about being noxious, I'll easily win against some measly fine dust.

545
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,660
Come on, how can you say such thing?

546
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,290
You're right.

547
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,680
I guess the dust would be offended.

548
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,690
At least they don't interfere with the lives of others.

549
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,230
Did something happen today?

550
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,940
I want to be on your side.

551
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,760
Since you're on the losing people's side, you must be lonely too.

552
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,300
So I'll be on your side.

553
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,520
It'll be difficult being on my side. You won't be able to do it.

554
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:35,090
Being in Hyeonjeo-dong today, my heart felt weird and it ached.

555
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,580
But after hearing your story on top of that,

556
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,650
something in here keeps resonating,

557
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,640
and I feel something hot rising inside me.

558
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,680
That's why I told you not to come.

559
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,790
It doesn't suit you.

560
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,200
There are many people on my side already, so you just go back where you used to be.

561
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,530
I have to go to a meeting. Take the bus home.

562
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:22,980
♫  Spring&nbsp;blossoming in our hearts  ♫

563
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,990
♫  My trembling heart waiting for you  ♫

564
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,350
 It's me, Ji Soo.

565
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,060
 I'm in front of your house.

566
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,720
 I couldn't just leave today.

567
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,910
  There is something that feels like it'll kill me if I don't tell you, and something I'd like to hear as well.

568
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,670
 I'll wait. I'm not leaving until you come.

569
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,470
♫  The ticklish whispers of summer emotions   ♫

570
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:55,890
♫  The longing welled up in my brow  ♫

571
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:02,820
♫  All of this is a new experience of you  ♫

572
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:15,250
♫  Our hearts are colored with autumn   ♫

573
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:21,440
♫  With your smiles that are like a cool breeze  ♫

574
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:32,430
♫  And those facial expressions I'm first seeing  ♫

575
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:44,540
♫  In unfamiliar scenery not yet lived  ♫

576
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:50,670
♫  I've never faced such beauty  ♫

577
00:49:50,670 --> 00:50:03,610
♫  I had thought such beauty would never exist again  ♫

578
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,510
How can someone who plays the piano not even wear gloves?

579
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,260
They're really like ice.

580
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,930
Whether it's for organization or assembly, please stop hanging around.

581
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,640
It's not even a time where all citizens need to fight with their lives on the line.

582
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,910
You aren't desperate and it isn't your belief either.

583
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,920
To me, you are my belief and my world.

584
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,260
So I'll do all the things you do out of your belief.

585
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,190
I'll be on the same side as you,

586
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,760
and I'm going to live in the world that you're living in.

587
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,100
I won't change my mind, so don't try to convince me otherwise.

588
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,620
Come to department room 310.

589
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,370
It's a circle that I made.

590
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,740
Is that about philosophy, too?

591
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,060
No, it's about movies.

592
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,910
Also...

593
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,620
We are dating as of today.

594
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,970
Sunbae used to be my side, my belief...

595
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,050
and my world.

596
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,520
Your belief is no longer of this world.

597
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:13,250
 Hyeong Seong

598
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,460
Since we offered to negotiate, we expect most of the leading demonstrators will come.

599
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,390
A lot of people will also be gathering to support it.

600
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,720
But we don't have much to bring to the negotiating table.

601
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,450
Other than reinstating them, there isn't much else to discuss, and we cannot accept those terms.

602
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,370
It's a formal procedure and a show, for the purpose of building history.

603
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,710
The negotiation will end within thirty minutes of starting.

604
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,810
Then the police will be deployed immediately at that moment.

605
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,900
Please do that.

606
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,530
I didn't learn anything and I didn't even graduate from university.

607
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,190
I don't know if we'll be able to do well.

608
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:55,230
Don't worry. You know it best, after all.

609
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,030
What it is that people want.

610
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,790
Should I take some cheongsimhwan? 
  (T/N:  medicine for the nerves)

611
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,750
Now that they suddenly want to talk,

612
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,260
I feel more nervous.

613
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,060
I heard that the new vice president is even more vicious.

614
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,080
Even so, they say that he isn't a bad person. They say he's smart and logical.

615
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,000
It's worrisome because he's smart. We don't know what kind of tricks he'll play.

616
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,510
On top of that, since he's the chairman's son-in-law, he's definitely going to be on the company's side.

617
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,890
Even so, this is a great improvement.

618
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,840
Before, they wouldn't even meet with us.

619
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,190
It'll turn out well. The world has changed a lot too.

620
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,270
It should be like that, right?

621
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,060
Okay, then let's go and get just one drink somewhere.

622
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,660
I think that's the only way I'll be able to fall asleep.

623
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,920
You're going to negotiate with them?

624
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,580
Who said you could? You're just bypassing me, the CEO?

625
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,920
Didn't you tell me to do whatever I want?

626
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,690
Was being in there for four years the problem?

627
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,150
Why are you doing things you normally don't do?

628
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:04,460
The process is just for formality;  the result won't change.

629
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,450
Report every detail of the result of the negotiation to me.

630
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:12,640
Okay, I'm going to go out for some air.

631
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,610
- Ji Soo. 
- Yes?

632
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:31,040
I don't think that we're going to win.

633
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,350
Even so, I'm not going to lose easily.

634
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,670
Whether you win or lose, I'll be on your side until the end.

636
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,580
 The End of that Summer

637
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,850
 From Ji Soo, returning this to Sunbae Jae Hyeon

 Yoon Ji Soo

640
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,240
Seo Gyeong, what is it at this late hour?

641
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,080
Please cancel the riot police for today.

642
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,590
Pardon? But we already finished all the discussions with the police captain.

643
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,930
We'll decide again after the negotiation.

644
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,390
But why all of a sudden?

645
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,850
Please proceed that way.

646
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,730
I understand.

647

♫  we will not be shaken by any temptation  ♫

648

♫  let us live like a rock  ♫

649
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,110
♫  what sways in the wind  ♫

650
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:51,310
♫  are reeds with thin roots  ♫

651

♫  but that rock firmly embedded in the land  ♫

652
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,190
 Police

653
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,280
 It's an order from the Chairman. Don't interfere.

654
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,000
 Is it loyalty to your colleagues?

655
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,510
 Or what? Is it your sense of justice?

656
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,480
 It won't even earn you money. So why?

657
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,640
 Because I learned from you.

658
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,480
 That the losing side, is our side.

659
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:44,840

660
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:05,850

663

 I am my own guardian.

664
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:27,450
 Whenever you do something weird, that woman is always there.

665
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:34,160
 I still don't understand why you left like that.

666
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,380
 I'd better let her know her place.

667
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,090
 For you to be happy.

668
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:44,400
 Because you'll end up making different choices from the ones you've made until now.
