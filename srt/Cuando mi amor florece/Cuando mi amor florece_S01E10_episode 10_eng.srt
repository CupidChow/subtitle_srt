 When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower

3
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,550
What is going on?

4
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,520
Hurry and call me, honey.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,000
What is that sound?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,810
Why are the lights not on?

7
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,230
- But I'm in a hurry...
 - What's going on?

8
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,980
 Passengers, our train will stop momentarily due to a generator malfunction.

9
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,040
 We will depart as soon as the repair is completed.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,530
 I apologize profusely for causing this inconvenience.

11
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,360
I have to go and find my daughter.

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
 It's raining, and my daughter will be cold.

13
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,550
 Ji Yeong! Honey!

14
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,770
Ah, I'm going to the department store with Mom to get my watch fixed.
   /  (T/N:Sampoong Dept Store collapse, June 29, 1995.)

15
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,820
 Shall we buy you a strawberry cake there?

16
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Dad's office said I should hurry and go there.

17
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,900
So I better hurry and go.

18
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,660
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,510
 Stop

20
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,460
Ji Soo?

21
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,290
Just a moment.

22
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,680
Be careful of your hands.

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,210
What do I do...?

24
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,530
No...

25
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,630
I must go!

26
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,520
Please open this, please.

27
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,320
I...

28
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,120
I am too late...

29
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,290
I told them I would be home early.

30
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,760
Mom, what to do?

31
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,900
Please open this, please.

32
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,240
Ji Soo, Ji Soo.

33
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,290
Ji Soo?

34
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,470
I can't remember.

35
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:25,850
I remember everything that happened that day.

36
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,050
But the last time I saw Mom and Ji Yeong's faces,

37
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,810
no matter how much I try, I cannot remember.

38
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,580
Ji Soo.

39
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
 Emergency Room

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,720
 Episode 10

41
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,010
 Funeral Home / 24 hr Emergency Room

42
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,200
 I hoped that they were in the emergency room.

43
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,230
 I prayed that they were in the emergency room.

44
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,100
 That they would at least be alive...

45
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,380
 I prayed and prayed again, but...

46
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,030
 Ah, I'm going to the department store with Mom to get my watch fixed.

47
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,280
 Shall we buy you a strawberry cake there?

48
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,390
I'm sorry.

49
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,300
Eonni is so sorry.

50
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,940
 Ah, I'm going to the department store with Mom to get my watch fixed.

51
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,430
 Shall we buy you a strawberry cake there?

52
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,530
 Do whatever you want to.

53
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,420
 Hurry home, Dad will get angry again.

54
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,340
 Yes.

55
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,610
 Look at her leaving so quickly, not even letting us see her face.

56
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,650
 Eonni, we might forget what you look like.

57
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,520
 Mom. Ji Yeong.

58
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,160
 Ji Yeong. Mom.

59
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,710
 Mom! Ji Yeong! Yoon Ji Yeong!

60
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,830
 Mom, please look this way.

61
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,600
 Mom, please just look this way, just once.

62
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,790
 Ji Yeong, please look this way, just once.

63
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,560
 Just once, please. Please let me see your faces, just once.

64
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,140
 Please, just once...

65
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,120
 It's always the same dream.

66
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,190
No matter how much I call them, Mom and Ji Yeong will not turn to look at me.

67
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,370
I should have made sure to see more of them.

68
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,820
They even joked that they would forget my face.

69
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,670
I should have seen them every day and told them I loved them, every day.

70
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,050
I changed like this, what if they can't recognize me?

71
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,660
I miss them so much,

72
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,840
but what if we can't meet again?

73
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,040
That's what I think every day.

74
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,440
How can they not recognize you?

75
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,020
Because they must be looking at you every day already.

76
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,230
They probably saw that you got gray hairs already.

77
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,060
"Eonni, you have gray hair now." That's what she would say.

78
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,960
Ji Yeong and Mother, they would laugh together, and worry together,

79
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,500
and even discuss what they should do, I'm sure.

80
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,180
I have a mountain of worries

81
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,990
and yet I'm even worrying about the afterworld. I'm sure they will scold me for that.

82
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,740
Yes, a lot.

83
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,170
Perhaps, Seonbae,

84
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,550
I don't think I've taken even a single step outside from that day.

85
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,810
But must you come out of it?

86
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,240
Perhaps that day is not a day that you must overcome and escape from

87
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,180
or leave behind.

88
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,160
A deep wound is also a deep longing, after all.

89
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,700
You long for them so much, so it hurts so much. And as you hurt, you long for them even more.

90
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,670
It's a problem regarding how you accept it, rather than how you endure it.

91
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,630
So maybe if you keep facing it and looking into it deeply,

92
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:31,370
then maybe someday you may remember your mother and Ji Yeong's faces?

93
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,480
Was it like that for you, Seonbae?

94
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,270
Like Dong Jin said, it's carrot. (Wordplay on the word sure).

95
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,130
I acted like a know-it-all, but I've still got a long way to go. Maybe I'm about halfway there?

96
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,080
My daughter, is she alright?

97
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,840
- Omo, what's he doing?
 - Please find my daughter for me.

98
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,140
Ji Yeong... Ji Yeong...

99
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,260
Please... please...my daughter. 
 Emergency Medical Center

100
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,610
My daughter... my daughter and my wife should be here.

101
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,950
Please find my daughter for me.

102
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,080
Ah, did you get a call that they were in the emergency room?

103
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,120
They should be here.

104
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,320
They got hurt, and they will be lying down.

105
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,040
Please...

106
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,780
Please find my daughter for me.

107
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,770
Emergency Medical Center

108
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,490
 The recipient cannot answer your call, you will be connected to voice mail. After being connected...

109
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,840
- Hey, what are you going to do?
 - Let go.

110
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,340
It's just gossip among our moms, it's not even certain.

111
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,460
I don't care, I will kill them all.

112
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,830
Hey, Han Joon Seo!

113
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,410
I said I always hated you from the start, didn't I?

114
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,860
I wish you were dead! Just die already!

115
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,060
Why are you doing this to me again? Why? What did I do wrong?

116
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,440
You just suck. You and your mom, you both just suck.

117
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,000
Why are you cursing my mom?

118
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,720
- Why?!?
 - Why? Because this is all because of your mom!

119
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,610
I was waiting for you...

120
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,330
And it just so happens that you two came together.

121
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,720
Joon Seo.

122
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,490
Nurse's Office

123
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,860
Yeong Min.

124
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,730
I hear that Yeong Min hit Joon Seo again.

125
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,810
Didn't I tell you that we needed to deal with the past incident properly?

126
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,850
The old proverb that a needle thief becomes a cow thief. Would the elders say things that weren't correct?

127
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,180
Are your injuries okay?

128
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
What happened?

129
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,940
Yeong Min, please look at Mom.

130
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,160
You really won't tell me? Shall we just get past this again?

131
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,480
Then I can't help you this time.

132
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,070
I promised them that this sort of thing will never happen again.

133
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,310
Are you, perhaps,

134
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,160
mad at Mom?

135
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,940
They both won't speak about why this happened.

136
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,600
First and foremost,

137
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeong Min hit Joon Seo first, that is an important fact.

138
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Isn't the reason more important than who hit who first?

139
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,650
Teacher Kim? Have you inquired the students who were with them, or saw the fight?

140
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,240
So tell us. We hear that you both were there.

141
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,320
If you don't speak, you both will be summoned to the school violence committee,

142
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,180
and it will be on your permanent records.

143
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,550
So who hit who first?

144
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,110
Joon... no, Yeong Min hit first.

145
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,710
There must have been a reason.

146
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,850
Yeong Min's mom and Joon Seo's dad,

147
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,440
they have a "something-something" relationship, we heard.

148
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,410
Yeong Min, Mom found out everything.

149
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,150
Why you won't even look at my face.

150
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:56,290
My heart is aching.

151
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,650
I'm aching, too.

152
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,440
What Han Joon Seo said, is he correct?

153
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,390
Yeong Min,

154
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't know how you will take this.

155
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:27,560
Maybe you'll feel angrier, or maybe you'll feel less angry, I can't be confident.

156
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,020
But I'll tell you about my life from a long time ago.

157
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,270
Joon Seo's dad

158
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,920
was my first love.

159
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,740
 Among our family,

160
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,190
 only the two people who had the most fraught relationship were left behind.

161
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,580
Dad.

162
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,890
Where are you going now?

163
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,180
They're not there anymore. They're really gone.

164
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,970
What are you saying? Why isn't my Ji Yeong there anymore?

165
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,220
If you say strange things like that again, I will kill you with my own hands!

166
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,460
What brings you here?

167
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,880
So you will continue to not go to school?

168
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,140
I plan to quit.

169
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,570
I understand, but you don't have to quit.

170
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,740
Just take a leave of absence, and once things get sorted out.

171
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,920
Dad was expelled from his job.

172
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,540
They were investigating bribery related to abuse of power,

173
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,920
and during the audit, he confessed everything, I heard.

174
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:24,300
Dad isn't really living anymore. I feel like he is dying.

175
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,390
After just a five-minute walk from my house, you can see that department store.

176
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,500
Every day the thought that Dad could die at any time occurs to me.

177
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,560
That's why I plan on leaving here.

178
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,320
What about Seonbae Jae Hyeon?

179
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,510
With the moments that were pretty as flowers

180
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,550
I think I can endure.

181
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,220
I'm sorry and  I was grateful, Seonbae.

198
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:47,980
 I was able to endure because of the moments that we had like blooming flowers. I am sorry and I was thankful, Seonbae  
 ♫  Instead of saying the words 'I love you'  ♫

199
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,190
I can't find her anywhere.

200
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,820
She moved away from her home, too.

201
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,760
I heard she quit school, too.

202
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,380
Yeong Woo, she didn't tell you anything, either?

203
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,510
No.

204
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,510
Then what about that friend? She was Ji Soo's closest friend, the engineering major.

205
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,040
Hye Jeong?

206
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,640
Would she also not know, maybe?

207
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,210
Even if it were me, I would understand her not wanting to see anyone right now.

208
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,470
Thinking about Ji Soo does bring tears to my eyes,

209
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,860
but we should endure the pain together. Why would she disappear? Why?

210
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,010
That naughty wench.

211
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,850
Until I have to return to duty,

212
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,570
I will continue to look for her.

213
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,200
But once I return, please continue to look for her, too.

214
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,730
She must be having a very very difficult time alone,

215
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,700
and what if something happens to her?

216
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,250
I don't think I can live.

217
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,990
I was in my right body and mind,

218
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,520
but I couldn't do a single thing for her.

219
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,170
The person who I thought was my whole world was falling apart,

220
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,530
but all I could do was to look on from afar.

221
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,930
So my life became all heartache and agony...

222
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,800
Do you understand at all how I feel?

223
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,870
But I always wished her well and prayed for her.

224
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,050
Then I happened to meet her again.

225
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,170
But she's having a difficult time, same as ever.

226
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:08,210
So I felt bad, too, as if I'd returned to the past.

227
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,750
But Dad, you have Mom.

228
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,720
I

229
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,090
had no choice but to leave, I think.

230
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,560
After that day...

231
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,360
someone who loves, someone who receives love...

232
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,830
such ordinary happiness...

233
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,610
I felt like I had no right to enjoy such things, ever.

234
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,390
You are so small,

235
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,580
yet I just gave you such a huge burden.

236
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,230
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

237
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,950
Yes?

238
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,330
Hello, this is the nursing home.

239
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,490
You are Mr. Han Jae Hyeon, aren't you?

240
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,040
Yes, what is the matter?

241
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,290
Patient Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter is not answering her phone.

242
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,830
The patient left the nursing home and he hasn't returned.

243
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,820
His mother is quite something.

244
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,640
When it comes to their child, other parents are eager to have it pass and are busy groveling.

245
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,650
This mother doesn't act like that. It's almost hateful.

246
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,730
Actually, she is has that character, enough to behave that way.

247
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,390
I did frame the incident as Yeong Min's fault, rather than Joon Seo's.

248
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,850
But I am apprehensive about how Yeong Min and his mother will react.

249
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,920
What's the point of their insistence, when there is no evidence?

250
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,130
That is true.

251
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,540
But if he violates school rules and causes a big problem,

252
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,350
isn't it possible to expel that student under the principal's authority?

253
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,330
Ah, yes, that is true, but...

254
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,740
even if the school violence committee is held, expulsion is the harshest discipline.

255
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,310
It's rare for a middle school student to be given that punishment, so I am worried that there will be rumors.

256
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:51,040
So what if there are rumors? They will die down soon.

257
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,970
Are people these days that interested in other people's affairs?

258
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,810
Of course, they're not interested.

259
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,820
Then I will report to you on any updates regarding how it goes.

260
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,510
Sure, sure.

261
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,810
 3rd crossing Super (market)

262
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,940
You didn't answer your phone.

263
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,190
I guess I was off this whole time.

264
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,390
The nursing home called saying that Father left and hasn't returned.

265
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,180
Do you know where he might be?

266
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,990
It's raining, so I think it would be there.

267
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,630
Why are you doing this again? Breaking my heart.

268
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,890
What if something really happens to you?

269
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,060
Ji Soo.

270
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,120
It's fortunate that

271
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,920
we found Mom and Ji Yeong, at least.

272
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,950
They said there are countless people who never even found their family's bodies.

273
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,290
It's something we should be thankful for.

274
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,570
But still,

275
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,970
I really do miss them a lot.

276
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Dad...

277
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,660
Do you have some time?

278
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,510
You said you were curious why I left.

279
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,000
It definitely wasn't your fault,

280
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,190
and I knew that so well,

281
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,160
but I thought I might come to blame you.

282
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:20,580
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have left home that day without even looking back.

283
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,630
Mom and Ji Yeong wouldn't have gone there that day, at that time.

284
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,030
We would have been together that day and enjoyed a peaceful evening together.

285
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,080
It wouldn't have been enough to blame myself, over and over,

286
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,680
so I would have needed someone else to blame.

287
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,010
That would have been you, and after continuing to blame you,

288
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,370
I thought we might come to hate each other.

289
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,060
We would scratch each other

290
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,790
and it would make us hurt more.

291
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,600
But this time, Yeong Min got hurt.

292
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,420
It's definitely not your fault this time, too,

293
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,700
but my heart feels conflicted.

294
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,380
After the last incident, perhaps you didn't have a proper talk with your son.

295
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,520
They say mothers' words are strong,

296
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,800
but a son should fear and be obedient to his father.

297
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,200
After thinking such thoughts, I would beat myself up in my head.

298
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm stupidly blaming Seonbae again.

299
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,380
Twenty-five years ago, and again, now, I'm making the same mistake.

300
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,380
So Seonbae,

301
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:48,160
our children's hearts and bodies have become hurt, so they need time to heal.

302
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,430
And we do as well, I think.

303
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,450
Yes.

304
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,950
I think you may be right.

305
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,490
 Apartment Building 2, Units 3-4

306
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,910
 Homeroom Teacher

307
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,460
Yes, Teacher?

308
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,940
Yes, I understand.

309
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,700
She thinks they will have a school violence committee hearing.

310
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,950
Mom, are you still feeling sorry for me?

311
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,530
Yes.

312
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,580
Then can you let me do as I want things done?

313
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,680
Yes.

314
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,730
This time no matter what anyone says to you,

315
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,080
make sure to never change your opinion so the committee proceeds, Principal.

316
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,650
Yes.

317
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,230
They're doing the school violence committee?

318
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:51,600
Of course. Someone dared to mess with Jang Seo Kyeong's son, not just once but twice.

319
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,550
I really won't stand for it this time.

320
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,420
So what will you do?

321
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,550
I will humiliate him in public and get him expelled from school.

322
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,550
But I hit him, too.

323
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,210
But did you really tell me everything yesterday?

324
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,450
What do you mean?

325
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,320
Did he really just hit you without any reason?

326
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,130
It's not without any reason,

327
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,310
he said I looked down on him and teased him.

328
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,360
That's fine then. Keep eating.

329
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,460
You can say whatever you need to at the school violence committee, so why must you...?

330
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,570
Yeong Min said he had something to tell you.

331
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,150
Yeong Min, I plan to hear both of you out fairly.

332
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,400
To judge after hearing just one side is bias.

333
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,250
I already know that you only believe Joon Seo's words.

334
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,460
What are you saying? When did I only believe Joon Seo?

335
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,590
I definitely never hit him first.

336
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,540
I was wrong to hit him back out of anger, so I plan to accept my punishment.

337
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,340
So that is why we're holding a school violence committee.

338
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,670
I don't want to accept the punishment given by this school.

339
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,120
It's because this school, while I was suffering school violence

340
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,260
did nothing for me.

341
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,280
So I will withdraw from this school.

342
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,920
Go ahead, cry. You can cry.

343
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,980
I know well how you feel.

344
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,300
It's alright.

345
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,450
So am I now just an elementary school graduate?

346
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,860
I'm just a high school graduate. I know you love Mom, but you don't have to copy what I do.

347
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:57,130
But Yeong Min, you could transfer schools. Why did you say you will quit?

348
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,280
I thought that would make it all end sooner.

349
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,850
So you will have fewer difficulties, Mom.

350
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,330
Don't you hate Mom?

351
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:16,250
Why are there rumors about you and Han Joon Seo's dad, of all people? That made me angry.

352
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,250
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

353
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,240
I know it might sound insincere because I say that to you so often.

354
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,750
But I am really sorry.

355
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,450
So what happens now with Joon Seo's dad?

356
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,190
If I tell you that I don't like it, can you stop seeing him?

357
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,550
Yes?

358
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,720
That student quit school. Did you coach him into doing that?

359
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,900
He quit school?

360
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,560
So it's his mom's doing, huh?

361
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,560
He quit before he was expelled.

362
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,460
But isn't that a bit cowardly?

363
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,890
What are you trying to say?

364
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,720
I'm just letting you know that the divorce you want isn't easy.

365
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,560
Can you really abandon your beloved child and live while raising someone else's child?

366
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,830
Dad, do you remember Yeong Min?

367
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,090
Hello.

368
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,350
It's alright.

369
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:03,490
It's Saturday, so it would've been nice if Joon Seo's dad could have joined us.

370
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,670
He even goes to work on Saturdays. You know he doesn't know anything else besides work.

371
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,930
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

372
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:18,930
I purposely didn't tell him that you were coming, Mother.

373
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,680
I wanted to speak with you alone, Mother-in-Law.

374
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,490
Is something going on?

375
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:36,610
Jae Hyeon would die for you because he loves you so much.

376
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:41,480
So if you tell him that you like me, he might not let me go.

377
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,270
So something is going on between you two.

378
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,720
Please plead with Jae Hyeon, Mother.

379
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,560
When did you come?

380
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,820
And why are you here alone?

381
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,520
Has something happened?

382
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,150
What about you, what is happening with you?

383
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,060
Joon Seo's mom asked me to help her hold on to you.

384
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:21,220
You told me that you met that girl, so did something really happen after all?

385
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:26,760
Because I know how you've endured so far in life,

386
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,840
if I'm only thinking about you, it would be right for me to tell you to break up with your wife.

387
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:39,390
However thinking about your child, I cannot bring myself to utter those words.

388
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,450
What's going on that you would come to greet me?

389
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,720
Did you drink? After inviting my mother to come here?

390
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,930
Well, since I said all I needed to say to her.

391
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,610
But seeing your reaction,

392
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,070
looks like using the mother-in-law as a saving chance wasn't very effective.

393
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,160
It's our problem. There isn't anything Mother can do about it.

394
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,940
There's no such thing.

395
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,930
I will do everything. I will grab anyone I can to help me.

396
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:27,510
How regretful that your father died when you were young. I'll bet he would be on my side.

397
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,950
All that's left is for you to make your decision.

398
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,290
I can't decide.

399
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,980
How can I make such a decision so easily?

400
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,990
Nothing was ever easy before.

401
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,840
Because at every single point, you have to put everything at stake.

402
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,820

 Ocean Music School

404
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,730
- Bye, Yoo Bin.
 - Goodbye.

405
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,010
Is she your friend, Yoo Bin?

406
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,900
She is not my friend.

407
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,860
Did you come to take a class?

408
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,370
She doesn't go to this music school.

409
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,250
I can play better than you even if I don't attend an academy.

410
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,390
How funny. How can you play if you don't take any classes?

411
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,400
I can play.

412
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,870
You don't even have a piano at home.

413
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,550
But I can still play.

414
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,820
Then do you want to try playing piano?

415
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,650
Teacher, my mother wants you to come over for dinner.

416
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,190
Alright Yoo Bin, go on home.

417
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,910
Goodbye.

418
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:01,940
Byeol, how did you play that? You really never had lessons before?

419
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,450
Then can you play something else?

420
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,280
- Byeol, you really never studied piano before?
 - No.

421
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,750
You can't read music?

422
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,950
But you just know how to play it after listening to it?

423
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,790
Yes.

424
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,880
Byeol, wouldn't you like to attend the music school?

425
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,520
Mom says she has no money even if we were to just eat.

426
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,230
If you come at this time, I can just give you lessons.

427
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,400
I don't have money to pay you, though.

428
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,890
I will teach you for free. It's because I want to hear you play.

429
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,620
Go on home.

430
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,890
Teacher, thank you.

431
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,460
 Rental Inquiry

432
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,300
010-766-8464

433
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,170
I know you're very busy, so I'll confirm just a few things and end this.

434
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,550
The cause of the suicide from five years ago, of Kwon Hyeok Soo, a laborer at Hyeong Seong Steel

435
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,990
was the result of a malignant disollution of labor by the company.

436
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:04,660
And that you, Han Jae Hyeon are the center of those events is the claim made by the plaintiff.

437
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,840
Do you acknowledge these statements?

438
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,390
That is not true.

439
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,730
Yes, even I view it that way.

440
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,960
The documents submitted by the plaintiff,

441
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,420
aside from the fact that you were the department head of the Strategy Committee has no physical basis.

442
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,180
They're all just speculations and assumptions.

443
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,480
Destruction of the labor union in violation of the law did occur.

444
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,170
What?

445
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,650
What I am saying is that I was not involved

446
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:32,280
in the destruction of the labor union. That is not to say that Hyeong Seong did not engage in unfair labor practices.

447
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,230
Five years ago, at Hyeong Seong Steel, there was a calculated and vicious destruction of the labor union.

448
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,660
And regarding Kwon Hyeok Su's death, that event was the direct cause.

449
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,440
Vice President, what you just told me,

450
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,190
what that means, and what will result from it, do you comprehend it?

451
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,830
I comprehend it well, and I have been well prepared for it.

452
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,170
 Park

453
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,460
Are you looking for that old man?

454
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,700
For some reason, he isn't around.

455
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,210
It's the notice of the outcome of the suit sent by Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office.

456
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,980
No charge, no indictment.

457
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,950
What does this mean?

458
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,350
That evidence is lacking regarding whether Han Jae Hyeon committed a crime,

459
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,600
or that what he did cannot be classified as a crime.

460
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,740
So they cannot punish him.

461
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,490
Then what happens now?

462
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:48,580
There are no other legal actions left.

463
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,110
He really is a cowardly and unscrupulous person.

464
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:59,970
Aigoo, I pity my Hyeok Soo so much. I don't know what to do.

465
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,310
I cannot live.

466
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:09,820
I really cannot go on living like this, Mr. Attorney.

467
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,400
I cannot go on living like this, either.

468
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:00,550
I know well that you have a lot.

469
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,570
Everyone in this nation knows that.

470
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,250
And because I know well how you came to have them

471
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,960
I am telling you that I will never accept anything that you give to me, Chairman.

472
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,530
I heard that you love your son a lot. But I guess, not so much?

473
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,550
It is because I am thinking of my child.

474
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,990
And please stop tailing me.

475
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,690
I will report your tailing as illegal surveillance of regular citizens.

476
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:36,990
Your father is bedridden, and I feel bad about your mother and sister.

477
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:41,000
So all that I have, and all the power I have,

478
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,090
I haven't even shown you even as much as a speck of dirt underneath my fingernail.

479
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,120
Sorry about this, but I don't want to see it.

480
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,250
Whether it be a carrot to entice me or a stick. Please don't do anything.

481
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,970
Since it's all illegal and all threats.

482
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,520
I condemn the murderous corporation Hyeong Seong's misdeeds. Dissolution of labor and character assassination.

483
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,930
 Apprehend Han Jae Hyeon immediately.

484
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,860
I will confirm for you, just what Han Jae Hyeon did.

485
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,630
 You're keeping a promise you made 25 years ago.

486
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,120
I know, right?

487
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,290
But I don't think it tastes the same as back then.

488
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,240
It was so delicious.

489
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,680
We were probably much hungrier, back then.

490
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,480
No,

491
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,060
I think it probably changed.

492
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,610
Because you changed, Seonbae.

493
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:32,630
I'm glad that you were not indicted today. Still, I'm not sure

494
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:38,170
what is real and what is right.

495
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,800
And the elder who is protesting by himself in front of your company headquarters, I know him, too.

496
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,720
I even helped him before when he was having difficulties.

497
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:59,250
Is what happened to his son really because of you, Seonbae?

498
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:05,620
It's a long story. To tell you just the conclusion, it's not.

499
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,310
Because of the things I have done, I know it's hard to believe.

500
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,020
I don't intend to lie even to you.

501
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,800
This incident is like a thorn inside, too.

502
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,220
If you wait just a little bit longer, I'll tell you the whole, long story.

503
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,850
Though for now, it will be difficult.

504
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,640
 Seonbae Jae Hyeon

505
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:46,410
Seonbae. I'd better hear the story after all.

506
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,680
The long story.

507
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:55,430
This afternoon, Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter came by. She was quite impudent.

508
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,060
Different from her father... shall I call it, hot tempered?

509
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,090
Maybe malice? Anyway, she has that.

510
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,930
What do I do with a day-old pup that doesn't know to fear the world?

511
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,710
I've got so many thoughts in my head.

512
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,520
- Chairman.
 - Why are you standing? I said to sit down.

513
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,620
I came to see you because I had something urgent to tell you while investigating Yoon Hyeong Goo.

514
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,600
What is it?

515
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,550
The story begins with my father.

516
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:28,150
While I was in the army, I got a call.

517
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:32,900
That my father committed suicide.

518
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,100
That he betrayed his fellow workers who were like family to him

519
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:44,330
and took bribes to destroy the labor union, an informant, a con man.

520
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,770
He was tormented by the tag of being a mole.

521
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:54,650
Among the labor union leaders who always just called for strikes, he was different.

522
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,450
He tried to hear out the company's position, too.

523
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:01,300
That is why he was perfect to be used for our plans.

524
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,590
Because he was well-liked and respected, things worked out well.

525
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,000
The original labor union was disbanded.

526
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,060
After that, we negotiated a restructuring with a new labor union...

527
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,520
Alright, so what happened, anyway?

528
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,990
He filed charges with the prosecutor's office that we committed labor violations.

529
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,730
So we blocked that, that time.

530
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,030
Yes, the prosecutor fixed the case so that we turned the blame for the disbandment of the labor union

531
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,240
and the unfair terminations all onto him.

532
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,570
Thanks to that, the union members were disbanded.

533
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,140
In true sequence, the fired workers, all of them, filed charges against him.

534
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,930
So all the charges against the company were dismissed

535
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,840
and that person was indicted for illegal destruction of a labor union instead.

536
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,020
Soon after, he committed suicide.

537
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:53,720
I confirmed recently that he was Vice President Han Jae Hyeon's father.

538
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,310
It was the most barren funeral showing in the world.

539
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:18,740

540
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:23,930
♫  We have perhaps, again,  ♫

541
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,250
♫  passed by the same place  ♫

542
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,620
 When My Love Blooms 
 ♫  and at that time another day  ♫

543
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:40,560
If there was a need to put the word "because of whom" in regards to my father's incident,

544
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,070
it should be because of me.

545
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,090
Yoon Ji Soo's son committed violence against Joon Soo.

546
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,420
What is it that you want to say?

547
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,500
I don't know how to fight fair.

548
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,920
I will win by ripping you into pieces.

549
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,260
Let us end this.

550
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,830
The most painful bone-shattering mistake I made in my life, I don't want to make it again.

551
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,590
Because we have to become happy.

552
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,540
♫  Just when I think I got over it easily  ♫

553
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,720
♫  To that time again.  ♫
