1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:14,050

2
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,890
 When My Love Blooms

3
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,570
So, what did you want to say?

4
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,150
If you don't believe in turning a blind eye to the faults of the man you love,

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,470
please stop Jae Hyeon.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,260
You're the only person who can do so.

7
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,160
If you stop Jae Hyeon, I will leave.

8
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,870
Properly.

9
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,960
 Hyeong Seong

10
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,370
I'm sorry,

11
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,880
but I will not stop him.

12
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,970
Alright, then. Continue your adulterous affair.

13
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,650
Forever.

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,630
However...

15
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,940
why does your justice bypass me and my father?

16
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,720
Is it okay to steal from people with money?

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,260
He will not steal.

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,110
If Sunbae has returned to his original self,

19
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,850
he will never steal from others.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,760
I must seem laughable.

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,990
At the thought of losing money, I threw any feelings of love out the window.

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,460
I wouldn't have acted much differently, either.

23
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,880
My dad, mom, and younger sister.

24
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,490
If it was for my family, I could've done anything, too.

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,600
That's why I'm trying to do anything, too. Until the end.

26
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,920
I will need all of your support.

27
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,300
First,

28
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,370
you may be wondering what right I have to say such things.

29
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,330
  The owner's family, borrowed-name shares, Scissorhands,

30
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,280
  and even my personal matters in the recent couple of months.

31
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,190
 I know many cold glares were aimed at me. I know

32
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,700
 I should be the one to deal with all these things myself.

33
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,950
However, what I want to say today relates to your and my workplace.

34
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,350
It is about Hyeong Seong.

35
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,040
As you all know, next week, an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting will be held at Hyeong Seong Holdings.

36
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,750
That day,

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,910
I will need your support for a new Hyeong Seong.

38
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,730
Look here! Do you know how many people who were forcibly dismissed from Hyeong Seong

39
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,140
are now out on the streets? Before you come here talking about a new Hyeong Seongâ€”

40
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,860
Five hundred forty-seven people.

41
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,210
One hundred thirty-seven from Hyeong Seong Mart, 292 from Hyeong Seong Steel,

42
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,200
35 from Hyeong Seong Products, and 83 from Hyeong Seong Steel Production.

43
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,230
 The other line's phone is off, you will be connected to voicemail...

44
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,120
Please call Executive Director Hwang and Section Chief Lee.

45
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,390
 The other line's phone is off, you will be connected to voicemail...

46
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,920
Lawyer Kim, as well.

47
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,180
It's Jang Seo Kyeong.

48
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,040
 Yes, CEO.

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,110
How's my dad?

50
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,410
 The review for the legality of detention that we requested will open tomorrow.

51
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,360
How does it look?

52
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,620
 Not good.

53
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,280
The new Hyeong Seong will have ownership completely separated from management.

54
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,540
At the shareholders' meeting, I will request

55
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,060
the dismissal of Chairman Jang San and CEO Jang Seo Kyeong.

56
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,100
Moreover, at the meeting,

57
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,950
I will resign.

58
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,870
 All affiliates of Hyeong Seong

59
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,800
 will be changed to a system with a board of directors and management specialists.

60
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,490
  They will be constantly observed by a compliance committee separated from their company.

61
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,080
At the meeting, I plan on institutionalizing

62
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,230
all of this permanently.

63
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,660
For the sake of that new beginning,

64
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,590
I will need the support of the 8.97% of shares

65
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,240
that all of you possess.

66
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,400
Yeong Min, when did you learn how to play?

67
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,910
The dog at the village school will become literate in three years, after all (exposure to something for a long time will help you garner the knowledge).

68
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,010
But that woman before, was she Joon Seo's mom?

69
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,810
Yeah.

70
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,140
Did something happen?

71
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,280
Joon Seo's grandfather is in prosecution, that's why.

72
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,520
Yeong Min.

73
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,610
Hug me just once.

74
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,370
I'm all out.

75
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,430
Of what?

76
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,820
Love's battery. Recharge me.

77
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,920
Mom, that's a dad joke.

78
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,350
I'm not a dad.

79
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,480
 Vice President!

80
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,690
What on earth is going on?

81
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,560
You're giving up the management rights?

82
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,770
Let's sit down and talk.

83
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,460
The article was wrong, right?

84
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,120
No, it's just as you read.

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,530
How could you do this without discussing it even once?

86
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,650
I know you are against a new Hyeong Seong.

87
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,800
I didn't put that money in compliance management to do economic justice.

88
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,370
The two of you have choices as well.

89
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,360
You could continue to help the new Hyeong Seong grow as their investors,

90
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,800
or sell all the stocks you've saved up to now when they're at their highest.

91
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,840
Why are you like this all of a sudden? You went through so much.

92
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Now you're just barely getting your time to shine.

93
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,810
I used to think the same way as you both.

94
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,180
I wanted to rise to Chairman Jang San's position,

95
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,320
and I wanted to feel the power and comfort of life from that seat.

96
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,200
But someone asked me this.

97
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,520
If I rise to that position,

98
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,830
will it be fair?

99
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,990
 Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to Give Up Management Rights for Hyeong Seong Group

100
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,360
 Incoming Call: Unni Seon Hee

101
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,830
Things went crazy after the bomb that Vice President Han Jae Hyeon dropped.

102
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,560
This timing perfectly crosses with Chairman Jang's indictment.

103
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,640
Isn't this Vice President Han Jae Hyeon's big picture?

104
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,780
I wondered how Jang San's faithful hunting dog, the Scissorhands who shed neither blood nor tears,

105
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,910
could become a whole new person overnight,

106
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,510
but I think I know the answer.

107
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,030
What's the answer?

108
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,330
The answer is Yoon Ji Soo.

109
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,030
I don't know what happened between the two of you,

110
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,680
but the Ji Soo I know can do more than just that.

111
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,350
Unni.

112
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,570
Do you want to have another cup of coffee? Or chicken and beer?

113
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,860
Hey you, with the broad shoulder.

114
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you looking for something?

115
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,610
I'm sorry. I'm waiting for somebody.

116
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,610
Are you waiting for my daughter?

117
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,940
No, it's not your daughter.

118
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,650
But I'm right! You are the one who came together with our Ji soo!

119
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,610
Our Ji soo?

120
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,420
I want you to sit down first because my neck hurts.

121
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,460
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,560
What's your relationship with our Ji soo?

123
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,540
It's an "our Ji soo, our sunbae," relationship.

124
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,380
That's a serious relationship!

125
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,610
Sunbae.

126
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,990
Here you are!

127
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,520
Ji Soo.

128
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,740
That grandmother is really nice.

129
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,780
I asked her to be my mom, but she said she can't.

130
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
She called you as her daughter?

131
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,590
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

132
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,090
As if anyone would doubt she is a Gyeongsang Province's grandmother.

133
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,440
Do you know why I was waiting for you here?

134
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,350
I know what happened today.

135
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,010
What happened today started here.

136
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,550
"There are still people there."

137
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,870
Are you not going to compliment me?

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,430
Come closer.

139
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,390
I heard this is a compliment?

140
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,930
Come out here. Come out here.

141
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,520
Did you hear about Vice-President Han Jae Hyeon giving up the management rights?

142
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
What do you expect for the review of the legality of your detention?

143
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,930
Is your tax evasion and embezzlement of public funds true? Please say a word!

144
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,990
Say something about it!

145
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,650
  The habeas corpus request by the chairman Jang San of Hyeong Seong Group on the first day of the prosecution

146
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,720
  was rejected by the court today.

147
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,030
 - The court fears the claimant might try to escape...   
 - Is that Joon Seo's grandfather?

148
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,270
  and might try to destroy the evidence,

149
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,970
 - thus stating the violation is significant enough to maintain the detention.   
 - Yes.

150
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,850
It would be hard for Joon Seo.

151
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,930
  Last night, Chairman Jang San was imprisoned in the Seoul detention center.

152
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,150
  The court also rejected the habeas corpus requests from Executive Director Hwang Hak Soo

153
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,230
  and Section Chief Lee Myeong Geun of Management Support, who were arrested and indicted at the same time...

154
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,800
  Hyeong Seong Holdings Extraordinary General Meeting of Stockholders

155
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,210
  CEO.

156
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,780
Keep talking.

157
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,360
  The result of the extraordinary meeting of shareholders came out.

158
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,830
  The dismissal proposals for you and the chairman

159
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,700
  have been passed.

160
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,300
  Vice-President Han resigned, too.

161
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,810
  Employee stockholders association and minority shareholders

162
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,910
  supported Vice-President Han's side.

163
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,320
  Court

164
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,270
Throughout the trial process so far,

165
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,630
it has been clearly confirmed that the claim from the three defendants, Jang San, Hwang Hak Soo, and Lee Myeong Geun,

166
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,920
is explicitly against the objective evidence.

167
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,260
The defendants have a long history of corruption crimes involving chaebol corruption

168
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,140
together with political and business collusion.

169
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,610
In the same manner, for the benefit of  the company's expedient management and the personal interests of the owner's family,

170
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,920
they have repeatedly committed systematic illegal acts that go against the national judicial order

171
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,070
for decades until now.

172
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,190
In addition to this case, there are no less than forty-two additional cases of criminal facts

173
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,510
for which the statute of limitations has already passed and which are therefore not covered in this trial.

174
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,140
One of them is

175
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,940
a crime resulting in the death of two workers who killed themselves

176
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,390
because they could not stand the stigma of being "agents at the company's service," union-breakers, and receiving bribes,

177
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,960
which is an anti-labor, anti-human rights crime.

178
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,890
And yet, the defendants

179
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,120
denied all the crimes and continued to make excuses  throughout the trial,

180
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,100
and even made false statements and criticized this trial.

181
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,340
By showing such an attitude, they once again caused great pain to the people

182
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,590
who observed this investigation and the present affair.

183
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,940
Your Honor,

184
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,540
please take this case as a valuable opportunity to put right our justice and principle of law,

185
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,000
and to set an example to support the efforts of the majority of law-abiding entrepreneurs.

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,060
For defendants Jang San, Hwang Hak Soo, and Lee Myeong Geun's crimes,

187
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,910
please give a fair evaluation and severe punishment.

188
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,940
We should be drinking on days like today

189
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,740
for completely opposite reasons.

190
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,940
Besides the fact that you are not managing the company,

191
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,100
nothing will be different for you.

192
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,730
The largest shareholders are still you and the chairman.

193
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,750
My entire shares will be applied to the nonprofit foundation that I'm going to create.

194
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:48,250
I'll make the articles of association so that nobody can challenge your ownership under any circumstances.

195
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,690
If Hyeong Seong keeps moving forward in a righteous manner, it can be much better than it is now.

196
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm not giving you this because I got touched by what you said. 
  Confirmation of Consensual Intention of Divorce

197
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:31,160
I met Yoon Ji Soo before you went to see the employees.

198
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,920
I still don't know that much about you,

199
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,770
but she had faith in you.

200
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:47,160
And at my dad's first trial today,

201
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,150
I had a lot of thoughts on my mind.

202
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,720
I was thinking about you and your father as well.

203
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,750
It's a given, but I'm going to take Joon Seo with me.

204
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,390
Joon Seo also said he wanted that, too.

205
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,090
I'm going to continuously talk with him as well.

206
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,650
Let me ask you one last question.

207
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,850
Why did you marry me?

208
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,250
Because I was threatening you with killing myself?

209
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,630
Or because you felt bad for me?

210
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,830
Not just because I felt bad for you.

211
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,350
I had lost my love and beliefs

212
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:46,280
and lived my life as if I pushed myself into hell and shouldn't be happy,

213
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,030
but you gave me comfort.

214
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,080
I could have some laughter.

215
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,680
I thought I could love you if I tried.

216
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,140
I felt the same as well.

217
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,620
I thought if I tried a little bit,

218
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,270
then you would soon be all mine like any other guy.

219
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,960
But after all, it's because you were different from those other guys,

220
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,550
that I said we should get married.

221
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,730
I want you to be happy.

222
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,310
Don't worry. Of course, I will be.

223
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,490
Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

224
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,910
You can go home.

225
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,390
I'm sorry I inconvenienced you to come all the way here today.

226
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,790
I'm sorry?

227
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,480
The suspect, Kwon Pil Ho, withdrew his statement.

228
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,610
What are you talking about?

229
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,480
He had stated that the reason he committed the crime was because of your advice

230
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,650
and that you were the one who told him about Han Jae Hyeon's whereabouts on the day of the crime.

231
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:01,630
But now he changed his statement, saying that it was all done by himself.

232
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,840
It is hard to find other evidence for this kind of case,

233
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,460
so the statement of the one involved in the case takes priority.

234
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,760
You know that as well, right, Lawyer?

235
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,180
Do you have anything to state differently from him about this case?

236
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:25,880
Of course, we don't close the case just with the victim's statement.

237
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,520
There was a report about you,

238
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,510
and we already figured out the circumstances of the case.

239
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,840
But even so, we are going to end this case here.

240
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,700
There's one big reason.

241
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:47,260
The victim, Han Jae Hyeon, filed a petition seeking leniency for Kwon Pil Ho.

242
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,520
In my life as a detective,

243
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,510
I never saw a victim filing such a long petition for leniency toward the assailant.

244
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,100
And I didn't even ask,

245
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,350
but he said multiple times you are not related to this case at all.

246
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
As for us, we can figure out what the truth is

247
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,010
by just looking and hearing from all of you.

248
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,640
But we decided to respect the will of the two persons involved.

249
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,540
As you know, the law also has eyes to see.

250
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,480
Let's end it here.

251
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,600
My apologies for inconveniencing you today.

252
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,450
I couldn't forgive you.

253
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,450
If he had lost his life on that day,

254
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,130
then you would've taken away two people's lives, Sunbae's and the Elder's.

255
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,900
Also, you would've left an unforgettable scar in Yeong Min's heart as well.

256
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,710
I thought, since he's alive maybe I should let it go.

257
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,640
Leaving everyone unaware, keeping it unknown to the world,

258
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,260
and just covering it up myself. I agonized over wether that would just do.

259
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,680
But I couldn't do that.

260
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,230
Because you are Yeong Min's father.

261
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,320
Because he's going to keep seeing you in the future.

262
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,540
Thinking of you not paying for your misdeed

263
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,500
and continuing to see Yeong Min without feeling any remorse or regret,

264
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,350
that made me scared.

265
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,460
I know how you came out of the police station today.

266
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,350
I also know he claimed your innocence.

267
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,460
There's only one thing I want from you.

268
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,540
The fact that you're the father of our son can't be changed,

269
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,100
so I want you to change.

270
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,300
I think you can change yourself.

271
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,680
When I said you look like you're standing at the edge of the cliff,

272
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,050
so I said I wanted to hold you to not fall,

273
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,790
when I said those words, you were a good person.

274
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,860
If you come back to the person you were at that time,

275
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,670
I'll think about forgiving you.

276
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,890
Yeong Min!

277
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,990
So today is the day you are coming.

278
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,420
Yes.

279
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,640
Is something wrong?

280
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,690
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

281
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,380
Because I'm such a bad father.

282
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:51,190
When you said you wanted to live with Dad, it was not what you really wanted, right?

283
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,050
But I also lost some confidence.

284
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,600
Why?

285
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,880
Do you know that you are becoming more like your mom?

286
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,100
I think having one person like your mom in my life is enough.

287
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,610
You mean it was a bad experience?

288
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,690
I meant it was good. So much that I couldn't let her go that easily.

289
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,520
Then why did you break up with Mom?

290
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,160
I didn't have confidence.

291
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,510
I wanted to know if she liked me or not,

292
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,170
so I did a lot of twisted and bad things to her.

293
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,520
So stay next to your mom, Yeong Min.

294
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,680
With you, she can have some laughter.

295
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,770
Would you keep meeting me, too?

296
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll be a dad that you'll never be ashamed of.

297
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,650
Yes.

298
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,830
  I'll wait here until you come out, Joon Seo.

299
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,930
  The person you are trying to reach is not available...

300
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,370
Is it not fun?

301
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,820
No.

302
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,210
Should we have gone to a different place?

303
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,270
Should we go camping instead?

304
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,300
It's fine.

305
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,590
Joon Seo.

306
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,500
You hate me, right?

307
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,280
Yes.

308
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,280
It's good that you're honest.

309
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:13,390
But I can kind of understand you.

310
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,010
I know you had a hard time.

311
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:24,100
Grandfather has been always yelling at you, and you don't go along with Mom.

312
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,210
Joon Seo.

313
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,580
I'm always going to be your dad, wherever you are,

314
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,260
and I'll always be on your side.

315
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,210
You should protect your mom.

316
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,380
And I hope you can tell me anything,

317
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,030
be it a good or a bad thing.

318
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,760
I'm going to come see you every week.

319
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,710
But listen, Joon Seo.  You shouldn't do anything bad. Okay?

320
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,580
I said I'll be on your side no matter what,

321
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,330
so if you do a bad thing, then I have to go to prison again.

322
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,890
Let's do these things more often, go fishing, go camping, play basketball...

323
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,500
Let's forget about fishing.

324
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,540
You find it that boring?

325
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,470
I love you, Joon Seo.

326
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,900
I love you, too.

327
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,790
To Yeong Woo's bar?

328
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,200
  That's right.

329
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,470
Why all of a sudden?

330
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,570
Dong Jin said he got some bonus, and called everyone to gather.

331
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,230
Okay, I'll be there.

332
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,300
That's great. I'll see you soon.

333
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,940
Hey.

334
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,280
  June, 1994

335
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,180
What should I do for a birthday?

336
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,710
My birthday is still far away?

337
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,240
Not for your birthday.

338
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,000
Ji Soo's?

339
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,080
Go to a buffet.

340
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,030
Isn't it expensive?

341
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,720
You don't even have â‚©1,500  ($1.50) ?

342
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,790
Is there a buffet that only cost â‚©1,500?

343
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,760
The school's cafeteria.

344
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,160
If you want to eat something luxurious like western style food,

345
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,580
then go to the language institute to eat the pork cutlet.

346
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,530
You crazy...

347
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,250
I don't know either! I never had any experience.

348
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm sorry, sorry. My apologies.

349
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,550
So when's her birthday?

350
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,800
The 29th.

351
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,150
- It's coming up soon, then? 
 - Yes.

352
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,120
Enjoy your food.

353
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,620
Let's eat while it's hot.

354
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,820
Why did you bring me to such an expensive place?

355
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,790
I like the school's cafeteria.

356
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,020
I have a lot of money!

357
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,750
If you don't eat, then I'm going to eat all of it.

358
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,600
How is it?

359
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,500
It's very delicious.

360
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,700
This is why everybody gets excited about their birthdays.

361
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,780
Have some more.

362
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,260
Don't cry, it's really nothing.

363
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,880
I'll give you a much better one in the future.

364
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,840
I mean...

365
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,700
I don't need a present.

366
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,270
You are the present. Why would you give me another one?

367
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,020
Take it.

368
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,760
Thank you.

369
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,610
I really didn't imagine something like this.

370
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,920
I'm not sure if I can take this.

371
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,570
If I have to give a present worth as much as you,

372
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,860
then I need to have billions of won (millions of dollars).

373
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,140
When did you have time to record this?

374
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,460
You said you like to listen to me singing.

375
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,770
Of course, I do.

376
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,920
Can I listen to this now?

377
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,900
Right now?

378
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,430
Then I'll go to the bathroom for a bit.

379
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,220
You can listen to it.

380
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:08,790
â™«  Today, all of us are gathered here like this   â™«

381
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:16,610
â™«  to wish you happiness for your future  â™«

382
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,910
â™« Today, all of us are gathered here like this  â™«

383
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:33,690
â™« to celebrate Ji Soo's birthday â™«

384
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,600
What's this?

385
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,870
Happy birthday, Ji Soo.

386
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,190
Thank you so much.

387
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,890
- Happy birthday! 
 - Happy birthday, Ji Soo.

388
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,480
Happy birthday, Yoon Ji Soo!

389
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,690
Happy birthday to you.

390
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,490
Why didn't you tell me!

391
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,330
Let's blow out the candles now.

392
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,370
I'm going to blow now.

393
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,600
Oh, the wish! I forgot to make a wish.

394
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,690
I'm going to make a wish now.

395
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,000
Ji Soo! Hey! How can you do this to her...

396
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,310
Are you okay?

397
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,320
Hey!

398
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,560
- Come fast! 
 - Okay!

399
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,430
Hurry up, hurry up!

400
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,240
One, two, three!

401
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,690
Where did the owner go?

402
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:25,520
â™« Today, all of us are gathered here like this â™«

403
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,840
â™« to celebrate Ji Soo's birthday â™«

404
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,780
Happy birthday, Ji Soo.

405
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,600
Happy birthday, pretty girl.

406
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,880
Happy birthday, Yoon Ji Soo. It's the first time I'm saying this to you since 1994.

407
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,460
Happy birthday, Yoon Ji Soo.

408
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,080
Should we sing another song for you?

409
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,380
Come here.

410
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,990
You should blow out the candles and make a wish.

411
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,570
I can't.

412
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,150
I don't have a birthday.

413
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,530
Ji Soo. Since your birthday is their death anniversary,

414
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,370
you will remember even more and won't be able to forget for even longer.

415
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,830
So maybe your mother and Ji Yeong would be even more grateful to you for this.

416
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,650
The candles are going to melt away. Blow them out now.

417
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,160
You should eat a lot of cake, too. For all the cakes you haven't had all these years.

418
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,810
Also, get your 20-years-worth of birthday presents from Jae Hyeon!

419
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,360
If you don't blow out the candles fast, then I'm going to have a hard time again because of the vice-president.

420
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,310
Why because of me?

421
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,550
Happy birthday.

422
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,820
How did you find that photo?

423
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,560
I asked Yeong Min to help me.

424
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,750
It was all film back in the day.

425
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,150
So I asked Yeong Min to look for the film.

426
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,220
What if my dad had thrown that out?

427
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,600
Then I was going to photoshop it.

428
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,470
Ji Soo.

429
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,290
You can't just cut off the finger because it's painful.

430
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,450
Actually, you should take care of it more often and with more consideration.

431
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,990
If I see this every day,

432
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,920
will I meet my mom and Ji Yeong someday?

433
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,240
Of course, you will.

434
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,560
You are going to sleep in every day, our Ji Soo.

435
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,270
 I'm going to the department store to fix my watch with mom, should we buy a strawberry cake there?

436
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,480
 Do what you want to do.

437
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,440
 - Come home early! Your dad's going to be angry if you come home late. 
 - Yes!

438
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,630
 Look at her, leaving without looking back at us.

439
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,610
 We are going to forget your face, Unni!

440
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,200
 Mom.

441
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,220
 Ji Yeong!

442
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,060
 Mom!

443
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,000
 Mom! Ji Yeong! Yoon Ji Yeong!

444
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,920
 Mom, please look at me just this once!

445
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,600
 Ji Yeong! Look at me just one time!

446
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,870
 Please...

447
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:33,800
â™«   Weâ€™ll see each other again   â™«

448
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,640
â™«   Give me a hug, then   â™«

449
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,240
â™«   Though I couldn't bring myself to do it today   â™«

450
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,480
â™«   Do that instead of saying your sorry   â™«

451
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:08,060
â™«   Instead of saying the words I love you   â™«

452
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,110
  In love for million years. May 12, 1995

453
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,980
  For a million years... Love blooms for the most beautiful time of our lives.

454
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,220
When did you write this?

455
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,870
When we were here before.

456
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,610
- I want to write something, too. Can you give me a pen? 
 - Do you want to?

457
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,620
It doesn't have a subject.

458
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
Is that so?

459
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,140
There are still tons of stars.

460
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,400
They were all staying at the same spot without going anywhere.

461
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,470
Admirably.

462
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:36,260
It's sparkling and unbelievably cute.

463
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,590
Like our Ji Soo.

464
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,150
It was hard to keep your spot, right?

465
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,480
It would not have been easy.

466
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,590
A little bit. It did make my legs go numb.

467
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,980
Do you remember what I said here before?

468
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,500
Of course, I remember. Even in order.

469
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,690
What did I say?

470
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,860
"Because I'm sorry."

471
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,470
"Because I love you."

472
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,430
Besides that.

473
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,770
But that was the highlight?

474
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:35,760
â™«  Perhaps, someday we will remember  â™«

475
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:48,850
â™«  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  â™«

476
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,760
The painful finger.

477
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,580
Is not painful anymore.

478
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,770
Now it's just my finger.

479
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:11,050
â™«  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  â™«

480
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:18,410
â™«  If we can return to that time, then I would tell you  â™«

481
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:25,590
â™«  If we can reach that day, that time  â™«

482
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:32,180
â™«  I would embrace you once and tell you  â™«

483
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:39,390
â™«  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  â™«

484
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:48,340
â™«  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  â™«

485
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,950
  May, 1991   
  Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy!

486
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,130
Bring back! Bring back!

487
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,050
- Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy! 
 - Bring back! Bring back!

488
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,880
- Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy! 
 - Bring back! Bring back!

489
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,920
Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy!

490
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,740
Is this really going to work?

491
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,750
- Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy! 
 - Bring back! Bring back!

492
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,740
- Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy! 
 - Bring back! Bring back!

493
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,940
They went that way!

494
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,940
Are you okay?

495
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,840
I'm sorry. I just wanted to help you.

496
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,430
It's because of the tear gas...

497
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,610
They went that way. So you should go this way.

498
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,560
  Yoon Ji Soo

499
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,890
And take this with you.

500
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,910
I heard if you put this under your eyes,  then you'll be okay when you get hit by the tear gas.

501
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,340
Ah, that is...

502
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,220
Now you laughed.

503
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:33,180
  That baby-like college guy who was good-looking even just with his eyes showing, that was you?

504
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,160
I went back to that street a few times after then, but I couldn't find you, Yoon Ji Soo.

505
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,170
But why didn't you tell me about that?

506
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,080
Because I was embarrassed?

507
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,800
As soon as I got into university, every day was a rally, and every day was terrifying.

508
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,830
That was the first day of street demonstration, so it was extra terrifying to me.

509
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,220
Then were you crying because you were terrified?

510
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,990
No, it was because of the tear gas stinging my eyes.

511
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,410
Then you liked me first?

512
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,130
- That's not true. 
 - As if.

513
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,980
I was just being curious about this eccentric and funny girl.

514
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,610
It wasn't like I liked you.

515
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,420
What are you talking about? I was really pretty!

516
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,770
Yes, you were pretty.

517
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,960
What about me?

518
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,930
When you were the freshman or when I was the freshman?

519
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,740
Well, both of them.

520
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:34,530
When you were the freshman, that college guy whose eyes were the only thing I saw,

521
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,150
I felt bad for him but he was very cute.

522
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,640
And when I was the freshman, you were

523
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,910
trying to pretend to be a strong person and that was cute, too.

524
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,950
I forgot your ID was 'Noir' before.

525
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:10,250
  For a million years... Everyone's love blooms for the most beautiful time of our lives.

526
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,510
  Twinkle Twinkle Piano House

527
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,690
  Certificate of Achievement

528
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,810
I'll be back. Thank you for the trouble, Teacher Kim.

529
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,300
You're welcome. See you soon, Director.

530
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,820
  Us Together Foundation

531
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,340
Next Monday, we have to check the after school garden of Gyerim Elementary School in Soomin-dong.

532
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,790
And from Tuesday to Thursday we have the middle school English speech classes in Duwul-li, North Chungcheong.

533
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,770
Also, on Friday we come back to Seoul and... one second, please.

534
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,790
There's the fifth class for The Exciting Country of Coding in Dongseon-dong Community Service Center.

535
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,920
I was about to talk about that class.

536
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,940
To make the kids learn the coding with more fun, I think we need something to move according to their coding,

537
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,560
like a wooden robot or something like that.

538
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,080
I agree with you. If there's something like what you just said, Mr. 'Love letter,'

539
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,250
then it can show what coding does in real life,

540
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,890
and it makes it easier to explain it to kids.

541
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,950
I like the reaction from you, 'Candy.'

542
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,280
So speaking of that.

543
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,360
It doesn't feel good...

544
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,590
Why don't you become the wooden robot, 'Running Man'?

545
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,440
Vice-president! I mean, 'Love letter.'

546
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,710
There are 'Candy,' 'Anne of Green Gables,' and 'John Snow' here.

547
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,670
Why do I have to be the robot?

548
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,660
I got old, so my body doesn't work like it used to.

549
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,480
What do you mean by old?

550
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,170
Thank you in advance.

551
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,710
Yes, I will.

552
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:52,060
Really, my body reacts first to this 'Thank you' code from you, 'Love letter.'

553
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:00,270
Many people misunderstand when they hear 'music psychotherapy.'

554
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,610
For example, they might think it is a sort of treatment for patients with autism,

555
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:08,310
to whom you would play a certain piece by Mozart that would make them get better.

556
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,970
But now you understood it's not something like that, right?

557
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,730
- I think you are really amazing. 
 - What about it?

558
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:19,010
That you finished the Bachelor's degree in such a short time and came into the Master's program like this.

559
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,560
I really wanted to come to this place, so I did my best.

560
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,320
And there's another amazing thing about you.

561
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,820
- What else? 
 - That you are really popular!

562
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,690
Everybody's going crazy that you are one of the three beauties in this school!

563
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,480
Nobody can imagine your actual age.

564
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,410
Who are the other two? Let me see their faces.

565
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,050
Should I call them to come out quietly to the back of the general-hall?

566
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,460
Will you?

567
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,590
We put it together perfectly so there won't be anything that side could refute at all. 
  Court of Law

568
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,840
Also, we made the division of property very clearly as well,

569
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,040
so they would lose their money and lose their minds.

570
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,580
Can you be quiet?

571
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,690
Yes, I'm sorry.

572
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,280
- Have a safe trip back home! 
 - Safe trip!

573
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,160
Don't give up on the child support money.

574
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,970
Whether they have money or not, wether that money is clean or dirty doesn't matter. It's your right as the custody holder.

575
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,620
Thank you so much.

576
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,620
I don't know what to say. You even did the divorce suit for free.

577
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:14,010
I have committed too many misdeeds to get that thank you from you.

578
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,540
That's Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

579
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,510
I heard he gave up on his successful law firm and started to do divorce lawsuits for free.

580
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:30,390
What is this feeling?  Why do I feel like I lost to him or something like that?

581
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,270
How are you? I'm good.

582
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,700
I'm walking with Mond and Kaw in the Han River area.

583
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,910
Is that so? They were very cute. Show them to me next time.

584
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,790
You don't have to worry about my babies, I'll raise them as I see fit.

585
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,530
You have so much work to do. That's rightâ€”

586
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,490
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

587
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,920
- What should we do? 
 - I'm okay.

588
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,900
That doesn't look okay. I'll compensate you for it.

589
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,730
If I hold them like this, it's not visible. So don't worry about it.

590
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,460
Let's go.

591
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,740
I can hold one of them. They look heavy for you.

592
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,140
I'm fine.

593
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,960
You only have the stain on one side...

594
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,130
I said, I'm fine.

595
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,390
I don't think you're fine. The puppy looks uncomfortable, too.

596
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,580
You're making me uncomfortable.

597
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,230
Then!

598
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,290
Where do you live?

599
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,650
I'm sorry?

600
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:33,070
I'll drive you to your place.

601
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,590
Why?

602
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,560
Because you can't use your hands anymore.

603
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,330
I also have a car.

604
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:42,320
Then! Can I have your number?

605
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,390
Unni is finally leaving to put on tons of oil on my body.

606
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,220
That sounds nice. I want to go with you.

607
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,500
You are too busy. With the school, the after-school classes, and all those requests for private lessons.

608
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,650
Send me many photos, then! So I can feel the vacation as well.

609
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,660
We'll see! I don't know if I'll have time to take photos!

610
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,450
Me and Joon Seo came into Korea because it's summer vacation.

611
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,260
I have no intention to meet anybody, though?

612
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:29,170
I'm busy and I also have a boyfriend.

613
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,660
Who is very handsome and only has eyes for me.

614
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:42,650
 Thank you to our channel manager: klaudiotta.

615
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,010
What's this?

616
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:54,640

617
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Thank you to our segmenters: kitty100 (chief), pilar_velasquez,&nbsp;kazumi_oka,&nbsp;and hana_860.

618
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:08,600
 Thank you to our segmenters cont: c_scott,&nbsp;dasfl49,&nbsp;chemellelott,&nbsp;humilim, and nmelova.

619
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,980
I found you, Yoon Ji Soo.

620
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,460
Do you feel a bit more comfortable now?

621
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,010
Because we met each other again.

622
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:44,640
We've endured it well, right?

623
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,300
I told you so.

624
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,220
We can endure it, by holding onto the times that were beautiful like flowers.

625
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,960
And I knew we would meet each other again.

626
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,420
Thank you.

627
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,370
You recognized me, even though I changed over time.

628
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,220
I would've recognized you no matter how you had changed.

629
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,160
Because I was always looking only at you the whole time.

630
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,530
I wanted to hug you like this.

631
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,230
You did great, Ji Soo.

632
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,930
You did more than amazing.

633
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,330
I won't forget those times. Because that was the most beautiful time in my life, when my love bloomed.

634
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,460
And you two were the flowers.

635
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,400
It's still the most beautiful time in our lives now.

636
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,790
Because we are together.

637
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,940
By the way, Ji Soo.

638
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,560
I thought we would get a sad ending,  but doesn't it seem to be a happy ending?

639
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,660
It's a totally happy ending.

640
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:47,940
I'm so happy that I can't stop smiling.

641
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,800
 In this world with seven billion people, there are seven billion most beautiful times of one's life.

642
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:10,940
 This means that everybody has their own most beautiful times of their lives.

643
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,350
 When my love blooms.

644
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:21,530
 There's no reason to be sad if the time for your life to become a flower hasn't come yet,

645
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,760
 or to feel regretful because it has already passed.

646
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,990
 Yesterday is connected to today.

647
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:35,030
 I am connected to you, and you are connected to us.

648
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:42,200
 Life is always flowing and flowers are always ready to bloom.

649
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:50,520

650
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:57,670

651
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,470
â™« Poignantly â™«

â™«   The ticklish whispers of summer emotions   â™«

663
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:18,050
â™«   The longing welled up in my brow   â™«

664
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,760
Sunbae. Weren't we kind of lovely back then?

665
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,660
No. We were really, very lovely.

666
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,530
 Thank you for watching When My Love Blooms.

667
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,980
  For a million years, may every one of you have the most beautiful times in your lives.
