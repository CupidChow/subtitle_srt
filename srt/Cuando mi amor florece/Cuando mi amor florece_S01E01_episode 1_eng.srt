00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,010
  When My Love Blooms

2
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,580

3
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,390
Do you know when that was?

4
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,230
I know how long it lasted.

5
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:30,620
  When My Love Blooms

6
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,210
  Episode 1  
 I don't think believing in superstitions is a bad thing. 
 (If you eat tofu after being released from jail, you won't go back.)

7
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,670
It isn't a bad thing, but it isn't tasty.

8
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,740
I'm really sick of beans and tofu. 
  (Prisons give rice with beans.)

9
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,820
I'm sorry.

10
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,610
Why are you alone? What happened to the people who cried their eyes out when I went in?

11
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,980
A staff meeting was suddenly scheduled today, so they all went there.

12
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,410
They won't be too happy that I've come back after four years.

13
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,120
It's not like it's the Olympics or something.

14
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,220
You should really be careful. The mood isn't so great these days.

15
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,720
The employees who used to follow you are getting fired one after the other, and it casts a chill every time.

16
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,510
Casts a chill?

17
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,670
It means the atmosphere gets suddenly chilly and uncomfortable.

18
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,450
It'll continue to be chilly from now on.

19
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,210
Why, is there something going on again?

20
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,700
A typhoon is moving north, you see.

21
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,050
The weather isn't even good today. Why did you come all the way here?

22
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,720
Because I hate the supermarket.

23
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,850
Why would you? The prices are much cheaper.

24
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,750
I hate it because the prices are cheap. I got fired because of that.

25
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,850
Why would you be working at the supermarket, when you even graduated from university?

26
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,110
Because of a red string.

27
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,820
A red string? Where?

28
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,720
On my family register. A pretty string.

29
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,370
Grandma, it looks like a nobleman will come by today.

30
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,730
What? A ghost? 
   (The words ghost and nobleman sound similar.)

31
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,430
Not a ghost, a nobleman.

32
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,850
You know, they say that a morning spider brings good fortune, while an evening spider brings in thieves.

33
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,820
Oh really, how did it come in here again!

34
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,540
They keep making a mess, setting their home over there!

35
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,650
  Hyeong Seong Group employment briefing. Hyeong Seong supermarket recruits new graduates.

36
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,530
Ji Soo!

37
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,590
Yoon Ji Soo! Yoon Ji Soo!

38
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,170
  April 1993, Sinchon

39
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,160
Yoon Ji Soo! Really, girl!

40
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Do you know how many times I called your name?

41
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,710
Sorry, I was looking over there and didn't pay attention.

42
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,690
♫ The love of our comrades ♫

43
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,630
They're doing another protest?

44
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,770
I'm  tired of it, really.

45
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,490
♫ Our comrades live on in our hearts ♫

46
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,500
Don't you think they must have their reasons?

47
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,280
Bullshit.

48
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,270
Why are students throwing protests day-in and day-out instead of studying like they should

49
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,950
in this hell of a world?

50
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,070
They do seem like people from a different world.

51
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,120
Their gaze is scary and they look really angry.

52
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,110
Just think of them as aliens. Aliens on the brink of extinction.

53
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,250
Anyway, this isn't important. I got into that professor's class!

54
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,140
For real? That's really—

55
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,180
Erotic, of course! Even the assignment is to write an erotic novel.

56
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,990
Kids like you would never be able to attend that class.

57
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm late! I'm leaving!

58
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,970
Bye!

59
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,190
..

60
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,960
Crush them!

61
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Crush them! Crush them!

62
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,440
Crush them! Crush them! Crush them! Crush them!

63
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,270
Crush them all!

64
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,750
Do as I do. Take a deep breath.

65
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,790
You don't know what a deep breath is?

66
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:10,290
Breathe in deeply, out, in, out.

67
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,150
Did they shoot tear gas?

68
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,400
No, Molotov Cocktails.

69
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,370
Why would they throw that, dammit.

70
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,780
Don't touch it.

71
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,210
Don't rub, just press on it.

72
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,700
Can you go on alone?

73
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,030
I didn't even get a chance to ask his name.

74
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,770
 March 5, 1993

75
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,250
 Student Union

76
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,040
Do you have a demonstration today? Like the one you guys did yesterday morning?

77
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,310
What did we do yesterday?
  (T/N: They are afraid that she might be a police informant.)

78
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,130
Then what is the schedule for the next demo?

79
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,940
♫ Without love, honor, and names ♫

80
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:58,880
♫ Let's go together to the very end ♫

81
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,390
- So is that fun?
 - Yes, it's really fun.

82
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,350
Wow, I was totally surprised.

83
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,610
Hey, they're doing what you like.

84
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,490
Go on ahead.

85
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,280
And now, the keynote speech from Law Student Han Jae Hyeon.

86
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,200
Hello, my fellow students. I am Law Student Han Jae Hyeon, of the freshman class of '91.

87
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,670
I embrace my hot desire for the liberation of labor and liberal democracy

88
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,650
to greet you enthusiastically.

89
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,870
 The 13th Anniversary of the May 18, Gwangju Democracy Movement, Remembrance and Declaration of Battle

90
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,470
Today, we take to the streets again for a better tomorrow.

91
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,130
You may wonder why we are doing this again when the world has changed so much.

92
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,840
But everyone! There are still many places in this world that need our voices.

93
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,350
In 1980, those who shouted for democracy in this nation in Gwangju

94
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,850
were killed by the blades of the military.

95
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,870
Not even an inquiry was held regarding upon whose orders it happened.

96
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,200
They were only called a "commie mob" in the official records.

97
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,900
And in the name of redevelopment,

98
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,290
families were kicked out of their homes they had lived in for 30 years.

99
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,080
And to allegedly preserve the companies for tomorrow,

100
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,070
there are heads of families who are being laid off without explanation.

101
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,600
In this capitalist society where everything is strongly pulled to the right,

102
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,800
we are not demanding a minimum level of respect and courtesy.

103
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,220
We are talking about desperate survival.

104
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,250
I found you, Hae Jae Hyeon.

105
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
Please come.

106
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,370
Thank you.

107
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,110
Thank you.

108
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,300
 Law Department

109
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,000
 Law Studies Conference Room

110
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,040
Are you looking for someone?

111
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,940
What? Oh, a law student, freshman class of '91.

112
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,560
Who from the freshman class of '91? We have more than just one or two of them.

113
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,180
- Han...
 - Jae Hyeon?

114
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,110
Jae Hyeon, someone is here to see you.

115
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,860
Her face is so pretty, she is a total beauty.

116
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,390
These days, four years is enough to completely remodel the whole country.

117
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,400
Honestly, your sentence was too severe.

118
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
Why do you think that?

119
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,810
Because it was the chairman who was responsible for the stock manipulation and embezzlement.

120
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,530
Sorry, are you alright?

121
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,790
So, is this considered a chill?

122
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,290
I apologize.

123
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,140
Ajumma! How could you just pop out into the street like that?

124
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,450
I'm sorry, my bag ripped.

125
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,920
Please get out of the way already.

126
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm trying to get out of your way quickly.

127
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,090
What, what, what now?

128
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,100
This water is precious, like my blood.

129
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,350
Ajumma!

130
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,490
Sorry, because of that strange ajumma.

131
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,450
What is that?

132
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,510
She made sure to pick up her water bottle, but she left that behind.

133
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,420
It's a man's handkerchief.

134
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,410
No, she doesn't seem like someone who cares about such differences.

135
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,810
You know, those kinds of people. She doesn't care if she wears her husband's socks or underwear.

136
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,860
- Joon Woo.
 - Yes?

137
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,170
Let's go to the company.

138
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,290
Yes, sir.

139
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,220
What? You don't want to go to your home?

140
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,110
I think I will have to visit the chairman first.

141
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,980
Dismissal from work is murder! Withdraw the dismissals!

142
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,330
Withdraw! Withdraw!

143
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,490
A mayfly is called a "one-day-lifer" because it only lives for one day. We are "two-year-lifers"

144
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,410
because we can only live for two years.

145
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,420
If we work for more than two years, they must select us as permanent employees.

146
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,620
That is why the company dismisses us after two years.

147
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,430
Even if we beg, cry, and fight, the company dismisses us.

148
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,860
We are "two-year-lifers" who live a scary two years.

149
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,780
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

150
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,970
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

151
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,590
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

152
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,290
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

153
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,820
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

154
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,350
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

155
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,260
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

156
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,810
The welcome greeting for you was quite something.

157
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,990
Even if I was hit with sh*t instead of eggs, I would have still laughed maniacally.

158
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,350
It is my first day out, after all.

159
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,550
Prison life is not easy, of course.

160
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,110
- You've worked hard.
 - It was nothing.

161
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,930
Do you want to return to work right away?

162
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,060
I am apprehensive because I have been away for so long.

163
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,000
Then go work in the supermarket department.

164
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,100
I put Seo Kyeong in charge as CEO, but I keep having worries.

165
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,760
 Four years will pass by quickly.

166
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,040
 Just close your eyes and endure for four years.

167
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,020
 Then I will make you vice chairman of Hyeong Seong.

168
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,710
Those ajummas demonstrating down there,

169
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,150
I would like it if you cleaned them out completely.

170
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,740
You are the best when it comes to cleaning people out, aren't you?

171
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,800
They didn't call you "Scissorhands" for nothing.

172
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,320
Yes, I understand.

173
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,900
Jae Hyeon, just because the hunting dog brings the rabbit

174
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,740
doesn't mean the hunting dog keeps the rabbit.

175
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,370
The hunting dog should just eat what the hunting dog usually eats.

176
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,770
If he begins to covet the rabbit,

177
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,340
its owner will become angry, won't he?

178
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,820
Yes.

179
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,380
And you don't have to begin work immediately.

180
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,660
You should play some, too.

181
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,560
Do you not know how to play because you were always working?

182
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,370
I don't know, but I'd like to try once.

183
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,300
I am a quick study, whatever it is.

184
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,090
♫ Let's live like a rock♫

185
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:28,300
♫ Even when windy rainstorms fall ♫

186
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,530
♫ We will withstand all temptation ♫

187
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,540
♫ And stand strong like a rock ♫

188
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Hey, Yeong Min.

189
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,990
Should I buy some food before I visit?

190
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,980
Hold on, Yeong Min, I'll call you back.

191
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,290
Thank you.

192
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,100
It's okay, sir. I'll fix this and give it back to you.

193
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,050
You don't have to. I should do it since my son was a victim.

194
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,940
I have a son as well.

195
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,090
That's why I want to do it for you.

196
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,710
They're really evil people.

197
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,120
What do the youth do these days?

198
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,840
They play games and go out for drinks.

199
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,290
Some guys go to shoot pool, too.

200
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,180
The mountains and rivers are said to change every 10 years.

201
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,830
You're right. How do you feel about the movies?

202
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,280
There are some great ones out.

203
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,290
No, I don't like movies.

204
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,450
 Murderous Company

205
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,230
 You should call the security guard.

206
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,180
I may be an ajumma who doesn't possess an ounce of femininity,

207
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,280
but I don't think I should brag about a woman living alone.

208
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,790
How could a scaredy-cat like you live alone?

209
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,510
I'm fine. There's nothing to do at night, anyway.

210
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,190
I'm going to bed early after watching TV.

211
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,700
After lighting the candles, I can see perfectly.

212
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,950
 I see, noblewoman from the Joseon Dynasty. You should get some fireflies for your lantern.

213
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,610
I like the atmosphere, and it feels like a movie theater.

214
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,990
 You would always go to movie theaters while others went to nightclubs,

215
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,530
 but you don't even go near one anymore.

216
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,450
That's the worst place to waste your money.

217
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,710
They'll eventually air on the TV for free, anyway.

218
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,890
Stop talking like you're broke.

219
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,460
Just wait a few days and I'll fix it for you.

220
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,470
Really?

221
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,170
 Marx

222
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,720
 From Ji Soo to Sunbae Jae Hyeon, again. 
- January 1994

223
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,370
 Myeonghwa Special 
 Love Letter

224
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,910
They're playing "Love Letter"?

225
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,470
 May 1993

226
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,820
 Do you rent out "Love Letter"?

227
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,440
 Tomorrow, come to Hendrix, on the third floor of Nakwon Mall.

228
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,590
 How can I find you, Mr. Wall Kiss?

229
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,230
 I'll be wearing a white hoodie.

230
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,900
- Excuse me, are you... 
 - Excuse me...

231
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,590
Oh, you're here for "Love Letter" too?

232
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,690
How can you just leave when you said you reserved it first?

233
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,230
It's okay, you can watch it.

234
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,000
But you reserved it because you wanted to see it, too.

235
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,050
I can't watch it alone. I feel too sorry.

236
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,110
So?

237
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,370
Let's watch it together.

238
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,630
Mr. Wall Kiss said it will be ruined if you try to copy it a second time.

239
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,170
We can't watch it too many times, either.

240
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm good.

241
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
I won't spread rumors.

242
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,660
Nobody would believe me, anyway.

243
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,990
Who would believe that an activist senior wanted to watch a melodramatic Japanese movie, anyway?

244
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,200
Don't you know Korean? I said I'm good.

245
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,370
♫  Thinking of you again today  ♫

246
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,280
♫  About that night I was with you  ♫

247
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,500
Let's watch "Love Letter" together.

248
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,990
♫  My footsteps toward you  ♫

249
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,460
♫  Feel like they’re walking on a cloud in the sky  ♫

250
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,820
♫  Oh baby  ♫

251
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,820
♫  I like everything about you  ♫

252
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,830
♫  I wanna stay with you tonight  ♫

253
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,040
♫  Tonight, it’s you and me, will you stay?  ♫

254
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,280
♫  You know you're my everything  ♫

255
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,430
♫  I’m falling for you  ♫

256
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,260
♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

257
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,460
♫  Falling Falling for you  ♫

258
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,750
 Love Letter

259
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,670
What are you doing?

260
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,830
It's a habit to exercise my fingers.

261
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,180
It's bothering me.

262
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,070
Sorry.

263
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,630
It's dirty.

264
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,740
My nose keeps running in front of you.

265
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,750
If you saw me like this twice, you've seen me at my lowest,

266
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,430
- so you— 
 - I got it, so get up.

267
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,130
Okay.

268
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,400
The music from the movie was so nice, right?

269
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,880
I could play it, too.

270
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,360
There's a piece I've been obsessed with lately.

271
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,860
Would you like to hear it?

272
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,730
No.

273
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,730
That's too bad. I'm free every Wednesday during fourth period.

274
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,400
I practice alone in room 301 in the music building.

275
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,660
Good for you. I enjoyed the movie.

276
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,650
When will we meet again?

277
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,750
- When will we what? 
 - Meet again.

278
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,820
Why would we meet again?

279
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,100
Because we'll miss each other.

280
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,190
Go.

281
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,830
We should meet up.

282
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm busy.

283
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,910
So why do you have to study and do demonstrations?

284
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,820
Others pick only one.

285
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,890
Is that something to get in trouble for?

286
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,660
- I want to do it, too. 
 - Studying or protesting?

287
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,780
Protesting. I like exercising, too. 
 (T/N: protesting and exercising are the same word in Korean.)

288
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,740
I was a horseback rider when I was young.

289
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,400
My "exercise" is protesting against rich families like yours.

290
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,020
I wonder how they'd react if they heard their pampered daughter

291
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,130
who took horseback riding lessons hung around a protester.

292
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,680
I wasn't pampered.

293
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,270
- Which bus are you taking? 
 - Number 12.

294
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,320
It's here.

295
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,940
 12 - Gaepo-dong to Front of Yonsei University

296
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,460
I won't give up! So you should give up!

297
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,530
I will date you, even if it's the last thing I do!

298
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,780
Love Letter again?

299
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,760
How can you watch a movie as soon as you get back?

300
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,360
I didn't mean you had to turn it off.

301
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,140
Anyway, welcome back. You worked hard.

302
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,430
You had a hard time alone, too.

303
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,540
Sorry I couldn't go earlier today.

304
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,530
It's okay. It's not like I won a gold medal.

305
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,060
You're probably busy since you became CEO.

306
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,830
- On that note, I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow. 
 - Hawaii?

307
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,430
I'm not going on vacation. I'm going for work.

308
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,330
To Hawaii?

309
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,850
Market research to see if we can launch our market there.

310
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,550
Okay, have a good time.

311
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm really not going on vacation.

312
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,180
Okay, I got it.

313
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,340
Also, I have a favor.

314
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,450
Pay some more attention to Joon Seo.

315
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,340
The poor kid's been without his dad for four years.

316
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,660
They say no matter how well a mom does, boys need their dads.

317
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,450
I'll try. But... I'm going to get busier, too.

318
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,650
I thought you told them you're not returning to work right away.

319
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm going to take a vacation.

320
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,270
A good one.

321
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,800
They put you in jail for four years and now they screw you big time.

322
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,210
First, they say vice chairman of headquarters but you ended up as market vice president.

323
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,830
We should be grateful. They're acting just as we expected.

324
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,220
In the end, Hyeong Seong Mart is the end of the succession project.

325
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,380
It's at the top of Hyeong Seong's governance structure.

326
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,320
And the thing I asked you to do?

327
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,020
I delivered the documents to the press's inspection agency.

328
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,860
I did what you told me, but what are we fighting with?

329
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,810
We don't have any shares or live ammunition.

330
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,010
Pandora's box or the Trojan horse?

331
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,630
Can you explain it more easily, please?

332
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,460
Whether Pandora's box is opened or enemy soldiers pour out from the Trojan horse,

333
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,090
our opponents won't just stand by and watch.

334
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:31,510
Would you understand if I say our weapon and live ammunition is stirring up the enemy and making them take action?

335
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,440
I understand.

336
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:40,620
By the way, I have a picture of the Madam...

337
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,450
- A picture? 
 - Yes.

338
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,040
Director.

339
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,680
I'm sorry. What were you saying...

340
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,750
Are you okay?

341
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,580
One minute.

342
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,840
Son, what did you have for dinner?

343
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,220
 Rice.

344
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,050
What did you eat it with? Froggies?

345
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,930
 Mom. I have to do homework.

346
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,190
Alright. You have no aegyo (cuteness), son.

347
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,320
Hang up, then.

348
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,760
My hand slipped.

349
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,860
Sorry, First Place Beggar.

350
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,960
Looks like you'll need to get more.

351
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,990
Now that we're all moms from Gook Jae Middle School, let's support our kids well

352
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,780
and work together to fix any issues at school.

353
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,720
Yes, yes, don't worry.

354
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,780
What problems would there be at school?

355
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,440
All our kids are from wealthy homes.

356
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,840
School violence only happens with kids who are from poor homes.

357
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,820
- True, true. 
 - It's true.

358
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,120
I heard Yeong Min scored first place in the final exams again.

359
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,130
He's never let go of first place since he enrolled.

360
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,010
Yeong Min's mom, you're a piano major, right?

361
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,070
- What does his dad do? 
 - Actually...

362
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,250
He's a lawyer in Gangnam.

363
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,670
No wonder. I don't know about other things, but the smart kids inherit good genes.

364
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,180
- You're right. 
 - Yeah.

365
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,220
The wealthier ones are more frugal. Just cookies for first place celebration?

366
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,970
You have it rough, too. Having to be a parents' representative because your kid got top marks.

367
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,930
She doesn't seem as chatty as us.

368
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,520
Who are you calling chatty?

369
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
We're not chatty.

370
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,440
 Sunbae Hwa Jin is dead.

371
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,140
♫  Where have my comrades gone?  ♫

372
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,240
♫  Only flags stream  ♫

373
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,330
♫  Until a new day comes  ♫

374
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,680
♫  Let's not lose our resolve  ♫

375
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,680
♫  Even when the times go by  ♫

376
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,740
♫ The mountains and streams all know ♫

377
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:40,130
♫ When we wake up we passionately shout ♫

378
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,000
It's been a while, hyungs.

379
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,390
You look good, Hyung.

380
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,960
Is it because you're the son-in-law of a wealthy family?

381
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,760
You look like a million bucks, even though you've been in jail.

382
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,900
Only the dead person is pitiable.

383
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,370
Everyone else is eating and living well.

384
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,690
Hey, Kyeong Ho. I understand how you're feeling, but—

385
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,850
If you weren't even going to finish it,

386
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,990
why did you drag her in?

387
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,230
If it weren't for you, she would have gone to school with a full scholarship

388
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,230
and become a lawyer, judge, or prosecutor.

389
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,340
That foolish girl suffered alone doing labor movements.

390
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,110
Couldn't you have asked why she was doing that?

391
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:25,030
If you considered the feelings of someone showing up in front of their past crush after 20 years

392
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:30,450
asking to borrow money for even one minute, you wouldn't have treated her that way.

393
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,970
So you're saying that Hwa Jin's death

394
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,290
- is my fault? 
 - Yeah, you jerk.

395
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,940
 I saw your interview in a magazine.

396
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,960
 - 5 years ago - 
 I was so proud of you.

397
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,900
 Did you come to see me because you were proud?

398
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,100
 Oh. that's not it...

399
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,770
 Then?

400
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,760
 Can you lend me some money, Jae Hyeon?

401
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,190
 Kyeong Ho and I both have bad credit, so we can't get loans.

402
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,420
 We can't get any more private loans either.

403
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,400
 Would it be alright for you to receive my money?

404
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:25,860
 Didn't your organization report me and my company to the Ministry of Labor?

405
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,880
 All of "my" money is actually that company's money.

406
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,700
 You're right. I came to the wrong person.

407
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,510
 I'm sorry, I'm in a bad place these days.

408
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,390
 How much do you need?

409
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,910
 It's fine. I don't need it.

410
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,250
 No, you're right.

411
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,760
 I shouldn't take that dirty money.

412
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,160
 LP Music Cafe
 Beer / Wine

413
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,890
Ji Soo.

414
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,320
It was cancer, I heard.

415
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,400
Because she had no money, she wasn't able to get surgery on time.

416
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,890
Didn't you say

417
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,400
she had a child?

418
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,310
Yes, an eight-year-old son.

419
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,860
She must have

420
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,400
been in a lot of pain.

421
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,310
She must have hurt so much, that she couldn't even speak.

422
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,890
For the first time, I regret

423
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,460
that I turned my back on everyone and left.

424
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,370
If I hadn't,

425
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,650
I could have seen her more.

426
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,480
You didn't have a choice back then.

427
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,680
One, two, three.

428
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,960
You're allowed three seconds when you take one photo.

429
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,080
A farewell like this is quite cruel.

430
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,890
No forewarning, no redo.

431
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:24,370
Only helplessness.

432
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,080
Do you think the others felt

433
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,720
the same way when I left?

434
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,410
How is that the same as this?

435
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,390
Stop blaming yourself. It changes nothing.

436
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,590
And I'm sure Hwa Jin went to a better place.

437
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,120
She did so many good deeds, after all.

438
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,780
At this age, there are never any happy occasions for family gatherings.

439
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,440
Only investigations, dammit.

440
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,400
You should get regular medical exams.

441
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,740
Isn't that the only "report card" we get for the rest of our remaining lives?

442
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,740
You can tell with one look the kind of life you've led.

443
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,670
And it estimates the progress you are likely to make.

444
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,570
I am not afraid of such a report card at all.

445
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,490
Then what are you afraid of?

446
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,560
That we miraculously have a reunion,

447
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,750
but it is with a death portrait.

448
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,160
Do you mean Yoon Ji Soo?

449
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,250
Hey, how old is Ji Soo that you are already anticipating her obituary?

450
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,510
Well, Hwa Jin wasn't at that age, either.

451
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,480
And I couldn't find her, no matter how much I looked.

452
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,080
Are you the National Intelligence Service?

453
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,280
The CIA?

454
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,850
How can you find everyone you want? I'm sure she is hiding well somewhere.

455
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,450
Do you think so?

456
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,650
And you know, Ji Soo,

457
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,670
she isn't such a shabby player.

458
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,870
She's lithe and delicate, so people think she is a fragile woman.

459
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:10,030
But in college, Yoon Ji Soo was a total warrior.

460
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,790
You know those girls who go around wearing only tights, like Black Widow?

461
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,250
Wow, very scary, wow.

462
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,290
Wow, Engineering Major Unni, you are the best.

463
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,320
We don't learn this stuff in the engineering department, you know.

464
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,830
Are you going to keep using my high-caliber talent this way?

465
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,800
I'll make you something yummy.

466
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,140
How long will you keep doing those protests that don't make you any money?

467
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,760
You are so consistent about your hatred for those demos.

468
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,700
Because I am an advocate for peace.

469
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,140
I don't think I can do it for much longer.

470
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,610
I admit that I am happy to hear that. But why?

471
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,220
My father's nurse is asking for a raise.

472
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,990
You said only she can handle your father.

473
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,990
So you are grateful to her,

474
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,070
but what if she's asking because she knows that?

475
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,490
Hye Jeong.

476
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,200
Yes?

477
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,910
I think I'm going to throw up.

478
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,080
Some days, I sit in the street with other unnis, and drink just one bottle of mineral water.

479
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,580
But I spend other days with other moms who spend the same amount as those unnis' monthly living expenses in one blow,

480
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,000
eating brunch in hotels and laughing.

481
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,750
It makes me nauseous.

482
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,650
So just pick one and drop the other.

483
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,720
That will keep you from getting sick.

484
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,170
I can't leave behind those unnis who sit in the streets.

485
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,420
But thinking of Yeong Min,

486
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,740
I can't make any unpleasant faces at those moms, either.

487
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,580
I even put on a mask to play piano.

488
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,390
The person who said you become wise once you reach the age of 40

489
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,920
should be flogged.

490
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,460
We are flopping around like wind-sock puppets, wisdom my ass.

491
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,990
I thought when I reached this age,

492
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,440
I would read travel books while sitting in a massage chair elegantly,

493
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,710
lying on a heavenly beach, munching on cucumbers,

494
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,600
getting a sun tan. But wow, reality.

495
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,950
I go to "heaven" often.

496
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,080
Part-Time Job Heaven, Kimbap Heaven.

497
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,350
 Kimbap Heaven

498
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,090
You said you won't come anymore.

499
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,500
Yes, I feel too ashamed.

500
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,380
You said your son is at an international school?

501
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,780
That must cost so much money.

502
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,390
Isn't that being too greedy, in your situation?

503
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,440
You don't know?

504
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,360
He scored 1st place in International Olympiad (academic competitions) and things like that for many years.

505
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,100
So that school took him as a scholarship student for all three years.

506
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,210
- They pay all his tuition.
 - Goodness, really?

507
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,060
Then you should go and take care of him, instead of being here.

508
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,390
But I feel too sorry. I will continue to come, at least for this week.

509
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,720
- You don't have to.
 - Go, already.

510
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,020
You're blocking her?

511
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,960
Oh, that psycho bastard, call the police.

512
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,030
No, ambulance. Ambulance!

513
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,610
I'm going to die! Hurry!

514
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,620
 Homeroom Teacher

515
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,070
 Jang Seo Kyeong

516
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,380
- Yes?
 - What do you do?

517
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,300
I told you to pay attention to Joon Seo!

518
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,550
What are you talking about?

519
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,100
They said Joon Seo got hurt!

520
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,280
What?

521
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:43,080
 Yeong Min threw a chair at a student in his class.

522
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,010
 But he's not saying why he did it.

523
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,660
Dad.

524
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,340
But why are you here?

525
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,470
What about Mom? Grandpa?

526
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,540
Is that how you greet me after four years?

527
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,990
Oh, right. Sorry.

528
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,220
Have you been well?

529
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,120
My son, only your body has grown.

530
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,840
So what happened? Where did you get hurt?

531
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,660
- You didn't get hurt anywhere else?
 - I didn't.

532
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,540
Then tell me what happened.

533
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,170
There's this guy who is a bit poor.

534
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,170
He suddenly went insane and threw a chair at me.

535
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,860
Suddenly?

536
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,990
Without any reason?

537
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,940
Yes, I didn't do anything to him.

538
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,090
You didn't fight with him?

539
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,350
Do I need to go to the hospital?

540
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,630
Joon Seo.

541
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,280
It really hurts a lot.

542
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,380
Joon Seo?

543
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,160
I know that a similar thing happened when you were in sixth grade.

544
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,050
So you didn't do anything this time, just like that last time?

545
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,340
No, that bastard is just crazy.

546
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,300
He's a lame, loser bastard.

547
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:03,410
 Hwabon Station

548
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,110
As follows, the responsibility for the breakdown of this marital relationship

549
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,730
clearly lies with defendant Lee Se Hoon.

550
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:32,240
But Plaintiff Yoon Ji Soo rejects any monetary compensation including alimony and child support

551
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,110
and only requests the custody of their child, Lee Yeong Min.

552
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:38,270
So this court's judgment is as follows:

553
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,380
Regarding Lee Yeong Min,

554
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,140
his custody is awarded to plaintiff Yoon Ji Soo.

555
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,680
And alimony and child support which is the responsibility of the defendant,

556
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,280
is exempted as requested by the plaintiff.

557
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,720
Is Father-in-law going to leave us soon?

558
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,360
What kind of bet are you placing, if you're not counting on a life insurance payout or something?

559
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,240
I have no intention of raising Yeong Min with your or your mother's money.

560
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,450
I understand your objective, but will it be possible?

561
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,860
If anything ever happens to Yeong Min, I will use it to sue you for custody.

562
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,560
And I won't give up on you, either.

563
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:22,410
As long as Yeong Min exists, you can never go far away.

564
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,550
I am too ashamed to think of something to tell you.

565
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,460
This has never happened before at this school.

566
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,940
Please ask this student to leave first. I think this talk should occur between us adults.

567
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,210
Ah, yes, we should.

568
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,520
Yes, Yeong Min, let's go out now.

569
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,330
It doesn't seem like a typical case of school violence.

570
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,690
Please come in, Yeong Min's mother.

571
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,530
I am sorry. I sincerely offer my humble apology.

572
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:07,290
If you will show me favor just this once, I will make sure such a thing never happens again.

573
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,230
I know that nothing I say can earn forgiveness, but he is still a young student.

574
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:16,430
Yeong Min's mother. This isn't something we can decide so easily.

575
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,500
The victim's father is here.

576
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,490
Goodness, how angry he must have been.

577
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,750
I'm sorry. Shall I go and speak with him?

578
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,930
Please stay here.

579
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,630
I request that you do not call a hearing regarding school violence.

580
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,590
Since you left so suddenly, I thought you were very angry.

581
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,310
I left because I didn't feel that the situation merited such a fervent apology.

582
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,540
But this is a clear case of school violence,

583
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,090
- and the school has policies about discipline—
 - I saw Joon Soo before coming here.

584
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:03,090
It's not something to worry so much about, so please take care of it as such.

585
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:06,730
Yeong Min, talk to me.

586
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,130
There had to have been a reason for this.

587
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,180
You're the type to set mayflies free, so you wouldn't attack someone without reason.

588
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,760
So tell me. Was there some kind of problem?

589
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,840
So, are they kicking me out of school?

590
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,140
No.

591
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:31,060
The victim's family is showing us favor. Nothing much will happen.

592
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:36,710
So, Yeong Min, you must tell me what really happened.

593
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,920
Mom, I have to do my homework.

594
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:54,720
If I leave now, I will arrive around midnight.

595
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,710
 Then please have a safe trip back.

596
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,810
Wait, I don't think I can go. It's snowing too heavily.

597
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:16,090
I am going to leave the car here, so come get it later. Okay.

598
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:41,040
♫  spring, our hearts bloom  ♫

599
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,850
♫  My trembling heart waiting for you  ♫

600
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:53,970
♫  Our fluttering gazes  ♫

601
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:06,700
♫  The ticklish whispers of summer emotions  ♫

602
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:13,960
♫  The longing welled up in my brow  ♫

603
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:20,670
♫  All of this is a new experience of you  ♫

604
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:33,380
♫  Our hearts are colored with autumn  ♫

605
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:39,450
♫  With your smiles that are like a cool breeze  ♫

606
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:50,290
♫  And those facial expressions I'm first seeing  ♫

607
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,650
I think that's mine.

608
01:00:53,650 --> 01:01:04,820
♫  My season with you is the most beautiful color of the sky  ♫

609
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,630
I found you.

610
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,920
Yoon Ji Soo.

611
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:23,710
♫  I love you, I love you, it’s our season now  ♫

612
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,310
It's quite snowy here.

613
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:54,110
In any case, I don't think we can get home tonight.

614
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,880
Don't worry too much about the school incident, please.

615
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:15,720
It's common for boys to fight and hit each other.

616
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,380
I found you.

617
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,480
Yoon Ji Soo.

618
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:26,320

619
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,420
 When My Love Blooms 
Preview

620
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,240
 It snowed then, of all times, and so much, so maybe that was why.

621
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,180
 I wish it snowed more, so we couldn't move at all.

622
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,220
 It appears every day when I'm breathing.

623
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,340
 I... only endured because of those moments that were beautiful like flowers. I am sorry and I am grateful, Sunbae.

624
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,750
 That was how I could live on.

625
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,940
 What do you think you are doing?

626
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,510
 I'm saying we should follow procedure. I'm not trying to punish you.

627
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:03,060
 Our methods are just different when it comes to protecting love, that's all.
