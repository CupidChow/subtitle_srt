00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,460
 When My Love Blooms

2
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:49,480
I think that to those who survived, there is a reason for their living.

3
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,590
That it's because there are things that only you can do in this world.

4
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:05,710
So you being alive may be a blessing to us.

5
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,370
So Ji Soo, you can do it all.

6
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,710
You can rest, you can cry.

7
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,010
If you're having a hard time, you don't have to grit your teeth and endure it.

8
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,380
Because I'll be by your side.

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,000

10
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,660
Why would you be by my side?

11
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,380
I should be in my place, and you should be in your place.

12
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,960
That's right.

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,890
Anyone would know that this was just an escape.

14
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,830
And even for a first love, we cannot justify an inappropriate relationship.

15
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,520
But why can't I turn away from you?

16
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,400
Why can't I leave us in my memories?

17
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,210
I kept thinking about it.

18
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,910
And I found that the answer was in our past.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,010
You said this.

20
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,070
Your belief,

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,430
your world is me.

22
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,370
There was something I couldn't say at the time.

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,140
To me, you were my dream.

24
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,500
Now that I'm again facing the dream I had lost,

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,890
I find myself unable to either throw it away

26
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,210
or run away.

27
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,460
Because that's what a dream is.

28
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,760
Because it's a dream.

29
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,780
Because you'll wake up from it soon.

30
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,520
I have to go now.

31
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,350
Sunbae.

32
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,810
Hm?

33
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:18,140
I'm sorry for ruining the mood, but I'm really cold and hungry.

34
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,720
Yoon Ji Soo, are you mad?

35
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,330
Are you? 
 ♫  Thinking of you again today  ♫

36
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,060
Wow, I thought our Ji Soo was all grown up, but she's still a baby.

37
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,990
♫  About that night I was with you  ♫

38
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,530
♫  My feelings are slowly growing  ♫

39
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,570
Are you mad? You're not mad, right?

40
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,770
Forget it.

41
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,030
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,780
♫  When did this start?  ♫

43
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,400
Hey, we'll catch a cold.

44
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,270
♫  ♫  I laugh for no reason  ♫

45
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,580
♫   Oh baby  ♫

46
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,190

♫  I'm falling for you   ♫

68
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,180
Is this seonji (clotted cow blood)?

69
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,080
Yes.

70
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,010
So they're like those squashy blood clots that form when you get a bloody nose?

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,560
People are so cruel.

72
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,100
How can they even take the blood clots out of a cow and eat them?

73
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,930
You're not eating it? It's tasty.

74
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,610
I'm good.

75
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,600
Do they have this in Seoul too?

76
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,480
I'll buy it for you there.

77
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,510
It's so good.

78
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,580
Sunbae.

79
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,430
Weren't we kind of lovely back then?

80
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,280
No. We were really, very lovely.

81
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:00,520
 When My Love Blooms

82
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,170
 Episode 5

83
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,660
Head back home safely.

84
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,520
Ji Soo, I was sincere yesterday, when I said that I would be by your side.

85
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,110
It's just a dream.

86
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,030
It's all just a dream. I've woken up from it already.

87
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,640
- So, you too— 
 - I'm not saying we should start something again.

88
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,900
I just want to be able to protect you so that you don't cry again.

89
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,250
Don't worry.

90
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,080
I cry in dreams, but I don't cry easily in reality.

91
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,510
Then don't cry. If you cry, I'll come find you.

92
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,660
Well, that sounds like a threat.

93
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,310
Rest well.

94
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,670
Where is Seo Kyeong?

95
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,960
Ah. She hasn't come in yet.

96
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,770
You're here? Come in.

97
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,370
I have to leave soon because I have a movie shoot.

98
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,270
When is it?

99
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,590
Around three?

100
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,410
Can you not do that? I feel uncomfortable with all those girls there.

101
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,670
Are they even women?

102
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,800
I'll pay you instead.

103
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
But, I'm not doing it because of the money.

104
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,420
Then why are you doing it?

105
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,150
Well, just for self-realization?

106
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,040
What is this. High school?

107
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll see you next time.

108
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,020
Wait a second.

109
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,340
- Buy what you need. 
- I'm fine.

110
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,730
You're not fine.

111
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,330
Your bag doesn't look that great. Throw it away.

112
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes, Chairman.

113
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,500
 Where are you?

114
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,990
I'm home.

115
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,500
 Then come over for a bit.

116
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes. I understand.

117
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,550
Are preparations for the government inspection going well?

118
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes.

119
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,200
I heard they're all with bloodshot eyes,

120
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,350
pondering whether they should eat you roasted or boiled.

121
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,070
It is alright.

122
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, the guys at the National Assembly live for the thrill of making a scene out of things, after all.

123
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,070
Just bow your head a bit and butter them up by addressing them as "Esteemed Assemblyman."

124
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,230
You get it right?

125
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,910
Yes, I understand.

126
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,670
But why is Seo Kyeong acting this way again?

127
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,460
I told you to take care of it, did you not?

128
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,150
You're not afraid of me, are you?

129
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,300
I'm afraid of myself.

130
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,960
When it comes to my kids, I can't really control my temper, you see.

131
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,260
If you make my kid cry because you are giving her a hard time,

132
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,120
that is the day you'll leave this house.

133
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,370
You will have to leave in just your underwear.

134
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,490
Will you be okay with that?

135
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,650
- Yes?  
 -  Vice President.

136
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,040
- Yes. 
-  Right now, millions of won are being paid

137
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
  every couple of minutes with CEO Jang's corporate card.

138
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,700
From where?

139
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,040
  From luxury brand shops within a department store.

140
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,140
How dare you come here?

141
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,160
I thought it was a sign for me to come.

142
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,250
Were you with that woman?

143
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,170
"I'm in pain, I'm so pitiful."

144
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,100
"Don't worry, I'll protect you."

145
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,910
Showing a face full of pity for her.

146
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,810
Have you properly filmed your soap opera?

147
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,450
You're drunk.

148
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,510
But you do know, right? That I've also been with another man.

149
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,710
We are tied.

150
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,790
So don't take it more seriously than it actually is.

151
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,770
This kind of stuff is nothing.

152
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,580
You and I are overloaded with stress,

153
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,300
and so we look for something to divert ourselves.

154
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,140
It is not a lesser deal nor a bigger deal than that.

155
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,110
Don't you think?

156
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,840
Yes Manager.

157
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,770
It's such a shame. I really liked you.

158
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,770
Well, there's nothing we can do. This happened because I couldn't control my temper.

159
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,920
But it was refreshing to see. Just like drinking a sip of cool soda.

160
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,100
But, that is, how much would that sip of soda cost?

161
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,500
Pardon?

162
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,730
The clothes.

163
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,160
I'll find out and contact you.

164
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,990
Then, will you move to a different hotel?

165
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,150
Please let me know ahead of time so I can follow you there.

166
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,290
I'm really not sure where I should go now.

167
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,650
Stay strong.

168
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,660
You live so diligently, so better days should come sooner than you think, no?

169
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,060
Better days and a better world don't seem to be coming.

170
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,610
Even though I thought  they would come soon.

171
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,430
Don't ever do it again.

172
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Don't ever hold someone else's hand in front of me and leave.

173
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,500
You already know why I'm acting this way.

174
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,210
Why are you being so harsh, when you can't even lift a finger.

175
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,970
Do you think you're still a tiger, Dad?

176
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,270
You can't run away from home.

177
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,410
You told me to fight, though.

178
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,070
How is running away considered fighting?

179
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,570
I'm no match to them.

180
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,870
I'll go with you.

181
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,820
You're no match for them either.

182
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,410
Then what do you want to do? Never see them again?

183
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,890
I don't want that, but I think today really isn't the right time.

184
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,570
If it's not today, then tomorrow won't be the right time either.

185
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,210
No.

186
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,820
I have something I would like to ask.

187
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,100
Why are you treating Ji Soo so harshly?

188
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,680
Am I required to explain that to you?

189
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,870
Honestly, I don't think that I would be able to understand whatever reason you tell me.

190
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,760
I also don't think I would be able to contain myself even if you said she was hit with a flower.

191
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,780
A warm prosecutor looking after the marginalized ones who have no power nor strength.

192
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,190
A fair prosecutor who only pursues the truth.

193
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,330
A trustworthy prosecutor who earns the trust and understanding of others.

194
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,850
A righteous prosecutor who is more harsh on himself than others.

195
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,780
While swearing that prosecutor's oath,

196
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,920
amongst all the prosecutors that swear an oath to justice,

197
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,130
you are at the highest position.

198
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,520
Please treat Ji Soo with warmth. I beg you.

199
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,410
Did you say you're in the Department of Law?

200
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,770
Yes.

201
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,370
Are you preparing for the judicial examination?

202
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,800
I have been thinking about it.

203
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,570
Is it because of your discretion or your principles?

204
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,740
Though you seem to be lacking in both.

205
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,030
Leave now. I don't want to hear from you nor see you anymore.

206
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,480
Still, it's a relief that it's only to this extent.

207
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,780
Quietly look into a kid for me.

208
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,280
Han Jae Hyeon from the class of '91 in the Department of Law.

209
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,310
I think he might be part of the activist group. Look into his family situation as well.

210
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,060
Okay.

211
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,220
Don't worry. I won't get back together with him again.

212
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,580
 They're saying the dress costs three million  (≈ $3,000).

213
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,900
You did well.

214
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,880
- Go. 
 - Goodbye.

215
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,790
Bye.

216
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,510
Excuse me, Director.

217
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,650
Yes, please speak.

218
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,570
Are there any opportunities for private lessons?

219
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,160
Teacher Yoon, aren't you already doing a lot of private lessons?

220
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,750
I'm in an urgent need for money.

221
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:26,320
I understand your situation, but it's not like I have individual lessons reserved just for you.

222
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,840
Anyway, I'll let you know if there are any reservations coming in.

223
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,390
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,270
 So Ji Soo, you can do it all.

234
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,790
 You can rest, you can cry.

235
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,170
 If you are having a hard time, you don't have to grit your teeth and endure it.

236
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,390
 Because I'll be by your side.

237
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,730
 Yes, Yeong Woo.

238
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,990
- Where are you? 
  - At home, of course.

239
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,950
- What are you doing? 
  - Washing the dishes.

240
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,250
Where is that place? Tell me the address.

241
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,190
I'm going to report you as missing if you don't tell me.

242
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,160
If you're going to work here, just come work at my bar instead.

243
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,620
The hourly wage is high here.

244
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,990
I'll pay you the exact same.

245
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,040
Your business isn't going well enough, you know it.

246
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,960
Are you not going to play the piano anymore? Can you just use your hands however you please?

247
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,900
These days, rubber gloves are made really well.

248
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,240
Why are you doing part-time jobs like these?

249
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,980
I ruined a luxury brand dress while working part time at the hotel.

250
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,970
Then find another hotel to work at.

251
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,760
- I don't want to.
 - Why?

252
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,850
I like using my body. It helps me clear my head.

253
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,010
And it's pathetic too, to strain myself at the hotel or whatever, just to earn 'refined' money.

254
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,720
Because I have to eat brunch with the other mothers at the hotel,

255
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,820
I even wore that unsightly mask, and my life itself was a masquerade.

256
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,550
But now I plan on living with my bare face.

257
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,900
Actually, I couldn't say this before,

258
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,510
but you look much better with your bare face.

259
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,120
Are you being sincere or is that a diss?

260
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,020
Just the truth.

261
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,090
That's upsetting. I did my best to dress up.

262
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,340
Do you not have a mirror at home?

263
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,590
You're still single because you act like that.

264
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,180
Hey, let's go together.

265
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,320
You must be busy, I'm sorry for calling you here like this.

266
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,570
- It's okay, but why did you call me here? 
 - That is...

267
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,120
We should settle our debt.

268
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,340
Yes.

269
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,420
"I'm not going to ask for that money because I'm rich."

270
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,190
I don't do that. I learned from a young age that I need to calculate everything clearly.

271
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,550
I'll pay you back within a week.

272
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,570
Is it over with you paying for the clothes?

273
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,030
Why aren't you compensating for shaking up someone's family?

274
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,410
I know what you or Jae Hyeon will say.

275
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,810
That I had an affair first, so shouldn't I stay quiet.

276
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,680
Then you guys should only go to the extent that I did.

277
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,150
Throw him away after playing for a bit.

278
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,440
Such that there isn't even a bit of sympathy or lingering feelings left.

279
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,130
Then I'll say I received my compensation and call it even.

280
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,780
Just so you know, I have absolutely no refinement.

281
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,560
Grabbing people's hair or anything that can be grabbed,

282
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,190
slapping people, spraying water, I'm good at all those.

283
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,300
 We will now begin the government inspection of the case pertaining to

284
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,880
Hyeong Seong Group's borrowed-name shares and dismissal of temporary workers.

285
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,430
 Every person who has lent their name

286
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,080
 has revealed that the real owner of their stocks was you, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon.

287
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,340
 Altogether, the total issued shares from borrowed names reaches thirty-five percent.

288
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,760
  While even the owner, Chairman Jang San, has only twenty-one percent of the shares under his name.

289
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,040
Permanent workers make up just under 60% of the overall personnel.

290
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,100
Why would such a large corporation like Hyeong Seong Group do such thing?

291
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,030
I'll look into the specifics a bit more before elaborating.

292
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,020
What exactly is it that you know?

293
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,690
If you don't know anything, why did you come here?

294
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,800
You should be ashamed of yourself!

295
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,660
And by the way, witness.

296
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,350
You used to participate in demonstrations quite diligently when you were a student, right?

297
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,640
What's more, I understand you used to partake in labor movements as well.

298
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,490
What a way to turncoat.

299
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,130
You're not going to the festival?

300
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,400
No, I'm not.   
 May, 1994

301
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,130
Why? I really want to go.

302
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,950
You go.

303
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,120
Everyone goes with their boyfriends and girlfriends.

304
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,590
There's the subway union strike, and the Uruguay Round as well.

305
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,160
The student council election is also soon, and there's the campaign against the tuition fee, too.

306
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,670
That's a lie.

307
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,810
I'm going through puberty right now.

308
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,100
What?

309
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,340
With my rebelling for no reason and being boisterous,

310
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,650
I've been copying what the activists from the 'upper league'  did in the 80's.

311
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,680
And now I feel like I'm playing with politics while pretending to be an adult. So I'm thinking hard these days.

312
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,390
In light of that, there's no reason for me to go play at a festival.

313
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,890
When are you going to be able to live feeling at ease?

314
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,130
Someday, when the world becomes good.

315
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,400
I hope the world becomes good quickly.

316
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,100
We have a meeting in the club room. Do you want to go together?

317
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,520
Hundred people from liberal arts, fifty from natural sciences, forty from law.

318
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,770
How many people are on the other side?

319
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,940
We'd only know once Kyeong Ho gets here.

320
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,660
We can fill all five hundred slots even if they only bring fifty people.

321
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,420
If we can fill rows one and two with forty good runners,

322
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,880
then we have a rough sketch of the formation.

323
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,980
How can we fight with only five hundred people? The problem just keeps growing as time goes.

324
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,660
Sometimes I wonder if we should be more soft, like the others.

325
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,160
Revolution. Purge. Destruction.

326
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,030
We use words that are too intense.

327
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,970
Excuse me, our people won't be able to go.

328
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,380
Why?

329
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,660
There's a sudden test that has been scheduled for the Business Department.

330
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,090
Dammit. Tell them all to go die.

331
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,510
Why are people who worry about tests joining in protests?

332
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,700
- It's a test that will affect our grades, so— 
 - Is there anyone who doesn't get grades?

333
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,770
Do you think I like to dual wield?  
  (T/N: dual wield here means to fail two subjects in a semester.)

334
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,670
Am I a cowboy?

335
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,690
In any case, the so-called 'leadership' group is the worst.

336
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,940
They're either studying for the TOEIC, or they're busy dating.

337
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
We are slowly losing our power to fight. Maybe because we have a civilian government.

338
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,050
I've said this before. Student protests are like riding a bicycle.

339
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,940
You have to continue and consistently pedal

340
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,230
without any breaks. If you are without power, what do you do? You—

341
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,350
Do you want to just keep going only?

342
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,530
- What? 
- Where is that bike going?

343
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,690
Where is the destination?

344
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,970
Ah, this punk really.

345
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,750
It's because of that calculating and rotten mentality of yours, that our organization is in this state.

346
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,270
I know you're trying to get some connections into the political world

347
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,100
because your chances of getting a job have been blown with your horrible grades.

348
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,900
But don't use the innocent kids who tossed aside their books to change the world

349
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,650
to wheel your own bike, Hyung.

350
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,360
Hyeong Seong Group's Chairman Jang San's relative present here,

351
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,090
obtained personal interest by fraud,

352
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,420
through numerous means such as the possession of borrowed-name shares

353
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,130
and the creation of slush funds,

354
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,110
all the while performing deeds such as massive dismissal of temporary workers,

355
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,050
thus displaying ultimate immorality.

356
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,170
- Good work, Sir. 
 - Sure.

357
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,900
A fair amount of people with a borrowed name stock must've replied.

358
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,840
Saying their shares actually all belonged to Han Jae Hyeon.

359
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,280
Everyone wants to transfer ownership to your name as fast as possible.

360
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,880
We'll have to make a queue.

361
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,730
All that's left after changing names will be taxes.

362
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,510
But Seoul Bank said they are still doing the paperwork.

363
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,440
I am pecking at them to get them going.

364
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,780
That aside, the civil case can be taken care of this way,

365
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,700
but what do you plan on doing for the criminal case?

366
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,520
Should I meet with the prosecution in advance?

367
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,000
You don't need to do that.

368
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
Why not?

369
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,000
I've already met them.

370
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,710
But, Director Jeong.

371
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,880
Yes, Vice President.

372
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,340
How come nobody knows about my negotiation with the laid-off workers?

373
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,300
Is the PR team on vacation?

374
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,750
I'll look into that right away and take action.

375
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,960
They should've seen everything.

376
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,480
Joon Woo.

377
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,960
Yes, Sir!

378
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,470
The black car behind us, since when has it been following us?

379
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,860
I think it has been following us from the parking lot

380
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,980
- Today? 
 - No, Sir. For a few days now.

381
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,250
What about the car itself?

382
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,100
I've been checking every day for location tracking devices.

383
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,500
 Leslie Chung, Special Showing

384
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,800
Did you mention that you liked movies?

385
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,790
Yes. I like movies a lot.

386
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,870
- In that case, shall we go see a movie? 
 - Right now?

387
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,380
I know that I am not in any position to see a movie at the moment.

388
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:50,300
I just wonder when next I will find the chance to see a movie.

389
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,790
I'm all for it, no matter what.

390
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:26,440
 October, 1994

391
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,630
What's with this Hong Kong movie? You can't call that a movie.

392
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,050
- You know that movie with Chow Yun Fat? Much better. 
 - This was a waste of money.

393
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,170
So boring.

394
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,040
It's totally boring, how is that a Hong-Kong movie?

395
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,720
Let's go, let's go.

396
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,740
Shit, let's go!

397
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,260
Wait here a moment.

398
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,960
Your arms must hurt.

399
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,890
How did you know to find me here?

400
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,060
I'm sorry but I didn't come because of you.

401
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,710
I was on a street campaign and saw the movie poster, so I snuck out.

402
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,250
I also wanted to see this movie and I wasn't in the mood for that demonstration.

403
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,990
Ah, so my sneeze was because of the tear-gas.

404
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,110
I knew it was you when I heard the sneeze.

405
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,320
Then you should have come to sit beside me.

406
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,760
I didn't want to block those gentlemen's view.

407
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,810
They asked for a refund.

408
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,450
They said they thought it'd be something like  A Better Tomorrow.

409
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,560
Leslie Cheung was good in  A Better Tomorrow  too, but I liked this version of him as well.

410
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,820
I agree. I hope he keeps acting for a long time. Don't you think so?

411
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,470
You know, Sunbae...

412
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:59,400
They say that there are people who always end up meeting again, no matter what happens.

413
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,660
I think we are exactly like that.

414
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,550
I will soon be home, so don't lock the door. Okay.

415
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,520
 Hit 1 to beep, 2 to leave a message, and 3 to change the greeting.

416
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,480
Hello, this is Yoon Ji Soo's boyfriend Han Jae Hyun's beeper.

417
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,480
If you are male, please press one or two. If you are female you are advised to please hang up. He has someone.

418
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,100
What's worse, his girlfriend has a very terrible temper—

419
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,500
You ought to get a scolding.

420
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:07,970
Your message has been recorded. 
 ♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

421
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:23,090

430
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,530
How was the movie?

431
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,830
I think it is a movie of high cinematic quality.

432
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,340
Leslie Chung was very handsome.

433
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,770
What did you like in the movie?

434
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,170
Sorry?!

435
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,080
Well, I like action scenes the best, after all.

436
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,150
You snored really well.

437
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,070
The c-c-car, I will bring the car around.

438
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,480
Apparently Leslie Chung said half of  Days of Being Wild  is really about him.

439
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,830
The bird with no legs is exactly Leslie Chung, isn't it?

440
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,630
Feeling lonely and futile. Right?

441
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,800
 Jang Seo Kyeong

442
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,010
- Yes. 
 -   Where are you?

443
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,150
I am sure you know where I am.

444
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,010
  What are you talking about?

445
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,160
You haven't been given a report yet?

446
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,260
  I didn't do it. Perhaps my father put the tail on you, but I didn't do it.

447
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,050
Then ask your dad where I am.

448
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,500
 Wait. I'm behind you.

449

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,260
 What is this?

465
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,980
  Let's meet, just the two of us. (T/N: He is using numbers to convey the message. Like old school internet language.)

  Let us meet

469
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,920
 It seems forced.

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,000
 1010235

471
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,280
 I know this one. A passionate love.

472
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,730
 1200.

473
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,300
 1200? We're breaking up?

474
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,780
 "Too much work." I'm saying I'm busy.

475
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,960
  You studied this a lot, didn't you, Sunbae?

476
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,480
  I studied music too.

477
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,330
  Music?

478
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,010
The end.

479
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,150
What song is that?

480
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,070
"The boy who counted stars." It's a song by Jeong Won Yeong.

481
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,600
How was it?

482
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,110
Are you asleep?

483
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,980
I think the song is weird.

484
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,270
Why?

485
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,530
It keeps making me tear up. What is going on, really?

486
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,220
Isn't it fun?

487
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,930
Yes. It's really fun.

488
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,000
I want to practice this at home. Is this your guitar?

489
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,420
No. I borrowed it from the club next door.

490
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,150
Ah really? I should buy one. Come with me and help me pick one out.

491
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,460
I'll buy it for you.

492
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,380
No. It's okay.

493
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,260
I have money

494
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,200
When I get paid from my campus part-time job.

495
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,780
How could I accept that?

496
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,160
I'll buy it for you, so just know that.

497
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,740
Let's do it one more time. Grab it with your fingers like this.

498
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,920
What are you both doing in this sacred club room?

499
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,950
I'm learning guitar.

500
00:45:54,950 --> 00:46:00,200
Hey. What does he know about the guitar that you would learn from him?

501
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,760
Ji Soo. Did you see me play the guitar or not?

502
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,710
I did.

503
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,360
You did, right? Am I different from him or not?

504
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,490
You were in fact different, but...

505
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,500
- Give it here. 
 - What are you doing?

506
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,180
- Ah, just hand it over. 
 - Come on.

507
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,130
♫ Your silence ♫

508
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:33,190
♫ has dried out my lips ♫

509
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,350
- ♫ Your— ♫ 
 - ♫ Dong Jin. ♫ Exactly how many times will you do the same song?

510
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,560
♫ I beat up on only one guy. ♫ 
  (T/N:  fixates on one thing only)

511
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,870
I should beat you up for butchering such a good song.

512
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,300
Don't you feel sorry for Yang Hee Eun (the singer)?

513
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:53,950
♫ As you turn away, I tell you ♫

514
00:46:53,950 --> 00:47:00,970
♫ Instead of the words "I love you"♫

515
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,460
Come on in.

516
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,410
Hello.

517
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,720
Wash your hands and feet first.

518
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,060
Yes.

519
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,850
How is his mom these days?

520
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,310
She's the same.

521
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,200
She should just either completely go under or do something else.

522
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,000
She has to pick one.

523
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,980
You're sure she's not seeing another man?

524
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,990
How could she see a man at her age and in her circumstances?

525
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,430
Well, that's true.

526
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,830
However, she has a pretty appearance.

527
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,100
She definitely must have something going on.

528
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,510
 Mom...

529
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,610
 By the time you see this letter,

530
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,470
  I probably won't be a part of this world any longer.

531
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,500
  Every day is just a struggle

532
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,180
 and no matter how I think about it, I can't find the answer.

533
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,950
What's the name of the store you're looking for?

534
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,080
- Hendrix. 
 - Hendrix.

535
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,020
But I really can't imagine that you used to play the guitar.

536
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,250
With long hair and doing headbanging.

537
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,680
Wearing leather pants, ripping up the strings with your teeth.

538
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,150
I'm starting to want to rip you apart with my teeth, so just hurry and find the store.

539
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,850
I found it.

540
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,800
Hendrix. It's here.

541
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,810
 Hendrix. Guitar specialist.

542
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,040
 - Excuse me.
 - Excuse me.

543
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,180
 Are you looking for Love Letter as well?

544
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,720
Oh, Yeong Min's mom.

545
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,800
Se Ri's mother.

546
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,020
Oh my goodness.

547
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,750
So the piano teacher that the director recommended was you.

548
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,720
Come in first.

549
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,500
Okay.

550
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,650
These days, I find this the easiest. It tastes good too.

551
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,410
It really is tasty.

552
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:47,620
Right? There's no need to go to a cafe.

553
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,220
Is it Se Ri's younger sibling that's learning the piano?

554
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,920
Yes. He's seven years old right now.

555
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,840
He went out to buy something out front. He'll be back soon.

556
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,380
I guess he went with Se Ri?

557
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,500
Se Ri went to Joon Seo's place. Did Yeong Min not go?

558
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,780
Joon Seo's place?

559
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,800
Yes, Joon Seo is hosting a party at the hotel, so they called all the kids—

560
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,790
Oh my, I guess he forgot.

561
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:14,990
Joon Seo wouldn't have told Yeong Min. They aren't close.

562
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,950
Is that so?

563
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,170
 My son~ What are you doing?? What did you eat for lunch??

564
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,680
 Ask your dad to buy you a lot of good food.  
  (T/N: the messages show as unread)

565
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,930
Yeong Min.

566
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,750
Should we change schools?

567
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:41,650
Tell me the truth. What happened?

568
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,330
Nothing happened.

569
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,460
Then why did you write something like this?

570
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,850
Just because studying is hard.

571
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,680
You had thoughts of dying because of that?

572
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,240
It's school violence.

573
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,970
No, it's not.

574
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,950
If I ask the school, I'll find out everything.

575
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,390
I'm someone with no patience.

576
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,280
I was the perpetrator.

577
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,860
I'm really sorry.

578
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,090
- Vice President.
 - Yeah?

579
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,160
Where are you going to play the guitar?

580
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,450
I'm not telling you.

581
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,120
I want to see too.

582
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,780
What do you want to see? I haven't played in over twenty years.

583
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,660
Even so, they say that the body remembers this kind of thing.

584
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:51,200
I guess. I remember too much, and that's the problem.

585
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,520
Why the guitar?

586
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,940
I'm thinking of playing again.

587
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,880
Then you should tell me.

588
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,060
I played guitar pretty well back then.

589
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,890
Hey, if you don't believe me, ask Yoon Ji Soo.

590
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,950
I always played for her in the club room.

591
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,980
That's right. You played just the one song throughout four years.

592
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,760
At least I mastered one song,

593
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,330
with these precious hands.

594
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,160
I do feel sorry to Yang Hee Eun.

595
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,380
If I ever see her in a private setting, I should give her a big apology.

596
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,560
Wow, you do have a conscience.

597
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,470
Anyway, so you're going to pluck some guitar strings?

598
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:45,120
Can you do that here? We're not in Misari Live Cafe Street here.

599
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,920
- Hey, Dong Jin.
 - Hm?

600
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,530
Let me do something cowardly, just for today.

601
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,980
What?

602
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:06,380
♫  Perhaps, someday we will remember  ♫

603
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:20,950
♫  The promises we kept hidden within our memories  ♫

604
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:28,560
♫  Steeped in love, everything has passed by  ♫

605
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,790
♫  Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years  ♫

606
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:42,390
♫  But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you  ♫

607
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,160
 I'm in front of your house. I have something to tell you.

608
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,250
♫   then I would tell you  ♫

609
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:56,530
♫  If we can reach that day, that time  ♫

610
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:03,090
♫  I would embrace you once and tell you  ♫

611
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:10,430
♫  Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed  ♫

612
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:19,040
♫  You are no longer a memory, but my every day  ♫

613
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,260
 Lee Se Hoon

614
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,160
 My son. What are you doing?

615
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,290
  What did you eat for lunch?

616
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,800
 Ask your dad to buy you a lot of good food.

617
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:56,320
 Mom, Dad found out about what happened at school.

618
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,600
What is it?

619
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,790
I have something to give you.

620
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,160
What is the guitar for?

621
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,400
I was supposed to buy one for you back then. I suddenly remembered that.

622
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,640
You know that I won't accept it.

623
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,300
I know. I know it well, that you won't accept it.

624
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,760
But still, this is a promise from the past, so I thought maybe it would be okay for you to accept it.

625
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,180
But more than that, to be honest...

626
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,600
It's because I wanted to see you.

627
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,320
 My child and Yeong Min are classmates.

628
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,520

 This is the start. It's going to be a long fight.
