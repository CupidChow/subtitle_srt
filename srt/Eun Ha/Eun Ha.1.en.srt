1
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,462
Mom ...

2
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:01,994
Is there anything special ?

3
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:04,580
Oh,
yes, yes, no special, nothing special !

4
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,125
Don't sleep,
get some wind or come.

5
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,126
No !

6
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,841
Why are you so relaxed today ?

7
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,094
I told you.

8
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:21,638
If anything happens,
I'll hit the radio.

9
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,601
But aren't you on duty today ?

10
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,313
I changed it,
I have some work to do.

11
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,039
- Are you okay ?
- Uh ...

12
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,708
wake up ...

13
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:57,883
go back to work.

14
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:00,677
Yes, I understand !

15
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:08,769
You, you bastard.

16
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,939
If you get me one more time,
it'll be over.

17
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,816
Okay ?

18
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,036
Did you know ...

19
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,210
uh ?
Don't you answer.

20
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,716
Aren't you answering ?

21
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,593
Don't say anything ...

22
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:42,843
hey !

23
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,642
Hey,
what's this kid's face, huh ?

24
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,021
What kind of Samcheong
education rental is this ?

25
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:53,772
If you do something wrong,
you should be punished.

26
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:57,609
Oh, no matter what ...

27
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,110
come to work.

28
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,738
What is this kid's face !

29
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,199
Is this, is this a prison guard ?
Criminals !

30
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,787
Hey, you must go.

31
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:15,460
Hey, he's not your junior as
a prison guard either, huh ?

32
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:18,672
No,
since when did you say mobile team now, nigga ...

33
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,091
it was too much.

34
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,347
It's time to patrol.

35
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,893
Baby, I’m talking, Mr.

36
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:36,732
Where are you wrong ?

37
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:37,733
- Yes ?
- Look, look ...

38
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:38,942
Ayu, baby.

39
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:44,072
Prisoner, just one cigarette.

40
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:45,240
Baby, go away.

41
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,785
Oh, bro, you look bad.

42
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,996
What else ?

43
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,165
Baby, do you want to play poker ?

44
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:55,375
- Poker Guman.
- Oh, look.

45
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,918
Oh, to cheat again.

46
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:24,780
Hey, Chief Han.

47
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,161
How about a chicken with me tonight ?
I will shoot.

48
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:34,024
This is a violation of the rules.

49
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:38,585
It's not about killing people,
but what about catching a chicken ?

50
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,128
Don't be too tight.

51
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:50,472
Is today your
wife's anniversary ?

52
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:53,183
Yes.

53
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,480
I've been here for 10 years ...

54
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,024
I've seen all of
you get married.

55
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,195
So let's have chicken
and a glass of soju.

56
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,739
A day like this, isn't it ?

57
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,408
It's not okay.

58
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,621
Mr. Lee, before I die.

59
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:18,416
We always have a chicken with you,
huh ?

60
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:24,002
Emergency situation, the physical
examination room in Yeosa-dong is in riot.

61
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,887
Child, child, child.

62
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:34,141
If you don't smoke,
give me away, fuck it ...

63
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,810
damn.

64
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,191
Are you okay ?

65
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,986
- Don't come.
- Calm down.

66
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,281
Please calm down, okay ?

67
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:51,278
Do you want to be stabbed ?

68
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:56,328
Do not come.

69
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:58,873
Do not come.

70
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,958
Do not come.

71
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,879
Sir, I mean don't come ...

72
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,305
Put them all in
the punishment room.

73
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:14,388
Yes.

74
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,181
Everyone get dressed and wait.

75
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:32,531
Are you deaf ?

76
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:34,576
Get dressed and wait.

77
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:44,252
It's the last time,
get dressed and wait.

78
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:53,220
Don't you know Korean ?

79
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,931
It was my turn.

80
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,101
I'm not feeling well,
please just end it quickly.

81
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:02,687
When the female guard comes ...

82
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:04,356
get dressed and wait ...

83
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,736
please just finish it quickly.

84
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,741
Then take off your underwear.

85
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,048
Physical examination is performed
in a completely dislocated state.

86
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:54,863
Okay ?

87
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,951
He must have turned,
why is he like that ?

88
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,689
Ah,
a song is coming out, a song is coming out.

89
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:30,317
♪ He gave me a
bouquet of flowers ♪

90
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,902
♪ Moonlight blue ... ♪

91
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,537
Man,
the lyrics are all wrong, the one I know.

92
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,284
Oh, too bad, too bad.

93
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,785
What ! Seed.

94
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,329
Too bad.

95
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:43,330
Oh, I'm crazy.

96
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,957
- What can't you do ...
- Come on, come on, come on !

97
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,169
Come on, everyone, let's drink !
Come on, let's have a drink.

98
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,589
Let's drink !

99
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:55,091
Oh,
Seojun hyung, drink a little !

100
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,261
Oh,
pour me some alcohol and see, huh ?

101
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,721
Quiet !
Hey you man.

102
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,098
Don't think of dead Jesu,
you bastard.

103
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,100
Sir, on a day like today.

104
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,018
Why.

105
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,104
If there are pretty prisoners,
let’s meet and see.

106
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,607
Hey,
do you think that bastard will meet ?

107
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:12,067
Who is that bastard ?

108
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:16,154
No,
there won't be many half-brothers, right ?

109
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,615
Aww,
these are the kids who come to kill people.

110
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:19,824
What do you meet fuck.

111
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,411
It's good,
it's thrilling, it's good, huh ?

112
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:25,330
Brother, bring it to me, I ...

113
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,874
How can men be so alike ?

114
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:32,962
But my brother is
something different.

115
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,571
A man who can't
forget his dead wife.

116
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,552
Isn't that cool ?

117
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,305
Cool, shit.

118
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:49,881
Would you like to
go out with me ?

119
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:54,859
Do you hate me.

120
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,363
I don't go out with anyone ...

121
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,031
because my brother.

122
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,910
Special only for today.

123
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,833
Ah, so drunk, ah ...

124
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,418
Are you okay ?

125
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,375
No, until things go like this.

126
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,212
Why haven't you
contacted me before ?

127
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,672
Oh, how worried.

128
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,551
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,889
Don't you have a lawyer
appointed right now ?

130
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:53,311
Uh, I have a junior that I know,
so I'll find out soon.

131
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,523
Can I get out ?

132
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,525
Oh, okay, don't worry.

133
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,487
There's no reason to be
here if you're not guilty.

134
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:05,073
Thank you.

135
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,537
Visitation time is over.

136
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,706
Oh, yes.

137
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,626
Wait a minute, I'll be out soon.

138
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:23,007
Ai, me, Eun Ha, over there,
he, if you go to a lawyer, we will meet well.

139
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,133
Honey ...

140
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,219
Oh, true ...

141
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,314
435, are you okay ?

142
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,489
Chief, I'm sorry.

143
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:30,486
Yeosa-dong #435 ...

144
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,576
What did you come into ?

145
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,537
Oh that pretty.

146
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,039
Wait ...

147
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,876
yes here it is.

148
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:44,088
Fraud,
What, Blackmail, Blackmail, Murder.

149
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:45,715
Are you all tied up ?

150
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,248
Oh, you know that big live
fish wholesaler on the shore ?

151
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:51,345
He is the suspect in the
murder of President Choi.

152
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,728
If you are CEO,
you have a good reputation.

153
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:01,689
Yes,
it looks like a flower snake, bitter.

154
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,735
I'm seeing this
for the first time.

155
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,237
I'm stateless.

156
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,328
Stateless ?

157
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,874
Hey.

158
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,379
Hey !

159
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:30,176
Are you banging your
head and just sleeping ?

160
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:34,681
That bitch was walking
around with a man.

161
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,416
The bitch that killed that man
because he didn't have money.

162
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:42,522
There's nothing like a flat face ...

163
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,400
this spooky bitch ...

164
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:52,031
wow look at those eyes.

165
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,741
Huh ?
I'll catch someone !

166
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:57,745
Where are you twisting ?

167
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:03,793
Spooky bitch, that's right.

168
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,131
Let go !
Seed.

169
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,511
Hey, let it go, let it go !

170
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:19,644
- Bad ! Let it go ! Let it go !
- Hey, let go, Mr. Lee, let go ! Mr. Lee.

171
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,319
Stop the action !

172
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:44,333
Hey, you're not coming !

173
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:46,835
Subdue.

174
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:50,441
Ttt, is it a legacy ?

175
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:54,028
Well, I had a three month old.

176
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,197
Fuck.

177
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:00,835
Oh, if there is such a thing,
shouldn't we talk about it in advance ?

178
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:02,244
Stupid year.

179
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,320
Didn't you do it gently ?

180
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:38,613
No face.

181
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:42,618
All right,
Chief Han, do you know how well you usually do ?

182
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,161
I don't talk anymore.

183
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,086
I watched it 435 times anyway ...

184
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,129
I have no nationality and my origin is unclear, so
I can’t use my strength no matter where I say it.

185
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:59,677
Excessive suppression,
just take good care not to say anything.

186
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:03,264
Put them in a solitary cell so
they don't mix with other inmates ...

187
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
yes ...

188
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:43,262
435,
come to your senses, come to your senses !

189
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:46,724
Nurses, nurses, nurses !

190
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,270
435, come to your senses ...

191
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,230
nurse !

192
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:36,107
What are you doing ?

193
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:41,821
Just let me die.

194
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:44,824
'Cause there's no
reason to live anymore.

195
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:48,536
Everyone lives for no reason ...

196
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:49,786
if you want to die ...

197
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,582
die out of sight ...

198
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:10,618
true.

199
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,954
That, the 435 or so girl.

200
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:15,915
Not kidding ?

201
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,710
It's going to be quite a pain in the ass,
oh my.

202
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:22,797
I ...

203
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,798
Huh ?

204
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:25,257
Is it very cold
inside these days ?

205
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:27,510
It's cold, you bastard.

206
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:30,429
When did you give it to the fire ?
Seed ...

207
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:35,059
year goes by.

208
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,020
Are the clothes new ?

209
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:42,775
Huh ?
A few days ago, my grandson gave me a new one.

210
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:46,509
But why the clothes
all of a sudden ?

211
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:52,701
#435, going out because of an
appearance in the prosecution.

212
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:06,173
The fact that he escaped after killing the victim,
Choi Byeong Hyeon, around 18:00 on March 26.

213
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:08,509
Right ?

214
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,055
Planned offenses aimed
at victims' property.

215
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:15,932
Right ?

216
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:25,192
Hey Eun Ha Lee.

217
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:29,029
The right to remain silent is when
you have someone to defend you.

218
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,450
People with no
nationality like you.

219
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:37,329
Being here in itself is a crime.

220
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,335
Wouldn't it be better for you to just
cooperate when you say something nice ?

221
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,797
Fish oil, I'm sure this.

222
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,804
Do whatever you want ...

223
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:57,348
what ?

224
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:02,563
I want you to take
care of yourself.

225
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:21,498
Uh, uh, uh, draw it.

226
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:22,582
Enjoy your meal.

227
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,126
- Eat well, you too.
- Enjoy it.

228
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:28,797
Hey,
435, is he a real flower snake ?

229
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,176
Oh,
how many years have we been on this floor ?

230
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,223
Huh ?
Just by looking at it, you can see each ...

231
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:36,138
huh ? Huh ?

232
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:39,725
Eh ?

233
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
What ?

234
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:44,438
435 Horse.

235
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:46,982
Isn't he a bit strange ?

236
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:49,817
What ?

237
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,112
The kid is a little cold.

238
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,698
What are those flower snakes ?

239
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:57,076
Is it his distinctive color ?

240
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,953
There's something hot ...

241
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,538
'cause he doesn't.

242
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:03,539
Oh yeah ...

243
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,713
Are you really going
to say nothing ?

244
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:14,718
I want to help,
but I can't do anything like this.

245
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,202
Oh,
why are you giving up so quickly ?

246
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,478
If it goes on like this,
you could get a really heavy sentence.

247
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,733
Death penalty is better.

248
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,584
Lawyer !

249
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:51,671
Yes ?

250
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:56,176
#435 Eun Ha Lee, how about you ?

251
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,972
Well, I have no will.

252
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,211
I guess you don't want to argue.

253
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,436
Do you see someone you know ?

254
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,916
I have no nationality and this
is my first case like this.

255
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,961
If you don't say anything like that,
even if you prepare well, you won't be able to ...

256
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,236
I have no idea what to do.

257
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,419
The first trial is
just around the corner.

258
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:19,907
Good work.

259
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,372
Yes, wait a minute.

260
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,168
Ah ...

261
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:03,804
Yes, bring this later.

262
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:07,391
Get in here.

263
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:15,274
He's coming soon.
Please wait a minute.

264
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:16,900
Yes, thank you.

265
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:23,906
Wake up all.

266
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,303
Oh, sorry for this.
Am I too late ?

267
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:46,138
Oh, it's okay ...

268
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:47,681
ah.

269
00:29:57,983 --> 00:30:00,360
Oh,
what should I say about this first ?

270
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:04,907
Eun Ha's mother was a defector ...

271
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:08,619
defecting to China and there.

272
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,159
I met a North Korean defector
in the same situation.

273
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,249
A galaxy was born between them.

274
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:27,137
When Eun Ha was 12,
the two died in a car accident.

275
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,974
From then on,
Eun Ha wandered through China and Southeast Asia.

276
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:33,727
He came to Korea.

277
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:38,440
But why no nationality ?

278
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,694
What could a runaway parent do ?

279
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:47,491
Well, now the treatment of refugees and
North Korean defectors has improved.

280
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:50,202
Well,
that's something you might need to know.

281
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:53,664
Oh, Korea ...

282
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:57,084
Eun Ha's mother wanted
to come like that.

283
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:00,254
If you go there,
it will definitely be warm.

284
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,089
Said she would welcome.

285
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:04,967
So her mother died.

286
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,637
Ha,
she came to Korea, which she wanted so much.

287
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:12,349
This country called
Korea is very demanding.

288
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,310
So nobody accepts it.

289
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:19,773
Eun Ha was not
recognized as a Korean.

290
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:25,112
The reason was that it was a time when the
North Korean defector issue was sensitive.

291
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:28,031
In the end I wanted.

292
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:31,410
The application to acquire
Korean citizenship was rejected.

293
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:37,040
Well,
and I left here about a year ago ...

294
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,002
there was no hope.

295
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:44,506
Most people expected that it would
go well when they came to Korea.

296
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:49,344
When I get rejected, the disappointment
is so great that I can't stand it.

297
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:15,621
All seated.

298
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,379
Case No. 2014 Gohap 487 ...

299
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,757
charged with murder ...

300
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,301
I will start the trial of
the defendant Lee Eun Ha.

301
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:42,272
Did the accused Eun Ha Lee
ever work at a witness's shop ?

302
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:46,151
Yes,
that, the first time I saw it.

303
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,322
He looked pretty,
but he was too skinny.

304
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:54,451
It looked kinda bad,
so he let me work in our store.

305
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:59,265
How was the first meeting between the
defendant and CEO Choi Byeong Hyeon ?

306
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,289
Please explain ...

307
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,668
that ...

308
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:06,380
Oh,
that same day, the boss came to eat alone.

309
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:09,675
Eun Ha was in charge of serving.

310
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,969
The boss was very
nice and gave me tips.

311
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,391
But when the boss left,
Eun Ha suddenly followed.

312
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:19,935
I just got into
the car recklessly.

313
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:22,062
So I just dried it.

314
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,523
'I'm sorry' and.

315
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:28,485
The boss just laughed.

316
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:35,200
Choi Byeong Hyeon,
the president of the accused, found a house.

317
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:36,283
When did you find out ?

318
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:41,748
That rumor has been circulating
since about a year ago.

319
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,712
Eun Ha said that she seduced
her boss and got a house.

320
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,883
Did you know that CEO Choi
Byeong Hyeon was threatened ?

321
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:56,471
Yeah, ah, some kind of video.

322
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:00,391
I'm going to go to the boss' house and
send it to the broadcasting station.

323
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:04,396
So the boss couldn't move
and listened to everything.

324
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:11,486
Submit as video evidence.

325
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,012
This video was filmed with
the defendant's mobile phone.

326
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:40,203
It was exploited as a weakness
of President Choi Byeong Hyeon.

327
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,321
Summarizing the testimony
of the witnesses.

328
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,147
Defendant Lee Eun Ha seizes the man's
weakness and continues to threaten him.

329
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:48,982
Getting what you need.

330
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:51,151
It can be said to be a type
of typical flower snake.

331
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,030
I didn't want
something to go wrong.

332
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,700
I didn't know it would
turn out like this.

333
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:04,206
Eun Ha is by no means a
flower snake-like child.

334
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,962
May I ask you a
pretentious question ?

335
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:16,635
The guard said that
this country is now.

336
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,887
Do you believe you are
protecting yourself ?

337
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,849
Yes, of course.

338
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:28,897
Then what if the ship the
prison guard was riding on sank ?

339
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,902
Or the house you used to live
in is the target of demolition.

340
00:35:34,444 --> 00:35:37,113
Or if a nuclear
power plant explodes.

341
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,659
Do you think this country
will protect you even then ?

342
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:47,833
A person's human rights.

343
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,794
You can never take
precedence over the state.

344
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:56,716
Stateless people or
refugees are nothing special.

345
00:35:57,843 --> 00:35:59,427
If the state doesn't protect us.

346
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:03,014
We too become stateless ghosts.

347
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,543
Don't even give up on
you because of the child ...

348
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:20,837
you are still alive.

349
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,716
Say there's no guilt.

350
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,221
What do you think
you know about me ?

351
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,977
Even if you say things like me,
you don't believe anything.

352
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,924
You wanted this too.

353
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,550
Yes ?

354
00:40:20,772 --> 00:40:21,856
Chief Han ?

355
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,320
Uh, what did you hear ...

356
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:28,779
effort ...

357
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:19,581
don't make excuses ...

358
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:22,292
just admit it.

359
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,379
There's no win for you anyway ...

360
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:34,220
in this narrow area ...

361
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,807
that the person tried
to kill your baby.

362
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:39,966
If there are rumors like that.

363
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,979
Me and my kids can't live here.

364
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:48,985
Even rural people like us
can live without money.

365
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:51,279
I can't live with shame.

366
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:56,159
If you admit what you did ...

367
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,745
I'll help you get
the sentence down.

368
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,458
I didn't kill.

369
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,252
I didn't kill you ...

370
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,712
you know all that ...

371
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:09,546
no.

372
00:42:11,174 --> 00:42:12,508
I didn't kill you ...

373
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:15,637
you killed it ...

374
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,804
no.

375
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,475
I didn't kill.

376
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:22,267
Murderer.

377
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,687
I didn't kill you !

378
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:27,315
I didn't kill you !

379
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:29,859
I didn't kill you !

380
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:36,573
435 !

381
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,868
Calm down ...

382
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:42,121
435,
come to your senses, come to your senses !

383
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:46,042
Fuck who are you ?

384
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:48,336
Which bastard interviewed
the victim's family ?

385
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:50,838
Aren't you working right ?

386
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:53,925
Victims' families don't know
it's forbidden to visit !

387
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:59,389
Since they are just acquaintances here,
of course ...

388
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:09,941
If you're going to do that,
you'll hit everything, these babies ...

389
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:44,517
어, 몸은 좀 괜찮아 ?

390
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:50,648
여기 아무도 없으니까 푹 쉬어 ...

391
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,069
조금만 ...

392
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:59,157
더 같이 있어 주면 안 돼요 ?

393
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:24,724
Hello ...

394
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:46,203
me.

395
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:52,585
Hey, you ...

396
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:54,614
Why are you like
this these days ?

397
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:55,921
What ?

398
00:44:56,047 --> 00:44:59,509
Oh, since when did you start taking
care of the prisoners like that, huh ?

399
00:45:01,427 --> 00:45:02,707
Hey, do you know what they say ?

400
00:45:03,638 --> 00:45:06,182
435 flirts with you.

401
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,585
He said he ate it all,
including the liver and gallbladder.

402
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:10,811
Let's stop.

403
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:15,483
Hey,
aren't you sorry for your dead Jesu ?

404
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,152
No,
eat something with a flower snake, Mr. Lee !

405
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:20,863
Talking hard.

406
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:23,199
Stop it.

407
00:45:23,282 --> 00:45:24,492
Stop what, what !

408
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:28,371
Yes, you are now.

409
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:30,957
Now that I've tasted a woman,
I think it's because.

410
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:33,334
Don't trust those bitches, huh ?

411
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:36,212
They didn't come
here for nothing.

412
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:39,257
I have a naive baby like you ...

413
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:42,385
개털린 새끼들도 수두룩 빽빽이라고 새끼야, 알아 !

414
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,930
아유 !

415
00:46:11,956 --> 00:46:13,499
한국 국적 신청이 반려되고 ...

416
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,209
난민센터에서 나오게 되면서

417
00:46:16,169 --> 00:46:18,921
When you are lonely and
need someone to lean on.

418
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:22,149
It is true that I received help
from President Choi Byeong Hyeon.

419
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,740
There is no evidence anywhere
that the defendant made threats.

420
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:28,389
The video footage was actually
filmed with whose cell phone.

421
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,472
It's not clear.

422
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,143
As can be seen from
the fact I just said.

423
00:46:32,894 --> 00:46:34,353
The defendant is not Korean.

424
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:37,287
I am a stateless person who does
not belong anywhere in the world.

425
00:46:38,107 --> 00:46:41,319
In other words, the current
defendant's identity itself is illegal.

426
00:46:41,903 --> 00:46:43,487
If you are in this status.

427
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:45,948
The likelihood of a crime
appears to be very high.

428
00:46:46,324 --> 00:46:48,576
It is not his will that
the defendant be stateless.

429
00:46:49,702 --> 00:46:52,806
It's just that we're exposed to loopholes
in the current national legal system.

430
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,430
Associating it with the likelihood
of a crime is an overstatement.

431
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:59,378
So, can it be said that the
defendant's condition is legal now ?

432
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,728
It's not a matter that can be judged
by such black-and-white logic.

433
00:47:04,217 --> 00:47:06,344
Statelessness should be
solved by all of us ...

434
00:47:07,094 --> 00:47:09,096
This is not a refugee tribunal.

435
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,850
Speak only about whether the
accused has committed a crime.

436
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:21,067
Defendant, make a final plea.

437
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:30,283
Defendant ...

438
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,414
defendant.

439
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,838
Please argue something.

440
00:47:43,714 --> 00:47:46,008
You didn't do anything wrong, right ?
Yes.

441
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:56,434
Without ...

442
00:48:05,903 --> 00:48:07,822
how a person's existence.

443
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:12,952
Could it be illegal by itself ?

444
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,585
I live here ...

445
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,217
baby in my womb.

446
00:48:30,136 --> 00:48:31,971
I had a right to live.

447
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:38,728
He tried to kill my baby ...

448
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:44,608
I just ...

449
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:50,281
baby in my womb.

450
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:54,118
I just wanted to protect.

451
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,391
Are there any strange rumors
circulating these days ?

452
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:25,608
What rumor are
you talking about ?

453
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:29,779
You said that you take
good care of me 435 times ?

454
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:35,159
I didn't tell you to
take good care of it.

455
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,412
Don’t say any more, behave well.

456
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:40,872
Yes.

457
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:45,127
You've been doing well,
so why are you like this these days, puberty ?

458
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,899
What's wrong ?
Why is your expression like that ?

459
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:09,901
No.

460
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:15,533
I don't know what's
wrong with me ...

461
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,369
you only live once.

462
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:24,333
If you pay attention to useless things,
you miss out on important things.

463
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,464
Then you look like me, huh ?

464
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:21,807
Taeha ...

465
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:35,195
Taehaya.

466
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:40,868
Taehaya.

467
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:42,995
Taehaya.

468
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:09,021
Tae Ha, Tae Ha.

469
00:52:11,273 --> 00:52:12,273
Whew.

470
00:52:24,078 --> 00:52:26,455
I envy you,
no matter who you are.

471
00:52:28,165 --> 00:52:29,333
Aww, oppa.

472
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,210
Oh, why, what's going on, huh ?

473
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:32,461
Oppa, wake up.

474
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,440
What is it ?
This gentleman, where are you like this, huh ?

475
00:52:35,464 --> 00:52:37,091
Come grab a drink and listen.

476
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:38,634
Aww, what ...

477
00:52:38,717 --> 00:52:40,010
Oppa, wake up !

478
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:41,470
Come quickly.

479
00:52:41,554 --> 00:52:43,681
Oh, why did you drink so much ?

480
00:52:56,068 --> 00:52:58,195
Why are you making such a face ?

481
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:10,874
Hey, but what time is it now ?

482
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:14,420
What is the importance of time ?

483
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,339
Go fast.

484
00:53:19,258 --> 00:53:20,259
Where ?

485
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:30,477
Oh, where are you ?

486
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:32,855
You know that ...

487
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,737
go wherever you want to go ...

488
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:42,615
at least not here.

489
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:21,862
Do I really have
to do it like this ?

490
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:25,574
Fuck ...

491
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:29,203
sorry.

492
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,798
I haven't seen you.

493
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:44,129
I

494
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,927
When that person has a child.

495
00:56:53,096 --> 00:56:55,390
He thought he wanted to
live for the first time ...

496
00:57:00,646 --> 00:57:02,272
so to that person.

497
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:07,528
He asked me to adopt a child.

498
00:57:13,617 --> 00:57:15,869
If you said you
would know before ...

499
00:57:55,826 --> 00:57:58,662
Oh my, you look so happy.

500
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:35,324
Let's try.

501
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:08,815
Now,
I have submitted all the necessary documents.

502
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:10,511
You have to wait for the results.

503
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:13,779
Can I get self-defense
recognition ?

504
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,201
In fact, it is true that all of
these situations are against us.

505
00:59:20,577 --> 00:59:22,371
CEO Choi will also use his hand.

506
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:25,499
If it is not recognized
as a legitimate defense.

507
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:28,335
Probably at least 6 or 7 years.

508
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:30,462
But it will be fine.

509
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:42,849
You deserve that.
One person died.

510
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:49,832
In the meantime,
let’s find a way to acquire Korean citizenship.

511
00:59:57,489 --> 00:59:58,949
When you fill out your sentence ...

512
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:02,119
I'll definitely give it to you as a gift,
resident registration card ...

513
01:00:10,252 --> 01:00:11,420
uh, that bathroom.

514
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,130
Yes, I'll see you in court.

515
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,548
Yes, you did a good job.

516
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:15,549
Yes.

517
01:00:15,632 --> 01:00:16,632
You did a great job.

518
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:23,765
Why am I so clueless, this ?

519
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:26,435
Ha, I am ...

520
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,190
Thank you.

521
01:00:35,444 --> 01:00:38,530
I want to live again.

522
01:00:40,115 --> 01:00:42,159
Not because of my nationality,
but because of me.

523
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:50,459
Don't worry.

524
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:52,919
Everything will be fine.

525
01:02:02,406 --> 01:02:05,659
The defendant has
since February 2013 ...

526
01:02:06,076 --> 01:02:08,537
for one year until February 2014.

527
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:10,205
Threatening Choi Byeong Hyeon.

528
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:13,875
Continuously extorting
money worth 100 million won ...

529
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:15,585
was provided with a living space ...

530
01:02:17,295 --> 01:02:18,463
also get pregnant.

531
01:02:19,214 --> 01:02:22,551
He threatened Choi
Byeong Hyeon to adopt a child.

532
01:02:23,135 --> 01:02:27,097
When a quarrel broke out,
he killed Choi Byeong Hyeon and then fled.

533
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:32,227
In the sense that all these crimes
were done under a thorough plan ...

534
01:02:32,978 --> 01:02:34,479
very bad quality.

535
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:39,401
Moreover, since the crime was committed in the
status of a stateless person without nationality ...

536
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:44,698
It causes the social seriousness of
non-Korean crimes in Korean society.

537
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:50,203
Therefore,
the accused is sentenced to life imprisonment.

538
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:43,733
No.
435 Lee Eun Ha moves to Ki Kyeon Soo’s room.

539
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:53,326
When my brother is confirmed,
I have to move.

540
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,536
Don't touch it !

541
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:56,580
- Oh, really.
- I'm leaving here.

542
01:04:56,663 --> 01:04:57,789
Don't touch it !

543
01:04:57,872 --> 01:05:00,375
- Be still !
- Don't touch it !

544
01:05:14,806 --> 01:05:16,558
I want to go out now.

545
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:20,645
I want to live ...

546
01:05:22,731 --> 01:05:24,190
move out of the room ...

547
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:26,568
let's find a solution ...

548
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:41,749
will die.

549
01:05:44,836 --> 01:05:46,212
Rather let me die.

550
01:05:47,714 --> 01:05:49,549
Why are you doing this to me !

551
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:50,675
What are you doing !

552
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:52,052
Don't come close ...

553
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:54,638
I'm going to die,
I'm going to die !

554
01:06:39,265 --> 01:06:41,226
Moving rooms is not important.

555
01:06:42,352 --> 01:06:45,730
After all, the female weapon-bearer
has to move to another place.

556
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:47,773
You know that.

557
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,361
Just ...

558
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:52,987
wherever you travel ...

559
01:06:53,196 --> 01:06:55,865
uh ?
When you come, everything will be sorted out.

560
01:06:57,534 --> 01:06:59,369
I will take good
care of the director.

561
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:02,996
Thank you.

562
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:08,086
But I'll take care
of my business ...

563
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,550
oh really.

564
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh, I don’t know.

565
01:07:15,927 --> 01:07:17,679
Hey you do it yourself.

566
01:07:20,348 --> 01:07:21,891
What's wrong with that ?

567
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:27,939
Oh,
what did you do over there, the weapon came out ?

568
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:31,401
I didn't know how to
handle it to this extent.

569
01:07:34,237 --> 01:07:35,780
I'll have to prepare
an appeal soon.

570
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:40,577
Appealing probably
won't change much.

571
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,203
Oh, what do you mean ?

572
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:44,706
Of course I should appeal,
I'm not guilty, why ?

573
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:45,789
Seniors.

574
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:49,461
I don't think I can
make it this far ...

575
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:52,713
uh ?

576
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,180
To be honest, even if I take this to an appeal,
it won't do me any good.

577
01:07:58,636 --> 01:08:00,054
It's not getting
public attention.

578
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:04,934
Hey,
are you talking about that now ?

579
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:10,011
You know there's nothing good about being
a judge in the local community, right ?

580
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,026
I have to eat too.

581
01:08:14,986 --> 01:08:16,112
Everyone is like me.

582
01:08:16,946 --> 01:08:19,146
Why are you chasing a foreigner
who has no nationality ?

583
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,160
Even if I appeal,
I am not confident.

584
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,557
There is no favorable evidence,
and there is already a lot of evidence over there.

585
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:27,581
When doing it wrong ...

586
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,668
There could be a death penalty.

587
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:35,548
What, sa, the death penalty ?

588
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:37,966
Yes.

589
01:09:15,088 --> 01:09:16,464
Hmm, over there, Chief Han ...

590
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:20,801
what ?

591
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:23,929
Here.

592
01:09:40,655 --> 01:09:42,095
Now you're saying
the death penalty ?

593
01:09:42,323 --> 01:09:43,825
You haven't been
instructed recently !

594
01:09:46,369 --> 01:09:49,289
It's a higher order,
hand it over to the person in charge.

595
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:50,456
Who did it ?

596
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,710
Who the hell made you
kill Jeong Man Ho ? !

597
01:09:58,798 --> 01:10:02,760
No one has the right to
kill this person recklessly.

598
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:07,932
What power do we have ?

599
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:10,393
If you do it above,
you do what you say.

600
01:10:11,978 --> 01:10:13,730
Who the hell is up there ?

601
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:32,999
Hey,
what's wrong with this, huh ?

602
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,960
Is it time for one
of our chiefs to die ?

603
01:10:37,754 --> 01:10:38,838
Well, I have this much.

604
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:41,341
Okay, where can I try it ?

605
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:43,092
Hey ...

606
01:10:48,556 --> 01:10:49,599
delicious, um ...

607
01:10:51,643 --> 01:10:52,643
you eat too.

608
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:53,852
Yes.

609
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:06,824
I'm going to get a good night's sleep
today thanks to one of the chiefs, huh ?

610
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:10,370
Thank you ...

611
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:49,826
it's ok, chief ...

612
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:58,710
because it's okay.

613
01:13:01,773 --> 01:13:03,441
It's too unfair to
give up like this ...

614
01:13:05,109 --> 01:13:06,778
Eun Ha is never
that kind of child.

615
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:11,074
You know ?
That the child is innocent.

616
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,744
No, I'm losing my billions.

617
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:18,873
But overturning this
one heart is itself.

618
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:21,375
They have to prove
their incompetence.

619
01:13:21,918 --> 01:13:24,003
Oh, who's willing to take it ?

620
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,005
Anyways anyway.

621
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:29,050
Ha, I'm not interested.

622
01:13:30,134 --> 01:13:32,053
I just think of it as a nuisance.

623
01:13:34,222 --> 01:13:37,141
For those who don't
have a single vote.

624
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:41,729
I don't want to do that annoying thing
until I get the hate of other voters.

625
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:47,985
Ha, tuk, more than once I was
involved in a crime like this.

626
01:13:49,821 --> 01:13:51,364
There is no hope in Korea.

627
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:02,083
When the first nationality
application is rejected.

628
01:14:03,459 --> 01:14:07,547
Why did you stop trying
to go to a third country ?

629
01:14:09,632 --> 01:14:11,092
I'm so sorry.

630
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:15,489
No, this is ...

631
01:15:17,617 --> 01:15:18,868
Why do you need it ?

632
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:23,246
Please do.

633
01:15:26,959 --> 01:15:28,085
Wow ...

634
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:30,254
crazy, this.

635
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:36,594
Help me just once ...

636
01:15:56,822 --> 01:15:57,698
hard work.

637
01:15:57,782 --> 01:15:58,782
Yes, thank you.

638
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:55,798
Go.

639
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:21,615
I got it the hard way.

640
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:44,304
I ...

641
01:17:45,556 --> 01:17:47,016
please take care of that child.

642
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:49,560
Well, what to me ...

643
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,771
I'm just connecting.

644
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,065
Please take care of me later.

645
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:12,476
Oh, baby, you work hard.

646
01:19:13,978 --> 01:19:15,229
Oh, nice to meet you, right ?

647
01:19:15,688 --> 01:19:18,149
Baby,
what's wrong with the guy who comes every time ?

648
01:19:18,232 --> 01:19:20,776
Take a dive, yeah.

649
01:19:24,738 --> 01:19:25,948
Oh yes, hello.

650
01:19:33,622 --> 01:19:34,540
Yes.

651
01:19:34,623 --> 01:19:35,623
Please enter.

652
01:19:37,209 --> 01:19:38,419
Well then, work hard, yes ...

653
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:45,759
well then ...

654
01:19:56,854 --> 01:19:58,314
435, interview with a lawyer.

655
01:19:58,397 --> 01:19:59,397
Yes.

656
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:03,235
I'll go.

657
01:20:04,111 --> 01:20:05,571
Yes, here it is.

658
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:20,710
Let's go ...

659
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,259
don't answer, listen ...

660
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:30,137
you will get out of here.

661
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:33,285
If you leave,
go straight to the port.

662
01:22:13,991 --> 01:22:15,367
It's the boat ticket and ID.

663
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:18,120
I'm going to the port and
taking a boat to Laos.

664
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:20,484
Apply for asylum with this ID ...

665
01:22:27,463 --> 01:22:28,464
change into this.

666
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:32,718
Come on, no time !

667
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:35,386
Listen carefully ...

668
01:22:36,013 --> 01:22:37,013
if you leave here ...

669
01:22:37,848 --> 01:22:38,932
never contact me.

670
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:42,227
If you know where you are
people will go get you.

671
01:22:43,854 --> 01:22:46,982
I can't get away from here.

672
01:22:48,651 --> 01:22:50,527
What are you going to do ?

673
01:22:50,778 --> 01:22:52,071
'cause I'll figure it out ...

674
01:23:00,454 --> 01:23:01,454
take this too ...

675
01:23:02,748 --> 01:23:03,748
still.

676
01:23:05,209 --> 01:23:07,252
You're leaving here today, huh ?

677
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,804
Your life that has
only suffered so far.

678
01:23:18,222 --> 01:23:19,431
I'm starting over.

679
01:23:20,724 --> 01:23:22,184
Go to a place no one knows.

680
01:23:24,061 --> 01:23:27,439
I have to meet good
people and live happily.

681
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,028
I do not like it.

682
01:23:33,737 --> 01:23:35,072
I do not like it ...

683
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,131
sorry.

684
01:23:54,258 --> 01:23:56,051
I can't keep my promise.

685
01:24:16,947 --> 01:24:17,947
Hurry.

686
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:22,870
Yes, please hurry up,
yes, I have a lot of places to stop by.

687
01:24:25,122 --> 01:24:26,123
Yes.

688
01:24:31,754 --> 01:24:33,297
I have too much work.

689
01:24:35,132 --> 01:24:36,925
Baby ...

690
01:24:40,012 --> 01:24:42,431
yes it is ...

691
01:24:46,977 --> 01:24:47,977
good work.

692
01:24:52,274 --> 01:24:54,234
- Good job.
- Yes, good job.

693
01:25:01,742 --> 01:25:03,827
I Charm.

694
01:25:08,624 --> 01:25:12,461
Child,
child, the door is open, look at my mind.

695
01:25:30,854 --> 01:25:31,980
Stop moving !

696
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:47,329
You bastard,
why are you doing this, huh ?

697
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,832
Ha, don't do this.

698
01:25:50,624 --> 01:25:51,708
It won't be a big deal.

699
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:53,859
Shut your mouth
and raise your hand.

700
01:25:55,087 --> 01:25:57,548
Otherwise,
fuck it, it really shoots !

701
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:00,175
Hey wait.

702
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:02,159
Shut your mouth
and raise your hand.

703
01:26:03,011 --> 01:26:06,181
Otherwise, Mr. I'll really fire.

704
01:26:06,807 --> 01:26:09,393
Don't do this, it won't matter.

705
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:12,312
Put the gun down, huh ?

706
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,983
Raise your hands and get down on your knees !
Fuck it, really !

707
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:37,170
Go quickly, come on, come on !

708
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:50,851
Everyone stop ...

709
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:55,731
otherwise shoot.

710
01:26:55,939 --> 01:26:57,608
Seo Joon A ...

711
01:26:59,109 --> 01:27:00,109
stop ...

712
01:27:01,987 --> 01:27:03,307
let's stay like
this for a moment.

713
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:05,699
Wait a moment ...

714
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:07,451
I'm stuck.

715
01:27:08,702 --> 01:27:10,412
