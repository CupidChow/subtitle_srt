00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,750

have you seen Yu Shubo today?

Professor Zhang asked me to remind him to submit his homework.

233
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,740
No.

234
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,380
No?

235
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,040
By the way,

236
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,920
he's running for the student council's chairman in a couple of days.

237
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
If he wins the election,

238
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,740
he'll gain a lot of new fans again.

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,040
He's running for the student council's chairman.

It's not like he'll make his debut.

241

Are you jealous?

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,820
Don't worry.

What does she see in me?

249
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,970
I think, first of all,

250
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,130
it's probably my handsome appearance.

251
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,210
Second, it might be...

252
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,750
my sculpted physique.

253
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,800
But I think the most important thing

254
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,270
is probably my humor.

00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,950

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,360
Alright, you two go ahead then.

267
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,310
That's all.

268
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,760
Perfect.

269
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,630
Your PowerPoint presentation will absolutely make a huge splash.

270
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,650
But there's still a problem:

271
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
the allocation of classrooms for the clubs.

272
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,100
How about drawing lots?

273
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,850
Drawing lots definitely won't work.

274
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,050
It can't convince everyone.

275
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Indeed.

276
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,230
I have a few ideas.

277
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,330
Let me share them with you.

278
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,520
Why are you still using a fountain pen?

279
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,480
You're like an old-school official.

280
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,260
I got used to it from practicing calligraphy when I was little.

281
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,380
So I've been using a fountain pen.

282
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,210
Let me see.

283
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,240
How about this?

284
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,370
I'll take notes for you

285
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,980
to organize things a bit.

286
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,120
Then I'll tell you directly using the slides.

287
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,600
Okay.

288
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,850
First, I think the most important thing is

289
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,630
the school needs to approve new venues.

290
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,940
Only with new venues

291
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
can we move forward with our plans.

292
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,770
And we won't have to deal with clubs

293
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,360
fighting over them anymore.

294
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,180
For large venues,

295
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,210
we can allocate them to clubs that need significant space

296
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,590
like the boxing club and the drama club.

297
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,590
Small venues can be allocated to clubs

298
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
that don't need much space

299
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,150
like the literature club and the comic club.

300
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,400
What about a collaboration

301
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,560
between large and small clubs?

302
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,480
That's something we need to think about more carefully.

303
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,180
[Honesty Building]

304
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,080
Everyone,

305
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,020
as shown in the PowerPoint presentation,

306
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,490
we've categorized the clubs

307
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,010
by type and function.

308
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,390
We'll allocate funds

309
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,900
based on the clubs' needs.

310
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,040
The student council has applied for sufficient funding

311
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,510
from the school and government units.

312
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,770
The funding will be distributed fairly to each department annually.

313
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,330
Additionally, we'll assign accountants to oversee

314
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,510
and audit the use of the funding by each club.

315
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,440
We'll also support clubs like the boxing club

316
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,450
and the comic club

317
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,470
in participating in and organizing events and competitions.

318
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,760
Lastly, the school has approved

319
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,270
a new base for club activities,

320
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,760
which will be ready by next semester.

321
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,900
From now on, everyone,

322
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,730
we won't have to worry about venues

323
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,620
or funding anymore.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,080
Senior Yu is indeed graceful on stage.

325
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,320
Go for it, Senior.

326
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,050
As for the collaboration details,

327
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,320
I have compiled them into a booklet

328
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,820
and distributed it to all of you.

329
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,840
[Go for it, Senior. Get him as soon as possible.]

330
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,840
[Senior Yu is indeed graceful on stage.]

331
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,440
Lastly, I want to say...

332
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,720
Don't worry.

333
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,640
I won't let him be with any other girl.

334
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,550
I will work with the student council

335
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,710
to move forward and thrive together.

336
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,050
Thank you all.

337
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,950
Based on the voting results

338
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,820
and the opinions of the Youth League Committee teachers,

339
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,230
the newly elected chairman of the student council is...

340
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,460

341
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Let's capture the moment

342
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,120
of Chairman Yu's successful election.

343
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,800
Go.

344
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,320
Let's take a photo.

00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,980
Okay, three, two, one.

-Yes!
-Yes!

349
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Are you happy today?

-Yes!
-Yes!

353
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,290
Should our Chairman Yu have a drink?

354
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,920
Drink all of it!

355
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,760
He should!

356
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,560
Drink all of it!

357
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,890
Well... honestly, I became the chairman of the student council

358
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,150
thanks to your help.

359
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,250
It has nothing to do with us.

360
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,670
Thank you very much.

361
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,660
Thank you, thank you so much.

362
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,240
Let's skip the formalities.

363
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,470
If you really are capable,

364
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,790
help the comic club.

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,880
I'll make sure everyone gets their turn!

370
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,900

371
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,790
Congratulations.

372
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,140
Finally, I can call you Chairman Yu.

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,810
Thank you.

374
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,150
Hurry up!

375
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:55,930
Let's have a toast!

376
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Come on, cheers!

377
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,740
Come on, cheers!

378
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

379
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,420
How about playing a game?

380
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,570
For example, when I say

381
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
"who do you think

382
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,040
is the most xxx?",

383
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,820
you pour a drink for that person.

384
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,210
Okay!

385
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,640
Okay?

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:20,920
Come on.

387
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,160
Okay!

388
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,720
Let's do it.

389
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,540
Thank you.

390
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,960
Who do you think is the worst

391
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,490
ladies' man among us?

392
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,990
Chopper, you really are...

393
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,140
Chairman Yu.

394
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,500
No cheating!

395
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,320
My turn.

396
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,740
Among us here,

397
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,700
who deserves a beating the most?

398
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,360
You.

399
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,880
Who is it really?

400
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,360
Xiao Yang.

401
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,360
Pour.

402
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Give it to him.

403
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
Fill it up!

404
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
Drink!

405
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,260
Drink.

406
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,350
You're even helping me catch the spilled wine?

407
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,170
Just drink.

408
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,400
Drink.

409
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,170
Who do you think

410
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
should perform a show?

411
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,780
Fill up his glass with wine.

412
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,480
Okay?

413
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,310
Three, two, one, pour.

414
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,650
This one.

415
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,940
Come on.

416
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,960
Come on, Su Yancheng.

417
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,800
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

418
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,780
Bottoms up!

419
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
Go! There's a stage over there!

420
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,560
Go, Su Yancheng.

421
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,080
Go, go.

422
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,100
There's a stage over there!

423
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,960
Su Yancheng, go.

424
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,240
Su Yancheng! Show us something!

425
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,040
Go! Don't be shy!

426
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,800
-Show us something!
-Show us something!

427
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,650
Show us something!

428
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,850
Let's go.

429
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,650
Let's go.

430
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,100
I don't have any performance for you,

431
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,430
but right now,

432
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,400
there's something I want to do the most.

433
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,960
Is that okay?

434
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,560
Is that okay?

435
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,580
Just say it.

436
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,420
Let me reintroduce someone to you.

437
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,250
Bai Xiaoduo,

438
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,000
my girlfriend.

439
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,710
Really? We all already knew.

440
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,760
♫In this bustling world♫

441
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,140
Let me reintroduce myself to you.

442
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,650
♫Amid the crowded sea of people♫

443
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,740
I am Su Yancheng's girlfriend,

444
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,840
Bai Xiaoduo.

445
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,520
♫Every time I toss and turn♫

446
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,530
♫It's all because of you♫

447
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,340
♫I wish I could tell you♫

448
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,150
♫Every boy would like you♫

449
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,010
♫My humor and charm♫

450
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,230
♫All belong to you♫

451
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,990
♫Perfectly♫

452
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,460
♫I follow your path♫

453
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,940
♫I'm very cautious♫

454
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,260
♫Keeping the longest memories♫

455
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,690
♫Of me and you♫

456
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,880
♫The sea breeze♫

457
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,810
♫The rain from the eaves♫

458
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,420
♫I still like you after all this time♫

459
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,560
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

460
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,430
♫I'd give you all my best memories♫

461
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,240
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

462
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,430
-Kiss! Kiss!
-Kiss! Kiss!

463
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,400
♫I didn't tell you♫

464
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,380
♫Because I was hesitant♫

465
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,340
♫Don't worry♫

466
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,830
♫That I'll leave without saying goodbye♫

467
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,480
♫I'll give you the best♫

468
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,470
Drink some to sober up.

469
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,580
To be honest,

470
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,090
I'm quite envious of you.

471
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,170
They say

472
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,960
brave people get to enjoy the world first.

473
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,750
You're brave too.

474
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,050
Maybe

475
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,620
everything has been too easy for me since I was little.

476
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,580
In any competition,

477
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,600
as long as I wanted it,

478
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,340
the first-place trophy

479
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,590
would always be there waiting for me.

480
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,160
But...

481
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,550
it's different when it comes to love.

482
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,320
I didn't expect you...

483
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,210
to be such a humble bragger.

484
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,750
Am I right?

485
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,070
You can publicly display your affection,

486
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,350
so why can't I show

487
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,250
just a tiny bit of superiority?

488
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,390
After hearing what you said,

489
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,870
now I

490
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,690
want to strive for something.

491
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,710
What do you want to strive for?

492
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,710
I want to strive to be good friends with you forever.

493
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,380
You really... You scared me.

494
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,160
Later,

495
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,890
I'll go back to school first.

496
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,310
You guys have fun.

497
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,850
Okay.

498
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,880
Take care of yourselves.

499
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,880
You too.

500
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,010
I'm leaving then.

501
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,280
Let me walk you out.

502
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,850
Okay.

503
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,270
I know how to wake him up.

504
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Chang Shangwen has become the chairman of the student council.

505
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,820
What?

506
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,750
Don't joke like that. You scared me.

507
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,030
You really scared me!

508
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,500
Let's drink somewhere else.

509
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
This place is too boring.

510
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,480
Okay, next round then.

511
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,800
I know a very interesting place.

512
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,780
Let's go.

513
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,920
Let's go.

514
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,600
Let's go.

515
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,520
Let's go.

516
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,210
Let's go.

517
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,310
Be careful.

518
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,020
Su Yancheng's coat.

519
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,760
He still hasn't come back from the bathroom?

520
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,440
Yu Shubo.

521
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
This is for you.

522
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,460
What is it?

523
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,960
A fountain pen?

524
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,910
