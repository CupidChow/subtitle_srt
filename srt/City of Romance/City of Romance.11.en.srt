I didn't really understand it when I was little.

Bai,

376
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,040
have you really

377
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,770
fallen in love with Blake?

378
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
I like him.

379
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,590
But

380
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,910
you don't even know what he looks like.

381
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,130
I mean

382
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,420
it's more than just a fan's love for an idol.

383
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,810
I don't know.

384
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,740
Detective Su!

385
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,460
Come quickly!

386
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,370
Come.

387
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,910
What's wrong?

388
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,060
Quack plasters.

389
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,610
What quack plasters?

390
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,560
These are the Bai family's heirloom plasters.

391
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,850
They're very precious.

392
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,660
They're still plasters.

393
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,910
Are you going to use them or not?

394
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,860
I'm fine.

395
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,820
A-Actually, my injury is almost healed.

396
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,040
Almost healed, huh?

397
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,560
I used to think you had slender arms and legs.

398
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,020
I didn't expect that you're capable of doing a shoulder throw.

399
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,640
I thought you were useless.

400
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,690
Done.

401
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm useless?

402
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,970
That's not what I meant.

403
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,970
What I wanted to say is...

404
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,110
actually...

405
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,410
you are the spiritual pillar of the comic club.

406
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,350
And I think everyone is great.

407
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,610
In the past, Blake gave me strength.

408
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,660
But now, I think it's so good to have friends.

409
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,380
So it doesn't matter anymore whether Blake

410
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
is in MCUSOM or not.

411
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,890
From now on, let me, Vice President,

412
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,420
assist you.

413
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,230
Wait.

414
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,580
You just said

415
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,120
it doesn't matter anymore whether Blake is in MCUSOM or not.

416
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,010
What does that mean?

417
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,230
It just doesn't matter anymore.

418
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,770
Because I've already met him.

419
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,760
I'm very happy.

420
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,600
It doesn't matter?

421
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,480
You're not looking for him anymore?

422
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,540
No, I'm not.

423
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,070
How could you just stop looking for him?

424
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,950
You're the one who said you wanted to find him.

425
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,520
You're also the one saying you're not looking for him.

426
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,090
Can you at least be a little...

427
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,440
persistent in that?

428
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,390
What's wrong with you?

429
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,260
Listen, stop trying to pressure me

430
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,860
with your president's tone.

431
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,100
I see.

432
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,520
Are you jealous that I've met Blake?

433
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,790
If you want to see him, go find him yourself.

434
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,970
If I could find him...

435
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,420
Hello, Dad.

436
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,010
Don't worry. I'm fine.

437
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,990
Listen, I did something big recently.

438
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,700
[Comic Club]

439
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,240
Thank you all for your hard work at the exchange conference.

440
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,770
We won

441
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,130
the first place in the creativity competition.

442
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,490
We also won the popularity award.

443
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,350
And we caught the pervert in the bathroom.

444
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,620
Therefore, the organizers

445
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,810
gave us a special award.

446
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,310
Although the funding isn't a lot,

447
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,410
it's enough for our comic club's expenses.

448
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,060
Great!

449
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,370
Friends, long time no see.

450
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,020
Yu Chi, you look great today!

451
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,990
When did you come back?

452
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,050
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

453
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,810
Who is she?

454
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,270
I don't know.

455
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,610
You heartless girl, you didn't contact us.

456
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,080
Yeah.

457
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,360
But they seem to be very close.

458
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,520
How could I not miss you?

459
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,180
Su Yancheng,

460
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,350
you're still the same as before.

461
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,240
You wouldn't even pretend to be surprised.

462
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,470
Wow.

463
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,890
Yu Chi, come and sit over here.

464
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,830
Have some water.

465
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,500
Thank you.

466
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,390
You must be Bai Xiaoduo.

467
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,210
Hello, I'm Yu Chi.

468
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,600
You know me?

469
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,950
Nice to meet you.

470
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,360
Hello.

471
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,360
Su Yancheng.

472
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,100
Why didn't you answer my calls?

473
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,840
Check your phone.

474
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,990
Hi, Yu Shubo.

475
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,460
Long time no see.

476
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,620
I like you.

477
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,610
Well, the professor wants to see us. So...

478
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,120
come to me once you're done.

479
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,110
I'm going first.

480
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,610
Got it.

481
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,110
I'm leaving, everyone. Bye bye.

482
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,890
Bye bye.

483
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,270
Bye bye.

484
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,090
Bye bye.

485
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,910
Well, let me introduce her to you guys.

486
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,080
This is Yu Chi.

487
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,390
She was also a member of the comic club in the freshman year.

488
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,110
Later, she went abroad as an exchange student.

489
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,390
When she was in the comic club,

490
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,860
she and Su Yancheng had

491
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,820
a remarkable rapport.

492
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,430
Let's welcome her with a round of applause.

493
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,720
Su Yancheng,

494
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,570
can I join the comic club again?

495
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,870
You're very familiar with this place. Feel free to do whatever you want.

496
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,010
Welcome back.

497
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,590
Thank you.

498
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,560
You deserve it.

499
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,230
Today is a good day.

500
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,540
Our comic club has won awards.

501
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,360
And Yu Chi has come back.

502
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,590
Let's find a place to celebrate.

503
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,970
Good idea!

504
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,860
How about... going to a scary escape room?

505
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
Okay, I know a place.

506
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,500
If Xiaomiao will go, I'll go too.

507
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,570
Bai Xiaoduo.

508
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,900
Let's go together.

509
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,500
Okay, okay.

510
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,070
Okay.

511
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,260
Why does she keep calling me?

512
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,770
She...

513
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,020
She likes you.
