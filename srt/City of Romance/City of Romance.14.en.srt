Why... Why are you touching me?

4
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,250
I'm not touching you.

5
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm eating a tangerine.

6
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,520
It's quite sweet.

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,210
What's wrong?

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,520
Do the apples

9
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,919
or the tangerines taste better?

[Episode 14: The Savior of People on the Lonely Planet]

11
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,790
I didn't expect you to be so calm.

12
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm numb.

13
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,670
We can't get out anyway.

14
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,880
And ghosts can't come inside, either.

15
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,100
What you said makes sense.

16
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,420
I got it.

18
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,829
0711.

19
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,140
It seems that

20
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,820
there were no voice-activated locks during this period, huh?

21
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,410
It seems there really weren't any.

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,340
You all

23
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,750

24
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,820
It's alright.

25
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,820
Where are the other two people?

26
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,340
They... They didn't come with us.

27
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,250
Senior Su and Bai ran away together.

28
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,610
They should be together.

29
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,350
Gosh!

30
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,579
Are they trapped by a certain prop

31
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,450
or mechanism?

32
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
From what I've discovered,

33
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,170
this old man wasn't someone who indulged in debauchery.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,490
He had many social activities to attend.

35
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,270
So if it was suicide,

36
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,100
it's very likely that he died from falling while being drunk.

37
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,740
That makes sense. Keep making up the story.

38
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,510
Xiaomiao and I also found this curse charm.

39
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,270
It's very likely that someone cursed him.

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,800
Hey!

41
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,900
Something terrible happened!

What's wrong?

43
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,460
Mrs. Jia went mad and then committed suicide.

44
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,590
Suicide?

45
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,260
Maybe Mrs. Jia went mad

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,140
because Mr. Jia died.

47
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,390
After all, the pillar of the family collapsed.

48
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,620
But what does this have to do with

49
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,490
the young master's suicide?

50
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,610
Both his father and mother passed away.

51
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,760
This seven-year-old boy couldn't bear the shock,

52
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,070
so he also committed suicide?

There are clues here.

I'm sure he is.

69
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,960
He's just an ordinary person after all.

I'll still choose you as my teammate next time.

79

But it says, "Next Time for Sure."

80
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,490
What does it mean?

81
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,420
I think I know what this story is about.

82
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,990
What is it about?

83
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,320
Although the Jia Family was wealthy,

84
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,870
the young master wasn't happy.

85
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,070
He longed for the company of his family.

86
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,420
He didn't know whether his parents truly loved him or not.

87
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,280
So the riddle on the wind chime we just found is,

88
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,960
"Do Dad and Mom love me or not?"

89
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,100
But he didn't have to commit suicide.

90
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,710
There are no such parents who don't love their own children.

91

When I was a kid,

92
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,390
due to my father's work,

93
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,650
we often had to move to another city.

94
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,280
Therefore, I haven't had many friends since childhood.

95
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,390
They always told me,

"You need to understand."

101
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,730
Since they couldn't do it,

102
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,710
they shouldn't have made a promise so casually.

103
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,500
That's why I hate lying very much.

104
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,350
Actually, when I was a kid,

105
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,730
my father was also quite busy.

but I almost set the house on fire.

110

Then what happened?

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,820
Then my dad saved me out of the house.

112

The door was locked at the time.

So, did you forgive him?

115
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,630
He didn't mean to do it.

116
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,030

If I say it, you can ask me to do whatever you want.

I can be fined 100 yuan.

123
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,640
In that way, it's like letting you off so easily.

124

It's 100 yuan!

125

However, though this family seemed warm and loving,

it was on the verge of falling apart.

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,840
I didn't expect that you guys could actually come out.

188
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,260
After all, we are the embodiment of courage, wisdom

189
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,990
and unity

190
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,980
as modern college students.

191
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,690
How come you have this longevity lock?

192
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,050
How come he has a scar on his hand?

193
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,860
He is the young master who died.

194
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,410
Since you've all figured it out,

195
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,020
just stay here forever!

196
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,640
Su Yancheng.

197
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,340
Everything is here. Thank you for your hard work.

198
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,630
Buddy, the box!

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
That's outrageous!

200
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,640
I've never run this fast, even when I was chased by a dog.

201
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,510
This is way more terrifying than a dog.

202
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,010
You can sit next to me.

203
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,410
Okay.

204
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,380
Stop it. This is our comic club's top-management meeting.

205
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,120
Do you want to sit over there?

206
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,390
Can I sit here?

207
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,880
Sure. It's fine. Just sit here.

208
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,960
Why are you keeping that?

209
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,410
This is the first time you've complimented me.

210
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,350
I have to keep it as a memento.

211
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,120
Xiaomiao.

212
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,390
Let's take a photo together.

213
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,400
Okay.

214
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,740
Let me fix my hair first.

215
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,970
Then let's all take a photo together.

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay, okay.

217
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,330
Okay. Come on.

218
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,690
Take the photo.

219
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,110
Raise your hand a bit higher.

220
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,880
Three, two, one, freeze!

221
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,650
Done.

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,950
Why are you grinning?

223
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,310
I'm done taking a shower. It's your turn.

224
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,670
Take a look at this.

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,890
I made this.

226
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,210
You're my romance with double sweetness.

227
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,800
You're going to confess your love so soon?

228
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,010
You think this is so soon?

229
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,270
Compared with you, it's indeed so soon.

230
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,110
You should do some self-reflection when you have time.

231
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,250
Screw you.

232
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,330
What should I reflect on?

233
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,790
You're asking me what you should reflect on?

234
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,050
The chemistry has existed between you and Xiaoduo for so long.

235
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,050
She's a girl, so you should take the initiative.

236
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,920
Who says I haven't taken the initiative?

237
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,450
Your initiatives are all ineffective.

238
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,290
Confessing your love and being with her are the most important.

239
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,110
[Us] [Lin Xiaomiao] [Xiao Yang]

240
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,620
It's okay. Just learn more from me.

241
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,350
Us.

242
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,090
[Us] [Lin Xiaomiao] [Xiao Yang]

243
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,860
Wonderful.

244
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,210
It looks nice.

245
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,690
Oh, my God.

246
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,720
Xiaoduo, have you caught a cold?

247
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
It seems so.

248
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,819
Bai.

249
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,200
Why don't we go to the campus clinic tomorrow to get some medicine?

250
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,609
It's okay. I probably caught a cold in the secret chamber.

251
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,720
Try this.

252
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,420
I think you'll get better in a couple of days.

253
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,810
Thank you, Senior.

254
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,329
Is this new medicine?

255
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,740
I don't think I've seen it before.

256
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,290
This medicine was developed by Su Yancheng's father and his team.

257
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,370
Amazing.

258
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,620
I'll pour you some water.

259
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,640
Be careful. The water is a bit hot.

260
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,200
After taking your medicine, get some good rest.

261
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,550
Thank you, Senior.

262
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,020
You should go to sleep. Don't let me infect you.

263
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,830
I won't get infected. Good night.

264
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,480
Good night.

265
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,680
Xiaomiao, I'm very bold.

266
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,640
Bai Xiaoduo.

267
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,860
Let's go watch a movie together.

268
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,140
[You have a new message.]

269
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,430
Black, I have a secret.

270
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,380
I think I have a crush on someone.

271
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,270
But I'm not sure whether he also likes me.

272
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,020
He's aloof.

273
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,520
He always seems unapproachable.

274
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,800
But he can always notice it when I get vulnerable.

275
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,880
He cares for me and encourages me

276
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,250
when I need it.

277
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,290
It's hard not to have feelings for him.

278
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,040
When I found out that

279
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,960
he also had a past which he didn't want to mention,

280
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,710
I seemed to care about him even more.

281
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,820
So, is it me?

282
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,520
When I'm with him,

283
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,040
my heart would be palpitating with excitement and I'd feel insecure.

284
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,930
Most importantly,

285
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,540
I can be my truest self in front of him.

286
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,040
But our relationship seems

287
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,860
to be at a standstill all this time.

288
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,790
It is said that when a boy likes someone,

289
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,070
he tends to be proactive, isn't it?

290
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,790
Does he not like me?

291
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,270
[Sent successfully]

292
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,300
Okay.

293
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,250
What does "okay" mean?

294
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,220
It's not like that. I like you.

295
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,990
I'm sorry. I clicked the wrong button just now.

296
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,300
Actually, he likes you, too.

297
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,640
Three?

298
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,500
That's what it means, right?

299
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,370
It means thinking three times before taking action, right?

300
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,410
Continuous ambiguity in the relationship is just a game.

301
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,610
Confessing your love and being with him are the most important.

302
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,210
Good luck.

303
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,350
Is Black encouraging me?

304
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,550
Thank you, Black.

305
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,100
Bai Xiaoduo, let's go watch a movie.

306
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,420
Black's blessing is so efficacious.

307
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,360
Thank you, Black. Thank you, Blake.

308
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,750
Okay.

309
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,510
But Senior He Rui...

310
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,920
You're awake.

311
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,150
Good morning, Senior.

312
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,970
Didn't you sleep well? Your dark circles are so heavy.

313
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
Senior.

314
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,450
I want to be honest with you about something.

315
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,240
Then sit down and tell me.

316
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,190
I...

317
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,410
I have a crush on someone.

318
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,420
What should I do?

319
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,200
I also don't have much dating experience

320
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,370
to teach you about.

321
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Senior, if it were you...

322
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,250
If you and your good friend

323
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
liked the same boy,

324
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,560
what would you do?

325
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,170
I think

326
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,450
I would tell that friend about the truth.

327
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,200
Right?

328
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,350
I'm sorry.

329
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,590
I really don't want to lose you as a friend.

330
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,460
But...

331
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,540
I also don't want to...

332
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,040
I don't want to deceive myself.

333
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,490
I like Su Yancheng.

334
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,990
Xiaoduo, I think you understand

335
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,080
what's important is not what your friend thinks,

336
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,340
but what that boy thinks.

337
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,430
The chubby girl in Tian Chuan's mobile phone

338
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,880
is you, right?

339
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,760
It's me.

340
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,800
Thank you for trusting me

341
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,450
and telling me all about your past.

342
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,830
Well, have you told Su Yancheng about these things?

343
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,710
I don't dare to tell him.

344
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,160
There's too much shame in my past.

345
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,740
So, I only want him to see

346
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,120
who I am now.

347
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,100
Xiaoduo, no one in this world is perfect.

348
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,100
I know.

349
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,310
The person who likes you will appreciate your strengths

350
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,940
and accept your flaws.

351
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,590
Don't be afraid.

352
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,720
Be brave and be your true self.

353
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,170
I'll always be there for you.

354
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,040
You're leaving right after coming back?

355
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,760
There's something I want to tell you.

356
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,670
What is it?

357
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,050
You're in your junior year now.

358
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,740
It's time to start thinking about your future career.

359
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,740
I've arranged

360
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,550
an internship position for you at my company.

361
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,810
No, thanks.

362
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,160
Wait. If you don't want to be an intern, that's fine, too.

363
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,190
Then you can continue your studies abroad for a master's degree.

364
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,350
If you want it, just go by yourself.

365
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,730
Su Yancheng.

366
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,540
What kind of attitude is that?

367
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,630
My attitude corresponds with your tone.

368
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,730
I'm trying to have a proper discussion with you, aren't I?

369
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,520
Look.

370
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,610
It's that liar.

371
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,930
Isn't she that compulsive liar?

372
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,550
Gosh.

373
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,940
Yes. Look at her. You really can't judge a book by its cover.

374
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,050
She wears a mask of being lively, cheerful and free-spirited,

375
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,270
but deep down, she's just a two-faced bitch.

376
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,490
I saw her being with a group of men

377
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,190
and flirting with all of them.

378
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,230
She likes to lie.

379
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,050
This person is quite skilled in her tactics.

380
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Don't be fooled by her.

381
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,920
You're right.

382
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,850
Let's stay away from her.

383
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,980
Don't get too close to her. It'll bring misfortune.

384
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,610
It's okay.

385
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,870
This is hallucination.

386
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,800
Bai Xiaoduo.

387
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,580
Why are you always lying?

388
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,730
I'm not lying.

389
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,800
Can we actually

390
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,480
hear a word of truth from you?
