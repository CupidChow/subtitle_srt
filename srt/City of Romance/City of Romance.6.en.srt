I like someone like Blake.

15

I have a psychological test.

Would you like to try it?

22
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,890
Yes. What is it for?

23

It's about what you usually like to drink after meals.

about our ways of conducting experiments.

93
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,960
I think his experiments lack universality.

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,560
So sometimes, we conduct experiments separately.

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,860

To cover up a lie they've already told.

107
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,800
They don't want others to know their true selves.

108
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,560
It's because I got sick and used hormones.

109
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,900
That's why...

114
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,680
This part says that

115
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,050
the experiment may lead to mild dizziness.

116
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,180
Is it caused by the questions of the test?

117
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,260
Not necessarily.

118
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,080
It could be due to nervousness.

119
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,020
Just relax.

120
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,350

I saw your expression.

135
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
It probably showed that you were not happy.

136

I also don't know what was wrong with me.

137
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,070

How could he not notice that you were feeling unwell?

146
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,610
It was not entirely his fault.

147
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
He was taking care of others.

148
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,400
I was the one...

149
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,200
This is a matter of professionalism.

150
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,370
You're surprisingly kind-hearted.

151
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,700
You're even making excuses for him.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,410
I don't want to go on talking to you.

153
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,010
Why was he suddenly so fierce?

154
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,480
I also don't want to go on talking to you.

155
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,750
So what happened after that?

156
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,980
Did you just run away?

157

158
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Then Su Yancheng suddenly barged into the lab

159
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
and dragged me away.

160
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,940
How did he drag you away?

161
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,650
Did he do it like this?

162
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,680
He kicked open the lab door

163
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,320
and then loudly declared,

164
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,740
"Bai Xiaoduo

165
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,290
only belongs to me."

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,910
Did he do it like that?

167
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,370
Xiaomiao,

168
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,840
have you been reading some

169
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,870
strange comic books lately?

170
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,670
No, I haven't.

171
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,120
Tell me the truth.

172
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,090
Do you have any feelings for him?

173
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,640
Speaking of this guy,

174
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,550
sometimes, when you think he's pretty nice,

175
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,490
he would suddenly say something weird,

176
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,060
and then he's not that likeable.

177
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,470
But I think

178
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,430
you do have feelings for Senior Su.

179
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,770
You just haven't realized it yourself.

180

I don't have feelings for him.

181
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,350
And I think that

182
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,800
Senior Su likes you, too.

183
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,500
You two are quite suitable for each other.

184
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,070
I think you two look...

185
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,110
Stop thinking about it.

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,250
Stop thinking about it.

188
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,680
I think...

189
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,070
I think you should go to sleep now.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,610
Be good.

191
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,430
Why don't you two give it a try?

192
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,470
No way. It won't happen.

193
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,290
Go away.

194
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,820
It won't happen.

195
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,650
I heard that

196
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
you took Bai Xiaoduo

197
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
away from Yu Shubo's experiment.

198
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
I noticed that she was having a rejection reaction.

199
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,690
I just happened to be passing by.

200
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,960
Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,430
Yes.

202
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,230
You were just passing by.

203
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,490
I understand.

204
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,800
It's okay.

205
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,430
Buddy, just tell me the truth.

206
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,250
Do you have a crush on her?

207
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,220
Let me tell you.

208
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,340
You're not far behind Yu Shubo now.

209
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,470
Just make more efforts

210
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,150
to snatch Bai Xiaoduo from him.

211
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,440
She's just my experimental subject.

212
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,610
Be more confident.

213
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,150
Remove the word "experimental."

214
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:58,960
Good luck.

215
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,720
I've decided to lead the comic club

216
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,580
to participate in the College Comic Convention.

217
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,420
Chief Editor Yu, please help us

218
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
get a seat there.

220
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,200
Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.,

221
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,560
we'll have the first meeting after the comic club has been reorganized.

222
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,660
I hope that everyone can attend it on time.

223
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,130
You do have feelings for Senior Su.

224
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,730
You just haven't realized it yourself.

225
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,710
How is that possible?

226
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,320
And I think that

227
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,780
Senior Su likes you, too.

228
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,260
Do you have a crush on her?

229
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,750
Let me tell you.

230
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,620
You're not far behind Yu Shubo now.

231
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,970
Make more efforts to

232
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,470
to snatch Bai Xiaoduo from him.

[The 10th College Comic Convention]

234
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
Oh, my God!

235
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
I've heard that it's extremely difficult to get a seat

236
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,680
in this College Comic Convention.

237
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,670
Did you purchase in-game items?

238
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,340
Our comic club is so poor that it's on the verge of disbanding.

239
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,500
Where would we get the money?

240
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,329
That's true.

241
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,829
Su, did you...

242
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,260
We've only temporarily avoided the crisis of disbanding.

243
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,680
But we didn't get any sponsorship.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
So I applied to Chief Editor Yu

245
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,619
for the qualification to participate in this competition.

246
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,540
If I can win the first place in the competition,

247
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,830
there will be prize money.

248
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,430
By that time,

249
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,880
we won't have to worry about

250
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,150
the club's funds and the organization

251
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,280
of some events.

252
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,750
How about we do cosplay

253
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,200
or wear Hanfu costumes collectively?

254
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,150
Is that okay?

255
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,120
It's fine if we wear them ourselves.

256
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
But other clubs have also done the same thing before.

257
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,410
It's not creative.

258
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,110
Why don't we prepare a dance instead?

259
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,980
We can even attract people's attention at the entrance.

260
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm familiar with this.

261
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,420
Good.

262
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,220
Junior Bai.

263
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,150
You're Blake's assistant, aren't you?

264
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,020
I think you might as well invite him here directly.

265
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,780
No.

266
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,280
No.

267
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,220
I'm asking Junior Bai. Why are you interrupting and answering it?

268
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,330
Blake's identity can't be exposed.

269
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,040
So he probably won't participate in this kind of

270
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,020
public event, right?

271
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,560
Yes, that's right.

272
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,770
Then what advantages do we have?

273
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,000
I've heard that

274
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,840
the comic club at Xue City University is particularly good.

275
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,460
They stole the thunder every year.

276
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,460
If Blake can't be present personally,

277
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,150
could we display some of his works?

278
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,120
Yes, that's clever, Xiaomiao.

279
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,770
Junior Bai.

280
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,280
Why don't you get a few more of Blake's manuscripts?

281
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,490
Yes.

282
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,480
If we have Blake's manuscripts to support us,

283
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
the promotion effect will be good.

284
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,600
Yes.

to take extra care of the girls

334
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,960
because I'm a boy.

is going to participate in the College Comic Convention,

350
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,280
would it be convenient for you

to lend us two of your manuscripts

352

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,280
What? Are you here to ask for my help?

374
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,560
Just say it.

375
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,480
Sister.

376
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,490
I want to borrow Blake's manuscripts from you.

377
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Why do you need Blake's manuscripts?

378
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,470
Here's the thing.

379
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,430
Our school's comic club has been reorganized, hasn't it?

380
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,900
Blake also left a drawing on the wall.

381
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,730
The students have a deep emotional tie

382
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,680
with Blake and the comic club actually.

383
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,640
So I want to

384
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,400
help them this time.

385
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,440
Tell me the truth.

386
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,080
Are you doing this

387
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,220
for the comic club

388
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,180
or for officially becoming

389
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,620
the chairman

390
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,010
of the student council yourself?

391
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,520
Neither of them is the reason.

392
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,400
So you're doing this for a girl?

393
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,840
No.

394
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,310
Come on. Stop pretending in front of me.

395
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,950
Don't I know what you're thinking?

396
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,360
I guess this person is either in the comic club

397
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,740
or in the student council.

398
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,790
Am I right?

399
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,220
No.

400
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,450
Yu Shubo, you know what?

401
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,560
The way you came in just now

402
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,420
was just like when you were kid.

403
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
You insisted on keeping that little stray dog,

404
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,950
but the whole family disagreed.

405
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,080
And then,

406
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,600
you put on this self-sacrificing act

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,920
to negotiate with our parents.

408
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,240
Sister.

409
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,860
I really want to help them this time.

410
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
I understand.

411
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,740
I'm sure you like that girl.

412
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

413
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
come all the way here to beg me today.

414
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,260
However,

415
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,870
I'm a person of principles.

416
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,980
[Principles]

417
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,120
So I really can't give you his manuscripts.

418
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,220
Is this okay, Sister?

419
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,540
Can you talk to Blake about it?

420
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,610
We'll borrow them from him.

421
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,710
Don't worry.

422
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,680
Even the discarded manuscripts are fine. I promise they won't be leaked.

423
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,300
No.

424
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,040
I really can't help you this time.

425
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Later,

426
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,690
I'll have a meeting.

427
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
Go home by yourself.

428
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,680
Si.

429
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,340
Si, come in for a moment.

430
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,150
I don't need that stack of documents on my desk anymore.

431
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,180
Please throw them away for me.

432
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,190
Okay.

433
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,240
I'll attend the meeting now.

434
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,300
Go home by yourself.

435
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay.

436
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,550
Be careful on the way.

437
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,890
So this is

438
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,950
Blake's draft for Season 3?

439
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,790
Si.

440
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,600
Let me help you.

441
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,610
Okay. I'm giving them to you.

442
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
I have to throw them away anyway.

443
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,140
Okay.
