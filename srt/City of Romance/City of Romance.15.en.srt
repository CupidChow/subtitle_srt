I haven't told you all this time

208
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,160
because

209
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,320
I didn't know if others could accept

210
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,020
the type of things I like.

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,410
Of course, if you can't accept it,

and telling me these secrets.

217
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:37,880
But...

218
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,170
But I do find it a bit hard to accept.

And I even got to enjoy some gossip along the way.

Those two didn't intentionally hide it.

You... You... You don't need to say anything.

379
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Can you stop smiling so disgustingly?

380
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,370
You've been brewing for so long. If you have something to say, just spit it out.

381
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't be impatient.

382
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,060
Let's talk when Su comes back.

383
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,290
Are we having a shareholders' meeting?

384
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,950
Everyone's here.

385
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,270
Go ahead.

386
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,240
How should I put this...

387
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,370
Well, about this matter, it...

388
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,380
It...

389
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,240
How should I say it, well...

390
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,220
Speak up.

391
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,770
If you don't say it, I'm leaving.

392
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,770
I...

393
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
I...

394
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm officially off the market.

395
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,720
With Lin Xiaomiao?

396
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,710
Xiaomiao must be blind.

397
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,140
Now, a living, breathing success story

398
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,660
is right in front of you.

399
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,030
You should learn from it when you have time.

400
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,290
Learn what?

401
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,940
Learn how you

402
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,550
kiss?

403
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,460
How do you know that?

404
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,120
I was passing by and accidentally saw it.

405
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,810
Accidentally saw it?

406
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,890
What else did you see?

407
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,730
There was a second part?

408
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,120
There... Wasn't.

409
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,910
There was a second part?

410
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,970
No, there wasn't.

411
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,630
It doesn't matter anyway. We're all adults here.

412
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,160
It's fine. So what if you saw it?

413
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,720
Don't be envious or jealous.

414
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,580
Get lost.

415
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,020
You don't have it, do you?

416
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,590
You don't have it either, right?

417
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,350
I do. Isn't that annoying?

418
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,630
Bai, what's with that expression? Stop smiling.

419
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,880
This is a mother's pride.

420
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,470
So, how did it go just now?

421
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,130
Don't you dare tell anyone.

422
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,570
I definitely won't tell anyone.

423
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,560
From today on,

424
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,570
I'm your couple's number one fan.

425
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,890
I'll defend Yang and Lin Couple with my life.

426
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,410
What's Yang and Lin Couple?

427
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,020
It's the couple name I just came up with for you two. How is it?

428
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,920
If Xiao Yang dares to bully you in the future,

429
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,590
I'll immediately unstan and turn against him.

430
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,100
That won't happen.

431
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,230
Senior Xiao Yang isn't that kind of person.

432
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,810
How come on the first day

433
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,510
you're already taking his side?

434
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,460
I'm not.

435
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,890
But you're quite brave.

436
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,680
You can tell him your secret directly.

437
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,250
Because I think

438
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,630
if two people want to be together,

439
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,250
they should be honest with each other.

440
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,700
What if he doesn't accept it?

441
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,070
If he doesn't accept it,

442
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,770
we can try to change or adapt.

443
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,250
After all, in this world,

444
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,950
there are no two people who are perfectly compatible.

445
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,720
If you want to get closer to each other,

446
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,040
someone always has to make an effort.

447
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,260
If both people only care about themselves,

448
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,740
then the relationship will only stagnate.

449
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,220
That makes sense.

450
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,630
As expected of you.

451
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,910
No wonder you can...

452
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,060
Here you go again.

453
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,020
What?

454
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,850
Senior Xiao Yang sent a message.

455
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,910
I have a message too.

456
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,390
I've bought the movie tickets for tomorrow.

457
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,700
After the movie, I'll take you somewhere.

458
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,130
Okay.

459
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,910
Who is it?

460
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,730
Let me show you.

461
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,270
Isn't that Yu Shubo?

462
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,040
I can't believe he made a poster for himself.

463
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,280
[Notice Board]

464
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,250
Yes, he even covered up other people's posters.

465
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,230
How badly does he want to win?

466
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,210
How could he do that?

467
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,760
[Pick me. Pick me. Please vote for me.]

468
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,760
[Student Council Chairman Election]

469
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,890
Right.

470
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,360
And look at how that poster is made.

471
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,440
Look at his head, it's shaped like that.

472
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,660
That's him.

473
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,100
[I'm running for chairman of the student council.
Yu Shubo]
