[Episode 17]

3
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,360
Thank you,

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,730
my colorist.

5
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,720
What's it?

6
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,470
I thought...

7
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,440
What did you think?

8
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,220
You tell me.

9
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,270
Go take a shower. What are you thinking?

10
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,860
We can do it together.

11
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,980
Is that appropriate?

12
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,040
I mean, I have two bathrooms.

13
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,090
What are you thinking?

14
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,200
I

15
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,670
am not thinking about anything.

16
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm

17
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
done.

18
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,320
You're going to sleep here?

19
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
You take the bed.

20
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,100
Put your clothes there.

21
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

22
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,000
Give it to me.

23
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,630
It's okay. I can do it myself.

24
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,090
Good night.

25
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Good night.

26
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,150
Su Yancheng.

27
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,190
What's wrong?

28
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,290
Why don't you want others to know

29
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,530
that you're Black?

30
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,100
I didn't want others to know I was drawing back then,

31
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,240
so I signed a confidentiality agreement with the publishing house,

32
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
making Black become a symbol.

33
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll keep your secret too.

34
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,060
Then,

35
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,050
can we keep our relationship

36
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,330
a secret

37
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,010
for now?

38
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,070
No need.

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,570
This doesn't interfere with anything.

40
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,110
Besides, you have so many fans.

41
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,710
I just feel

42
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,110
it's better to keep a low profile.

43
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,710
It's okay.

44
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,720
You have me by your side.

45
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,820
And it's my first time being in a relationship.

46
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,270
I

47
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,000
don't want it to be so high-profile,

48
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,980
okay?

49
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,030
Please?

50
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,950
Come on.

51
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,320
Alright.

52
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,040
Are you cold?

53
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,630
Yes.

54
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,760
Do you want to come up and sleep on the bed then?

55
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,880
Can I?

56
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,570
I suppose so.

57
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,920
I want to ask you something.

58
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,310
Why did you

59
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,710
use Miss Flying Squirrel

60
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,070
and Mr. Owl

61
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,110
as the main characters?

62
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,039
When I was in middle school,

63
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,130
I accidentally found a flying squirrel

64
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,460
under a tree outside.

65
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,010
So I built a little house

66
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,799
for it in the tree.

67
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,280
I built it

68
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,500
very beautifully.

69
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,070
It even had a small pool inside.

70
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,040
Really?

71
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,140
And a little restaurant too.

72
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,750
Then every day,

73
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,700
I would bring it some nuts to eat.

74
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,750
Just like your place here?

75
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,790
Pretty much.

76
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,020
The same layout.

77
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,460
Over time,

78
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,250
it became my chat partner.

79
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,250
When I saw it getting

80
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,000
rounder and plumper from my feeding,

81
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,100
I thought it was quite cute.

82
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,960
But since you fed it until it got so fat,

83
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,910
weren't you afraid

84
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,850
that a wild cat might come and eat it?

85
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,010
Yeah.

86
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,030
One day,

87
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,590
it suddenly disappeared.

88
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,500
I searched for it for a long time.

89
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,440
Later, I found

90
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,250
an owl's feather under the tree.

91
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
I was quite sad at that time.

92
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,060
But then I thought about it.

93
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,680
Perhaps between them,

94
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,820
there might be a different ending.

95
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,710
There definitely would be.

96
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,110
That's so nice.

97
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,240
You weren't as boring

98
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,620
as me when you were little, right?

99
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,070
When I was little...

100
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,650
my dad raised me.

101
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,780
It was just the two of us,

102
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,850
relying on each other.

103
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,330
He was so much fun.

104
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,100
Do you call him every day?

105
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,370
Pretty much, yeah.

106
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,840
He's an empty nester living alone,

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and I'm a young girl studying away from home.

108
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,960
Staying in touch helps

109
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,590
ease our worries, I guess.

110
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,580
Sometimes,

111
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,690
I envy this kind of relationship.

112
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,170
It's okay.

113
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,060
Your parents are just too busy.

114
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,130
There's no parent who doesn't love their child.

115
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,600
Maybe they're just like you...

116

121
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,910
Who?

122
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,760
I'll go upstairs and check.

123
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,850
Wait for me here.

124
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,150
Okay.

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,390
Why are you at home?

126
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,250
I got back late yesterday, so I stayed here.

127
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,160
Have you had breakfast?

128
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,250
Not yet.

129
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,250
Then I'll make you some.

130
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,950
No need.

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,240
I... I'm not hungry.

132

Why are you acting so weird today?

Am I?

134
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,640
I've always been like this.

137

It's alright.

138
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,670
Why are you suddenly concerned about this?

139
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,960
I should be.

140
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,820
Rest a bit.

141
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,690
I'll be quick.

You both eat quickly.

What?

You've grown up.

148
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,030
There are some things

that I can't control anymore.

150

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,190
Mom,

155
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,780
I hope

156
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,270
you can keep this a secret for me for now.

157
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,170
At least don't let him know for now.

158
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,590
Don't worry. I won't tell your dad.

159
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,860
Well, it's getting late.

160
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,130
You guys take your time eating.

161
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,230
Don't just stand there. Eat up.

162
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,840
Come out.

Did she say anything?

No.

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,970
it's the rationalization.

196
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,220
Simply put, it means

197
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,210
using socially acceptable excuses...

198
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,830
People who are late usually use the back door.

199
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,520
Why did you come through the front door?

200
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,950
Where did you go last night?

201
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,819
I went back home.

202
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,270
Xiao Yang!

203
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,619
This is the key point!

204
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,720
Got it.

205
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,619
The fourth is projection.

206
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,680
For example, originally

207
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,119
you really want to get close to a boy or girl

208
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,000
you have a crush on,

209
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,510
but instead, you show distance and avoidance.

210
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,720
Think about it.

211
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,050
Isn't that how it is?

212
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,210
It's very interesting.

213
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,890
Alright, students,

214
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,120
that's all for this lesson.

215
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,120
Class dismissed!

216
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,560
Xiaomiao is looking for me. I...

217
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,290
Be serious.

218
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,330
Professor Zhang said our experiment report has been approved.

219
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,550
He wants us to prepare the thesis now.

220
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,960
Bai Xiaoduo deserves some credit for this too.

221
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,620
That's true.

222
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,620
If it weren't for her being our experimental subject,

223
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,680
it wouldn't have been this fast.

224
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,120
How about we

225
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,230
give her a gift sometime

226
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,290
or treat her to a meal or something?

227
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,910
No need.

228
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,050
I'll treat her.

229
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,140
Is Yu Chi still angry?

230
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,620
Bro, can we not bring this up again?

231
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,120
Need any help?

232
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,600
You're offering to help me?

233
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,320
What's the catch?

234
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,940
It's not for you.

235
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,650
Who else could it be for?

236
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,650
I gotta go.

237
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,580
Don't forget to turn off the lights.

238
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,750
Only if you two get along well

239
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,240
will Bai Xiaoduo not be troubled anymore.

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm so thoughtful.

241
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,390
Are they that appealing?

242
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm sorry, sorry.

243
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,710
They're not appealing.

244
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,100
Just average.

245
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,510
You're still the most appealing one.

246
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,130
What are you thinking about?

247
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm thinking

248
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,070
Yu Shubo and Senior Yu Chi still haven't made up.

249
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,860
What should we do?

250
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,930
This must be Yu Shubo's first time offending a girl.

251
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,670
He probably doesn't have experience

252
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,310
handling this kind of stuff.

253
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,710
But you don't know

254
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,940
how angry Senior Yu Chi was that day.

255
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,630
Yu Shubo didn't even try to chase after her.

256
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,670
Are all guys like this?

257
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,710
Would you be like this?

258
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,090
I would definitely chase after you.

259
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,320
Chase you to your dorm,

260
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,930
to your home,

261
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,570
and to the ends of the earth.

262
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,520
I'd never let you slip out of my grasp.

263
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,260
What's that? That's so corny.

264
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Xiao Yang taught me that.

265
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,080
I told you not to hang out with him so much.

266
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,630
Don't worry.

267
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,810
I

268
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,420
won't make you sad.

269
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,820
Are you the Clingy King?

270
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,950
The Clingy King is hungry right now.

271
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,650
I wonder

272
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,210
if you'd grace me with your presence for a meal.

273
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,730
Wait a moment.

274
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,790
My outfit today...

275
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,700
is not quite complete yet.

276
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
It's just a meal, and you're dressing up like this?

277
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,250
Let's go, Officer.

278
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,960
Our mission today is

279
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,500
not to let others recognize us.

280
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,110
We're more likely to be recognized with you dressed like this.

281
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,080
Officer, look.

282
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,710
The person we're looking for is among this group of people.

283
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,020
The officer thinks you're mistaken.

284
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,320
Look at me.

285
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,590
Xiaomiao.

286
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,740
It's cold. Drink this.

287
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,720
Come on.

288
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,750
I'll drink this one.

289
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,110
Bottoms up.

290
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,570
Look how sweet this scene is.

291
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,470
Walking home together after work.

292
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,140
Though the conversation is mundane,

293
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,270
they both know what the other is thinking.

294
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,530
Why do you always envy the love stories in the 2D world?

295
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,990
Aren't we sweet enough?

296
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,860
The 2D world is the 2D world,

297
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,350
and the 3D world is the 3D world.

298
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,110
They're different.

299
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,990
How are they different?

300
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,880
Although they're different,

301
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,140
both experiences are good.

302
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,550
Is this a confession?

303
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,800
Let go of my hand. Let go.

304
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,180
Hi.

305
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,410
Here on a date?

306
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,490
Since you're here, let's eat something together.

307
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,930
It's okay. We've already eaten.

308
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,020
We'll be leaving now.

309
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,670
Boss, we'd like to order.

310
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,480
Wow.

311
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,930
Why are you two as cold as this salad

312
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,760
toward each other?

313
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,380
Xiaomiao.

314
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,860
Come on, try this.

315
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,140
It's so delicious!

316
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,360
Xiao Yang, you're so thoughtful.

317
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,180
Do you want to eat this?

318
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,680
I don't like it.

319
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll eat it.

320
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,110
Your mouth is dirty. Let me wipe it.

321
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,690
Let me wipe your mouth.

322
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,610
What else do you want to eat?

323
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,000
Try this too.

324
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,670
It's delicious, so sweet.

325
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,220
So sweet.

326
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,060
As sweet as we are.

327
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,580
That's enough from you two.

328
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,130
We're dating now.

329
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,510
We can show off however we want.

330
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,170
You stole Xiaomiao from me,

331
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,200
and I haven't settled the score with you yet.

332
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,620
Last night, Bai didn't come back to the dorm.

333
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,640
Whose side are you on?

334
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,440
Su didn't come back either.

335
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,280
Don't tell me you two...

336
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,340
are sneaking around...

337
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,640
Is this fun for you guys?

338
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,370
Is it fun to be sneaky around?

339
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,700
Sneaking around is very exciting.

340
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,100
You don't understand.

341
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,700
Since I don't understand, let's just eat.

342
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,810
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,650
Why are you apologizing?

344
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,690
For making you envious of others.

345
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,050
I was a little bit envious.

346
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,610
Su Yancheng.

347
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,610
I don't want to go public yet,

348
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,900
but...

349
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,650
I really like you.

350
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,920
What?

351
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,070
I like you.

352
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,590
Senior, what are you doing?

353
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,390
What's going on...

354
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,280
making you this happy?

355
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,290
Tell me about it, will you?

356
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,530
Don't tell me you're dating

357
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,370
Su Yancheng.

358
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,280
What?

359
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,760
Making up lies again?

360
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,920
You love lying so much.

361
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,460
Do you deserve to be with Su Yancheng?

362
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,550
Don't you know what he hates the most is

363
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,330
people lying to him?

364
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,610
Su Yancheng.

365
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,470
I just...

366
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,530
I... I just didn't know how to tell you.

367
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,410
I'm sorry. I didn't...

368
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,010
We don't even have the most basic trust between us.

369
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,330
Is this what your so-called "like" amounts to?

370
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,970
Su Yancheng, I'm sorry.

371
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,760
Let me explain, I...

372
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,520
Let's break up.

373
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,430
Su Yancheng!

374
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,310
[Honesty Building]

375
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,620
You startled me.

376
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,330
I've been waiting here for you.

377
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,950
What's the matter?

378
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,030
There are some things I want to talk to you about.

379
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,740
Go ahead.

380
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,490
What do you think of Yu Shubo?

381
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,390
I think he's...

382
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,890
pretty good.

383
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,780
He might be a bit direct when he speaks.

384
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,520
I just want to hear your opinion.

385
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,270
Nothing serious. You don't need to think too much about it.

386
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,520
Alright, I'll be frank then.

387
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,420
He's someone who

388
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,140
is serious about work, has a strong ability to learn,

389
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,580
and is meticulous in what he does.

390
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,950
In summary, he's reliable.

391
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,170
So, that's

392
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,610
how you see Yu Shubo.

393
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,310
He...

394
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,340
also admits his mistakes when he makes them.

395
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,840
Bai Xiaoduo.

396
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,880
You don't happen to like him, do you?

397
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,240
No...

398
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,700
How did you come to that conclusion?

399
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,340
Then who do you like?

400
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,950
I like...

401
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,840

402
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,840

[Bai Xiaoduo]

404
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,760
Okay.

405
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,080
Have you finished organizing the materials?

406
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,220
If you're done, let me take a look.

407
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,250
What are you watching?

408
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,430
Waiting for a reply, aren't you?

409
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,510
You have a phone worth thousands,

410
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,480
yet no one messages you.

411
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,880
I'm receiving one.

412
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,320

[Behavior Analysis Area]

414
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:03,920
I've eaten.

415
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,560
No, I haven't. I haven't.

416
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,270
Have you eaten?

417
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,950
We're organizing materials.

418
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,910
Okay, where to?

419
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,460
He...

420
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,100
he's waiting for a reply.

421
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,860
But he hasn't received one.

422
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,130
If Black knew,

423
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,230
he would be very happy.

424
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,890
He knows.

425
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,680
I like him.

426
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,330
And he likes me back.

427
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,930
How do you know

428
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,700
that he doesn't treat all fans like that?

429
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,690
Just like Yu Shubo,

430
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,570
he treats everyone the same.

431
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,860
Why do you keep mentioning him today?

432
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,050
Because...

433
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,960
I like him.

434
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,030
Wait, you

435
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,540
are that brave?

436
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm sorry for making you envious of others.

437
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,770
I was a little bit envious.

438
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,120
Xiaoduo.

439
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,080
Do you think he likes me?

440
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,560
Yu Shubo is someone

441
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,990
who rarely shows

442
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,260
his true self.

443
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,550
But he's willing to show

444
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,680
his most vulnerable side to you, and that means

445
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,460
you're different from others.

446
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,860
So, you're saying

447
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,030
that he likes me too?

448
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,890
That's something you'll have to feel for yourself.

449
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,530
But it's definitely not the side of him you've seen.

450
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,660
But our relationship is so awkward now.

451
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,360

the poster thing, right?

453
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,150
Actually, he's quite upset about it too.

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,690

455
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
his guilt.

456

He hasn't even properly apologized yet.

I can't just forgive him first.

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:13,880
Right.

You give him a way out first.
