00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,920
Are you here to see Bai?

00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,050
Is this for Bai?

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,979
I can give it to her for you.

9
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,720
It's okay.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,440
No need.

11
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,770
I'll give it to her myself another day.

I'm leaving.

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,750
It's the weekend tomorrow. Are you going out?

14
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,010
I'm going to the amusement park with Senior Yu.

15

Which one do you think looks better?

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,810
Senior Yu,

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,130
I just saw him downstairs looking all secretive.

18
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,800
He was holding a document envelope.

19
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,050
It seemed to be for you.

20
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,560
Really?

21
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,550

Which one do you think I should wear?

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,320
For the amusement park,

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,980
this one is more suitable.

26
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,990
It's easier to move around in.

27
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,710
I think so too.

28
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,740
Xiaoduo,

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,920
why are you suddenly going to the amusement park with Yu Shubo?

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,950
He happened to have tickets,

31
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,370
so I'm just tagging along.

32
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,500
I see. It's just that you've been

33
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,480
closer to Su Yancheng lately,

34
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,690
I thought...

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,790
He's so aloof,

36
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,100
he probably wouldn't like going to an amusement park, right?

37
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,880
That's true.

38
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,610
Hello?

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,060
Okay.

Guess what I've prepared for you.

44

If I'm not mistaken,

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,030
it should be two big bags of snacks, right?

46
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,100
You're so smart.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,840
Look.

48

Why did you buy so much?

I'm so embarrassed.

They're all the snacks you like.

00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,930
the amusement park opens at 10 AM tomorrow.

191
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,490
How excited are you?

192
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,680
You're here so early, it just opened.

193
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,970
Mom, look!

194
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,780
This auntie is preening herself.

195
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Call me "sister".

196
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,290
You can't be so rude.

197
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,840
It's okay.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,880
Mom, she's so scary.

200
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,900
Xiaoduo.

201
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,990
Senior Yu.

202
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,640
I'm sorry, there was some traffic on the way.

203
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,750
It's okay, it's okay. I just got here too.

204
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,250
Let's go.

205
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,320
Let's go.

206
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,610
What are you doing?

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

208
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,850
Catch this one.

209
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,130
Is it okay?

210
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,580
Yes, it's fine.

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,490
That's about right.

212
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,280
It's alright.

213
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,450
You try to catch one.

214
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,250
Okay, I'll try to catch one.

215
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,850
I can't catch one either.

216
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,800
How about this?

217
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,330
Let me buy one for you.

218
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,530
Buying one doesn't feel right. Let's go.

219
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,590
It's not meant to be.

220
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
The balloon fell.

221
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,670
Is the baby having fun?

222
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,750
I'll buy you another one.

224
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,390
It's okay, it's okay. Mommy will buy you one.

225
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,200
It's alright.

226
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,250
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,490
It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry.

228
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,850
If I finish early, I'll come back to you.

229
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,670
I'm really sorry about this.

230
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,770
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

231
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,690
Good luck!

232
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,350
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:36,970
Bye-bye.

234
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,310
Bye-bye.

235
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,770
Su Yancheng.

236
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,150
What are you doing here?

237
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,350
Are you here by yourself?

238
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,310
Can't I enjoy myself alone?

239
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,300
Aren't you here alone too?

240
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,810
Who said I'm alone?

241
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,800
Sir, how do you score that last round?

[Arrow Game]

243
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,630
This one doesn't count.

244
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,510
You hit over here, it's considered off-target.

245
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,780
You need to hit your target.

246
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,400
It's alright, just stand aside and watch.

248
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,420
I want that biggest flying squirrel.

250
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,450
The young lady is really impressive.

251
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,210
Come here, young lady.

252
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,220
Thank you, sir.

253
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,650
Oh my!

254
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,790
I've lost money today.

255
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,810
This is Black's flying squirrel.

256
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,850
Don't you want it?

257
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,470
Of course, I want it.

258
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,920
But considering

259
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,190
how much you like Black,

260
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,980
I'll painfully part with it.

261
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm leaving.

262
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,810
You're out to have fun.

263
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,720
Why the long face?

264
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,710
I'm not. I'm quite happy.

265
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,880
Your lying skills are really mediocre.

266
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,040
Why do you have to care about whether I'm happy or not?

267
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,980
I can't control others.

268
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,250
But I have to look after the Vice President of the Comic Club.

269
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,920
Who?

270
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,210
You.

271
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,140
I've decided to promote you to Vice President of the Comic Club.

272
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,920
A gift for your inauguration.

273
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,700
Are you serious?

274
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,280
I've never thought about it.

275
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,460
The effort you've put into the Comic Club,

276
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,260
everyone can see it.

277
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,150
Black must have seen it too.

278
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,080
That's why he drew that picture to encourage you.

279
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,740
The Comic Club needs you.

280
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,410
Thank you, President.

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,310
But this is too sudden.

282
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,690
I'm not ready yet.

283
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,110
Can I think about it a bit more?

284
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,890
Until when?

285
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,200
Stop pretending. Just be happy about it.

286
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,730
It's starting.

287
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,980
As the Vice President,

288
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,690
you need to keep up with the President's pace.

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,780
I'm starting now.

290
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,820

Really not scared?

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,860
I said I'm not scared.

320
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,040
This.

321
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,370
Why do you have a mole on your hand?

322
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,300
Is it illegal to have a mole on my hand?

323
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,120
Black also has a mole on his hand.

324
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,560
How do you know that?

325
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you really his die-hard fan or not?

326
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,420
He posted on Weibo once

327
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,800
and there was a photo of a hand in the post.

328
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,110
There happened to be a mole on the hand.

329
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,180
It must be a coincidence.

330
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,780
It's normal to have a mole on your hand.

331
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,970
Let me take another look.

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,610

Do you often ride Ferris wheels?

336
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,770
My dad took me on it twice when I was little.

337
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,450
When you were a child, I suppose

338
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,160
your family often accompanied you, right?

339
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,070
They would play with me whenever they had time.

340
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,570
And my dad always praised me.

341
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,790
In his heart, no matter how I looked,

342
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,190
I was always the most beautiful.

343
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,320
Did you manage to borrow Black's manuscript?

344
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,930
If you didn't, it's okay.

345
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,010
We can find other promotional angles.

346
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,090
But I've already promised everyone.

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,750

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,610
Oh, I know.

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,970
If you're scared,

352
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,800
you can hold this.

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,720
I'll hold this big flying squirrel.

356
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,960
This way, our weights will be the same,

357
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,040
and it won't sway anymore.

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,010
Look behind.

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,540
Isn't that... How did they end up together?

360
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,450
I don't know.

I feel pretty bad about it.

Because the elderly lose a lot of calcium.
