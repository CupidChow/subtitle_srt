It's really fine. It's already scabbing over.

When

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
you were little,

38
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,460
you always liked to lock yourself in your room.

39
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,680
And you didn't like talking to people either.

40
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,560
I thought you'd never get into a fight in your life.

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,010
I told you I scraped it myself.

What do I do for a living?

43
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,790
I'm a surgeon.

44

about going abroad,

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,790
I've discussed it with your father.

49

Since you really don't want to go,

50

52
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,870
Actually, I've thought about this.

53
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,660
As parents,

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
should we communicate

55
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,490
with our child in a different way?

56
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,750
He also wants to be cared about

57
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,850
by his parents and friends.

58
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,340
Su Yancheng usually appears introverted

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,750
and doesn't talk much,

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,720
and can even look a bit cold sometimes,

61
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,460
but actually,

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
he lacks a sense of security.

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,909
I think Xiaoduo is someone

64
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,110

65

Don't let her slip away, okay?

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,430
Of course I won't.

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,300
From now on, your father and I

68
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,090
won't say "next time" to you anymore.

69
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,570
What if you break your promise?

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,230
Then...

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,480
we'll pay a fine of 100 yuan.

72

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,550
You see, Su is so handsome.

191
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,570
Our publishing house is even planning to change our promotional strategy.

192
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Alright, it's getting late.

193
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,020
Don't keep us any longer. Go.

194
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,350
Okay.

195
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,480
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

196
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,350
You two take care, okay?

197
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,730
Okay.

198
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,410
We're fine.

199
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,760
What's wrong, Ostrich?

200
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,680
I told Xiaomiao about my past.

201
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,250
It seems she's having a hard time accepting it.

202
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,560
It's alright.

203
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,510
Talk to her properly and communicate openly.

204
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,150
Be brave.

205
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,310
Be brave.

206
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,760
You're here.

207
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,910
We finally found you two.

208
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,160
Bro, you really are Black?

209
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,840
What kind of expression is that?

210
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,090
You're not, right?

211
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,950
We've been roommates for three years.

212
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,260
How could I not know?

213
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm so anxious.

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,160
Just tell us.

215
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,210
Just tell them.

216
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,800
Another day.

217
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,690
Another day?

218
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,270
Hey!

219
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,980
Let's go.

220
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,610
So annoying.

221
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,250
So, that's what happened.

222
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,390
So our president is actually the legendary Black.

223
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,700
I can't believe he's Black.

224
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,450
I should have realized it sooner.

225
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,020
Su Yancheng,

226
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:33,920
you...

227
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,620
are my idol.

228
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,030
President.

229
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,080
Black,

230
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,240
can I have your autograph?

231
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
-I want one too!
-I want one too!

232
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,670
I want one too, President.

233
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,010
President.

234
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,840
I came first. I should have your autograph first.

235
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,910
Don't touch me.

236
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
What are you all doing?

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,310
Can't you act a little more composed?

238
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,570
Look here.

239
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,260
What is he doing?

240
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,420
No wonder

241
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,480
Black's manuscripts

242
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,960
suddenly appeared in our comic club.

243
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,220
And the drawing on the blackboard.

244
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,730
It all makes sense now.

245
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,970
Isn't Bai Xiaoduo Black's assistant?

246
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,620
So she knew President is Black long ago.

247
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,870
-Yeah.
-That makes sense.

248
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,510
I need to confess something to you guys.

249
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,360
I've been lying to all of you.

250
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,470
Actually, I'm not Black's assistant.

251
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,520
What did Bai Xiaoduo say?

252
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
Not his assistant?

253
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,100
Didn't...

254
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,510
Black ask you here?

255
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,810
Then...

256
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,280
how did you get the manuscripts?

257
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,960
I...

258
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,620
found them in the trash.

259
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,250
She found the manuscripts in the trash?

260
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,280
So, you tricked us into joining the club

261
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,910
in the name of Black.

262
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,670
Bai Xiaoduo, how could you do that?

263
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,320
You've gone too far.

264
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,530
It's Bai Xiaoduo's fault that she lied.

265
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,450
But everything she did

266
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,400
was for the comic club.

267
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,740
Who bravely stood up when the boxing club

268
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,960
gave us trouble?

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
Who came up with the ideas for the comic expo

270
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,290
and helped the club win votes?

271
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,040
Who saved this comic club

272
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,040
that almost got disbanded?

273
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,620
So what if she lied?

274
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,240
Have you never lied before?

275
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:21,990
She's right.

276
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,530
Well said.

277
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,410
Bai Xiaoduo has done

278
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,720
so much for the comic club.

279
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,000
She is the hero of the comic club.

280
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,530
Does anyone have a problem with that?

281
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,870
I have let everyone down.

282
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,330
In the past,

283
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,650
I used lies to protect myself.

284
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,970
However,

285
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
I gradually realized

286
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,820
it was wrong.

287
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,240
It only brought temporary escape and more trouble.

288
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,860
Please...

289
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,020
Please give me another chance.

290
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,380
I hope, through my efforts,

291
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,940
I can regain everyone's trust.

292
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,310
Actually, I've always

293
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,500
wanted to thank Bai Xiaoduo.

294
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,980
While working on Season 3,

295
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,589
I hit a creative block

296
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,310
and even wanted to give up drawing comics.

297
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,490
She suddenly appeared,

298
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,110
pretending to be Black's assistant.

299
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,190
I also know it's not the right way,

300
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,750
but she did it for the good of the comic club.

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,010
During this time,

302
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,900
I believe everyone has seen all the effort

303
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,880
she's put into the comic club.

304
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,030
Bai Xiaoduo did it for the comic club.

305
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,800
So, as for whether Bai Xiaoduo can stay in the comic club,

306
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,340
I respect everyone's opinion.

307
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,660
I agree to let Xiaoduo stay.

308
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,950
I agree.

309
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,340
I agree too.

310
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,940
I agree too.

311
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,000
I also agree.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
I agree too.

313
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,080
I disagree,

314
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,260
unless...

315
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,300
Bai Xiaoduo.

316
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes.

317
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,010
Can you continue to dedicate yourself

318
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,080
to the comic club?

319
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:27,910
Yes.

320
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,860
Louder!

321
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,860
Yes!

322
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,240
This is for you.

323
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,720
Get lost.

324
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,060
Just kidding.

325
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,920
Junior.

326
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,030
Well done, Bai Xiaoduo.

327
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,250
Guys,

328
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,280
Black, Black.

329
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,220
Black.

330
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,630
This is great. We don't have to hide it anymore.

331
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,530
Thank you.

332
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,600
Let me know if you need my help.

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,690
I guess... I don't need any help.

334
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,600
I made an appointment with Yu Shubo. I should get going.

335
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,160
Just go.

336
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,160
Black.

337
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,590
I'm leaving.

338
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,910
Let's go, Xiaomiao.

339
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,170
Xiaomiao. Xiaomiao.

340
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,520
I want to talk to you about something.

341
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,930
I want to hear it too.

342
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,340
You can't.

343
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,910
Xiaomiao!

344
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,960
Xiaomiao!

345
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,620
Xiaomiao!

346
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,070
Xiaomiao! Xiaomiao!

347
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,130
Thank you for that just now.

348
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,540
Can I talk to you?

349
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,440
That is everything that has happened

350
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
to me since I was little.

351
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,840
That's why I developed

352
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,070
the bad habit of lying.

353
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,000
I know

354
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,920
it's not an excuse for lying.

355
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,420
Can you forgive me?

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,230
[In the Bloom of Youth]

357
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,670
It's indeed my fault.

358
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,820
I haven't been great at maintaining friendships.

359
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,220
You don't need to maintain them.

360

[As you wish]

361
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,340
Real friendships

362
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,930
happen naturally.

363

[As you wish][In the Bloom of Youth]

364
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
I remember I told you

365
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,990
no matter what happens,

366
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,330
I'll always be there as long as you need me.

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,240
Come on, have some beef jerky.

369
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,820
I'd better not. Or I'll gain weight.

370
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,290
I'll eat with you.

371
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,430
If we gain weight, we'll gain weight together.

372
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,940
Okay.

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920

It's really delicious.

Okay.

I have something to tell you.
