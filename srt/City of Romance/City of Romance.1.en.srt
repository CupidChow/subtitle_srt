I'll be on my way now, sorry.

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,950
Ah!

191
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,070
I've finally seen him!

192
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,110
I'm just interested in that orange.

193
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,370
What's wrong?

194
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,480
Did you submit your work and get rejected?

195
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,630
It's just a rejection.

196
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
It's not a big deal.

197
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,330
The great Blake once said,

198
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,680
"One must experience 41 failures

199
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,450
-before achieving success on the 42nd attempt."
-Before achieving success on the 42nd attempt.

201
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,300
You're a fan of Blake too?

202
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,580
No.

203
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,430
That's okay.

207
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,040

213
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,480
Nothing.

214

222
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,710
I actually have something to discuss with you this time.

224
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,360
has always been allocated to the comic club.

225
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,100
But they're going to disband.

226
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,430
The student council also really needs this sponsorship fee.

227
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,750
About the sponsorship fee,

228
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,930
I'll give it some serious thought.

He's probably been working on his research project lately.

270
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,880
He's likely spending a lot of time in the Psychology Lab.

271

Why should they sponsor your crappy comics?

380
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,800
Are your lousy comics worth anything?

381
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,810
You want to fight, huh?

382
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,720
Don't fight! Don't fight!

383
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,180

Yes, me again.

Who are you, anyway?

428
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,220
Because I'm Blake's assistant.

429
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,180
Because Blake sent me to help the Comic Club

430
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,130
through this difficult time!

431
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,880

This is his drawing.

438
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,090
Is it real?

439
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,500
Why don't you calm down a bit more?

Go.

Certainly, Professor.

485

I have a question

00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,000
I'd like to ask one of you.

487
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,310
As you all know,

488
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,100
Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes observation, 
listening, questioning, and pulse-taking.

489
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,190
So now, I'd like to ask this student—

490
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
during this valuable class time,

491
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,550
what did you see

492
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,610

Please share your thoughts with us.

494
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,040
I see that he...

495
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,260
he's sick.

496
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,510
What illness? Tell us about it.

497
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,140
This person has a flushed complexion.

498
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon states,

499
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,480
"The five grains are for nourishment, and the five fruits are for support."

500
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,740
This should be due to his excessive workload

501
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,400
and an unbalanced diet.

502
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,780
Moreover, he has a constitution of excessive yang and deficient yin,

503
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,220
which is why he appears robust,

504
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,740
but he actually lacks qi and blood internally.

505
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,290
It's half health-related,

506
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,970
and half psychological.

507
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,220
Do you have any treatment plans?

508
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,780
He should rest more and balance work and rest.

509
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,860
He can also practice Tai Chi when he's free

510
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,180
or do some square dancing and such.

565
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,240
She failed again. She's always dragging our class down.

566
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,940
Bad at studies and terrible at sports.

567
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,310
What can she possibly do?

568
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,000
If I were her,

569
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,770
I'd run ten laps on the field every day.

570
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,820
At least, I wouldn't drag down our class's PE scores.

577
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,580
It's because I was sick.

578
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,550
