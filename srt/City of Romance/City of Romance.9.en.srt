Bai Xiaoduo is nothing but a liar.

She wears a mask of being lively, cheerful, and free-spirited,

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,009
but deep down, she's just a two-faced bitch.

7
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,210
She flirts with both guys.

8
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,750
She uses her body

Bai Xiaoduo's photo, aren't you?

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,780
What photo? I don't know anything about that.

19
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,730
The school has retrieved the surveillance footage.

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,050
There's no point in denying it.

21
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,890
So what if we took it?

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,750
It's just posting a photo. What's the big deal?

23

What you're doing is spreading rumors.

Bai Xiaoduo deceived Senior Yu and Su Yancheng.

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,930
She is the biggest rumor of all.

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,950
Exactly, we're just revealing the truth.

Just wait for the school to deal with you.

No need to worry about what others think.

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,180
After all, no one can make everyone like them.

32

It's not even half as good as the ones I've taken.

37

Bai, are you okay?

38
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,730
I'm fine.

39

But these two may not.

46

49
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,520
That's right.

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,910
Even seeing with your own eyes doesn't necessarily mean it's the truth.

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,660
You could have asked the people involved directly for clarification

52
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,780
instead of making your own assumptions.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,410
Or I could directly find Senior Su

54

and Senior Yu to come over

55
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,240

Well, as the new Vice President,

94

Today, I have two things to tell everyone.

113
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,000
As you all know,

114
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,450
our comic club has been through ups and downs.

115
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,060
But there's a person

116
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,800
whose love and dedication for comics

117
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,700
have brought everyone together again.

118
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,310
So this person will become the Vice President of our club.

119
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,480
This person is...

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,980
Su, didn't I tell you?

121
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
I don't want to be the vice president.

122
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,430
I don't like this kind of life.

123
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,790
This person is...

124
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Bai Xiaoduo.

125
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,070
That's me.

127
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,130
Good.

128
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,190
Another thing is,

129
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,700
everyone, you're doing well in preparation for the convention,

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,240
but there's been a slight change in the rules this time.

131
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,710
Both the audience and the judges will be voting.

132
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,610
The prize money will only go to the first-place winner.

133
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,240
Does anyone have any new ideas?

134
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,710
I can go hand out flyers

135
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,400
to get everyone to come vote for us.

136
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,170
I can be a comic commentator.

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,090
After all, I know comics like the back of my hand.

138
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,910
One vote for half an hour of chat.

139
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,590
Then I'd like to wear Hanfu and draw portraits for everyone.

140
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,280
I agree.

141
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Anything else?

142
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,150
This painting on the wall

143
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,090
is Blake's unreleased work.

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,570
We can take a picture of it and make it into a puzzle.

145
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,270
Then we can host a puzzle contest,

146
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,350
and the winner will get Blake's manuscript.

147
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,390
I want it too.

148
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,510
That's a good idea.

149
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,950
Then the requirement for joining the challenge

150
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,300
is to vote for our comic club.

151
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,560

There are surveillance cameras here!

372
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,330
He's gone. Don't be afraid.

373
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,650
Xiaoduo, are you okay?

374
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,170
How about I stay and keep you company for a while?

375
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,900
No need.

376
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,990
I'm fine.

377
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,870
I want to be alone for a while.

378
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,620
He Rui.

379
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,770
Where's Bai Xiaoduo?

380
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,130
Xiaoduo said she wanted to be alone for a while.

381
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,610
I'm going out for a bit.

382
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,790
Please watch over things here for me.

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,400
Are you alright?

384
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,490
I'm fine.

385
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,040
Let's have a drink together.

386
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,800
You've been distracted all day.

387
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,720
Did something happen?

388
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,890
No, there isn't.

389
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,340
What could have happened?

390
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,100
Bai Xiaoduo.

391
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,170
I study psychology.

392
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,060
Compulsive lying is a disorder.

393
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,660
Su Yancheng.

394
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,890
If I've been keeping secrets from you,

395
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,490
would you still be friends with me?

396
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,320
You're always lying;

397
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,120
hardly a word of truth comes out of your mouth.

398
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,210
But after getting to know you,

399
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,670
I know that some of your lies

400
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,250
aren't malicious.

401
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,150
Sometimes, lying

402
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,940
is just to protect yourself.

403
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,340
Friendship is built on mutual trust.

404
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,830
It's okay if you don't want to talk about it now.

405
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,910
I hope you can find

406
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,240
someone you can confide your secrets in.

407
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,290
Owl.

408
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,630
Your drawing...

409
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,720
is nowhere near as good as Blake's.

410
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,250
Your painting skills still need some improvement.

411
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,640
I'll work hard to improve.

412
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,030
But still, thank you.

413
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll treasure this.

414
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,940
You're welcome.
