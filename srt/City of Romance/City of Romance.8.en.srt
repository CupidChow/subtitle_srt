122
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,350

After all, the third season hasn't been released yet.

124
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
There's not much point in promoting it.

125
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,490
I figured as much.

126
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,510

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,320
I understand what you mean,

129
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,990
but I'm afraid it's not possible this time.

130
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,990
Because the copyright for all your current manuscripts

131
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,380
belongs to our publishing house.

132
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,870
Let's not mention the one on the school wall before,

133
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,200
since it wasn't for profit.

134
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,660
But if it appears at the exchange conference,

135
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,370
it will have some commercial value.

136
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
The whole process would be quite complicated

137
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,840
