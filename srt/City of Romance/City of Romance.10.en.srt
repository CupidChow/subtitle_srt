I'm just a bit confused right now.

Why did you throw away that draft?

214
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,760
Why was it claimed to be a fake drawing in the folder?

215

That wasn't drawn by human hands.

It's AI-generated artwork.

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,310
I believe an author

224
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,570
should treat their work

225
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,550

but it can never capture the soul of true art.

Why is there a mole on your hand?

561
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,120
[I hope today can become a beautiful memory for you]

562
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,610
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

563
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,990
I, I was a bit carried away just now.

564
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

565
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,410
Thank you.

566
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,590
I saw him! I saw him!

567
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,170
Everyone, I saw him!

568
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,170
What now?

569
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,320
Calm down first.

570
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,350
Who did you see?

571
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,560
Xiaomiao,

572
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,490
I saw Black.

573
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,470
I saw Black in person.

574
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,160
Is it really worth getting this excited?

575
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
We've all seen him already.

576
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,160
It's different.

577
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,880
So you saw what he looks like?

578
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,970
No, I didn't.

579
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,680
But...

580
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,850
I'll tell you the details later.

581
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,460
I'm just so happy.

582
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:22,800
You're back.

583
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,150
Where were you all afternoon?

584
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,530
Get to work quickly.

585
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,800
I'll tell you later.

586
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,880
We'll talk in a bit. Let's pack up first.

587
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm so excited.

588
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,080
Let me tell you.

589
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,460
When I saw him today...

590
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
Give me that.

591
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,060
Xiaomiao!

592
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,850
Put that box down.

593
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:00,760
Let me do it.

594
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,800
You simp!

595
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
Y-You'd rather be a, be a simp

596
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,600
than h-help us.

597
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,500
Wow.

598
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,690
Uh.

599
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,320
No one's helping me carry the box.

600
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,840
So we're the only single ones here.

601
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,100
Everyone else is beyond us in the romance department, right?

602
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,270
You're a darn single man.

603
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,060
Why did you do that?

604
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,040
Hit me again?

605
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:38,950
You want to hit me?

606
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,850
Why are you two getting into a fight?

607
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,820
Let go of me!

608
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,360
Let go!

609
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,220
Let go of me!
