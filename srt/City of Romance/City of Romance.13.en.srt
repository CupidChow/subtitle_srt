188
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,920
I'll buy you breakfast for a month. Please.

189
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,280
Wash my socks for a month, too.

190
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,850
Deal.

191
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,230
He's right. I think it's fair in this way.

192
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,160
Let's go.

193
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,170
Let's go, let's go.

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,120
Let's go.

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,010
Yu Shubo.

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,280
Come here and check the top of this shelf to see

197
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
whether there are some clues.

198
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,240
I can't reach it.

199
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,190
Let me take a look.

200
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,020
Are you alright?

201
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,400
I might have gotten hurt.

202
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,590
But fortunately, you saved me.

203
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,620
Come on. Let's read it.

204
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,630
A child tugged at my clothes and asked me

205
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,840
why I was back home so late.

206
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,980
With whom did I compete for time? In the end, I only won these gray hairs.

207
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,000
Recorded on my child's death anniversary.

208
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,090
This is Du Mu's poem "Returning Home."

209
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,670
It's about a child longing for his father to come home.

210
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,720
But his father had to work

211
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,420
away from home to make a living.

212
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,410
There's a box here.

213
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,600
It has a lock on it.

214
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,870
I think the death anniversary date might be the password.

215
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,180
What's the date of the child's death anniversary?

216
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,210
It's not written here.

217
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,750
There should be more clues. Let's keep looking.

218
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,630
There seems to be something inside that bed.

219
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,650
I'll go check it out.

220
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,820
I think this is the master's diary.

221
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,080
But in his diary,

222
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,350
he only wrote about things like whom he did business with

223
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,130
in the morning and what he ate in the afternoon.

224
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,080
There's no mention of the death anniversary, either.

225
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,420
The last page is dated Gengchen Day, Wushen Month, Dingmao Year.

226
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,030
[Holograph]

227
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,150
August 14, 1927.

228
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,310
How did you figure that out?

229
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,370
[Holograph]

230
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,360
That's not right.

231
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,700
Then let's try August 15.

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,460
Perhaps after this young master died,

233
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,950
his father didn't have the mood to keep a diary anymore.

234
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,810
That makes sense.

235
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,460
Eight-one-five.

236
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,170
It's open.

237
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,180
You're impressive.

238
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,480
You're really something.

239
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,890
What information did you find?

240
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,390
A longevity lock.

241
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,460
Senior,

242
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,760
shall we go inside and take a look?

243
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,900
Yes.

244
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,330
Really?

245
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,840
I've told you that I'm very bold.

246
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,070
I'll go.

247
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,460
It's alright, it's alright.

248
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,670
This is just a fake spider.

249
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,940
It's fake.

250
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,750
It's fake.

251
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,870
It's alright.

252
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,620
There's a box here.

253
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,620
But...

254
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,700
I can't open it.

255
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
It seems that we need a key.

256
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,890
Shall we look for the key?

257
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,720
Okay.

258
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,300
There's nothing inside.

259
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,090
Chopper, help me hold the light.

260
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,290
[Dad]

261
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,180
I got it.

262
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,900
It's to put them together to constitute the characters.

263
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,150
[Dad]

264
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,940
Dad, Mom.

265
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,610
[Dad] [Not]

266
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,050
[Dad] [Not] [Me]

267
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,860
Love

268
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,210
me

269
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,360
or not?

270
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,690
So you found it?

271
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,450
Can we be together because of love?

272
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,350
It's alright, it's alright.

273
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,110
It's fake.

274
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,260
It's alright.

275
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,300
It's alright.

276
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,450
We've looked into it.

277
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,950
This family seemed quite happy.

278
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,520
So why did something like that happen?

279
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,850
The master of this family didn't seem to

280
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,390
indulge in debauchery outside, either.

281
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,830
His wife

282
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,340
just went out to play mahjong frequently.

283
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,790
Moreover,

284
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,150
we found a wind chime with a riddle

285
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,550
in one of the rooms.

286
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,340
It says, "Do Dad and Mom love me or not?"

287
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,260
It looks like

288
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,680
the members of this family didn't get along very well.

289
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,480
I think

290
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,560
their young master might have been killed in a crime of passion.

291
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,180
How was that possible?

292
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,120
Their family genealogy clearly states that

293
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,900
the young master passed away at the age of only seven.

294
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,690
Is that so?

295
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,520
Yes.

296
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,210
Well, then...

297
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,510
Don't you think

298
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,810
it's a bit strange that

299
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,030
this cabinet is here?

300
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,400
No, I don't think so.

301
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,550
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry.

302
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,450
I'm sorry, kid.

303
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,440
I didn't mean to disturb you.

304
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,640
I... I... I... I...

305
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,480
Senior.

306
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,110
I... I... I...

307
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,050
Are you alright, Senior?

308
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm fine.

309
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,200
Senior.

310
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,080
I... I... I... I'm very bold.

311
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,040
You... You...

312
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,180
Hurry up!

313
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,020
Hurry up! Hurry up!

314
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,440
Let's close the door!

315
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,470
Don't be afraid.

316
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,560
Hurry up.

317
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,280
Come inside now!

318
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,600
Hurry up, hurry up!

319
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,760
Or you'll be caught later.

320
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,800
Chopper?

321
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,340
Gosh! What a coincidence to run into you in such a big secret chamber.

322
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,510
Are you okay?

323
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,130
I'm fine.

324
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,440
Shall we go check on the others?

325
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,470
We're not familiar with the map of this ancient mansion.

326
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,700
Let's stay here and look for clues first.

327
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,510
I'm exhausted.

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,030
Oh, my God!

329
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,350
This is definitely a homicide.

330
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,120
Definitely!

331
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,830
Come out!

332
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,340
Come out!

333
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,590
This is my room!

334
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,300
Come out!

335
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,000
Since you guys are not coming out,

336
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,800
then never come out!

337
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,990
What is he shouting?

338
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,510
He's telling us not to go out.

339
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,220
Su Yancheng.

340
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,050
Is this stuff shaking?

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,580
It's okay. It's just a mechanism.

342
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,640
This is definitely a homicide.

343
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,600
What do you think?

344
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,750
Senior.

345
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,970
Senior.

346
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,880
Senior Xiao Yang.

347
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,360
Senior. Senior Xiao Yang.

348
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,280
Oh, no.

349
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,820
Is he so scared that he's stupefied?

350
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,350
Senior, wake up!

351
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,630
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

352
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,600
Senior!

353
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,330
Senior! Senior!

354
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,360
You...

355
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,410
Xiaomiao.

356
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,430
Actually, I...

357
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,270
I'm very bold.

358
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,240
No one is ahead, right?

359
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,100
It's quite scary.

360
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,440
Oh. my God.

361
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,320
This must be the secret chamber the butler mentioned.

362
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,130
It's locked.

363
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,830
I closed it.

364
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,720
I can't believe you.

365
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,560
There must be another exit.

366
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,410
Let's look for it.

367
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,140
Okay.

368
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,710
There are pictures here.

369
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,240
Su Yancheng.

370
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,840
Look.

371
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,330
Let's go and examine them.

372
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,940
A little boy.

373
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,720
A family portrait.

374
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,990
A birthday cake.

375
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,250
The little boy seems quite pitiful.

376
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,740
He celebrated his birthday alone.

377
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,060
But what does this have to do with this case?

378
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,470
Su Yancheng.

379
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,850
Su Yancheng.

380
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,230
Su Yancheng.

381
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,070
What's wrong with you?

382
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm thinking whether 0711

383
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,570
is some kind of password.

384
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,950
Password.

385
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,430
It's possible.

386
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,960
There's a door over there. Let's go check it out.

387
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,390
This is not right. It seems we need a key for it.

388
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,270
Hold this for me.

389
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,470
It's that easy.

390
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,800
Let's go.

391
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,360
I knew it.

392
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,580
My Lady, are you here?

393
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,690
I'll go.

394
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,730
My Lady, please open the door.

395
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,790
I think the door should be opened by a female player.

396
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,590
Then...

397
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,780
Then what should we do?

398
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,570
It's okay. I'll go.

399
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,840
[IOU]

400
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,370
[3rd, Lunar April, 1929]

401
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,470
[IOU]

402
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,390
I didn't expect that though the Jia Family

403
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,300
seemed so wealthy,

404
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,620
they would have quite many external debts.

405
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,670
Let me take a look.

406
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,940
With your leg like that,

407
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,140
why don't you rest for a while?

408
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,560
You even dare to eat the fruits here?

409
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,340
Let's just fill our stomachs first.

410
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,400
Are you injured?

411
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,170
No, I'm not.

412
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,940
Why... Why are you touching me?

413
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,980
I'm not touching you.

414
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,090
I'm eating a tangerine. It's quite sweet.

415
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,700
What's wrong?
