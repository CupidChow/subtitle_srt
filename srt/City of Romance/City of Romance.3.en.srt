00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,650
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,940
If this event goes well,

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,630
you'll be promoted from vice chairman to chairman, right?

5
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,310
Thank you, Sister.

6
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,500
No matter what,

7
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,470
this sponsorship is really important to me.

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,680
Don't flatter yourself.

9
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,020
We're not giving you the money because of you.

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,410
It's because your networking event is indeed

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,200
better than the comic club's proposal.

12
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,259
Oh, right.

13
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,490
Don't forget to include

14
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,250
our publishing house's logo among the sponsors.

15
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,390
The bigger, the better.

16
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,380
Right,

17
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,470
I prepared a gift for you.

18
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,930
A gift?

19
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,410
Let me ask you.

20
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,400
Did you prepare a gift only for me?

21
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,410
Or do the others have one too?

22
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,190
Actually...

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,610
Aunt,

24
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,900
Second Cousin,

25
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,520
and Third Sister all have one.

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,670
The gifts are exactly the same.

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,560
I knew it.

28
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,010
Yu Shubo,

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,430
you really are nice to everyone.

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,930
Sister.

31
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,490
There must be

32
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,650
quite a few girls at your school who like you, right?

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,980
So,

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,170
any sparks with anyone?

35
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,450
You can start by getting to know each other.

36
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,320
I...

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,220
don't want to focus on that right now.

38
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,080
Alright, I'm leaving.

39
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,090
There's still a lot to do at the club. I should get going.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,220
I'll take the gift with me.

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,280
Listen, if you like a girl,

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,020
you should prepare a gift just for her, got it?

43
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,910
Got it.

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,329
I'm off.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Chief Editor Yu...

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,660
Senior Yu,

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,060
are you busy?

48
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,340
No.

49
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,440
Is there anything I can help with?

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,500
Nothing. Have a seat.

51
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,250
Senior Yu,

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,750
yesterday, I said

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,010
I'm Blake's assistant.

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,970
Are you angry?

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,770
No. You said that to solve the problem.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
Thank you for your understanding.

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,300
By the way, I'd like to ask you something.

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,690
How do you think we can save the comic club?

59
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Get enough members

60
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,970
and work hard on innovation.

61
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,150
Do we have any event coming up?

62
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,610
Yes.

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,150
Look at these.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,840
They are all for the networking event.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,600
And that one too.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,370
The networking event?

67
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,000
The networking event.

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,550
Thank you, Senior.

69
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,780
Thank you, Senior.

70
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,480
I'm leaving.

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,850
Goodbye, Senior.

72
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,659
Goodbye.

73
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,000
Guys!

74
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,330
Wake up!

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,850
I just went to Senior Yu.

76
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,390
He's also worried about the comic club's disbandment.

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,600
Impossible. That guy is up to no good.

78
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,630
Senior Xiao, you've misunderstood him.

79
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,830
He's a good guy.

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,130
Junior Bai.

81
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,240
Don't you know Blake?

82
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,980
In my opinion,

83
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,330
you should go bring Blake here now.

84
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,530
It's the best way.

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
Well, he...

86
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,040
is busy with the third season.

87
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,610
I guess it won't work.

88
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,320
But considering the current situation

89
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,470
of the comic club,

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
we won't be able to recruit any new members.

91
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,100
It's okay.

92
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,270
I just saw the poster for the networking event.

93
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,250
I guess there will be a lot of people there.

94
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,060
We can give it a try at the networking event.

95
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,330
Your plan is...

96
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,670
Considering our looks,

97
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,080
I think our best strategy is

98
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,430
to attract attention.

99
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,659
Sounds good.

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,730
It's quite difficult.

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,580
Yes.

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,230
If we can't do it,

103
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,770
Junior Bai can't do it either.

104
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,690
Senior, what you said has made me less confident.

105
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,520
It's alright. You are what you wear.

106
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,380
If we dress up,

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
we'll look great too.

108
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,860
I have faith in you.

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,690
And you can find yourself a boyfriend by the way.

110
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,290
Seriously?

111
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,110
The club's survival is what matters most right now.

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,150
Senior.

113
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,070
Come here.

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,640
Come here.

115
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,980
Listen.

116
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,510
Xiaomiao will be there too.

117
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,670
She'll be there too?

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,300
Then...

119
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,640
Well... we should go then.

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah.

121
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,470
President, will you go?

122
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,330
No.

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,930
Why is he so unsociable?

124
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,280
Go with us.

125
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,190
Go have some fun.

126
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,300
Go with us.

127
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,060
Go with us.

128
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,980
Go with us.

129
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,440
Come on.

130
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,580
Go with us.

131
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,330
Go with us.

132
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,990
Junior Bai.

133
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,580
-Go with us.
-Go with us.

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,460
Fine.

135
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,210
-Go with us.
-Go with us.

136
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,810
-Go with us.
-Go with us.

137
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,400
[Library]

138
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,400
President,

139
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,940
why didn't you go with them to buy clothes?

140
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,580
Too much hassle.

141
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,350
Honestly, I think you should

142
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,650
participate in these group activities

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,810
sometimes.

144
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,150
Although it's a networking event,

145
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,250
there will be many people there.

146
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,690
Maybe our comic club can be saved, right?

147
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,150
Wouldn't that be great?

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,870
Senior, are you out for a night run?

149
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,290
What a coincidence.

150
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,670
You are...

151
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,190
We just finished a meeting

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,200
and are about to head back.

153
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,940
Let's go back together.

154
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,460
Okay.

155
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,590
Right, Su Yancheng,

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,740
I heard the comic club is having some trouble.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,970
I happen to be close to some people in the student council.

158
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,950
Feel free to ask me if you need help.

159
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,530
No need for that.

160
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,580
Things are pretty much resolved.

161
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,090
Well, last time you said humans have both biological

162
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,030
and social aspects.

163
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,180
I've been thinking about it but still can't fully understand.

164
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,700
I'd like to ask you more about it.

165
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,540
The core idea is

166
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,180
we shouldn't just understand patients' physiology.

167
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,480
We should also understand their psychology.

168
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,750
When patients learn about their illness, it's natural for them to feel anxious.

169
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,960
I actually have a few more questions.

170
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,470
Why don't we go to the library tomorrow?

171
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,410
I have something to do tomorrow.

172
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,419
Senior.

173
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,549
Let's go buy clothes tomorrow.

174
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,039
Xiaomiao wants to go too.

175
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,860
Let's go together.

176
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,289
Okay.

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,910
You should have gone with Xiao Yang and the others earlier.

178
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,610
They went to buy men's clothes.

179
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,500
It's okay, I trust your taste. Let's go.

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,180
I'll run back with you.

181
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
What a hassle.

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm walking out of sync.

183
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,980
Have you decided what to wear?

184
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,710
Not yet.

185
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,280
Let's all take a look later.

186
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,170
Welcome.

187
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
Hello.

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,570
Xiaoduo.

189
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,390
I'll go take a look over there.

190
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,740
Okay.

191
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,970
This is our new arrival for the season.

192
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,320
If you like it, you can try it on.

193
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,670
Xiaomiao. Maybe let's not try it on for now.

194
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,540
What's wrong?

195
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,080
Nothing, I just don't feel like trying it on.

196
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,110
Let's have a look around.

197
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay.

198
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,210
Thank you.

199
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,500
Is this one beautiful?

200
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,150
This one is beautiful too.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,360
Won't you feel hot if you wear it on that day?

202
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,070
Take a look at other clothes then.

203
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,560
Okay.

204
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,420

205

Come on, let's go take a look.

206
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,720

207
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,020

Do I look good?

210
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,410
Yes.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300

246

259
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,210
vibrates based on your heartbeat frequency.

260
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,900
It can help you find your destined match.

Don't lie to me.

380
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,320
I... I'm not a liar.

381
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,570
I'm not...

382
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,100
Hi, join the comic club.

383
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,280
Please, please.

384
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,850
This thing isn't for me. Sorry.

385
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,790
Thank you.

386
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,640
Senior Yu.

387
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,820
I saw you chatting happily.

388
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,780
Did you have a great chat?

389
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
I had a great chat with everyone.

390
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,690
Everyone?

391
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,150
I'm just...

392
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,260
here to make up the numbers

393
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,270
for the student council.

394
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,360
They can't do without you.

395
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,340
You performed exceptionally well on stage just now.

396
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,420
I prepared all night.

397
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,420
I even had notes written on my hand,

398
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,160
but then I washed them off.

399
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,120
You did a great job.

400
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,530
It was super smooth. Impressive.

401
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,750
So,

402
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,130
have you met anyone you like?

403
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,770
What happened to your arm?

404
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,230
Well... nothing.

405
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
My arm is numb.

406
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,560
Numb arm? I'm good at that. Come on.

407
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,240
No, no.

408
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,710
It's okay, trust me. It's a family remedy.

409
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,440
Let me fix it for you.

410
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,970
No need!

411
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
I...

412
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,020
I need to go to the toilet.

413
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,440
I'll come back to you later.

414
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,120
Okay.

415
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,400
Do you have... have tissues?

416
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,920
I don't need them.

417
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,440
I don't need tissues.

418
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,450
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

419
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,640
Are you interested in joining the comic club?

420
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,240
Yes.

421
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,680
Yes? That's wonderful.

422
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,680
Su Yancheng,

423
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,270
why did you come to the networking event too?

424
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,370
I thought you weren't very interested in it.

425
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,030
It's... just a club activity.

426
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,130
Can I add you on WeChat?

427
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,790
I'm sorry. I didn't bring my smartphone.

428
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,320
Why don't you join our club's group chat?

429
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,200
Don't be shy.

430
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,120
We can keep in touch in the group.

431
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,240
It's just adding each other on WeChat

432
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,680
to make friends, right?

433
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,160
I've been paying attention to you for a while.

434
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,050
Really.

435
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,430
I just want to

436
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,040
add you on WeChat and get to know you.

437
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,440
Time's up.

438
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,960
Thank you.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,550
Fine.

440
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,930
Let's go.

441
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,300
Let's go take a look over there.

442
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,170
Where are we going?

443
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,780
We're pretty much done here.

444
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,160
Let's go over there and see if we can recruit more members.

445
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,730
Sit down.

446
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,720
Okay, let's chat then.

447
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,070
What should we chat about?

448
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,380
Let me ask you.

449
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,240
Have you met anyone you like?

450
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,310
Look at you. I doubt you have.

451
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,630
Let me teach you. Listen.

452
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,670
If you meet someone you like,

453
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,680
you can talk to her about hobbies

454
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,400
or what type of boy she likes,

455
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,250
or things like that.

456
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
That way, you'll have something to talk about.

457
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,440
Come on.

458
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,960
Let me show you.

459
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,600
You ask me.

460
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,130
About what?

461
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,120
My hobby.

462
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,230
What's your hobby?

463
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,720
I like reading comics.

464
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,320
What type of boy do you like?

465
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
The type like Blake.

466
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,220
Xiaomiao, what are you looking at? You look so happy.

467
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,100
I suddenly think they're quite a match.

468
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,010
One always chatters,

469
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
the other always remains silent.

470
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,120
They do make a good match.

471
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,790
Xiaomiao.

472
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,110
I think you and I...

473
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,430
and our club also make a good match.

474
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
I invite you to join our comic club.

475
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,750
I'll... think about it.

476
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,320
Senior, your... your wristband...

477
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Nothing, Xiaomiao.

478
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,200
Next, we're going to have

479
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,900
a three-legged race.

480
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,060
You'll work in pairs.

481
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,460
Your teammate will be decided by drawing lots.

482
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,690
Have you thought about our strategy?

483
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,130
You're so eager to win.

484
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,990
You don't look like you're very athletic.

485
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,160
I once ran six kilometers

486
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,060
for Blake's autograph session.

487
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm not athletic?

488
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,680
How did I end up with you?

489
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,530
I'm not complaining about you, yet you're complaining about me.

490
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,010
Come on.

491
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,030
Later,

492
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,870
when I say "left," we step with our left foot.

493
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,010
Let's try it first.

494
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,960
One, two, three, left.

495
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,840
Well, step.

496
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,280
Let's try again.

497
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,150
One, two, three, left.

498
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,860
I stepped. I really did.

499
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,710
It's due to your own poor balance.

500
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,380
You're blaming me?

501
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,200
Ready.

502
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,700
Three, two, one!

503
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,600
-Come on!
-Come on!

504
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,080
Having no rapport is also a kind of rapport.

505
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,200
You walk.

506
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,760
-Come on!
-Come on!

507
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,970
[The most beautiful in the world]

508
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,790
-Come on!
-Come on!

509
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,840
-Come on!
-Come on!

510
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,100
[The most beautiful in the world]

511
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,880
Come on!

512
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,080
Watch out!

513
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,840
Where am I?

514
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,030
I'm in the hospital.

515
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,610
What happened to my hands?

516
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,400
Doctors won't bandage them like this.

517
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,300
Is anyone here?

518
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,660
Is anyone here?

519
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,600
Is anyone here?

520
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,200
Oh my goodness!

521
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,800
There really is someone here!

522
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
Why are you shouting so late at night?

523
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,550
Why are you here too?

524
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,910
You scared me.

525
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,290
Have you forgotten what you did?

526
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm sorry.

527
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,210
It's okay.

528
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,690
I'll get some ointment from my hometown later.

529
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,560
You'll recover soon.

530
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,940
Thank you.
