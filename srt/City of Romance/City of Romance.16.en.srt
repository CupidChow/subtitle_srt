Look.

208
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,840
There are so many stars today.

209
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,470
It seems Man City

210
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,020
rarely has visible stars.

211
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,870
Are you homesick?

212
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,350
My hometown,

213
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
is a small city,

214
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,580
not as prosperous as Man City,

215
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,690
but

216
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,670
you can see a sky full of stars every night.

217
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,000
Sometimes they're even brighter than the streetlights.

218
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,460
I'll definitely take you to see it when I have the chance.

219
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,680
Okay.

220
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,010
Look.

221
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,960
Can you see it?

222
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,430
That's Sirius.

223
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,860
It's my favorite star.

224
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,870
Why?

225
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,530
Because

226
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,390
it's the brightest star,

227
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,790
and its position is fixed.

228
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,319
Even if

229
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,109
it's raining or cloudy,

230
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,030
and I can't see it,

231
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,650
I know

232
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,770
it's always there.

233
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,900
It has accompanied me through many, many

234
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,970
difficult nights.

235
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,040
Then from now on, I'll be called Sirius.

236
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,360
Alright, Sirius Su.

237
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,890
However,

238
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,320
you're just Sirius Number Two.

239
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
Who's Sirius Number One?

240
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,990
Black.

241
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,100
You like Black that much?

242
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Of course.

243
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,390
You know, someone like me

244
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,330
is like a tiny planet

245
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,590
in the vast Milky Way,

246
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,220
who couldn't shine

247
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,320
and might even

248
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,950
remain unnoticed for a lifetime.

249
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,210
Black is like my star.

250
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,480
I reflect his light.

251
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,930
Because of him,

252
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,510
I found a reason to shine.

253
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,540
I like you.

254
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,450
I like you.

255
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,740
Does this scene feel familiar?

256
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,290
Dear Miss Flying Squirrel,

257
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,550
I am Black.

258
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,220
My Sirius Number One

259
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,580
and Sirius Number Two

260
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,720
have finally merged.

261
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,390
Let's listen to a song.

262
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,220
It suits the current starry sky better.

263
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,300
What does that look like to you?

264
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,510
Like what?

265
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,760
Like a dog.

266
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,980
It really does.

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,820
Xiao Yang.

268
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,960
In this cold winter weather,

269
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,780
[Switch to voice call] [Hang up] [Flip the camera]

270
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,490
aren't you cold wearing just a tank top?

271
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,770
Are you kidding me?

272
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,630
I'm a grown man, how could I be afraid of the cold?

273
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,030
It's so late at night,

274
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,460
and Bai hasn't come back yet.

275
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,820
I'm a bit worried about her.

276
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,660
She's all grown up now.

277
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,170
Why are you worrying for nothing? Just relax.

278
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,020
But...

279
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,840
Xiao Yang, Xiao Yang.

280
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:45,310
[Switch to voice call] [Hang up] [Flip the camera]

281
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,400
What are you doing?

282
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,940
I'm drawing.

283
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,860
Look, I drew you.

284
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm trying to talk about something serious here.

285
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,740
Isn't it a good drawing?

286
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,160
They're both adults now.

287
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,100
They know their limits.

288
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,170
They're not kids anymore.

289
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,300
Just relax, will you?

290
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
You mean...

291
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,210
Senior Su hasn't come back either?

292
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,830
[Switch to voice call] [Hang up] [Flip the camera]

293
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,520
Hey.

294
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:02,920
Xiaomiao.

295
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,600
Senior He Rui.

296
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,330
How can I not worry?

297
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,570
If Senior Su took Bai home,

298
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,830
who knows what might happen?

299
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,730
That's impossible.

300
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,900
I'll stake my comic drawing talent on it.

301
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,130
My buddy is definitely not that kind of person.

302
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,300
Wow.

303
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,820
Your house is so beautiful.

304
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,360
Take a picture of me, quick!

305
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,670
I'll go down, wait a moment.

306
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,720
Your house even has its own elevator.

307
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,630
This fish tank is so big, you could keep a whale in it.

308
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,680
Where are you?

309
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,190
Did you take it? Did you take the picture?

310
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,410
Are you done?

311
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,460
I like the black one the most.

312
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,400
The black one?

313
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,510
It looks quite like you.

314
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,880
Alright.

315
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,070
I want to show you something.

316
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,660
What for?

317
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,670
Come up.

318
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,920
Coming.

319
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,680
What? So mysterious.

320
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,390
I see so many familiar friends.

321
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,110
I'm suddenly feeling a bit moved.

322
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,740
But I feel like something's missing.

323
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,590
What's missing?

324
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,210
Black.

325
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,560
White.

326
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,770
Gray.

327
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,150
It's lacking some color.

328
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,400
I've never been very sensitive to colors since I was young.

329
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,150
This is also a weakness I made.

330
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,720
Wow.

331
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,070
Please, have a seat.

332
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,720
Today's story is about

333
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,810
the tale of Miss Flying Squirrel and Mr. Owl.

334
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,230
Mr. Owl, Mr. Owl.

335
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,270
May I ask, what color is winter?

336
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,220
Of course, it's snow white.

337
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,900
Winter has passed.

338
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,290
The snow has melted,

339
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,850
revealing lush green grass.

340
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,370
Everything is sprouting.

341
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,470
There are even a couple of

342
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,580
pink and white plum blossoms that haven't withered yet.

343
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,500
The pine trees remain a deep green.

344
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,500
The flying squirrel is eating pine cones.

345
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,140
Miss Flying Squirrel gazes into Mr. Owl's eyes.

346
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,030
They are a pair of brown eyes,

347
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,340
reflecting a cute little flying squirrel.

348
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,860
The little flying squirrel is wearing

349
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,920
a blue scarf.

350
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,410
How is it?

351
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,630
Have you found the feeling?

352
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,400
From now on, all of us in the Comic Club

353
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,730
will be your colorists.

354
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,290
Thank you,

355
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,390
my colorist.

356
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,490
What's this?

357
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,420
I thought...

358
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,410
What did you think?

359
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,980
You tell me.
