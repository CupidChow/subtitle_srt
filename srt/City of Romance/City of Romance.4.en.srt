3
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,759
Look at how I bandaged Xiaoduo.

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,170
Does it look like Doraemon?

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,890
I actually have a talent for bandaging wounds.

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
Stop joking around.

7
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,539
The light ball suddenly fell down at that time.

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,680
If Senior Su hadn't helped Bai cushion the fall,

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,130
I don't know what would have happened.

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,940
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

11
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,490
Why didn't I think of that?

12
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,910
Su Yancheng's strategy of playing the hero is truly ingenious.

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,520
I said Su Yancheng is truly brave.

14
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,120
I should learn more from him.

15

They injured their legs and arms.

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,540
Maybe it's better not to learn from him.

17
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,340
Are you worried about me?

18
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,660

20

You should go back and rest too.

26
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,530
Su Yancheng is a fool.

27

Su Yancheng is a pig.

29
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,630
I need to pay the material fee at school.

30

Transfer some more money to me.

I'm just worried about you.

Are you tired?

42
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,220
No. Everything's been fine.

43
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,980
And I joined a club not long ago.

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
Do you know what a club is?

No.

Don't make me worry.

Look at you. You were so chubby and cute before.

Don't bring that up.

I think it's good that I'm thinner now.

I was too busy.

57
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,260
I didn't spend much time playing with you.

And you

didn't like making friends.

If I hadn't done that,

74

If an apology can change anything,

I want to eat oranges.

189
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,290
Are you hungry?

190
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,530
I'll order takeout for you.

191
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,350
What do you want to eat?

192
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,340
You're so nice all of a sudden.

193
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,490
I'm a little unaccustomed to it.

194
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,760
Didn't you say we should help each other?

195
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,030
How about ordering pig's trotter soup for you?

196
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,750
Okay.

197
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,620
You can benefit

198
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,900
from what you eat.

199
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
Pig's trotter soup.

200
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,990
Is it delicious?

201
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,370
Let me have a bite too.

202
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,710
Delicious.

203
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,180
Give me a piece of meat, okay?

204
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,830
Aren't you girls all into dieting?

205
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,060
Why would I diet? I'm not fat.

206
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,030
You're the one eating so much meat.

207
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,160
Aren't you afraid of becoming fat?

208
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,410
What's wrong with being fat? As long as I'm healthy.

209
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,670
Su Yancheng.

210
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,580
Su Yancheng.

211
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,510
Well, you're using my chopsticks.

212
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,930
Then you use these.

213
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,180
I don't want to use yours.

214
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,330
Su Yancheng.

215
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,660
Senior,

216
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,540
you're here.

217
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,630
I told everyone

218
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,780
I'd bring you some food today.

219
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,420
I didn't expect you to be eating already.

220
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
I didn't eat.

221
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,940
He ate it all.

222
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,040
I just ate the vegetables.

223
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,270
What delicious food did you bring?

224
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,180
I made some myself.

225
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,390
Su Yancheng,

226
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,430
let me feed Xiaoduo.

227
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,930
Try this fish.

228
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
I specially bought it.

229
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,770
Thank you.

230
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,740
Xiaoduo, let me feed you.

231
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,600
Is it delicious?

232
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,990
Homemade dishes always taste better than those bought outside.

233
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,730
Then have some more.

234
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,470
Be careful.

235
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,660
Senior.

236
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,330
I really think you're a really good person.

237
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,760
If I were a man, I'd marry you.

238
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,470
Don't pretend to be a child because it suits you.

239
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,150
Whoever marries you would enjoy a comfortable life.

240
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,329
Have another piece.

241
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,230
Delicious.

242
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,610
I suddenly feel a bit sleepy.

243
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll get some sleep first.

244
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,760
You guys take your time eating.

245
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,940
Okay.

246
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,320
These are my notes from today's class.

247
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,510
You can take a look.

248
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,460
I still have a few questions.

249
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,130
I'd like to ask you about them.

250
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,750
Okay.

251
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,250
Thank you.

252
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,570
[If the number of members is fewer than ten within the given time, the comic club will be disbanded.]

253
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,570
[The comic club violated the recruitment rules during the networking event. The registration forms are invalid.]

254
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,870
The comic club won't be disbanded!

255
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,320
The comic club won't be disbanded!

256
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,560
How do you think we can save the comic club?

257
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,760
So,

258
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,000
have you met anyone you like?

259
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,170
Xiaoduo, the comic club...

260
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,560
[Nurse Station]

261
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,190
[Nurse Station]

262
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,690
He's handsome,

263
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,520
but his temper is a bit bad.

264
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,030
What did you say?

265
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,790
I... I didn't say anything.

266
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,640
I said, "go to the bathroom with me."

267
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,810
Go to the bathroom?

268
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,960
You don't want me to help you...

269
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,200
That's not what I meant.

270
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,780
I misspoke.

271
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,980
Just press the nurse call button for me.

272
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,050
What were you thinking?

273
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,410
Su! Su!

274
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,140
Su!

275
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,420
It's over! It's over!

276
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
What happened?

277
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,190
Xiaoduo, actually, the situation with the comic club

278
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,920
is not what you think.

279
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,520
Xiaoduo, actually, the student council isn't...

280
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,340
Excuse me.

281
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,040
[Nurse Station]

282
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,670
Who are you looking for?

283
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,610
Bai Xiaoduo.

284
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Room 507 is over there.

285
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,880
Thank you.

286
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,960
The comic club is going to be disbanded.

287
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,890
What?

288
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,090
W-Why?

289
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,540
I just received a notice from the student council.

290
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,090
They said we violated the rules by recruiting new members at the networking event.

291
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,500
All those registration forms they filled out don't count.

292
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:05,950
[Keep quiet, no loud talking]

293
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
So... all our efforts were in vain?

294
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,750
The deadline is near.

295
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,340
We're out of funds too.

296
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,230
And the old members are quitting.

297
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,270
We don't have enough members.

298
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,580
Perhaps it's fate

299
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,840
that the comic club will be disbanded.

300
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm sorry.

301
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,600
It's all my fault.

302
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,220
I should have kept a closer eye on it.

303
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,570
It's okay, Junior Bai.

304
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,850
Even if the comic club no longer exists officially,

305
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,010
we can still gather privately.

306
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,780
The student council is so unreasonable.

307
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:08,940
[Keep quiet, no loud talking]

308
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,620
Don't take it too hard.

309
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,870
A club is just an official title after all.

310
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,530
But it's the result of our collective effort.

311
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,640
And...

312
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,320
Blake would care.

313
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,340
Why do you think Blake would care?

314
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,340
Because the comic club

315
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,810
brought together people who love comics.

316
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,580
He's just like us,

317
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,990
considering comics as the most important thing.

318
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,050
So I believe

319
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,370
Blake wouldn't want the comic club to disband either.

320
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Although Blake hasn't updated for a long time,

321
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,370
I believe

322
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,030
he's just encountered some small difficulties

323
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,600
and he can overcome them soon.

324
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,370
Because he once said

325
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
only those

326
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,700
who've tried their best have the right to give up.

327
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,140
That's right!

328
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,400
Only those who've tried their best

329
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,470
have the right to give up.

330
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,260
It's the same for us.

331
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,290
I believe

332
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,940
we can reorganize the comic club.

333
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,490
We can do it. Come on!

334
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,350
Why has the relationship

335
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,970
between you two suddenly improved?

336
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,580
Was our relationship that bad?

337
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,060
We are Blake's die-hard fan duo.

338
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,780
Right?

339
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,030
I'm also Blake's die-hard fan.

340
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,870
I want to join too.

341
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,920
From now on, we'll be

343
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,400
Okay.

344
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,200

00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,320
Wow!

374
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,520
Well, just drink your water.

375
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,880
Why are you slurping?

376
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,520
Blake posted on Weibo.

377
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,950
Who?

378
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,370
Unlock it for me. Hurry.

379
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,270
My smartphone. Hurry.

380
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,650
Unlock the phone. Hurry.

381
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,760
Unlock it.

382
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,760
Weibo. Weibo.

383
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,520
Don't you know Weibo? Weibo.

384
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,550
Special follows. Hurry.

385
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,070
[Season 3 in the works]

386
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,850
Su Yancheng!

387
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,100
Blake released an announcement.

388
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,520
S-Season 3. Season 3.

389
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,680
Season 3. Season 3.

390
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,150
Season 3.

391
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,520
This... This day has finally come.

392
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,170
Oh my God!

393
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,860
Su Yancheng.

394
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
Season 3, Season 3, Season 3.

395
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,350
Season 3, Season 3, Season 3.

396
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,230
Season 3, Season 3, Season 3.

397
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,100
Season 3, Season 3, Season 3.

398
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
Be careful. My leg.

399
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,650
Was it... like this before?

400
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,890
What do you think?

401
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,090
I swear to God

402
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,730
it was a blank board.

403
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,530
Blackboard.

404
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,300
I know.

405
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,410
This is really Blake's work.

406
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,940
How did you get out of the hospital?

407
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,770
Judging from the style

408
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,480
and the strength,

409
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,210
this was indeed painted by Blake.

410
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,090
This is Blake's work.

411
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,370
Did he paint it for you?

412
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,390
He hasn't told me yet.

413
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,550
But...

414
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,480
he must want to give me a surprise.

415
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,000
Hello.

416
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,150
Are you here to sign up?

417
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,040
We saw Blake's Weibo post early this morning.

418
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,720
We're so excited.

419
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,280
So we're here to take a look.

420
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,040
Hello.

421
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,490
Just call me Hua Dao.

422
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,120
You should tone it down a bit.

423
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,680
Let me show you around.

424
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,440
This way.

425
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,640
Look.

426
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,800
These

427
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,730
are the glorious works of our comic club.

428
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,580
We still need one more member. I'm leaving first.

429
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,260
Blake drew pictures for us.

430
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,240
Let's take a look over here.

431
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,200
You should thank him.

432
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,190
Let's go.

433
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,170
This way.

434
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,660
Where should I go to thank him?

435
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
You can tell me.

436
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,120
I'll pass it on to him.

437
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,560
Thank me now.

438
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,760
You haven't thanked me for doing your hair yet.

439
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
But it's not the deadline yet. You should be reasonable.

440
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,260
You have to come.

441
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,410
What's the point of me coming?

442
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,360
Just watch.

443
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,560
We're here to claim the venue.

444
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,820
You can leave...

445
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,690
Our members are already here.

446
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,870
Why should we leave?

447
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,470
You clearly don't have enough members here.

448
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,400
It doesn't meet the requirement.

449
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,350
Right, Yu Shubo?

450
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,310
Yes.

451
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,650
But they still have one more day.

452
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,730
They still have a chance.

453
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,630
That's right. Some of our members haven't arrived yet.

454
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,950
It's just a lousy comic club.

455
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,460
Nothing's gonna change even if you wait another 100 years!

456
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,020
Don't waste my time!

457
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,910
Stay away from my club members.

458
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,980
Whoops.

459
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,270
Are you going to

460
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,930
give me a sweep kick

461
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,370
or a spinning kick?

462
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,080
Hahahahaha.

463
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,610
Don't worry.

464
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,890
In my life,

465
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,100
I don't fight two types of people:

466
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,620
women

467
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,000
and disabled people.

468
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
What did you say? Say it again.

469
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,920
Alright, enough.

470
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,920
Don't fight.

471
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,580
I didn't lay a hand on anyone.

472
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,310
Calm down, everyone.
