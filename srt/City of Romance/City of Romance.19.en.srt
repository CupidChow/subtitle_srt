[Episode 19]

3
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,080
What should we do?

4
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,150
It's already so late.

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
The dormitory gates are already locked.

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,350
That's right.

7
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,370
Where should we go?

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,480
Sir, I have something to report.

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,940
I want to continue the party.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,860
Watch your steps.

11
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,250
Let's go!

12
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's... Let's go to Su's home.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Oh, that's not okay.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,080
Alright.

15
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,930
I agree.

16
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,140
There's no one at my home anyway.

17
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,910
I called a cab just now.

18
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,470
Let's call a cab. A cab.

19
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,290
Are you sure?

20
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,360
Well...

21
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,820
Well...

22
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,120
Well, if you all agree, let's

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,140
count off.

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,390
One!

25
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:45,180
[Episode 19: Sorry, I Lied Again]

26
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,360
Two!

27
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,060
Four!

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,320
What about you, Bai?

29
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,810
Three.

30
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,960
Five.

31
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,680
Six.

32
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,420
Yu Shubo.

33
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,900
Where are they?

34
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,700
They all went to Su Yancheng's home.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
They are all drunk, huh?

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,190
I just went to buy some water.

37
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,750
You're even busier after your promotion, right?

38
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,760
Whether I'm busy or not, I'm used to it.

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,070
Will I need to

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,100
make appointments to see you from now on?

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,620
It's not that dramatic.

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,270
My work is just to help everyone

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,579
do some trivial things that I'm capable of.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,700
I've always wanted to ask you

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,510
what is most important to you.

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,150
You always take such good care of everyone around you.

47
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,850
You fulfill every request raised by others,

48
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,750
and you never say no.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,100
Even when you're tired,

50
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,790
you never show it in front of others.

51
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,790
Because you're afraid of showing negative emotions

52
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,140
that might make others unhappy.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,820
Am I right?

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,050
You're right.

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,910
You're correct.

56
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,040
But I think

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,420
at least when people mention Yu Shubo,

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,340
they will all think that he's a good person.

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,890
But if you don't act this way,

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,480
will they just say that you're a bad person?

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,990
Actually, you don't need to butter everyone up.

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,450
You should be aware of that as you major in psychology.

63
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,810
You are the protagonist of your own life.

64
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,640
You should be kinder to yourself.

65
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,550
I want to do that, too.

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,720
I want to do that, too.

67
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,750
But honestly speaking,

68
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,420
sometimes, it's really tiring. It's extremely tiring.

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm so tired that I want to say dirty words.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,100
Have you ever heard me say dirty words?

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,409
But when... when you really see that many people

72
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,930
feel happy because of

73
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
what you've done,

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,060
and they want to be your friends,

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,090
you'll feel that it's all worth it.

76
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,770
And you won't feel tired anymore.

77
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,320
It's really worth it.

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,340
But sometimes, sacrificing too much unilaterally

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,040
might also put pressure on others.

80
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,600
Especially those who care about you.

81
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,430
Okay. Then I'll give it a try

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,630
and put myself first.

83
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,010
Then let's give it a try right now.

84
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,090
Now,

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm going to do something.

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,210
You can refuse it.

87
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,130
What is it?

88
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,920
Xiaomiao, Xiaomiao.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,350
Are you sure you can handle this?

90
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:46,840
It's okay.

91
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,090
Take good care of Su Yancheng.

92
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,440
I'll figure out a way.

93
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,770
Alright. I'll be there to help you soon.

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,560
Let's go.

95
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,730
I always have to prop you up.

96
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,350
What are you doing?

97
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,410
What's going on here?

98
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
It's so hot.

99
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,430
You're quite unrestrained, aren't you?

100
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,610
Why is it stuck?

101
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,090
My head has grown bigger.

102
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,230
Stop taking it off. Be good. Stop taking it off.

103
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,640
You reek of alcohol right now.

104
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,890
You stink.

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,710
Come on. Lie down. Rest for a while.

106
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,590
Be good and wait for me here. I'll get you some water.

107
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,260
Let's hug each other.

108
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,330
Let's hug each other?

109
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,550
Let's hug each other.

110
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,600
Xiaoduo.

111
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,330
Don't go now.

112
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm still here.

113
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,490
You know what?

114
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,360
Hmm?

115
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,550
I really like Bai Xiaoduo.

116
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,380
I know.

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,420
She's really adorable.

118
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,030
Yeah.

119
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,050
I want to say that I've been really upset in the past few days.

120
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,820
Why?

121
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,080
She promised to be my girlfriend.

122
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,520
But she tries to hide me.

123
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,220
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,180
She also promised me that

125
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,050
she wouldn't lie to me again.

126
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,930
But she lied to me again.

127
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,790
She told me that Yu Chi needed to see her this afternoon.

128
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
But then I saw her

129
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,030
smiling brightly at Yu Shubo.

130
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,790
I saw it all.

131
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,190
I feel so hurt inside.

132
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,920
I feel so hurt.

133
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,610
It turns out that he's upset about this matter.

134
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,990
Why didn't this fool ask me?

135
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm so sorry.

136
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,930
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,070
What's wrong?

138
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,500
I feel really awful.

139
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't throw up.

140
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
Have you swallowed it?

141
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,980
But I won't be disgusted by you, either.

142
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,190
It smells so good.

143
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,730
Hey, Miss.

144
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,610
Alright. I got it.

145
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,780
I'll contact him tonight.

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Okay.

147
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,190
Xiao Yang, Xiao Yang.

148
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,110
Get up now.

149
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,050
Uncle Su and Auntie Su are back.

150
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
What auntie?

151
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,730
The dorm supervisors aren't aunties. They're like moms.

152
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,110
Get up, get up.

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,670
Get up now.

154
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,630
Get up, get up!

155
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,670
Su Yancheng.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,590
Wake up, wake up.

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,110
What's that sound?

158
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,590
Is your mother back home?

159
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,440
-I think my parents are back home.
-Get up now.

160
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,050
Your parents are back.

161
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,190
How can you go on sleeping here?

162
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll go downstairs first.

163
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,650
It's not like we've done

164
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,700
something inappropriate again.

165
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Well, we're lying here together,

166
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,020
and it's not good if your parents see us.

167
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,450
I'll go downstairs first.

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
What's wrong with that?

169
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
You once ate the noodles she made.

170
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,760
I haven't met her in person yet.

171
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,110
This is not okay.

172
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,380
Calm down for a moment first.

173
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,510
The best solution now

174
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,880
is that we both go downstairs to meet them.

175
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,880
Otherwise, if my parents

176
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,430
come upstairs themselves later,

177
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,490
it'll be even harder to explain it.

178
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,230
But...

179
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,820
I'm worried that they might have a bad impression of me.

180
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,180
Don't worry. I'm here.

181
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,400
Wake up.

182
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,380
-Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Su.
-Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Su.

183
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,900
Who are you?

184
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,540
W-We are Su Yancheng's friends.

185
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,480
We attended that celebration party,

186
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,760
so we were drunk.

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

189
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,400
Where's Su Yancheng?

190
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,890
Su...

191
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,290
You two...

192
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,100
Mom, Dad.

193
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,840
This is my girlfriend, Bai Xiaoduo.

194
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,230
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Su.

195
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,860
I was drunk last night.

196
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,020
She stayed to take care of me.

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,160
It's getting late, so you all should...

198
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,660
Yancheng,

199
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,580
won't you introduce your friends to us?

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Xiao Yang, Lin Xiaomiao, Hua Dao and Chopper.

201
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,190
Hello, everyone.

202
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,210
Hello, everyone.

203
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,020
How about this?

204
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,230
Let's have a meal together.

205
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,730
No, no, no.

206
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,580
No, no, no.

207
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,380
We still have something to do at school today, right?

208
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,640
Yes, yes, yes.

209
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,110
Yes.

210
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,080
-Next time.
-Next time.

211
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
Mr. and Mrs. Su, we'll...

212
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,250
We'll leave now.

213
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,060
Come visit us again when you have time next time.

214
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,610
Okay.

215
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,160
Ask Su Yancheng to stay for a moment.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,030
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,880
Why don't you stay for lunch?

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,110
That's right, Xiaoduo.

219
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,430
Stay and have lunch with us.

220
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,770
Don't be shy with me.

221
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,130
You must have had a hard time taking care of him last night.

222
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,120
Okay.

223
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,200
Yancheng.

224
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,690
Your father wants to talk to you.

225
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,730
Xiaoduo, let's go upstairs first.

226
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,300
We'll wait for you upstairs.

227
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,330
Good for you.

228
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
You've got a girlfriend, but you didn't even tell us.

229
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,800
Why are you standing there?

230
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,320
Sit down.

231
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,650
Hey, Su Yancheng.

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,930
Sit here.

233
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,000
If you have something to say, just say it.

234
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,500
Sit here, and I'll tell you.

235
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,980
Your mother and I

236
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,110
have already prepared everything for you to study abroad.

237
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,950
I won't go.

238
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Studying abroad is a good thing.

239
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,670
Aren't you always interested in psychology?

240
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,960
It's a perfect opportunity to further your studies overseas.

241
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,480
It's always like this.

242
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,720
You've already arranged everything.

243
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,340
What do you mean by "it's always like this?"

244
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,250
Are you saying that

245
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I need to discuss everything

246
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,590
that concerns you with you first?

247
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,910
Su Yancheng.

248
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,890
Look what you've become.

249
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,250
Do you just want to hang out, drink and mess around

250
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,480
with these people?

251
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,350
They are my friends.

252
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,290
Friends?

253
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,630
Let me tell you.

254
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,880
With friends like these,

255
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,130
you won't achieve anything in the future.

256
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,590
Anyway,

257
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,270
I just want to say this.

258
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,700
After you graduate,

259
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,710
go abroad immediately.

260
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,840
There's no room for discussion.

261
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,950
Anyway,

262
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,080
I've paved

263
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,210
the path for you.

264
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,910
It's up to you how to proceed.

265
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,960
Sit here and think it through carefully.

266
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,830
Xiaoduo, see if there's anything else you'd like to eat.

267
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,530
It's okay, Mrs. Su. Any food is fine for me.

268
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,910
Alright. That's it for now. Thank you.

269
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,750
Mom, why did you suddenly come back?

270
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,260
I have to attend a seminar today.

271
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,500
I came back to get changed.

272
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,550
Your father's company is preparing to launch a new drug.

273
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,860
He also came back to pack his luggage.

274
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,540
I don't know whether he'll be able to

275
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,970
come back for the Spring Festival this year.

276
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,579
It doesn't matter.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
I don't have any expectations for him.

278
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,650
Yancheng,

279
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,880
you should be more understanding towards your parents.

280
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,349
I'll go order some desserts additionally.

281
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait for me.

282
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,730
Okay.

283
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,980
Although he doesn't seem to talk much,

284
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,370
he's actually quite sensitive.

285
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,340
Maybe it's because we

286
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,870
don't communicate with him quite often.

287
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,880
Mrs. Su,

288
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
do you know how we met?

289
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,380
I got to know him through his drawings.

290
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,790
Oh, really?

291
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,430
He has always liked drawing since he was a kid.

292
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,330
He's also the President of our school's comic club.

293
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,550
I didn't even know that.

294
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,430
His father and I are usually too busy.

295
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,960
We rarely have time to pay attention to his growth.

296
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,700
Be careful not to fall.

297
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,450
Sit tight. I'll push the swing for you.

298
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,060
Baby, are you having fun?

299
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,840
Mommy, push it higher!

300
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,380
Okay. I'll push it higher.

301
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,160
I have a deep impression of that boy.

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
A towel was wrapped around his waist.

303
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,770
He's also a very good friend of ours.

304
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,980
Thank you, thank you.

305
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,160
Did you drink a lot last night?

306
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,350
I didn't drink much.

307
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,260
Thank you so much

308
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
for taking care of him all night.

309
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,990
It's nothing, Mrs. Su. It's what I should do.

310
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,220
You didn't get much rest, either.

311
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,980
It's okay.

312
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,840
What are you talking about?

313
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,770
We're talking about how grumpy you usually look.

314
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,450
Come on. Just eat.

315
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,500
I ordered it for you additionally. Taste it.

316
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,270
Xiaoduo.

317
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,290
Are you a local from Man City?

318
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,200
No, Mrs. Su. I'm from Rao City.

319
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,010
That's quite far away from here.

320
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,250
It's not easy for a young girl to come to this city herself

321
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,380
and study here.

322
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,340
If you have any difficulties, you can tell Yancheng.

323
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,490
Okay.

324
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,040
What do your family members do?

325
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,000
Mom.

326
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,310
They're just doing some small business.

327
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,790
It's related to traditional Chinese medicine.

328
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,230
Oh, really?

329
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,900
Your family members are also doctors?

330
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,550
Yes.

331
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,450
Both my great-grandfather

332
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,430
and grandfather engaged in this field.

333
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,980
Now my father is doing it.

334
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,530
So your family could be considered a traditional Chinese medicine family?

335
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,880
I suppose so.

336
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,660
It has been passed down through so many generations.

337
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,370
So now, are you doing something like

338
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,790
a chain of traditional Chinese medicine therapy centers, or...

339
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,120
Yes.

340
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,930
Oh, no. I bragged accidentally.

341
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,610
I was talking without thinking.

342
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,090
Yancheng's grandmother also studies traditional Chinese medicine.

343
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,210
You and she could exchange ideas if there's a chance.

344
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,710
It's delicious.

345
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,940
Just eat, Yancheng.

346
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,840
Do you think

347
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,600
your parents have a good impression of me?

348
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,320
They like you very much.

349
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,050
Really.

350
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,650
Really?

351
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,580
That's good then.

352
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,060
I was worried that there might be the scene like...

353
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,300
giving me five million yuan to make me leave her son.

354
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,160
I was worried that your dad might give me a cheque

355
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,250
to make me leave you.

356
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,670
Then we could share the money.

357
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,410
I would give it all to you.

358
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,770
Xiaoduo.

359
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,780
Actually, I've thought about whether we should

360
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
communicate with our child

361
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,570
in a different way as parents.

362
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,700
But with his father's temper like that...

363
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
Today, because of

364
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,700
the matter of sending him abroad,

365
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,790
they had another unpleasant argument, didn't they?

366
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,790
Mrs. Su.

367
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,970
Will he still go abroad?

368
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,910
About this matter,

369
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,790
just let him tell you himself after lunch.

370
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,870
Xiaoduo.

371
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,500

560
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,400
Can't you see I haven't sent it?

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,580
I was just kidding.

562
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,970
Su Yancheng.

563
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,170
I have something to tell you.

564
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,680
Let's meet at the library later.

565
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:21,960
[Library]

566
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,330
Su Yancheng.

567
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,270
I've applied to study abroad next semester.

568
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,610
Before I leave,

569
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,050
there's something I want to tell you.

570
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,060
Do you remember that

571
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,650
when we met for the first time,

572
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
it was also at this place?

573
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,580
Wasn't it in the pathology class?

574
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,110
You really don't remember it.

575
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,100
I'm sorry.

576
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,200
I was wearing a short skirt that day.

577
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,850
I was so careless that someone took photos of me sneakily.

578
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,490
You helped me.

579
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
I remember it now.

580
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,670
Did that person give you any trouble afterwards?

581
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,980
It's all fine now.

582
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,340
It was all thanks to you at that time.

583
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,700
Otherwise, my photos would have been all over the Internet.

584
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,620
That's good.

585
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,600
In the future, don't climb ladders while wearing a skirt.

586
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,270
After that day, in the pathology class,

587
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,780
I met you again.

588
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,520
The use of the harmonic average is discussed in the book.

589
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,500
Determine the questions to be answered and propose a hypothesis.

590
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,090
Identify key quantities and measurement methods.

591
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,420
If I did anything

592
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,650
that made you misunderstand,

593
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,350
I apologize to you.

594
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,810
It's all in the past.

595
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,640
I sincerely wish you both the best.

596
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,950
I've asked you to come here today

597
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,750
because I have a question for you.

598
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,950
Don't you hate it the most when people lie to you?

599
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,920
Why did you choose someone that is...

600
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,490
I know Bai Xiaoduo likes to lie.

601
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,060
I don't know why

602
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,320
she liked to lie in the past.

603
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,740
But now,

604
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,350
she's trying to become better gradually.

605
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,540
Why can't we give her a chance?

606
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,460
It turns out that loving someone

607
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,770
can really make you abandon all your principles.

608
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,530
I do hate lies,

609
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,800
but I hate the distrust

610
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,230
and trauma caused by lies even more.

611
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,260
Not saying something is also a kind of lie.

612
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,960
It's self-deception.

613
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,120
You should tell Xiaoduo as soon as possible

614
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,620
about your parents wanting you to study abroad.

615
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,800
This difficult issue

616
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,820
should be faced together.
