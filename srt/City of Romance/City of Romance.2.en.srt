[Episode 2]

3
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,030
Why are your summer practice project results

4
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,110
still like this?

5
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,110
As someone who excels in every subject, are you deliberately 
trying to fail and retake the course?

6
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,590
Professor.

7
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,990
Theories prove that adults

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,050
unconsciously tell lies several times a day.

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,110
Our research focus this time

10
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,590
is on the psychological analysis

11
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,420
of human lying behavior and its detection.

12
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,150
Motivation, individual differences,

13
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,990
interaction characteristics, and communication context factors

14
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,930
will all influence lying and its detection behaviors.

15
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,420
I've also collected a lot of references.

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,280
Su Yancheng.

17
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,720
Your grades are all good,

18
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,410
but your only weakness is in communication.

19
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,150
Don't always work by yourself with your head buried in your tasks.

20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,980
Hello.

[Mr. Owl and Miss Flying Squirrel]

22
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,310
Why is it him?

[Mr. Owl and Miss Flying Squirrel]

24
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,829
Do you know

25
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,710
where Senior Yu Shubo is?

26
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,750
He's not here.

27
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,690
[Episode 2: Sincere Lies]

28
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,340
May I ask where he went?

29
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,430
How would I know?

30
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,590
[Mr. Owl and Miss Flying Squirrel]

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Will he come back?

32
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,510
So aloof.

33
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,280
Can I just hang around here for a bit?

34
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,390
Do as you please.

35
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,750
Okay.

36
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,900
Oh my God!

37
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,540
This looks identical

38
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,710
to the area outside Mr. Owl's house from Blake's comics!

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,270
Do you need anything else?

40
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,210
Nothing much.

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,930
I'm just waiting for Senior Yu.

42
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,230
This is a laboratory.

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,750
If you're not doing experiments, leave.

44
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,010
Fine.

45
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,410
Su Yancheng.

46
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,490
What you need are experimental samples,

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
not references.

48
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,060
Blake sent me to discuss something with the Chief Editor.

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,480
Do you know where the Chief Editor's office is?

50
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,770
You know Blake well?

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm his assistant.

52
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,770
Because I'm Blake's assistant.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,750
Because Blake sent me to help the Comic Club

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,630
through this difficult time.

55
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,680
You say you're Blake's assistant?

56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,110
Yes.

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,899
But actually, you don't know who Blake is, do you?

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,900
If you don't believe me, forget it.

59
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,510
Let's do an experiment.

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
What is this for?

61
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,290
It's a lie detector.

62
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,040
I don't want to do this anymore.

63
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,740
So you admit that you lied?

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,280
Let's do it.

65
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,400
Now we'll officially begin.

66
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,500
I'll ask you a few questions first.

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,770
Name?

68
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,470
Bai Xiaoduo.

69
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,310
Age?

70
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,060
Nineteen.

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,570
Gender?

72
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,720
Can't you tell?

73
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,620
I suggest that you calm down now.

74
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,760
This test

75
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,650
is directly linked to your heart rate.

76
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,350
If not done properly,

77
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,910
we'll need to repeat the test.

78
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,260
Okay.

79
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,740
Gender?

80
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,920
Female.

81
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,570
How were your high school grades?

82
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,950
Pretty good.

83
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,320
Do you lie often?

84
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,710
No.

85
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,340
Do you have many friends?

86
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,820
Yes, lots.

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,020
All of them are my friends.

88
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,130
What's the biggest lie you've ever told?

89
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,380
I don't remember.

90
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,930
Are you Blake's assistant?

91
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,500
Yes, I am.

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,030
Is there anything

93
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,880
that could make you stop lying?

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,380
Blake's comics.

95
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,400
Why?

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,570
Because...

97
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,970
whenever I'm unhappy,

98
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,650
this comic has always been there for me.

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,060
When I was at the lowest point in my life,

100
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,900
it was also this comic that gave me strength.

101
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,590
It's still the same now.

102
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,030
People say he's long past his prime.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,880
How can you believe what the haters say?

104
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,470
I think he's just facing a bit of

105
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,460
a small difficulty.

106
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,990
He'll get through it soon.

107
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,890
How do you know?

108
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,790
What if he just doesn't want to draw anymore?

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,280
But based on his comics,

110
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,780
I don't think he's the type to give up easily.

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,640
Besides,

112
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,900
even if he doesn't want to draw anymore,

113
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,150
then he can just drop it.

114
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,230
I'd still support him.

115
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,740
Why support him?

116
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,750
Because I like him.

117
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,740
I like him more than anyone else in the world.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,770
Are you done asking the questions?

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Senior Yu!

120
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,340
Hi, you're here too.

121
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
I've been waiting for you.

122
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,940
Do you need anything from me?

123
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,710
I really love

124
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,390
the comic "Mr. Owl and Miss Flying Squirrel."

125
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
I can recite every episode of this comic by heart.

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,020
Okay.

127
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,230
Blake would be so happy to hear this.

128
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,350
Has work

129
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,860
on the third season started yet?

130
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,300
I've heard so, yes.

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,200
That's great.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,830
This is a laboratory, not a chat room.

133
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,050
If you want to chat, do so in private.

134
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,520
It's okay; he's always like this.

135
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,289
It's okay.

136
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,400
How about this?

137
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,810
Add me on WeChat.

138
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,670
If you have anything later, just message me on WeChat.

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,070
The lab really isn't a good place to talk.

140
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,190
Is it really okay?

141
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,970
Yes.

142
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,160
That's great.

143
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,440
It's fine. Don't be nervous.

144
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,840
I've scanned your code.

145
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,430
Thank you, Senior Yu.

146
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,310
Bye-bye, Senior Yu.

147
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,840
Bye-bye.

148
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,690
You can do it.

149
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,320
Senior Yu.

150
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,840
About the fact that you're Blake,

151
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,220
I absolutely won't tell anyone.

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,740
Okay.

153
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,110
How's the experiment going?

154
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,340
The assignment this time still didn't pass.

155
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,300
The professor asked me to tell you to hurry up.

156
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,940
It's mainly because school just started,

157
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,930
and clubs are recruiting new members again.

158
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,030
I've been too busy.

159
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,580
I heard that you want to take the

160
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,170
publishing house's sponsorship for the networking event.

161
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,220
So you're that eager to disband the Comic Club?

162
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,430
I'm not trying to disband the Comic Club.

163
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,220
If your club contributes to the school,

164
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,020
the school will definitely keep it.

165
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,310
The Boxing Club has a lot of support now.

166
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,100
I have no choice.

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,520
The publishing house hasn't decided who will get the money yet.

168
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,340
You should focus on your own project first.

169
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,840
You should mind your own business.

170
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,720
[Indication of Emotion]

171
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,460
Whose lie detector chart is this?

172
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,270
Judging by the lines, not a single truth was told.

173
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,060
It fits our research topic quite well.

174
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,370
Bai Xiaoduo.

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,050
That girl in the lab?

176
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:37,980
Alright.

177
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,470
I'll ask her another day

178
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,760
if she can cooperate with us for an experiment.

179
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,660
It's better I do this experiment alone.

180
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,230
We're on the same team.

181
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,520
We need to submit one report.

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,870
You're not good at communication. Let me go.

183
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,020
I have my own testing process.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,210
You should team up with someone else.

185
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,260
You're interested in her?

186
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,320
No.

187
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,760
But honestly,

188
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,090
her chart is indeed unique.

189
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,670
If that's the case,

190
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,050
then what she said in the Comic Club

191
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,060
might not be true either.

192
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,030
About being his assistant and about that draft.

193
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,620
But if Blake is really helping you all

194
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,700
get back on track,

195
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,870
the student council will help you too.

196
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,540
Draft.

197
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,870
Why are you here?

198
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,870
Why are you here?

199
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,400
I,

200
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,590
I'm here to get something.

201
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,280
Let me ask you.

202
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
What was your purpose for standing up

203
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,880
for the Comic Club earlier today?

204
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,970
What purpose could I have?

205
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,650
Blake asked me to help you guys.

206
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,570
Why did Blake send you?

207
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,650
Because he's worried about the Comic Club

208
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,080
but can't appear in person.

209
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,110
So, he sent me, his assistant,

210
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,050
to help you.

211
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,040
Since you're his assistant,

212
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,530
you must know his habits well, right?

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,380
Yes.

214
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,900
When drawing,

215
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,570
he likes to draw the background first and then the foreground.

216
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,800
I've even helped him with the line work before.

217
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,720
You're lying.

218
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,760
Your hands

219
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,610
don't look like those of an artist at all.

220
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,150
Moreover, in Blake's work,

221
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,140
he draws the foreground first, then the background.

222
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,570
How do you know that?

223
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,610
Could it be...

224
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,640
you're also his fan?

225
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,470
Well, I do study art, after all.

226
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,410
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

227
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,100
I guess this confrontation has made us friends.

228
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,640
From now on, we're family.

229
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,690
We can even follow his updates together.

230
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,690
And I can share some

231
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,090
of his little gossip with you.

232
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,230
What gossip?

233
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,460
He's afraid of heights

234
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,410
and doesn't like green peppers.

235
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,040
When did he ever say that he doesn't like green peppers?

236
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,520
On his Weibo.

237
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,760
Once, when he was eating,

238
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,120
he posted a picture on Weibo.

239
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,410
The green peppers were picked out separately.

240
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,530
From this, we can deduce

241
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,230
that he doesn't like green peppers.

242
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,660
I'm quite the detective.

243
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,060
Thanks for sharing that pointless gossip.

244
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,450
But sorry,

245
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,850
we can't let you

246
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,320
join the Comic Club.

247
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,540
Why?

248
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,170
Because the Comic Club doesn't welcome liars.

249
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Who's in there?

250
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,040
Get down.

251
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,830

252
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,430
My phone is over there.

253
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,230

We...

257
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,810
We're from the Boxing Club.

258
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:19,790
Run!

259
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,740
Stop!

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,570
I can't run anymore!

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,760
Alright.

I can't stop.

265
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,580
I really can't stop at all.

266

We don't need to keep running anymore.

267
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,960
Okay, I'll go that way then.

268
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,540
You should head back too. Bye-bye.

270
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,520
Let me ask you a question.

271
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,340
Go ahead.

272
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,020
You study psychology.

273
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,470
So do you think

274
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,650
people shouldn't lie?

275
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,120

276
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,000
Why are you still here?

277
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,440
I need to catch my breath.

278
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,080
Do you think lying

279
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,640
could save the Comic Club?

280
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,600
Wh-Wh-What's wrong with that?

281
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,040
Thanks to what I just did,

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,630
the Comic Club is saved.

283
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,150
And Blake asked me to come here.

284
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,830
It's not that you can't.

285
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,310
Some lies are well-intentioned.

286
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,580
Some truths require courage.

287
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,380
What you do with lies is up to you.

288
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,260
That's what Blake said.

289
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,290
Indeed, you're Blake's die-hard fan.

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,290
Then...

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,390

No.

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,920
That's a lie. I don't believe you.

Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,500
Who was that girl who came to the comic club looking for you

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,410
the other day?

I came out of the bathroom

315
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,840
and saw you talking to Su about something.

Don't rush.

319
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,320
Keep looking. She'd come out soon.

00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,740
adhering to rules and propriety.

378
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,030
Most Hanfu have a crossed collar with the right side overlapping,

379
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,320
but your front lapels cross left.

380
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,410
This style of wearing is mostly seen in ethnic minorities or...

381
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,490
burial clothes for the deceased.

382
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,410
Are you here to cause trouble?

383
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,290
If you don't want to participate in the activities, just quit the club already!

384
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,530
Making people quit just because you can't win an argument?

385
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,870
Is this how you lead the club?

386
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,250
S-She's the club president.

387
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,970
Is this how you lead the club?

388
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,420
This is all your Traditional Culture Club amounts to.

389
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,680
Let's go, Junior.

390
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,000
Misleading people!

391
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,790
What gives you the right to say that?

392
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,390
[Traditional Culture Club]

393
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,030
-Let me talk some sense into them.
-How could you say that to us?

394
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,510
It's none of your business!

395
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,530
Did she say anything wrong?

396
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,460
Was she wrong?

397
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,290
Is it any of your business?

398
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,770
Wanna do this?

399
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,400
Come on!

400
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,400
Do you remember me?

401
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,420
We met at the comic room door.

402
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,770
I remember.

403
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,110
Are you okay?

404
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,520
I'm fine.

405
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,250
They're just girls; their hits aren't that strong.

406
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,640
My dad hits harder than that.

407
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,590
Let me introduce myself properly.

408
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,090
My name is Xiao Yang.

409
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,350
I'm a third-year student majoring in psychology.

410
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,390
I'm Lin Xiaomiao,

first year, TCM.

412
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,770
Nice to meet you.

413
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,960
I think what you just said was great.

414
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,780
Those people neither understand history

415
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,140
nor respect culture.

416
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,750
They just want to take some photos to make themselves happy.

417
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,700
Thank you, Senior Xiao Yang.

418
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,930
It's no big deal.

419
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,800
There are so many girls in the Traditional Culture Club.

420
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,890
It must be like a palace drama in there.

421
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,250
Why don't you

422
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,850
join our Comic Club instead?

423
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,890
Aren't there many girls in the Comic Club too?

424
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,930
Well, how should I put this?

425
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,290
If the Comic Club used to be like the Land of Women,

426
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,100
now it's more like

427
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,190
the Shaolin Temple.

428
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,890

Su, come to the Comic Club quickly.

438
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm at the MCU.

439
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,450
Let's talk about the funding.

Su Yancheng.

441
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,510
I have three things to discuss with you today.

442
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,390
First,

443
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,480
it's about the third season we talked about last time.

444
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,730
How's your thinking coming along?

445
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,250
If it's not working out,

446
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,280
how about drawing some side stories from 
the first two chapters to build some hype?

447
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,140
I can't rehash old material.

448
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,750
Give me more time to think about it.

449
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,580
I heard that the Comic Club is going to disband.

450
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,180
Yu Shubo and his big mouth.

451
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,530
I think your work focus now

452
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,160
should be on your comic

453
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,580
rather than the Comic Club.

454
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,750
What's the second thing?

455
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,330
I applied for the sponsorship funding for you,

456
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,630
but it wasn't approved.

457
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,040
Why?

458
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,600
The company decided to give it to the student council this time.

459
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,790
They currently have some doubts

460
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,750
about your productivity and capabilities.

461
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,060
Oh, and the third thing.

462
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,430
There's an inter-university comic convention coming up,

463
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,710
and our publishing house is sponsoring it.

464
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,720
Think about

465
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,450
whether you want to attend as Blake.

466
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,140
There's a lot going on with school. I'm swamped.

467
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,930
Don't rush to refuse.

468
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,550
Think it over carefully.

469
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,390
Otherwise, even I won't be able to protect you in the future.

470
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,190
This is delicious.

471
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,030

Come here!

500
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,180
First, I need to make something clear.

501
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,490
Our Comic Club

502
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,900
is not something to be taken lightly.

503
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,480
If you want to join the Comic Club,

504
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,960
you need to understand its history first.

505
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,870
You see, our Comic Club at MCU

506
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,110
had always been unremarkable.

507
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,390
But three years ago, when President Su Yancheng

508
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,850
joined our club,

509
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,850
something miraculous happened.

510
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,100
In Blake's comics,

511
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,580
many scenes corresponded exactly to the MCU.

512
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,760
Word on the street was that Blake was here.

513
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,930
The club suddenly flourished with new members.

514
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,570
It was packed with talented members.

515
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,860

516
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,610

517
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,390

518
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,570
Are pretty good.

519
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,600
Pretty good.

520
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,870
But the good times didn't last long.

521
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,500
A year ago, Blake suddenly stopped updating,

522
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,370
which meant the club lost

523
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,320
its spiritual pillar.

524
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,190
Wait, does what you're drawing have anything to do with what you're saying?

525
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,980
It's all messy!

526
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,350

527
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,100
It does.

00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,680

Packed with talented members.

533
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,510
I'll continue.

534
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,540
As old members graduated and left,

535
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,950
and our president

536
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,250
wasn't good at management,

537
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,190
the club

538
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,510
gradually declined from its previous prosperity.

539
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,270
After losing so many members,

540
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,850
even the small boxing club

541
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,270
is trying to take over our place.

542
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,710
What a pity.

543
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,560
What a shame.

544
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,850
Here,

545
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,960
I would also like to apologize on behalf of my brother,

547
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320

548
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,530
What a genius.

549
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,410
Even with her joining,

550
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,580
there are only five of us.

551
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,870
A club needs at least ten members.

552
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,250
Don't worry.

553
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,900
From today on,

554
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,610
I'm with the Comic Club.

555
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,810
I'll do my best

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,400
to lead the club to restore its glory!

557

Aren't you tired?

558
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,300
As long as it's for Blake...

559
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,400
I won't be tired.

560
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,070
Good!

561
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,910
Good!
