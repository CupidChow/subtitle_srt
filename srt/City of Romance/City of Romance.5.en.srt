[Episode 5]

3
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,289
I never hit two types of people in my life.

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,900
Women

5
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,320
and disabled people.

6
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,920
What did you just say?

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,590
Say that again.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,229
Alright, alright.

9
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,120
No fighting, no fighting.

10
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,870
I didn't even touch him.

11
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,550
Calm down. Both of you should calm down.

12
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,950
Here! There's another one here!

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,750
Xiaomiao!

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,840
I, Lin Xiaomiao,

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,620
would like to apply to join the comic club.

16
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,720
Great!

17
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,740
We have enough people now.

18
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,020
You two, get out now!

19
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,550
Just go!

20
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,900
Yu.

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,910
I'm showing repsect to you today.

22
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,070
Fine.

23
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll help you find a way to solve the venue issue.

24
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,750
Just go.

25
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,780
Bye bye. Bye bye.

26
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,770
Let me tell you!

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
You don't need to show respect to anyone. Just come back!

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,079
Thank you for coming.

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,300
That's great!

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,760
Come on, come on.

31
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,680
From now on, we'll be a family.

32

If anyone needs help, just tell us anytime.

33

Thank you all for coming.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,070
Hello, Su Yancheng.

35
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,640
Explain this to me.

36
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,970
What's going on with Blake's Weibo?

37
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,030
You didn't post on Weibo when I asked you to do so before.

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,850
But now you're suddenly making an official announcement.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,180
Isn't that a bit hasty?

40
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,640
Previously, you said that

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,120
you had no inspiration for creating stories.

43
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,810
What? How come you suddenly have it now?

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,570
I have some,

45
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,410
but not much.

46
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,100
Do you have a crush on someone?

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,280
No.

48
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,860
I just don't want the comic club to disband.

49
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,970
Su Yancheng,

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,590
as your chief editor,

51
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,760
I have to seriously warn you.

52
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,240
This is Blake's Weibo,

53
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,800
not your Weibo.

54
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,829
Don't forget that

55
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,970
our contract hasn't expired yet. Okay?

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,750
If you delay submitting your drafts again,

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,390
I really can't explain it to the publishing house.

58
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm working on the drafts.

59
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,800
It's okay to date someone.

60
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,870
Maybe

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,180
the hormones that have been released will inspire your creativity.

62
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,540
But the fact that you are Blake

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,790
absolutely cannot be revealed.

64
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,670
We've signed a confidentiality agreement.

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,290
Got it.

66
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,770
How's your hand?

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,280
It's much better now.

68
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,030
Look. Does it look like a boxing glove?

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm sorry, Senior.

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,270
I've caused you trouble.

71
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,670
It's nothing.

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,240
This is also what the student council should do.

73
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,200
It's an issue of safety.

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,540
Is there any chance for me to make amends?

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,409
Actually, you don't need to think too much about it.

76
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,930
Just take good care of yourself.

77
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,220
Anyway, nothing serious happened. Right?

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,870
Thank you, Senior.

79
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,580
You're always so considerate towards others.

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,110
Sometimes, you should also think more about yourself.

81
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,500
Is there anything that you particularly want to do?

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,570
Something that I particularly want to do?

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,970
I want to have a meal.

84
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,930
You want to have a meal?

85
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,000
Alright. I'll take you to have a meal.

Your hairstyle has changed.

88
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,690
Yes. As for the one you saw just now,

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,100
Su Yancheng made it for me at the hospital.

90
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,300
He was so clumsy. Xiaomiao did it much better.

91

92
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,350

Thank you so much.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Thank you for not disbanding the comic club.

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,080
Because of your Weibo and sketches,

96
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,500
members of the comic club

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,430
reignited their passion for comics.

Let's talk about something serious.

102

I heard that you helped Su Yancheng with his experiment.

103
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,590
Previously, didn't you ask me

104
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,230
what I thought about lies?

105
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,610
I also want to ask you

as long as it's well-intentioned, it'll be fine.

I... I can do it myself.

113

I'm quite capable now.

114

Alright. Come on.

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:50,990

Where did you come from?

117
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,330
I'm here to eat.

118
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,400
If you're here to eat, just eat your own food.

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Why are you eating someone else's food?

120
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,920
I have difficulty walking.

121
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,200
It's not convenient for me to get food myself.

122
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,170
This table is close to the entrance, and there's food right here.

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,960
Su Yancheng, if you have difficulty walking,

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
you can order takeout food by yourself.

125
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,530
I prefer fresh food.

126
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,570
Well, are you this free all day?

127
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,460
The doctor gave it to me and asked me to remind you to take the medicine.

128
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,990
We're both medical students, so I don't need to explain it further, right?

129
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,600
Xiaoduo, come on. Have some meat.

130
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,110
No, thanks, Senior.

131
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,060
Actually, I'm not that hungry now.

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,100
How about you sit here and eat?

134
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,820
Just eat. No one can eat as much as you.

There's basically no major issue now.

You can walk as soon as the bandage is removed today.

138
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,880
But I still need to remind you

139
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,380
to avoid strenuous exercise for the next few days.

140
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,020
Did you hear that, Su?

141
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
You'll be able to play tennis again soon.

142
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,200
Didn't you hear the doctor ask me not to do strenuous exercise?

143
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,730
Doctor, do I really not need to keep it immobilized for two more days?

144
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,420
That's fine, too.

145
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,540
If you want to remove the bandage a few days later,

146
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,300
that's not a problem, either.

147
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,090
How about this?

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,670
I'll change your dressing first.

For the next few days,

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,130
remember to change the dressing frequently by yourself. Okay?

151
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,940
Thank you, Doctor.

152
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,290
Why? Didn't you say that it could all be removed?

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
The doctor is just giving advice, right?

154
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,530
We don't have to follow his advice.

Do you want me to be crippled for the rest of my life?

160

What about me?

162
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,540
What I might lose is my self-esteem as a man.

to be careful.

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,300
How did you play the game?

370
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,530
Dismiss.

371
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,980
We were going to report you.

372
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,530
Now all the three of us have been reported.

373
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,490
It's all your fault. We've lost several times continuously.

374
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,870
Let's just play again, okay?

375
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,170
Come on. Let's start another round.

376
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,600
[You have a new message.]

377
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,890
Blake.

378
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,500
Are you there?

379
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,190
How have you been lately?

380
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,460
How's the progress on the new season's comic story?

381
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,370
Blake, I have some good news for you.

382
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,210
I managed to save the comic club through my own efforts.

383
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,380
Hard work always pays off in the end.

384
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,650
During these days,

385
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,050
I hope you'll be in good health and live a long life.

386
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,410
May you enjoy every meal.

387
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,710
Thank you.

[Psychological Test of Love]

389
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,250
Su Yancheng, what's going on with you?

390
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,500
I've been calling you, but you didn't answer the phone.

391
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,470
I've brought you my family's ancestral herbal plasters.

392
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,790
I'm even more anxious than you in treating your wound.

393
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,400
What's the matter?

394
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,020
Didn't I tell you that

395
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,440
I brought you some ancestral herbal plasters?

396
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,390
Where are you?

397
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,360
What's the matter?

398
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,080
I...

399
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,110
You rascal!

400
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,730
Be careful!

401
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,110
This tree looks nice today.

402
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,620
Good for you.

403
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,810
Your leg has recovered, but you didn't tell me. Are you trying to fool me?

404
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,840
I'm not trying to fool you.

405
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,140
I was going to remove the brace today.

406
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,640
I don't believe it.

407
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,400
Forget it if you don't believe it.

408
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:23,730
You're going to remove the brace?

409
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,280
So your leg has recovered?

410
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,940
Where did you pop up from?

411
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,070
Xiaoduo.

412
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,600
What?

413
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,000
Senior, I'm sorry. What's wrong?

414
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,810
Are you free this afternoon?

415
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,560
How about accompanying me to do an experiment?

416
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,170
Okay.

417
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,250
Didn't you promise to be my experiment subject?

418
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,300
Then let's do it together. We're working on the same project anyway.

419
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,100
Alright. I don't have anything else to do today anyway.

420
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,280
Then each of you can get half a day.

421
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,240
Each of us can get half a day.

422
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,060
Then don't do it.

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,880
Since your leg has recovered,

424
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,360
let's play tennis to decide on it.

425
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,710
Just don't play tennis.

426
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,900
Your leg has just recovered.

427
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,990
If you get injured during the tennis game,

428
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,010
don't blame it on me again.

429
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,010
Okay.

430
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,570
I'm speechless.

431
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,540
Whatever.

432
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,020
[6:6]

433
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,040
[6:7]

434
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,230
It's his last time to serve a ball.

435
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,480
Su!

436
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
Su Yancheng!

437
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,520
Su.

438
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,280
Su.

439
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,250
-Su Yancheng.
-Are you alright, Su?

440
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,170
I'm fine.

441
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,790
Are you alright?

442
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,240
Are you alright?

443
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,550
I told you not to push yourself, but you insisted on playing tennis.

444
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,940
Su Yancheng.

445
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,600
How are you? Are you alright?

446
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm willing to admit defeat.

447
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,920
Let's go check your wound.

448
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,640
Hurry up!

449
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,200
Senior, I'll send you a message later.

450
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,840
Xiaomiao, help me carry my bag.

451
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm fine.

452
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,850
Let me check it.

453
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,140
Relax.

454
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,530
It's okay.

455
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,670
Relax.

456
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,710
Indeed, your bones are fine.

457
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,780
What are you laughing at?

458
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,920
Nothing.

459
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,910
Tell me in a low voice.

460
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,020
You were lucky.

461
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,090
I told you

462
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,510
not to play tennis, but you insisted on it.

463
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,990
You played tennis and even fell down.

464
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,980
Don't you think it was embarrassing?

465
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,190
I really don't understand

466
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,250
why your relationship with Senior Yu is so bad.

467
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,800
We just have different ideas about the experiment.

468
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,100
I don't care.

469
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,020
I'm leaving.

470
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,720
Wait.

471
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,580
What's wrong this time?

472
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,920
Let me treat you all to some drinks.

473
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,420
I can take this chance to finish the experiment quickly.

474
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,360
Okay.

475
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,330
How troublesome.

476
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,600
Why are you imitating me?

477
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,410
How troublesome.

478
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,550
You're troublesome.

479
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,340
There are so many cakes. How can we possibly eat them all?

480
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
Su didn't know what Bai Xiaoduo liked to eat,

481
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,850
so he bought a little of everything.

482
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,490
Thank you.

483
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,030
It's my treat.

484
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
But he paid the bill.

485
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,620
He used my card.

486
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,930
Thank you.

487
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Let's begin.

488
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,400
The first question.

489
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,370
Please listen to the question.

490
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,570
When you're about to die...

491
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,560
When you're about to die,

492
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,140
you have three minutes left.

493
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,100
What would you do?

494
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,340
This question is too ominous.

495
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,640
A. Make a phone call.

496
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,980
B. Do nothing.

497
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,130
C. Seek revenge.

498
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,780
D. Have a good meal.

499
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,460
I would have a good meal.

500
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,180
You long for love,

501
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,320
but due to your inner struggles,

502
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,310
you're not able to take the first step forward.

503
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,440
What nonsense is this?

504
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,490
You made this up, didn't you?

505
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,360
Let me see.

506
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,960
What would you like to drink after breakfast?

507
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,420
A. Coffee.

508
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,700
B. Hot cocoa.

509
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,780
C. Milk.

510
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,990
D. Tea.

511
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,910
Milk.

512
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,160
It indicates that your ideal romantic partner

513
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,100
is someone who is quite intellectual with a quirky temperament.

514
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,140
A quirky temperament?

515
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,530
Xiaomiao, what about you?

516
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,850
I'll choose hot cocoa.

517
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,180
Your ideal romantic partner is someone who is mature

518
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,490
and can lead you.

519
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,460
That's quite accurate.

520
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,940
It's accurate, huh?

521
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,480
Come on. Let me take a look.

522
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,780
If you have many secrets in your heart,

523
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,390
who would you choose to tell them to?

524
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,140
A. Writer.

525
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,420
B. Comic artist.

526
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,500
C. Scientist.

527
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
D. Psychologist.

528
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,780
I don't think I would tell others.

529
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,810
[You're a person who looks strong with a broken heart. You want to be tolerated and understood.]

530
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Since they're secrets, I won't tell others about them.

531
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,920
It's time.

532
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,290
Then I'll leave first.

533
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,380
You guys keep having fun for a while.

534
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,700
Thank you for your cakes.

535
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,850
Senior Yu, I was just about to look for you.

536
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,510
Where are you going?

537
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,100
Aren't you going to have dinner?

538
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,990
I'm going to the library.

539
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,070
Why did they all leave?

540
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,160
Only the two of us are left here.

541
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,120
There are still so many cakes.

542
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,260
Senior, why don't you eat some more?

543
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,700
You should eat more.

544
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,520
Why is there a hair here? I'll replace it with another one.

545
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,550
Senior, are you sleepy?

546
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,790
Later,

547
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,980
go back and take a nap after eating the cakes.

548
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,910
I'm fine.

549
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,810
Just eat.
