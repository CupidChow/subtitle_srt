As a single father raising her,

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,620
I was inevitably careless sometimes.

160
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,080
Sometimes,

161
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,010
when I saw she wasn't very happy,

162
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,070
I would ask

163
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,240
if something was bothering her.

164
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,200
But she said, "Nothing."

165
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,930
"I'm very happy."

166
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,470
Actually, I knew...

167
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,120
she was lying.

168
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,070
But I

169
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,830
pretended to believe her.

170
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,540
So, we were both lying.

171
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,280
Later, I found out

172
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,080
that it was because Xiaoduo didn't have friends.

173
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,580
Actually, sometimes,

175
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,180

177
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,960
Maybe they don't want to worry those around them.

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,320
Especially when it comes to someone they love,

179
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
they become even more cautious.

180
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,890
They're afraid that anything they say or do

181
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,880
may diminish their significance in the other person's heart.

182
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,460
But sometimes,

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
when lies are told too frequently,

184
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,620
it indeed

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,270
makes those close to you afraid to get close again.

186
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,040
However, you see, when it comes to relationships,

187
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,890
there's no absolute right or wrong.

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,560
What matters most is how we communicate,

189

Su, Xiaoduo has brought you some fruit.

192

I didn't do well enough.

294
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,860
I made you suffer.

295
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,440

♫Run to you♫

297
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
These past few days, I wasn't angry

298
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,500
that you lied to me.

299
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,180
♫This very second, run to you♫

300
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,280
I just felt

301
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,750
that you didn't trust me enough,

302
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,800
nor did you have enough faith in our relationship.

303

♫From now on, no matter if it's in the dark or in the cold wind♫

304

306
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,480
♫My heart will never waver or change♫

307
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,300

I hope even more

309
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,670
that you can be yourself, free from worries.

310
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,000

There's one more thing I want to clarify with you.

314
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,680
I know.

315
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,360
♫Even if there are storms in the future♫

316
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,230
It's about you going abroad, right?

♫Even if the whole world forgets me♫

318
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,660
It's okay.

319
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,630

♫I'll still hold you in my arms♫

321

323
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,480
and after I wake up in the morning,

324
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,590
you can say good morning to me.

325
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,620
The food there must be different from what we eat here.

326
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,400
Anyway, take good care of yourself.

327
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,700
Eat well

328
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,180
and sleep well.

329
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,170
I'll wait for you to come back.

330
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,700
You...

331
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,600
don't need to wait.

332
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,800

Don't worry.

340
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,020
I know what you want to say.

341
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:57,510
♫My heart will never waver or change♫

Can you come somewhere with me?

350
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,450
Let's go.

351
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,730
This is the high school I used to attend.

352
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,800
What do you think?

353
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,940
It's pretty good.

354
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,960
People always praise youth,

355
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,720
reminiscing about their

356
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,020
sunny teenage days.

357
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,990
But few can actually see the darkness

358
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,440
behind the sunshine.

359
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,150
Tian Chuan and I were high school classmates.

360
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,790
He's a notorious hood here.

361
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,040
Once, he cornered me in an alley asking for money.

362
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
At that time, to protect myself,

363
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,440
I lied to him.

364
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,370
After he found out, he often bullied me.

365
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,680
Sometimes,

366
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,850
maybe because he was rejected by someone he liked,

367
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,890
or sometimes he bullied me because he didn't do well in exams.

368
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,100
The most ridiculous part was

369
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,720
that sometimes he didn't even need a reason.

370
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,800
But then one day,

371
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,290
someone in an owl costume

372
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,990
suddenly appeared.

373
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,220
That person was you.

374
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,680
But I knew

375
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,840
that Mr. Owl might not always be there to protect me.

376
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,650
So, I had to escape on my own.

377
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,930
Every time I was in class,

378
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,600
I would stack my books very high

379
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,570
because I didn't want people to see me.

380
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,440
I-I really hated school.

381
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
However,

382
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,120
I had to study hard.

383
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,950
Only by studying hard and getting into college

384
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,230
could I leave this place.

385
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,800
And leave everything from this place behind me.

386
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,080
So this place

387
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,400
was also somewhere...

388
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,690
I could catch my breath, I guess.

389
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,980
Let me show you something else.

390
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,470
Look at this painting.

391
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,370
It's Mr. Owl and Miss Flying Squirrel.

392
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,690
They left their groups

393
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,060
and escaped from controversy and conflict,

394
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,120
standing together on the mountaintop

395
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,580
and gazing at the distant sunset.

396
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,100
Beyond those mountains,

397
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,920
there must be hope.

398
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,510
I used to be

399
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,870
very insecure.

400
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,180
Now, I am...

401
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,870
still cowardly.

402
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,370
I can't even bring myself to face my own past.

403
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,470
So, I lie and conceal,

404
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,310
making myself appear as someone

405
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,520
who doesn't need sympathy.

406
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,310
I can't even accept myself as I am now.

407
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,600
If you can't accept it either,

408
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,550
I understand.

409
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,470
From the day I decided to be with you,

410
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,370
I had already thought it through clearly.

411
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,770
Thank you for sharing your adventure stories with me,

412
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,690
Bai Xiaoduo.

413
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,590
You were never cowardly.

414
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
You are the bravest

415
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,660
Miss Flying Squirrel in the world.

416
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,950
You won't live in the shadows of your past anymore.

417
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Because now,

418
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,920
you've safely arrived by Mr. Owl's side.

419
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,780
Thank you.

420
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,160
We will both get better and better,

421
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,140
right?

422
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,580
Yes, we will.
