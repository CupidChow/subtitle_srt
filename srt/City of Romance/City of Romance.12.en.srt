00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,590
I've read the first-stage investigation and research report.

4
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,050
It's quite good.

14
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,460
we've indeed formulated our

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,020

18
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,680
It's like this.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,190
Based on the results of the last report,

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,350
we'll rule out the commonality of lying

21
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,630
under special circumstances.

22
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,740
Next,

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,670
we'll focus on those individuals standing out in the report

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,010
and conduct targeted experiments.

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,040
Yu Shubo, what's your opinion?

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,220
Well...

27
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,360
I agree to try his approach,

28
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,220
but I don't think it'll work perfectly.

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,870
Because there are still flaws in his experimental direction.

30
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,430
An individual can't represent the whole group.

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,790
So, we need at least

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,370
three experimental subjects, or more.

33
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,760

What do you plan to do?

37
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,840
You spoke so confidently in front of the professor.

38
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,450
Are you really going to do an analysis of individual experiments?

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
This time, I plan to

40
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,240

sweat, and other reactions of the experimental subjects.

43
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,350
Also, during the communication process,

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,640
you need to emphasize the consistently accurate conclusions of the lie detector.

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,330
This will

46
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,420
serve as a deterrent and psychological suggestion to the subjects.

47
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,920
Eliminate the subjects' false sense of luck.

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,230

50
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,060
That's too subjective.

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,760
When selecting subjects, it is essential to set aside subjective biases

52
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,320
and choose individuals in an unbiased manner.

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,080
Why?

192
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,260
Because it's very sarcastic.

193
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,660
I simply hope you can be in a relationship.

194
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,730
You are still so inexperienced.

195
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,130
It better be.

If you use this, it won't leave a scar.

I'm sorry, Xiaoduo.

221
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,310
I was too selfish.

222

There's nothing to apologize for.

223
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,680
I'm the one who should apologize.

224
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,090
I mistook you for Blake,

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,150
why has your drawing style become so cute?

It wasn't like this before.

245
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,190
I've always had many different styles.

246
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,580
That's too different.

247
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,170
That's too different.

He hasn't changed much these years.

378
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,410
He's still the same.

379
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,480
Well...

380
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,860
I...

381
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,980
I'm going to the bathroom. Order whatever you like.

382
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,850
Order whatever you like.

383
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm going to the bathroom too.

384
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,120
Then I'll order.

385
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,300
What are you doing here?

386
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,660
Waiting for you.

387
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,090
The dishes have been served. Let's go inside.

388
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,940
It seems you've been avoiding me.

389
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,870
Do you think

390
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,580
I still have feelings for you?

391
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,320
No.

392
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,940
Well, you're right about that.

393
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,900
Yu Chi, I thought my attitude was clear enough.

394
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
And I've made it clear to you.

395
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,120
You're worried about causing trouble for others.

396
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,960
You don't want others to be sad or disappointed.

397
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,940
So you never easily refuse anyone.

398
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,270
But why do you always refuse me?

399
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,490
I've told you before.

400
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,390
We can only be friends.

401
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,080
Yu Shubo,

402
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,280
do you dare to admit

403
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,270
that in your heart,

404
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm different from others?

405
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,360
Yu Chi,

406
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,610
I didn't handle it well two years ago.

407
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,150
I spoke too harshly.

408
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,340
I owe you an apology.

409
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm sorry, Yu Chi.

410
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,820
Okay.

411
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,820
I forgive you.

412
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,390
Saying sorry is not enough.

413
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,180
You have to treat me to a meal.

414
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,400
Isn't that what I'm doing right now?

415
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,470
Today's meal is for helping you with the posters.

416
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Why do I have a bad feeling again?

417
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,900
Earlier, that guy

418
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,910
hit me in the chest with a net interception.

419
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,010
It hurts like hell.

420
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,490
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

421
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,520
Not okay.

422
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,320
Next time, give him an overhead smash.

423
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,360
He definitely won't be able to return it.

424
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,730
That's too much.

425
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,150
Lin Xiaomiao?

426
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:35,960
Hello.

427
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,990
Xiaomiao.

428
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,030
Let's go then.

429
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,220
Let's not be the third wheel here. Let's go.

430
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,450
Bye bye.

431
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,340
Come on, let's go.

432
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,550
Let's go.

433
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,490
Let's go.

434
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,710
Senior.

435
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,810
What kind of person...

436
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,170
do you think I am?

437
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,030
I...

438
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,930
I think...

439
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,590
I think you are a gentle person,

440
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,720
but with a strong and brave heart.

441
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,220
You're also very strong-minded

442
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,330
and persistent in the things you like.

443
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,190
There's often an urge

444
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,770
to want to protect you.

445
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,920
There's no such perfect person.
