I lost.

374
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,720
Your firepower is quite intense.

375
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,040
Let's play another round.

376
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,090
Alright.

377
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,940
I give up.

378
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,850
I surrender.

379
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Well.

380
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,780
What's wrong with you today?

381
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,990
You were fine before the holiday.

382
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,250
Given your level of being a homebody,

383
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,040
it's probably not someone from outside who upset you.

384
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:01,970
It was Bai Xiaoduo.

385
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,150
Between couples,

386
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,830
if there's an issue, communicate promptly.

387
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,220
But never give each other the silent treatment.

388
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,430
Make sure to resolve problems in a timely manner.

389
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,150
Communicate?

390
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,230
I can't even reach her.

391
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,890
As your senior in romance,

392
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,370
someone with a few more days of relationship experience than you,

393
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,040
I must give you some guidance.

394
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,610
Get to the point.

395
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,540
First, think about this:

396
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,890
before the holiday or in the past few days,

397
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,460
have you offended Bai Xiaoduo in any way?

398
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,520
Since I told her I wanted to visit her in Rao City,

399
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,320
she's been taking a long time to reply to my messages.

400
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,180
No wonder they call you an emotionally clueless guy.

401
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,270
And to think you're the top student in psychology,

402
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,600
you even had to tell her in advance that you're going to visit her?

403
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,450
But our conversations these past few days

404
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,130
have been normal, except for her slow responses.

405
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,590
I see.

406
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,620
Do you remember before the holiday

407
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,580
when we were playing ball together?

408
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
I asked you about your plans

409
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,860
with Xiaoduo for the winter break.

410
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,060
What did you say then?

411
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,680
I said I respect her choices.

412
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,240
Right.

413
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,980
That's the problem.

414
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,890
You said you respect her choices,

415
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,480
and then didn't try to persuade her at all.

416
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,030
So now she doesn't want to see you.

417
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,130
That's right.

418
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,320
She's definitely angry.

419
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,770
If I were her, I'd be angry too.

420
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,610
I... I was wrong to respect her?

421
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,510
Exactly.

422
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,250
Girls nowadays like to hear

423
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,880
unexpected surprises.

424
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Why do they all like domineering CEOs?

425
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,450
You should have been more assertive with her back then and said:

426
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,430
Stay and keep me company.

427
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,690
That's so cheesy.

428
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,170
Well, I mean, that's the general idea.

429
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,550
You see, you didn't even try to make her stay.

430
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
It makes it seem like you don't value this relationship.

431
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,980
It's okay.

432
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,940
Luckily, I showed up just in time.

433
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,840
This time, you need to pull out all the stops.

434
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,220
What do you mean?

435
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,630
Go to the city where she is.

436
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,920
Walk the paths she's walked.

437
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,600
Then show up outside her home.

438
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,540
Give her a surprise.

439
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,490
Let me tell you, bro.

440
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,550
It'll definitely move her to tears.

441
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,130
But.

442
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,890
you must appear suddenly.

443
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,930
You can't tell her in advance.

444
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,150
Could that work?

445
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,920
Of course, it's a must.

446
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,920
Since you're my bro,

447
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,930
I'll pass this trick on to you.

448
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,750
Good luck, bro.

449
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,720
But I don't know her home address.

450
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,500
What's wrong?

451
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,840
Great.

452
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,810
Great.

Couples should communicate promptly when there are issues.

457
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,570
I need to tell her about going abroad in person.

458
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,780
About her address...

459
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,720

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,190
Zhan as in dipping in white sugar.

559
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,850
I didn't know you were coming today.

560
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,200
I've just prepared four simple dishes.

561
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,680
It's okay, uncle.

562
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,370
These four dishes are already very good.

563
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,400
Come on, eat.

564
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,160
Come, try my dad's cooking.

565
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,200
Try your dad's cooking.

566
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,990
No, I mean try her dad's cooking.

567
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,910
Daughter, you eat too.

568
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,660
Eat, eat, eat.

569
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,730
Look at the state of you now.

570
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,870
You used to be chubby...

571
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,710
Dad, hurry up and eat more.

572
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,080
-I’ll do it myself.
-Look how skinny you are.

573
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,800
Here.

574
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,990
Thank you, uncle.

575
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,980
You eat, you eat.

576
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,060
You eat, don't worry about me.

577
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,700
You... You and my Xiaoduo...

578
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,520
Dad.

579
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,910
You, you, you... Have some water.

580
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,800
Okay.

581
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,360
Don't just talk, drink some.

582
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,060
I'll drink water.

583
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,130
Uncle.

584
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,710
You're usually alone in the shop.

585
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,730
It must be very busy, right?

586
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,450
Busy with what?

587
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,470
Let me tell you.

588
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,530
This shop of mine...

589
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,720
It's all neighbors and old acquaintances

590
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,090
who come here often.

591
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,370
The family with the most people

592
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,810
coming to me has three generations all coming for a massage.

593
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,810
You also studied Chinese medicine?

594
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,860
No, I studied psychology.

595
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,270
That is good.

596
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,680
I, I, I... I have this in my heart...

597
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,930
Oh my!

598
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,150
No.

599
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,070
It's not the same thing.

600
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,090
Well, Su.

601
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,160
Xiaoduo's mother passed away early.

602
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,990
I...

603
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,240
I raised her, playing both the role

604
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,020
of a father and a mother.

605
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,620
Now Xiaoduo has grown up.

606
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,310
As for me...

607
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm just slowly getting old.

608
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,140
Gradually...

609
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
If one day I really, really can't work anymore...

610
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,180
I can't work much now either.

611
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,410
I plan to hand this shop of mine

612
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,990
all over to her.

613
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,070
You understand? These three floors of mine.

614
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,300
Have some fish.

615
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,770
This is my specialty fish dish.

616
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,560
I'll do it myself.

617
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,000
Come on.

618
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,830
Make the fish head face you.

619
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,590
Okay, thank you, Uncle.

620
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,480
Eat, eat.

621
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,590
-Okay.
-You eat.

622
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,340
Have you found a place to stay?

623
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,920
It's cold outside. You should head back first.

624
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,950
Alright.

625
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,330
If you need anything,

626
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,650
just call me anytime.

627
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,250
You don't know anyone here.

628
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,410
Bai Xiaoduo.

629
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,320
You know I hate lying.

630
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,390
Haven't you hidden anything from me?

631
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,739
Is it going to rain?

632
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,889
Then I'll go get you an umbrella.

633
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,000
But I came this time

634
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,270
just to tell you...

635
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,690
[Bai's Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic]

636
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,640
Even three floors can't keep him here.

637
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,120
Xiaoduo.

638
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,630
Xiaoduo.

639
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,110
What's wrong, Bai?

640
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,340
Aren't you going to sleep?

641
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,790
Let's chat for a while.

642
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,930
Sure, let's talk.

643
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,950
Do you think

644
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,990
I talked too much today?

645
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,090
No, why are you reflecting on yourself?

646
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,230
It's fine.

647
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,580
This Su.

648
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,320
Is he your boyfriend from college?

649
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,030
No.

650
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,010
Yes, he is.

651
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,560
What's going on? Did you

652
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,610
have a fight?

653
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,440
How did you figure that out?

654
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,820
How did I figure it out?

655
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,880
I'm your father.

656
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,320
You think I can't tell?

657
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,930
Tell me, what's it about?

658
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,200
Well...

659
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,640
I... I lied to him.

660
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,870
His mother once asked me

661
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,420
what my family does for a living.

662
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,660
And then I boasted.

663
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,040
Dad, I didn't mean to...

664
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,120
No, no, no.

665
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,810
I understand.

666
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,720
It's just that I

667
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,480
couldn't give you

668
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,960
better material things.

669
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,290
What are you talking about?

670
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,420
Nothing.

671
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,190
I... I actually think...

672
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,350
I quite like this kid.

673
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,820
He's polite.

674
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,270
The way he drinks

675
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,270
shows he's quite sincere.

676
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,850
Daughter,

677
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,090
have you ever thought about

678
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,740
using a different way to communicate?

679
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,520
For example,

680
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,740
being very honest when you talk to him?

681
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,270
Dad, I'm afraid.

682
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,540
What are you afraid of?

683
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,870
I'm afraid of losing.

684
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,600
Sweetheart,

685
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,860
how should I put this?

686
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,810
You're a grown woman now.

687
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,380
From now on, whatever you say or do,

688
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,060
you have to be responsible

689
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,180
for your words and actions.

690
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,740
If you want

691
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,560
others to be sincere with you,

692
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,870
first, we need to be sincere ourselves.

693
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:11,960
Right.

694
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,690
Even if the other person doesn't understand,

695
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,220
at the very least,

696
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,540
we can have a clear conscience.

697
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,930
Silly girl.

698
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,640
Dad,

699
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,130
so...

700
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,390
Are you saying that

701
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,340
I should tell him myself?

702
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,200
Of course.

703
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,840
Then why were you at the dinner table today

704
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,070
blabbing away?

705
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,140
Wasn't I doing it for your own good?

706
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,540
Wasn't I?

707
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,330
Yes.

708
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,240
These three floors of mine...

709
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,740
I'm about to give it to that guy.

710
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,570
He has a big underwater world at his home.

711
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,400
What world?

712
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
They have an underwater world.

713
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,090
It's a fish tank as tall as three floors.

714
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,160
The fish inside...

715
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,520
You can't even speak properly now.

716
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,130
I also have that world.

717
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,840
I even have an ani... animal world.

718
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,880
Downstairs in your building.

719
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,730
Remember, remember my... this...

720
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,080
There's even a snake in the big medicine jar.

721
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,780
I also raise birds.

722
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,530
You... you...

723
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,730
You... you...

724
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,680
Your dad has good taste.

725
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,690
Immediately go abroad after graduation.

726
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,610
There's no room for negotiation.

727
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,360
I hope you

728
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,010
don't tell her about this yet.
