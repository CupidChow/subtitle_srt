1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,583
WILL AND TESTAMENT

2
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,791
Chunhe.

3
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,541
Liu Chunhe!

4
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,250
Grandma.

5
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,500
Chunhe.

6
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,041
The care home I was in was so comfortable.

7
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,916
If your ma hadn't begged me,

8
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,416
I wouldn't have come back.

9
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,291
Look at this.

10
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,708
I've only been away a year,

11
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,791
and the pickle jar's gone moldy.

12
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,500
Without me, this home would be finished.

13
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,875
Here's a tip, Kiddo.

14
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:10,583
Dumb women buy clothes.
Smart women like me buy scarves.

15
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,000
They're cheap

16
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,958
and easy to change.

17
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,041
My mood changes every day.

18
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,416
Why were you on the roof?

19
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,500
I was… looking at the sky.

20
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,375
The sky?

21
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,250
Good job.

22
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,250
I told your ma to cut the landline.
What era are we in?

23
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,000
Waste of money.

24
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,875
Hello? Who is this?

25
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,583
Uh-huh…

26
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,666
Gimme a sec.

27
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,750
-Chunhe?
-Yes?

28
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,833
You sent your resume to a training center?

29
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,583
Yeah.

30
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,875
They want a trial lecture next week.

31
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,541
Wanna go?

32
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,625
Yeah.

33
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,583
Hello? He'll go.

34
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,458
Yikes, look at this rain…

35
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,875
They're here already.

36
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,458
My grandson, Liu Chunhe.

37
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,833
He got top-tier at the college exams.

38
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,208
He's waiting for a college offer now.

39
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,500
That's amazing.

40
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,666
Doesn't he have cerebral palsy?

41
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,875
Doesn't mean he's retarded.

42
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,875
Come. Allow me to introduce you.

43
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,125
The core members of my choir.

44
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,666
Thank you all for coming
to celebrate Chunhe's birthday.

45
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,958
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

46
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:39,083
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

47
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,708
Hope your wishes come true.

48
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,458
Happy birthday!

49
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,875
Cheers!

50
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,583
For our stage, I think that

51
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,625
the park is better than a housing estate.

52
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,958
At least we won't be reported for noise.

53
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,291
What do y'all think?

54
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,166
I'm fine either way. Whatever you say.

55
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,125
Same for me.

56
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,000
As our lead crooner,

57
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,375
I can rehearse anywhere.

58
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,291
As for

59
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,875
performance opportunities…

60
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,250
We'll do the usual.

61
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,041
Go to my son's supermarket,

62
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,958
buy some goodies for friends and family,

63
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,458
then ask them
to watch us perform at the park.

64
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,875
Let's have another toast!

65
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375
-Let's do it!
-Drink!

66
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,291
Cheers!

67
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,583
He's OK. He has trouble swallowing.

68
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,083
He chokes easily.

69
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,625
It's OK…

70
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,458
Chunhe…

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,916
It's all right…

72
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,916
Kiddo…

73
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,875
Can you hear me?

74
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,583
We're home.

75
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,916
Liu Chunhe!

76
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,625
If his mother sees him like this,

77
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,625
she'll chew me out.

78
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,625
Then wait a little longer.
I can keep you company.

79
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
What are you doing?

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,083
You took my son drinking?!

81
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,625
No! I took him out to eat,

82
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,625
and he had a few drinks.

83
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,250
Didn't I tell you?

84
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,875
He's re-doing year 3.

85
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,875
He's supposed to be studying!

86
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,416
If you get him drunk,
how is he going to study?

87
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,083
Then don't.

88
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,750
What's wrong with taking one night off?

89
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,750
His basics are not bad,
and today is his birthday.

90
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,708
He doesn't celebrate it!

91
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,791
He's an adult now. What are you afraid of?

92
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,291
Chunhe…

93
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,583
Is your son's birthday embarrassing?

94
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,541
What am I afraid of?

95
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,083
Of course, you wouldn't know.

96
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,250
You don't even know

97
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,541
how I survived so many years on my own!

98
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,375
Christ…

99
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,583
Show some decency.

100
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,541
I've been helping with Chunhe
since he was eight months old.

101
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,125
If it wasn't for me, you would've left him
out for the dogs in the trash!

102
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,416
That's right.

103
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,583
If it wasn't for you,

104
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,791
I wouldn't have known newborns
can be abandoned in the trash!

105
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,958
Didn't you

106
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,958
do the same to me?

107
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,208
Bullshit!

108
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,458
It's dead…

109
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,041
My cat's dead.

110
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,958
What? How?

111
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,208
It's dead!

112
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,791
You're an adult now.

113
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,583
You gotta stop this bad habit.

114
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,916
What scam are you into now?

115
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,875
I'm playing a game!

116
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,208
Like hell you are.
Then why won't you show me?

117
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,083
It's my privacy. Why should I show you?

118
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,666
What privacy do you have?

119
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,166
What would you keep private
except for those scams?

120
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,500
Show me!

121
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,291
You're violating my privacy!

122
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,500
What's there to keep private?

123
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,166
Why don't I deserve privacy?

124
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,791
I need privacy, too!

125
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Look!

126
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,000
Chunhe…

127
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,208
In the morning,

128
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,500
in addition to upper limb training,

129
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
you have to work on handwriting.

130
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,208
OK. It must've been your handwriting

131
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,583
that affected your essay score.

132
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,958
At 2 p.m.,

133
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,041
he has a math practice test.

134
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,250
It's 120 minutes long.

135
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,708
Uh-huh.

136
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,041
Then heat up some milk for him.

137
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,833
They're gone. They're really gone!

138
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,958
What's on your mind?

139
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,791
I want to go outside.

140
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,875
OK. One minute.

141
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,833
What's up with him?

142
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,625
Hi, everyone. My name is Liu Chunhe.

143
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,916
We'll be looking at a poem today.

144
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,375
<i>Where sunlight does not touch</i>

145
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,583
<i>Spring thrives untouched</i>

146
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,625
<i>Moss in bloom are as small as rice</i>

147
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,875
<i>Like peony shining bright as lights</i>

148
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,958
This poem is named <i>Moss.</i>

149
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,500
It was written in the Qing Dynasty
by Yuan Mei.

150
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,333
What kind of disease is this?

151
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,958
He must be crazy!

152
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:39,291
Does anyone know what moss looks like?

153
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,416
Anyone?

154
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,291
Quiet. Pay attention to the lesson.

155
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,708
Go ahead.

156
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,125
It's green. And fresh.

157
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,625
That's great.

158
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,916
Look at this.

159
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,291
After a spring or summer rain,

160
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,166
go under the wall

161
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,125
and the gaps between stone steps.

162
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,166
They're fresh green.

163
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,458
They're tiny and mild

164
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,083
and lush.

165
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,291
Look at this.

166
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,708

00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,666
They're great lines,

176
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,958
but they're just embellishments.

177
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,041
Moss only has a supporting role
in those poems.

178
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,875
Only in Yuan Mei's work

179
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,708
does moss have a personality.

180
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,541
Even in dark places
where the sun doesn't shine,

181
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,583
moss fights to grow.

182
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,166
It may be small as rice,

183
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,500
but it doesn't give up.

184
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,250
It it not self-defeating.

185
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,291
It uses its strength

186
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,083
to live as dignified as peonies.

187
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,666
What a great lesson! Watch this.

188
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,041
Liu Chunhe?

189
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,958
-Yes?
-That's me.

190
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,041
Thanks for coming today.
You gave a great lesson.

191
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,625
We all enjoyed it. Good job! Really.

192
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,041
However, we have to consider

193
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,791
the feelings of the children.

194
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
But the kids loved it.

195
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,625
That's right. He loved it.

196
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,916
Yeah, he was great.

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,250
But look…

198
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,750
In his condition… He may have trouble…

199
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,708
He is physically capable.

200
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,708
I can't call the shots on this.

201
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,416
Here we go…

202
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,041
There's nothing a bowl
of pig intestines noodles won't fix.

203
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,291
If there is…

204
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,083
Add an extra fatty intestine.

205
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,541
That training course

206
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,916
has run its course.

207
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,833
There's no future in it.

208
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,208
I'm OK, Grandma.

209
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,166
Hey! Pig intestines noodles, extra fatty!

210
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,291
Diao!

211
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,000
Come sit with us!

212
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,291
Goodbye.

213
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,958
Come to the park for rehearsal later.
I've got good news.

214
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,333
I'm not going.

215
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,666
Why not?

216
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,583
Problems at home?

217
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,583
You've disrespected me!

218
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,916
I told you to shop
at my son's supermarket.

219
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,416
But none of you came!

220
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,458
Do any of you know
the importance of a drummer?

221
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,333
The drum is the soul of a show.
Every performer listens to the drummer.

222
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,541
I'm saying it loud and clear…

223
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,750
Unless my demands are met,

224
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,208
I will quit this choir for good!

225
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,916
There's an event organizer in Xin'an

226
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,250
who saw the videos I posted online.

227
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,083
They've invited us to perform in Xin'an.

228
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,041
OK…

229
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,875
They said they'll get the audience.

230
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,416
That means

231
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,041
we don't need to bribe audiences
with goodies.

232
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,250
Isn't that great?

233
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,041
That's great…

234
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,541
-And we get to travel!
-It's a good deal!

235
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,833
-Sure it is…
-Isn't it?

236
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,833
I say.

237
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,833
We still need Diao.

238
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,791
What do we do?

239
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,666
Who'll drum?

240
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,958
Exactly.

241
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,833
We can't perform without a drummer!

242
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,208
That's a huge problem!

243
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,916
Big deal!

244
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,125
I'll find one that'll decimate Diao!

245
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,875
I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CEREBRAL PALSY
IN AUGUST.

246
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,833
Hi! Feng?

247
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,250
You're not Feng?

248
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,916
A long time ago?

249
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,916
What's happening?

250
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,291
He's dead.

251
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,541
Hello, Zhao?

252
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,166
Let me have the number

253
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,916
for that retired opera drummer, Li.

254
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,250
We need him for a show.

255
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,458
You're a tailor?!

256
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,958
Seriously…

257
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,500
Are drummers so in demand now?

258
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,791
Let's just call it quits.

259
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,416
Wait!

260
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,541
I have a candidate

261
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,916
who's ready right now.

262
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,791
Why didn't you say so?

263
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,583
Who is it?

264
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,208
SEND

265
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,000
I've never played the drums…

266
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,250
Yes, you have.

267
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,166
When you were in kindergarten,
every day at lunch,

268
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,750
you bashed your bowl with chopsticks.

269
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,041
That's different!

270
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,375
How so? It's all hitting!

271
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,541
<i>This is Leshan and Tianfu Avenue.</i>

272
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,666
<i>Please alight one at a time.</i>

273
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,833
<i>And watch your step.</i>

274
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,166
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

275
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,791
Kiddo!

276
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,208
Do you know how to drive? Kiddo…

277
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,791
-Are you all right?
-Are you hurt?

278
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,541
-Are you OK?
-You should've sat down.

279
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,666
Don't touch him!

280
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,416
Don't take a bus in your condition.

281
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,125
What the hell did you say?!

282
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,041
I told him to sit down.

283
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,041
Why can't he take the bus?

284
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,916
The disabled have no rights?

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,458
I never said that. You're overthinking it!

286
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,500
-Apologize!
-Why should I?

287
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,541
Let me go! What are you doing?!

288
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,750
Apologize to him! Apologize!

289
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,625
Don't waste everyone's time!

290
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,291
Who said that?!

291
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,791
-He didn't mean it!
-Let it be!

292
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,916
He didn't mean anything by it!

293
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,333
I'm in a rush!

294
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,291
Let's go!

295
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,458
Eat slowly.

296
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,625
It's OK.

297
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,083
Drink some water.

298
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,000
Chunhe…

299
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,625
Did you practice writing?

300
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,125
Yes. He was great!

301
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,666
He even forgot to eat lunch.

302
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,375
He couldn't even hear me.
He was totally locked in.

303
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,625
In the zone.

304
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,666
I'm contacting cram schools.

305
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,625
When you retake the exams,

306
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,583
choose a college close to home.

307
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,125
Do you hear me?

308
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,208
I'm full.

309
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,375
You've barely eaten.

310
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,916
-Eat more.
-I can't eat this.

311
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,041
-I'm watching my sugar.
-It's nutritious.

312
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,375
When will you tell Chunhe
about your pregnancy?

313
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,166
A little later.

314
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,041
The doctor said
if I don't control my blood sugar,

315
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,250
a miscarriage is likely.

316
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,291
Folks say…
A mom with many children suffers.

317
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,666
Giving birth is a painful endeavor.

318
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,625
Much easier to never give birth.

319
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,333
-That's right.
-Especially people like you.

320
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,166
Like me? How so?

321
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,458
You think you know me?

322
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,833
I was feeling sorry for you.
You can't even tell

323
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,583
when someone's being kind.

324
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,250
I don't get you.

325
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,333
And you don't get me.

326
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,166
We both missed
the chance to get one another.

327
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,375
Whose fault is that?

328
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,708
What are you writing?

329
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,291
A complaint letter.

330
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,208
You think I shouldn't write one, too?

331
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,666
You should.

332
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,833
But it'll lead to nothing, kiddo.

333
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,208
Writing it is a result in itself.

334
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:31,291
I don't think it's right to lie.

335
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,666
I haven't been studying.

336
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,416
Kiddo… Are you a man?

337
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah.

338
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,125
Then remember this.

339
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,625
A man…

340
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,291
especially a mature man…

341
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,208
has to lie once in a while.

342
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,166
Here, choose a drum.

343
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,083
Kiddo…

344
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,416
Just help for a few days.

345
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,625
When Diao comes back, step aside.

346
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,041
You know how hard it was for us

347
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,416
to get a decent chance to perform?

348
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,291
-It's impossible.
-Kiddo…

349
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,875
We need you!

350
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:25,875
We really, really… need you, kiddo!

351
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,708
-Really?
-Really!

352
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,416
Really!

353
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,541
In that case…

354
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,916
I want a drum kit.

355
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,791
-Don't laugh!
-You see?

356
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:02,375
It will take forever for him
to learn the drums!

357
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,375
Why do you keep saying that?

358
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,625
Chunhe is nervous enough as it is.

359
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,666
Is that my fault?

360
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,666
You got a retard to drum.
It's waste of everyone's time!

361
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,166
For the last time,

362
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,041
Chunhe has cerebral palsy.
He's not a retard.

363
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,541
Either way, he can't hold a drumstick.

364
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,333
What's the difference?

365
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,208
The difference is that
you've pissed me off!

366
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,583
Stop right there!

367
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,250
All day long.

368
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,250
You said you'd get this guy

369
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,958
and that guy. Then what happened?

370
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,625
You got us jack!

371
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,875
I've put out records before!

372
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,708
And nobody knows who you are!

373
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,291
Are you all right?

374
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,541
Toss it back!

375
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,583
Toss it!

376
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,000
Chunhe! Stop your grandma!

377
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,166
She's fine. She's never lost a fight.

378
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,166
Teach him a lesson.

379
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,250
You're a grown man. Act your age!

380
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,083
Starting brawls like a child…

381
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,375
I wasn't fighting!

382
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,125
I was stopping the fight!

383
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,791
What about you lot?

384
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,958
I have no children. I'm single.

385
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,291
And you?

386
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:04,833
I'm not calling.

387
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,875
My daughter will kill me.

388
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,208
It'll destroy my family.

389
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,791
Since you know it's wrong,

390
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,708
shake hands and apologize to each other.

391
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,416
Sorry.

392
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,166
I was being rude.

393
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,833
Good job.

394
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,500
ARE COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE LETTERS
ONLY SENT VIA THE POST OFFICE?

395
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,750
INBOX

396
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,791
UNREAD

397
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,833
Can you get rid of this skeleton?

398
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,458
Why do you keep it at home?

399
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,583
It's bad luck.

400
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,041
Your pa and I

401
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,000
have to take a long trip.

402
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,541
It could be a while.

403
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,791
Keeping studying at home

404
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,250
and look after Grandma.

405
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,166
Don't let her get scammed again.

406
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,333
What's the matter?

407
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,250
Why will it take so long?

408
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:40,708
I'm going to sleep.

409
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,416
-Turn out the lights.
-Are you done?

410
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,375
I'm done. Then go to sleep.

411
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,250
If Normal University accepts me,

412
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,875
can I go?

413
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,291
Not that school.

414
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,166
Why not?

415
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,833
I don't want you to leave the city.

416
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,666
It's only 90 minutes on high-speed rail.

417
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,541
No means no.

418
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,791
If you must go,

419
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:09,333
I won't pay for it.

420
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,375
Go to sleep.

421
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,291
Chunhe…

422
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,958
My investments have been doing well.

423
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,625
When I finally break even,

424
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,416
I'll cash out to pay your tuition.

425
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,791
It'll be fine.

426
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,125
The weather forecast says

427
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,625
there's 30% chance of rain today.

428
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,458
Let him wear this.

429
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,083
If it rains,

430
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,708
put this on the outer layer.

431
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,500
Chunhe… You're 20 this year, right?

432
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,458
Yeah.

433
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,666
I thought you're two.

434
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,708
-Wash up.
-OK.

435
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,666
Chunhe, look.

436
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,750
I haven't received last month's pension.

437
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,375
So, I asked Social Security.

438
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,625
They said I have to download some code

439
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,958
to prove I'm still alive.

440
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,791
Otherwise…

441
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,541
They'll cut me off!

442
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,500
Old folks these days…

443
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,208
-Old folks these days…
-Hmm?

444
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,791
-Look in the camera.
-Hmm?

445
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,875
Open your mouth.

446
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,333
Turn your head.

447
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,291
Close your mouth.

448
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:58,166
Done.

449
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,166
You're so smart!

450
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,583
That's enough!

451
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,041
Don't push him.

452
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,125
Let him rest so he can drum later.

453
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,041
Let's give it a rest…

454
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,000
Is drumming fun?

455
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,500
It is.

456
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,500
You don't have to hold it like this.

457
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,083
I think it looks cooler this way.

458
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,666
Why is he here?!

459
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,458
I heard you found a new drummer!

460
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,166
Where did you hear that?

461
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,500
Someone who doesn't agree
with this decision, obviously.

462
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,583
It wasn't me!

463
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,500
I just…

464
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,708
A new drummer

465
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,541
was a collective decision.

466
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:41,083
I thought you got some pro.
Turns out you got a retard.

467
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,458
Don't say that, Diao!

468
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,083
Chunhe isn't a retard.

469
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,791
He has cerebral palsy!

470
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,416
He has no place on the drums.

471
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,291
He can't even straighten his thumb!

472
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,500
His pose is wrong.

473
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,250
His rhythm is off.

474
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,000
You can tell, too, right?

475
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,791
Right.

476
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,416
Wanna see drumming?

477
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,500
This is drumming!

478
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,416
Destroy him.

479
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,916
Good!

480
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,625
Wow!

481
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,458
That's amazing!

482
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,000
Since Diao came back,

483
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,833
-let's have…
-A fair competition.

484
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,458
Right!

485
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:53,875
Great idea!

486
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,916
-They can play side-by-side.
-Yes!

487
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,500
Let everyone vote on the better drummer.

488
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,750
Yeah!

489
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:04,166
Don't you say I bully disabled people.

490
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,541
Hello.

491
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,458
You guys rehearse out here every day?

492
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:42,416
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

493
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,250
Two to 4 p.m.

494
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,708
Inside that pavilion.

495
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,250
How about you?

496
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,791
Can't say for sure. Depends on my mom.

497
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,041
What's your name?

498
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,875
Liu Chunhe.

499
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm Yaya.

500
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,625
I like watching you drum.

501
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,000
Add me on WeChat.

502
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,708
You don't want to?

503
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,875
It's not that!

504
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,750
I don't have WeChat.

505
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,541
Then how do you contact people?

506
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,833
I…

507
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,083
I use a watch.

508
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:32,875
Sorry…

509
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,750
Are you still a student?

510
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:36,875
No.

511
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,958
I've graduated high school!

512
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,625
I'm already 20.

513
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:45,625
See ya, high school grad.

514
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,291
See ya.

515
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,250
God!

516
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,041
I sat 'til I got numb,
and you only got a name!

517
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:28,750
Yaya!

518
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,375
Yaya!

519
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,500
Yaya, wait!

520
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,833
Slow down!

521
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,791
Yaya, why are you holding a street lamp?

522
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,666
Look closer. It's a torch.

523
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,833
You look handsome when you run.

524
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,333
Running isn't all I can do.
I can somersault, too.

525
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,625
Password.

526
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,416
What?

527
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,125
I'd like to buy a farm.

528
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,041
You are leaning on my arm.

529
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,208
How's the wine?

530
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,166
Lovely and divine.

531
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm a little hot…

532
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,250
Wash up.

533
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,375
Get out first.

534
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:46,875
Get out!

535
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,791
At school…

536
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,250
did you take a sex ed class?

537
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,500
Yes.

538
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,666
Then I don't have to explain.

539
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,166
When a boy reaches a certain age,

540
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,458
it's normal to have reactions like this.

541
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,208
It means your body
is functioning normally.

542
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,333
-If you want--
-Later today…

543
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:05,416
I want to apply for a job at a café.

544
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,083
-Café?
-Yeah.

545
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:11,750
Aren't you trying to get work
from that training course?

546
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,708
I just wanna try it.

547
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,916
Saving up for dates?

548
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,041
Saving up for university.

549
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,583
Use this old phone for now.

550
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:42,958
If you find work, ditch the watch.

551
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,791
You really don't need me there?

552
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,250
Don't move.

553
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,208
Walk slowly.

554
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,458
Don't rush.

555
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,083
Hot latte.

556
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,041
-Pack it up to go.
-Sure thing.

557
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,291
Thanks.

558
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:22,375
Thanks. Bye. Sir, I can help you here.

559
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:23,916
Hi…

560
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,083
I'm applying…

561
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,000
for a job.

562
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,541
My resume.

563
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,708
-OK, please wait.
-Thanks.

564
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,291
Boss, a job applicant.

565
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,541
-Liu Chunhe?
-Yes.

566
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,333
How did you get like this?

567
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,541
What I have is… cerebral palsy.

568
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,083
Neurology's oldest unsolved mystery.

569
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,375
We've got a customer.

570
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:58,958
How long can you stand?

571
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,000
As long… as I need.

572
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,666
How far can you walk?

573
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:10,041
I can… walk for about ten minutes.

574
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,583
Then…

575
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,333
I'll rest and keep walking.

576
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,750
Show me how you walk.

577
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,916
Look…

578
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,416
A barista's work involves
memorizing coffee types and prices.

579
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,000
You'll handle money,
brew, and wash dishes.

580
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,958
It takes IQ and EQ alike.

581
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:33,916
I have to make sure you can… handle it.

582
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:40,875
All right.

583
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:57,583
All right, then.

584
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,458
All right.

585
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:37,583
Everyone! Today…

586
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:42,708
I'll be performing the Menu Reading.

587
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,541
Today… I will be serving…

588
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,666
steamed lamb, steamed bear paw,

589
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,333
steamed deer tail,

590
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,416
roast duck,

591
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,958
roast chicks,

592
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,041
roast gosling,

593
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:02,041
braised poultry,
simmered chicken, cured meat,

594
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,250
pig stomach,

595
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,125
dried sausages,

596
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,791
assorted crisps, smoked chicken tripe,

597
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:11,208
steamed pork,

598
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,875
duck stuffed with glutinous rice…

599
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:23,500
Jarred pheasant… jarred quail,

600
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:26,041
assorted braised meats,

601
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,833
pheasant, rabbit,

602
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:32,375
steamed pond frogs.

603
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,375
Betty Botter bought some butter.

604
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:54,333
"But," said she, "the butter's bitter.

605
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,958
If I put it in my batter,

606
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,166
it will make my batter bitter.

607
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,125
But a bit of better butter

608
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,333
will make my bitter batter better."

609
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,375
So she bought some better butter,

610
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,416
better than the bitter butter,
put it in her bitter batter,

611
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,666
made her bitter batter better.

612
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:19,500
So 't was better Betty Botter

613
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,083
bought some better butter.

614
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,375
I'm a mother pheasant plucker.

615
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,125
I pluck mother pheasants.

616
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,708
I'm the most pleasant

617
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:31,500
mother pheasant plucker
to ever pluck a mother pheasant.

618
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:33,916
I've plucked mother pheasants
my whole pheasant plucking life.

619
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,708
To be honest…
I just want to hire a normal person.

620
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:57,833
I am… a normal person
with a killer memory.

621
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,291
When did you spot me?

622
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,875
The second I left home.

623
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:18,416
I knew you'd follow me.

624
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,583
How was the interview?

625
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,625
It's all right…

626
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,416
Not hiring you is their loss.

627
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,583
Experts say that

628
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:45,166
coffee increases risk of heart disease.

629
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,250
Young'uns have switched to tea.

630
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:51,083
Cafés have no future.
They'll all shut down.

631
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,625
-Grandma.
-Hmm?

632
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,541
I need to get a bank account.

633
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,708
What for?

634
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,416
-To receive my salary.
-Oh?

635
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,000
You sneaky brat. You got the job?!

636
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:17,875
Yup.

637
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:21,541
Liu Chunhe!

638
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,750
You're gonna be rich!

639
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,666
You can buy any clothes you like,
get your own phone,

640
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,125
and go to any school you want!

641
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,750
No, Grandma.

642
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,000
It's not just money.

643
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:37,916
Having a job means dignity.

644
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,500
It's dignity.

645
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,000
-That's right.
-Dignity.

646
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,708
Exactly!

647
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,750
Eat up.

648
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,500
I'm so happy.

649
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,500
These are happy tears. I'm fine.

650
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,125
I know.

651
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:22,458
Gimme a hug.

652
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,583
I'm all right.

653
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,875
I'm OK…

654
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,833
You asked for fair competition,
then you smash my drum!

655
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,666
Did you all plan this?!

656
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:46,041
I swear on Chairman Mao,
I never asked General to smash your drum.

657
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,625
I got too excited.

658
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,041
-I couldn't control myself.
-Like I'd believe that!

659
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,291
Unless you smash that spaz's drum, too!

660
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:55,791
Diao! Come back!

661
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:16,958
They're fighting again.

662
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,416
Did you hear something?

663
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,083
See?

664
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,416
Pine cone.

665
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,125
You gave me a fright.

666
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,166
Here.

667
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,500
-Hurry!
-Coming!

668
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:25,500
Relax. Turn right…

669
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,541
Turn left…

670
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,291
Here you go.

671
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,375
YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE

672
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,208
Chunhe, you're rich!

673
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,625
YOU ARE THE STAR UP IN THE CLOUDS

674
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,666
I AM THE WEIRDO
WHO TRAVERSES THE RIVER OF LONELINESS

675
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:35,250
Press here.

676
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:37,208
Finished.

677
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:39,875
Not bad.

678
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,375
Good job!

679
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,958
…and then

680
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:59,125
search the app you want.

681
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,458
You should find the word…

682
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,541
"Install."

683
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,416
What are you doing?

684
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,833
I slipped.

685
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,625
Get outta here!

686
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,333
Feeling shy?

687
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:36,083
I've seen more men than you've seen scabs…

688
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:52,541
Grandson.

689
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,166
Hello?

690
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,625
<i>What's he up to?</i>

691
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,708
Chunhe! just finished his milk.
He's reading now.

692
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,083
<i>Make sure he gets rest.</i>

693
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:16,583
<i>Don't let him stay up late.</i>

694
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:20,041
Don't worry. I'm taking good care of him.

695
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:23,041
<i>I got him a rehabilitation appointment.</i>

696
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,833
<i>Tuesday, 10:30.</i>

697
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,416
-OK.
-<i>Make sure you take him.</i>

698
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,291
Don't be late.

699
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,416
-I won't.
-Where's Chunhe?

700
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,416
Chunhe! Chunhe!

701
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,833
<i>-Chunhe?</i>
-Uh-huh?

702
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:41,875
<i>I'll be home right after I'm done here.</i>

703
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:42,833
OK.

704
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,458
<i>Study hard. You can do it!</i>

705
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:46,875
All right.

706
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:50,833
He's gotta study now.

707
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,583
Bye!

708
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,791
Mwah!

709
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,625
There are still blood streaks on the eel.

710
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:01,875
Cook it longer.

711
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,833
-All right,
-Take it out.

712
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,083
It'll get rough!

713
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,500
You forgot the scallions?

714
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,958
-It's not done yet.
-Chopsticks.

715
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,250
Chunhe,

716
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,958
do you know the bounce stroke?

717
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,500
It takes technique.

718
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,541
A drummer's pose is important.

719
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,666
You seem so fragile.
You can't even sit well…

720
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,916
We're one chair short.

721
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,333
-And with your age…
-There's a chair in my room.

722
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:32,041
-I need these, too. I'll go with you.
-Let's go.

723
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:34,916
I gotta teach you "four" notes
and "eight" notes, too…

724
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,791
You sure you can handle the show?

725
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:58,625
I've ordered milk, Mom.

726
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,458
It'll be there in 30 minutes.
Put it in the fridge.

727
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,958
You seem to get on with your mom.

728
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,458
She pays my salary.

729
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,500
My current job is full-time daughter.

730
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,541
But I'll be unemployed soon.

731
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,291
Why?

732
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:29,208
I've been home for a year.

733
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,291
I realized…

734
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:33,250
we're no longer
what we imagined the other to be.

735
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,875
You've got lots of books.

736
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,333
Have you read them all?

737
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:42,333
Have you worn
all the clothes in your wardrobe?

738
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:43,666
No.

739
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,333
I've read all my books.

740
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,791
When someone isn't so limber,

741
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:55,125
reading becomes an easy pastime.

742
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,125
Don't swipe my mic!

743
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,708
There's no spicy fish
without Sichuan peppercorns.

744
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,250
But you can't throw so much in!
The numbness should have layers!

745
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,250
Dinner's still not ready?

746
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,000
One more dish!

747
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,416
Where's Chunhe and Yaya?

748
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,666
The bedroom.

749
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,458
That's fast!

750
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:20,166
Where did you find these poems?

751
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:24,250
Here.

752
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,208
-You wrote them?
-Yup.

753
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,666
-You wrote these poems?
-Yup.

754
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,333
You're a poet, Chunhe!

755
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,125
That's amazing!

756
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,750
This is for you.

757
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,333
"<i>You are the star up in the clouds</i>

758
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,833
"<i>I am the weirdo</i>
<i>Who traverses the river of loneliness</i>"

759
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,250
That's all?

760
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,083
Yup.

761
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,000
The rest

762
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,833
is still brewing in my head.

763
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,500
I like it. I'll take it.

764
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:45,583
What's in this box? It's nice.

765
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:47,500
Hmm…

766
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,875
It holds ashes.

767
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:53,916
Whose ashes?

768
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:57,541
-Thunder God's ashes.
-Who's Thunder God?

769
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:01,375
A stray cat I had.

770
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,000
I picked it up on the street.

771
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,250
It only had three legs,

772
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,458
so it walked like me.

773
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,250
I took it home

774
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:15,041
and raised it for five years.

775
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:16,666
And then?

776
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,291
It died.

777
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,000
It's closed.

778
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,916
THE SHARK

779
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,166
Hello?

780
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,333
<i>What are you two doing?</i>

781
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:49,000
Just getting ready to eat. What's up?

782
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,250
<i>Open the door. I don't have my keys.</i>

783
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,333
What?

784
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,125
Why are you home?

785
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,958
-Time to eat…
-Time to eat!

786
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,208
There's so much…

787
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:05,666
I'm already hungry.

788
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:09,291
These are my choir buddies.

789
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,750
Everyone… This is my daughter.

790
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,166
Would you…

791
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,375
Do you… get…

792
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:29,708
A boner?

793
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,458
As you can see…

794
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:47,000
I'm a normal 20-year-old adult man.

795
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,625
Thanks for asking that question anyway.

796
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,208
Some people think that

797
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:13,833
we don't need anything other than

798
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,750
eating and excreting.

799
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:22,916
What are you doing?!

800
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,375
People like my mom.

801
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:33,875
Come.

802
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:36,958
Drink some water. Look.

803
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,541
You're soaked.

804
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,250
I know.

805
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,916
Why'd you miss
the rehabilitation appointment?

806
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,083
That's on me.

807
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,875
I was rehearsing and forgot the time.

808
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,500
It'll be OK. I'll take him to the hospital

809
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,166
and ask Dr. Luo to slot us in.

810
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,625
Who was that giri in your room?

811
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,833
-Chunhe's classmate.
-Impossible.

812
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,666
I know all of his classmates.

813
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,041
I've never seen her before.

814
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,833
She's from another class.

815
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:13,208
She's re-doing her year, too.
They're studying together.

816
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:14,916
I wasn't studying.

817
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,416
I haven't studied at all.

818
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,458
I never wanted to redo the year.

819
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:24,708
Then what will you do?

820
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,250
Go to college!

821
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,041
I applied to Normal University

822
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,958
and I'm working at a café.

823
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,000
You're working at a café?!

824
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,583
-Yes.
-You knew this?!

825
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,291
What else are you two hiding from me?!

826
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,708
I don't know why I left him to you.

827
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:52,708
-You can't raise him properly.
-Don't yell at Grandma.

828
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,750
It was my decision.

829
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,291
I'll pay for Normal University myself.

830
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:01,208
It's not a matter of money!

831
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:03,916
What's the problem then?!

832
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,708
They will never send you
an acceptance letter.

833
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,791
I meet their admission requirements.

834
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,291
Even if you get admitted,

835
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,500
what then?

836
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,291
You can become a teacher?

837
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,708
Why not?

838
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,125
Teachers have to stand

839
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,625
and speak to students and parents.

840
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:25,708
Can you?

841
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,541
They can't even admit
all the normal applicants.

842
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,791
Why would they admit you?

843
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,125
Well, then…

844
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,500
Who gave birth to me?

845
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:53,833
Kiddo…

846
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,833
-Whose fault is it that I'm like this?
-Kiddo…

847
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,833
Do you dare say it?

848
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,000
Excuse me, Professor…

849
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,750
Excuse me, Professor…

850
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:35,708
if I have cerebral palsy,

851
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,333
would that affect my admission?

852
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,666
Excuse me, Professor…

853
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,625
<i>Hello. This is Normal University's</i>
<i>admissions office.</i>

854
01:11:56,708 --> 01:12:00,541
<i>Our office hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</i>

855
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:03,583
<i>Please enter your extension number</i>
<i>followed by the "pound" key.</i>

856
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:04,708
<i>Thank you.</i>

857
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,916
Your mom's gone.

858
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,125
Eat something.

859
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:35,125
Can I get a driver's license?

860
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:39,083
What for? Want to run far away?

861
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,583
If I jump off here…

862
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:46,833
That's the farthest I'll ever get.

863
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:23,833
Don't be nervous.

864
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,208
Long time no see.

865
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,916
Long time no see.

866
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,666
I'm really in trouble now.

867
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:28,750
I'm usually fine on the bus.

868
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:31,208
But I get carsick here.

869
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:33,625
How do you folks get a driver's license?

870
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,625
By driving.

871
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,083
Did you expect him to fly a plane?

872
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,458
Slow down, kiddo.

873
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,250
Fly a plane…

874
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,916
You're going up a slope! Not off-road!

875
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:58,625
One vote for Chunhe.

876
01:14:58,708 --> 01:14:59,708
DIAO, CHUNHE

877
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,541
One for Diao…

878
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,166
Another for Diao…

879
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,166
Chunhe…

880
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,916
Why is a whippersnapper like you

881
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,500
hanging out with an old folks' choir?

882
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,708
Diao…

883
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,583
Diao…

884
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:19,750
Chunhe…

885
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,458
One for Chunhe…

886
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,916
One for Diao…

887
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,041
Good!

888
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,750
One for Chunhe.

889
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,750
Diao…

890
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:33,708
One for Diao.

891
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:40,250
Diao…

892
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:42,958
Watch the step.

893
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,416
-Be Careful.
-Lie down flat.

894
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,458
Slow down…

895
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,375
Yes…

896
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,125
The ambulance just took him away.

897
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,500
Get to People's Hospital.

898
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:57,583
You can't go right now?!

899
01:15:58,833 --> 01:15:59,708
Wait.

900
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:01,708
Is your business more important
than your dad?!

901
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:02,750
Hello?!

902
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,541
Kiddo…

903
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,958
I already took the day off.

904
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,041
I'm not going.

905
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,750
I'll wait for Diao.

906
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:38,291
Kiddo…

907
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,541
You're a big brother now.

908
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,166
Do you want to go see?

909
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,166
Let me help her get to the toilet.

910
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,000
Come in.

911
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,375
Why'd you have the C-section early?

912
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,458
The fetus' heart rate didn't look good.

913
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:26,250
They were worried
it's placental abruption.

914
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,583
So they operated early.

915
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,625
She hasn't peed
since they pulled the catheter.

916
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:31,791
No more catheter…

917
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,208
They'll re-insert if nothing comes out.

918
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:13,916
Don't you touch her!

919
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,791
It's OK…

920
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,333
Don't cry…

921
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,541
It's all right…

922
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,666
Mom's pregnancy…

923
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,666
You knew all along?

924
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,458
Yeah. I did.

925
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:13,291
Why didn't anyone tell me?

926
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,041
Your mom had high blood sugar.

927
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,041
There was a chance of miscarriage.

928
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:21,708
The doctor ordered her to be admitted.

929
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:24,291
We didn't know if the baby could be saved.

930
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:41,083
<i>Who made me like this?!</i>

931
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,416
Do you dare say it?!

932
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,208
Chunhe…

933
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:49,416
It was you who didn't fulfill
your responsibilities as parents.

934
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,541
It was your mistake.
I've been paying for it.

935
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:57,125
I've slowly come to accept it.
I'm still trying to accept it.

936
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,833
Then you keep coming to remind me…

937
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,750
Chunhe…

938
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:06,833
You're like a gorilla who should be kept
in a zoo cage!

939
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:09,166
Don't ever think of leaving…

940
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,291
Don't ever be seen in broad daylight.

941
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:14,541
It would only embarrass
those who feed you.

942
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,291
So then…

943
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,666
People out there avoid me,

944
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,791
they're scared of me, and they mock me.

945
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:26,666
My mother is the one who truly hates me…
and looks down on me.

946
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,208
I know I'm the dead weight of this family.

947
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,458
I've known that all along.

948
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:38,708
So, why do you
still pretend to care about me?

949
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,166
You make me sick, Chen Lu.

950
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:43,583
You're a hypocrite!

951
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:45,791
Yes, I am!

952
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,708
I despise you!

953
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,541
I don't care about you! I don't care!

954
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,791
Liu Chunhe!

955
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,208
This is your fate!

956
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,125
And mine, too!

957
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,583
I never asked for this life!

958
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:11,916
Slow down.

959
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,500
Get out and wait.

960
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,083
Get to the curb.

961
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,458
Hey! Why'd you drive so fast?!

962
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,625
You wanna die?!

963
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:56,291
I hear that the cafe
is launching a new product.

964
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,791
That's right.

965
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:00,958
We'll soon launch the new
"love nougat candy".

966
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:04,541
It's made by Liu Chunhe,
our cerebral palsy employee.

967
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:08,291
Reunion Café is always committed
to charity and social welfare.

968
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,625
We want to help the disabled community…

969
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,375
If it wasn't tax-deductible,
he wouldn't have hired that spaz.

970
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:15,791
Quiet.

971
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:18,833
-He doesn't understand.
-What if he can?

972
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,083
How was that?

973
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,708
-Pretty good.
-Any screw-up?

974
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,500
None at all. It was great.

975
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,541
I have a gift for you all.

976
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,333
Hi.

977
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:40,333
Hello.

978
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,833
You scared me!

979
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,250
I was with my mother at the doctor's,

980
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,625
and I saw a dozen missed calls from you.

981
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,458
I thought something serious happened.

982
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,541
Here you go.

983
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,416
Thanks.

984
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:58,833
So, you really had no idea?

985
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:03,458
But when I saw her…

986
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,500
her stomach was pretty big.

987
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,958
Did you think she just got fat?

988
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,541
Or…

989
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:13,166
you didn't expect her to have another kid?

990
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,500
I've thought about it.

991
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,000
But now that it's happened…

992
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,000
I can hardly believe it.

993
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,375
That's their freedom.

994
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:32,625
Whether to have it… How many, when…

995
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,625
They're free to decide that.

996
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:35,958
Their freedom

997
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:39,833
shouldn't dictate where I study,

998
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:42,458
what city I go to, and what I wear.

999
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,041
They should let me be!

1000
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,916
Yeah… They should.

1001
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:50,958
So, don't let yourself become like them.
Selfish adults with double standards.

1002
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,416
I won't.

1003
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,333
Let's go out.

1004
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:10,625
I don't want to go home.

1005
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,041
-All right.
-Great.

1006
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,541
I need the bathroom.

1007
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:23,708
All right.

1008
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:01,625
Liu Chunhe!

1009
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,500
<i>You are the star up in the clouds</i>

1010
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
<i>I am the weirdo</i>
<i>Who traverses the river of loneliness</i>

1011
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,500
<i>The executioner on the bridge</i>

1012
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,416
<i>Is killing dreams</i>

1013
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,333
<i>The gunshots from the embankment</i>

1014
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,916
<i>Killed all desires</i>

1015
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:07,541
<i>I hold a worn-out address</i>

1016
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,125
<i>It says…</i>

1017
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:16,583
<i>"This lonely hill's edge</i>

1018
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,250
<i>Is where I see you at your most beautiful"</i>

1019
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:26,708
<i>But right now</i>

1020
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:31,875
<i>My bubbling heart has become numb</i>

1021
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,750
<i>My body</i>

1022
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:40,833
<i>Has become visibly old</i>

1023
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:51,041
<i>I will soon forget</i>
<i>How long I've been trapped</i>

1024
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,541
Don't worry.

1025
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:08,416
I see him right here.

1026
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:16,375
I gotta go. All right, bye.

1027
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:21,333
You're home.

1028
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,333
-Yeah.
-Hungry?

1029
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:28,250
No. I've eaten.

1030
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,958
What is this?

1031
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,708
A gift for Mom.

1032
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,041
For your mom?

1033
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:43,500
-What is it?
-Candy that I made.

1034
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:47,166
-You made it?
-I did.

1035
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:53,625
You made this!

1036
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,625
It's yummy.

1037
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,625
Your mom's blood sugar is still too high.

1038
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,583
She can't eat sweets.

1039
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,000
So beautiful!

1040
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,875
Kiddo…

1041
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,791
You're so smart!

1042
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,208
What's that smell?

1043
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,250
My pig's trotter soup!

1044
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,250
What's wrong, kiddo?

1045
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,458
Chunhe! What's wrong?

1046
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,916
Why are you stuffing yourself? Chunhe!

1047
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:35,291
Open up!

1048
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,750
What are you doing?! You're crazy!

1049
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:41,416
What are you doing?! Chunhe…

1050
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:44,416
Chunhe… Chunhe…

1051
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,041
Chunhe…

1052
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,791
Are you crazy?! Open up!

1053
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:55,875
Spit it back out!

1054
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:25,166
-Chunhe!
-Where could be be?

1055
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:29,958
-He can't even walk properly.
-Let's look outside.

1056
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,875
I need a break. I'm tired.

1057
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,375
If we don't find him…

1058
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:58,333
Wouldn't our lives be a lot better?

1059
01:35:00,416 --> 01:35:01,500
Maybe.

1060
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:06,666
But that's another life we can't imagine.

1061
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:23,458
Don't… Don't speak.

1062
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,041
When you were being saved,

1063
01:36:27,833 --> 01:36:29,375
they cut open your windpipe.

1064
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,541
The wound takes time to heal.

1065
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,333
Recently,

1066
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:46,458
I've been dreaming about your birth.

1067
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:53,958
Three doctors pressed my belly
to get me to push.

1068
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,416
I pushed…

1069
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:00,166
as hard as I could.

1070
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:04,000
I kept doing it wrong somehow.

1071
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:07,583
They said

1072
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,291
I didn't know how to push.

1073
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,000
All these years…

1074
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,708
I couldn't celebrate your birthday

1075
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,416
and never got you a disability card

1076
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:31,125
because I'm reminded of those words.

1077
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:35,125
I still thought of it
when I had your sister.

1078
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,583
I remembered pushing wrongly.

1079
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:44,333
I was worried I'd do it wrong again.

1080
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,250
Chunhe…

1081
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:51,875
That day, I didn't mean

1082
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:54,708
to push you away.

1083
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:58,333
I got nervous.

1084
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,000
I was afraid.

1085
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:05,833
This is

1086
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:10,541
my last chance to be a mom.

1087
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:15,125
I don't want any regret.

1088
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,083
Chunhe…

1089
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,083
I'm sorry…

1090
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:28,708
I'm so sorry. Chunhe…

1091
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,041
Kneel.

1092
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:13,666
TALK OVER THE PAST AND PRESENT
AND SPEAK FREALY.

1093
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,083
Warrior God… I usually play you.

1094
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:19,833
Today… I am you.

1095
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,250
Pass under the Warrior God's robe…

1096
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:43,083
You'll get through
all obstacles in your way.

1097
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:42,875
Tell me.

1098
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:47,458
Why can't people be like cicadas?

1099
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,791
Every time it sheds a shell…

1100
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,875
it gets a new life.

1101
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:47,125
You can do that.

1102
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:23,208
Kiddo?

1103
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:31,375
Why aren't you asleep?

1104
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:54,041
Does it hurt here?

1105
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:59,208
No.

1106
01:44:00,791 --> 01:44:02,083
It's just sensitive to wind.

1107
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:09,208
You've never told me

1108
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:13,166
where that scar came from.

1109
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:19,791
When I… went to Tibet,

1110
01:44:19,875 --> 01:44:21,083
I opened an eatery.

1111
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:24,416
I was doing the books one night.

1112
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:28,958
A blade this long

1113
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:32,000
was at my throat.

1114
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:33,250
He demanded money.

1115
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:38,500
I said that money was for my daughter.

1116
01:44:38,583 --> 01:44:39,791
I couldn't give it to him.

1117
01:44:42,791 --> 01:44:44,583
Then blood spurted from my neck.

1118
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:49,333
And then?

1119
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:53,125
A passing truck driver saved me.

1120
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,000
Does my mom know?

1121
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:07,125
I'll take it to my grave.

1122
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:10,000
Don't want her to feel bad.

1123
01:45:17,083 --> 01:45:18,500
I'd feel worse if she doesn't.

1124
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:30,750
Still angry at your ma?

1125
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:38,375
She didn't tell you about the pregnancy

1126
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,958
because she didn't know how to tell you.

1127
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,208
Maybe you think

1128
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:49,000
she's not a good mother
because of her attitude.

1129
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:51,791
But you can't blame her.

1130
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:55,958
No one taught her how to be a good mother.

1131
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:02,416
I had her at 21.

1132
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,500
After a month,

1133
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:10,000
her pa left me

1134
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,875
for someone else.

1135
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:21,041
I went to Tibet alone
to make money for my girl.

1136
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:27,416
And I was gone for over a decade.

1137
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,291
Your ma was already 15 when I came home.

1138
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:42,416
All these years,

1139
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:45,750
she hasn't called me ma once.

1140
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,208
I don't blame her.

1141
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:53,083
It was my fault. When she most needed me…

1142
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:06,125
I think…

1143
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:08,583
you're great…

1144
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:22,000
-Grandma.
-Hmm?

1145
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,708
Do you think…

1146
01:47:29,583 --> 01:47:32,000
my sister would want

1147
01:47:32,083 --> 01:47:33,875
a brother like me?

1148
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:05,333
By the way…

1149
01:48:05,416 --> 01:48:06,958
While you were in the hospital,

1150
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:09,416
a delivery came for you.

1151
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:13,541
-It's mine?
-Yup.

1152
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:40,958
NORMAL UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER

1153
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:44,666
Grandma…

1154
01:50:49,208 --> 01:50:50,541
Grandma!

1155
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,083
What's wrong?

1156
01:51:00,333 --> 01:51:02,250
-Grandma!
-What's wrong?

1157
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:04,750
Look…

1158
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:08,250
Normal University accepted me.

1159
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:22,375
Chunhe!

1160
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,791
Chunhe!

1161
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:27,958
Chunhe!

1162
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,750
You can be a teacher now!

1163
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:36,500
Normal University!

1164
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,375
Mr. Liu!

1165
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:42,500
<i>"Dear Liu Chunhe.</i>

1166

1171
01:52:02,458 --> 01:52:04,791

1177
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:44,500
Pass out the food.

1178
01:53:45,916 --> 01:53:47,708
-Hurry!
-You guys eat first.

1179
01:53:47,791 --> 01:53:50,166
I need the bathroom! Go to the toilet.

1180
01:54:12,875 --> 01:54:15,500
I told you so!

1181
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:44,416
Hey, I'm warning you!

1182
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:47,250
Impersonating the police is a crime!

1183
01:54:48,875 --> 01:54:50,833
Why the hell should I calm down?!

1184
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:53,958
Come again?

1185
01:55:04,916 --> 01:55:06,583
Grandma's coming. Let's go.

1186
01:55:06,666 --> 01:55:07,625
Grab your stuff.

1187
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:08,666
Whose stuff is this?

1188
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,000
Wait, everyone.

1189
01:55:11,541 --> 01:55:14,208
-I have an announcement.
-What?

1190
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:17,958
The police just called me.

1191
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:20,000
The organizer in Xin'an is a con artist.

1192
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:21,208
He was arrested yesterday.

1193
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:25,166
What about our performance?

1194
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:26,916
It's canceled.

1195
01:55:28,916 --> 01:55:30,208
However…

1196
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:32,041
since I am experienced in being scammed,

1197
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:33,500
I was extra careful this time.

1198
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:35,583
I haven't sent our money over.

1199
01:55:36,083 --> 01:55:40,166
So, our train fare is our only loss.

1200
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,625
That's a silver lining, right?

1201
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:45,125
I can return the money to you all now.

1202
01:55:53,375 --> 01:55:57,291
I don't know where you got this number.
I'm no sucker!

1203
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,208
What group?

1204
01:56:01,541 --> 01:56:02,458
This way, please.

1205
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:05,666
-The stars of Shuchuan Bus Group's
-Thanks.

1206
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:09,291
Love is Barrier-free Town Hall

1207
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:10,958
has arrived!

1208
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,125
Let's give them a hand!

1209
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:19,500
SHUCHUAN BUS GROUP'S LOVE
IS BARRIER-FREE TOWN HALL

1210
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:20,916
A month ago,

1211
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,166
we received a letter from Mr. Liu.

1212
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:26,250
Our executives were alerted

1213
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:31,000
and they immediately ordered
the driver to undergo training.

1214
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:34,833
We promise to improve service quality

1215
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:36,875
to provide

1216
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:40,333
safe travels for every passenger.

1217
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:44,333
Thank you, Secretary Wang,

1218
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,125
for setting a positive example.

1219
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:52,416
We have arranged some goodies
for Mr. Liu and his family.

1220
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,166
Friends, this is meeting of hearts

1221
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,166
and a transmission of love.

1222
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:59,083
Let us welcome Mr. Liu

1223
01:56:59,833 --> 01:57:01,083
to take the stage.

1224
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:02,625
Please,Chunhe.

1225
01:57:09,375 --> 01:57:12,791
Let us welcome Mr. Liu to take the stage
and say a few words.

1226
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:14,083
Chunhe…

1227
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:38,083
I thought I was called to this hearing

1228
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:43,125
because my complaint worked.

1229
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:49,875
I thought

1230
01:57:50,375 --> 01:57:53,791
I'd see opposing sides

1231
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:56,000
debate the issues.

1232
01:57:59,166 --> 01:58:00,625
Unfortunately,

1233
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,208
that's not the case.

1234
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,625
I see three bags of goodies

1235
01:58:11,166 --> 01:58:14,041
though I choke whenever I eat.

1236
01:58:15,833 --> 01:58:17,791
You probably can't imagine

1237
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:20,708
what that feels like.

1238
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,375
I'm not upset

1239
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:29,875
nor am I in pain

1240
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:33,416
because I'm used to it.

1241
01:58:39,708 --> 01:58:43,250
Instead, I feel a little fear.

1242
01:58:46,583 --> 01:58:50,375
I fear I can't even do a simple task.

1243
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:57,083
And I fear that
if those who do these tasks for me

1244
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:01,041
are gone one day…

1245
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,916
I may not be able to carry on.

1246
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:10,375
I've asked my grandma…

1247
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:13,833
I've asked my parents…

1248
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:17,250
and I've asked my doctor…

1249
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:22,041
Why does it have to be me?

1250
01:59:25,083 --> 01:59:26,416
I didn't get an answer.

1251
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:31,541
I'll never get an answer.

1252
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:37,083
In the crowd,

1253
01:59:37,166 --> 01:59:39,791
I've met all kinds of gaze.

1254
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:44,041
Gazes of pity…

1255
01:59:45,541 --> 01:59:46,958
Gazes of fear…

1256
01:59:48,458 --> 01:59:49,833
Even gazes of disgust…

1257
01:59:52,208 --> 01:59:53,875
But I've rarely

1258
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:56,333
seen a gaze

1259
01:59:56,833 --> 01:59:58,791
that dared to stare at me

1260
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:01,250
and tell me I'm one of them.

1261
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,166
These old folks showed me that gaze.

1262
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:09,541
When I see that

1263
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:12,916
they don't know mobile payment…

1264
02:00:13,666 --> 02:00:16,541
or identity authentication…

1265
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:19,958
I feel like I've found my people.

1266
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:24,166
Do you know the bucket theory?

1267
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:29,541
A barrel's volume

1268
02:00:29,625 --> 02:00:32,041
is determined by its shortest plank.

1269
02:00:35,666 --> 02:00:37,541
To this world,

1270
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:41,083
we are that short plank.

1271
02:00:47,208 --> 02:00:49,166
I just want you to see…

1272
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:53,666
no matter how small

1273
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,083
or broken I am,

1274
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,000
I am what I am.

1275
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:03,250
The meaning of happiness

1276
02:01:05,125 --> 02:01:07,333
should include every one of us.

1277
02:01:20,375 --> 02:01:22,500
HOPE

1278
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:45,041
-Grandma.
-Hmm?

1279
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:50,208
You taught me

1280
02:02:50,708 --> 02:02:52,375
mature men

1281
02:02:52,458 --> 02:02:55,166
should learn to lie.

1282
02:02:55,666 --> 02:02:57,583
It's my turn to teach you something.

1283
02:02:58,583 --> 02:03:00,583
A mature woman

1284
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:03,958
should learn to be honest to herself.

1285
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:23,708
-Grandma.
-Hmm?

1286
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:28,583
After you take me to school,

1287
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:34,208
I'll buy you a meal at the cafeteria.

1288
02:03:35,041 --> 02:03:36,125
All right.

1289
02:03:36,958 --> 02:03:38,583
And then…

1290
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:40,708
buy yourself a train ticket

1291
02:03:41,208 --> 02:03:43,500
and go wherever you want.

1292
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:45,916
Go look around. Go have some fun.

1293
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:48,541
Let me walk

1294
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,541
the rest of my path my way.

1295
02:03:54,375 --> 02:03:55,416
All right?

1296
02:03:58,083 --> 02:03:59,125
All right.

1297
02:04:37,583 --> 02:04:40,166
It's beautiful. It is.

1298
02:04:45,416 --> 02:04:50,291
<i>My friend, you are going afar tonight</i>

1299
02:04:50,375 --> 02:04:54,083
<i>Take this drink</i>

1300
02:04:55,291 --> 02:05:00,250
<i>Forget the sorrows of traveling alone</i>
<i>To the ends of the world</i>

1301
02:05:00,333 --> 02:05:04,500
<i>Get drunk until the end of time</i>

1302
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:10,000
<i>Once you drift away today</i>

1303
02:05:10,083 --> 02:05:14,416
<i>You may never stop again</i>

1304
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:20,375
<i>Let us raise our glasses</i>

1305
02:05:20,458 --> 02:05:24,791
<i>Cheers, my friend</i>

1306
02:05:45,458 --> 02:05:50,333
<i>My friend, you are going afar tonight</i>

1307
02:05:50,416 --> 02:05:54,333
<i>Take this drink</i>

1308
02:05:55,333 --> 02:06:00,000
<i>The sky is blue and free</i>

1309
02:06:00,083 --> 02:06:04,458
<i>You long for it badly</i>

1310
02:06:05,375 --> 02:06:10,000
<i>I only hope those carefree days</i>

1311
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:14,375
<i>Will cease being a luxury someday</i>

1312
02:06:15,416 --> 02:06:20,250
<i>Let us raise our glasses again</i>

1313
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:24,750
<i>Cheers, my friend</i>

1314
02:06:45,458 --> 02:06:50,416
<i>My friend, you are going afar tonight</i>

1315
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:54,125
<i>Take this drink</i>

1316
02:06:55,333 --> 02:07:00,000
<i>The green fields have no end</i>

1317
02:07:00,083 --> 02:07:04,333
<i>Much like our childhood gaze</i>

1318
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:09,666
<i>When I think of you wandering the world</i>

1319
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:14,583
<i>Just to take control of your life</i>

1320
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:20,083
<i>I suddenly can no longer</i>
<i>Hold back my tears</i>

1321
02:07:20,166 --> 02:07:24,625
<i>Cheers, my friend</i>

1322
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:30,416
<i>Cheers, my friend</i>

1323
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:34,750
<i>Cheers, my friend</i>

1324
02:07:42,541 --> 02:07:43,750
Right now…

1325
02:07:43,833 --> 02:07:48,750
the Oldies Choir
would like to perform "My Beloved".

1326
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:06,833
<i>I want to steal a lookie-doo at him</i>

1327
02:08:06,916 --> 02:08:10,875
<i>While pretending</i>
<i>To be looking at vase of flower</i>

1328
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:14,833
<i>All I can do is steal a lookie-doo at him</i>

1329
02:08:14,916 --> 02:08:19,083
<i>Like I'm looking at a painting</i>

1330
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:23,125
<i>If he knows, he might mock my foolishness</i>

1331
02:08:23,208 --> 02:08:27,083
<i>So, I can only avert my gaze</i>

1332
02:08:27,166 --> 02:08:31,208
<i>Though I'd like to say one thing to him</i>

1333
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:35,041
<i>She's standing there right next to him</i>

1334
02:08:51,375 --> 02:08:55,250
<i>I want to steal a lookie-doo at him</i>

1335
02:08:55,333 --> 02:08:59,500
<i>While pretending</i>
<i>To be looking at vase of flower</i>

1336
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:03,500
<i>All I can do is steal a lookie-doo at him</i>

1337
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:07,500
<i>Like I'm looking at a painting</i>

1338
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:11,583
<i>If he knows, he might mock my foolishness</i>

1339
02:09:11,666 --> 02:09:15,875
<i>So, I can only avert my gaze</i>

1340
02:09:15,958 --> 02:09:19,750
<i>Though I'd like to say one thing to him</i>

1341
02:09:19,833 --> 02:09:24,333
<i>She's standing there right next to him</i>

1342
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:33,208
<i>She's standing there right next to him</i>
