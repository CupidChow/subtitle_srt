2
00:00:55,413 --> 00:01:00,542
 Tokyo, 5 years ago  br   It doesn't exist where you and I live. 

3
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,425
 We always knew  

4
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:11,346
 that everlasting love didn't exist  

5
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,947
 anywhere in this world. 

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:23,115
 I'm going back to where I belong. 

7
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,825
 If I don't leave this place right away 

8
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,927
 I feel that I'll resent you forever. 

9
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,251
 I have one last favor to ask of you. 

10
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:46,054
 Please send my belongings to the address I wrote down below. 

11
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,809
 Goodbye, 

12
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,793
 Jungo. 

13
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:11,777
 If I had only said something back then ...

16
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:30,819
 Yun Oh. 

17
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,424
 You haven't read the book I gave you, have you? 

18
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,650
 When are you going to read it? 

19
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,559
 I'm sorry. 

20
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,394
 I will read it soon. 

21
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:07,230
 I think you're going to love it. 

22
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,165
 Just like I did. 

23
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,651
 Promise me that you'll read it. 

24
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,944
 All right. 

25
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,629
 I promise. 

26
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,524
 Are you going to come home late again? 

27
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,204
 I probably won't be back until early morning tomorrow. 

28
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:26,499
 You work too much. 

29
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,118
 Can't you cut back a little? 

30
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,214
 Not until I'm done with college. 

31
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:35,884
 Please wait a little longer. 

32
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:40,055
 I'll do my writing from home once I graduate. 

33
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,806
 Then, I'll be able 

34
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:46,076
 to stay with you every single day.

 To my love, Yun Oh: Being with you makes me so happy. 

37
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:24,199
    
  Ladies and gentlemen, our flight will be landing at Incheon International Airport shortly. 

38
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,868
 Please return your seats to their upright positions, 

39
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:31,597
 stow your tables and fasten your seatbelts.

 Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poetry, Poems By Yun Dong Ju 

41
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,003
 Up until now... 

42
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,173
 I've never believed 

43
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,376
 in fate or miracles. 

44
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,547
 I used to think 

45
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,752
 they were nothing more than embellished coincidences. 

46
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,951
 But 

47
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,322
 she was there 

48
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,353
 as if it were a miracle. 

49
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,467
Jungo...

50
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:57,699
Mr. Sasae?

51
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,116
Pardon me.

52
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:08,060
Mr. Sasae, my name is Choi Hong.

53
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,157
I'll be your interpreter for today.

54
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:17,087
This is Manager Lee Min Jae, your editor in charge.

55
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,922
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sasae.

56
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:22,742
Welcome to Korea.

57
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,139
Shall we get going, Chief?

58
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,015
This way, please.

59
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,771
 Beni looks like... 

60
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,941
 a different person, who has completely turned her back on the past. 

61
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,727
 Her eyes 

62
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,239
 are not shining like they did on that day. 

63
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,493
 I wonder 

64
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,720
 if Beni remembers my confession. 

65
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,040
 Tokyo, 5 years ago 

66
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,553
Are you all right?

67
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,033
No...

68
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,762
Honestly,

69
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,946
I'm not all right.

70
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,250
I can't.

71
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,854
As expected,

72
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:01,832
I'm just not built for running.

73
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,770
When I was little,

74
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,441
I used to fake being sick if I had to run a marathon in PE class,

75
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,303
because I hated running.

76
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,829
Really?

77
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:19,399
Then, why did you say you'd come running with me?

78
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,326
I've been...

79
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,164
wanting to tell you something,

80
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,037
but I'm a lot more nervous than I expected.

81
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,796
What is it?

82
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,340
Hong.

83
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,553
I've decided...

84
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,223
to tell you today no matter what.

85
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,515
Do you remember...

86
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,524
what I told you before?

87
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,903
I told you that

88
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,114
it must exist somewhere.

89
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,788
 Do you believe in everlasting love? 

90
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,004
 That's a difficult question. 

91
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,762
 It must exist somewhere, no? 

92
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,100
If I'm with you...

93
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,063
I feel I can find it.

94
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,317
No matter...

95
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,822
where it may be.

96
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,739
Ouch!

97
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,984
Are you all right?

98
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,446
Let me see.

99
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,959
Are you sure you're all right?

100
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,880
No, I'm not.

101
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,716
What am I doing?

102
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,754
Put me down. I'm too heavy!

103
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,748
Come on, let me down!

104
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,190
♫  I believe you're saying about love  ♫

105
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,060
♫  Even if it's not in words I know  ♫

106
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,930
♫  I know you're at the end of the road  ♫

107
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,800
♫  So I run to you  ♫

108
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,010
♫  through the night  ♫

109
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,530
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

110
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,980
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

111
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,150
♫  We're the only ones  ♫

112
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,997
Feels like a dream.

113
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,584
If this is a dream...

114
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,713
I don't ever want to wake up.

115
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,640
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

116
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,071
This isn't a dream.

117
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,940
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

118
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,355
I'll always be...

119
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,151
by your side.

120
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,670
Jungo.

121
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,502
Don't the words for "writer,"

122
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,121
"famous,"

123
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,674
and "highway"

124
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,509
sound similar in both languages?

125
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,120
Can you believe they're actually two different languages?

126
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,565
"Beni."

127
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,274
Beni?

128
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,487
The character for "Hong" is pronounced "Beni" in Japanese.

129
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,163
Beni...

130
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,997
"Yun Oh."

131
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,000
- Yun Oh?
- Right.

132
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,036
That's how we say "Jungo" in Korean.

133
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,297
Yun Oh...

134
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,966
Yes, Yun Oh.

135
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,100
Yun Oh!

136
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,947
Beni and Yun Oh.

137
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:51,165
I really like it.

138
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,930
 Seoul, The Present 

139
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,359
Here's the passport.

140
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,737
The room has been booked for five nights. Is that correct?

141
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,338
Yes, five nights.

142
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,039
Thank you. Just a moment, please.

143
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,254
It's been five years.

144
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,551
Yes, it has.

145
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,174
Did you come...

146
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,575
knowing that I was Sasae Hikari?

147
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,353
Of course not.

148
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,109
If I had known...

149
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,488
I wouldn't have come.

150
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,069
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

151
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,363
Take your time and get yourself settled in.

152
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,824
We'll start the interview in 30 minutes.

153
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,951
"You can go drop-off your luggage in your room first.

154
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,962
The interview will start in 30 minutes."

155
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,957
Shall we?

156
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,592
Yes.

157
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,774
 Back when we were together... 

158
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,904
 we couldn't stand being apart from each other for even a second. 

159
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,126
 Tokyo, 5 years ago  
 Beni! Beni!

160
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,498
Yun Oh!

161
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,501
How are you home? Didn't you have work today?

162
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,628
Beni, I'll be right down!

163
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,380
Wait there!

164
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,723
Okay!

165
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,636
All right.

166
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,788
Enjoy.

167
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,751
Is this  jjajangmyeon? 

168
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,379
Yes. Go ahead and try some.

169
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,405
Thank you for the food.

170
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,734
It's so good!

171
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,772
In Korea, we eat this when we move to a new place.

172
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,192
Also, we give rice cakes to our neighbors.

173
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,735
Is that right?

174
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,988
In Japan, people used to give buckwheat noodles to their neighbors.

175
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,282
Well, it was a custom back in the day.

176
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,142
- Really?
 - Yes.

177
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,776
Why the noodles?

178
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,541
Apparently, the noodles symbolized their wish to be good neighbors for a long time.

179
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,167
Is that right?

180
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,919
In that case,

181
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,007
please take good care of me
 for a long long time!

182
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,425
Same here.

183
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,895
Take good care of me for a long long time, too, please.

184
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,065
Wait a second.

185
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,840
Ta-da!

186
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,146
Yun Oh!

187
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,699
Thank you.

188
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,816
I'm so happy.

189
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,679
Yun Oh?

190
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,468
Wake up, Yun Oh.

191
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,227
You're late.

192
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,665
I'm sleepy.

193
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:44,441
I'm so sleepy.

194
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,520
No, you need to get up now.

195
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,756
You really need to get up now.

196
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,341
You'll be late for class.

197
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,930
 Sometime 

198
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,180
 Come up. See me some time. 

199
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,394
Excuse me. Two beers, please.

200
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,012
Sure! Coming right up.

201
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,450
Thank you so much.

202
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,960
Thank you, everyone.

203
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,620
Are you all having fun?

204
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,122
Thank you, Yun Oh.

205
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,624
This place is awesome.

206
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,252
I'm so happy right now.

207
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,898
I had a feeling you might like this place.

208
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,554
But isn't this place expensive?

209
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,749
It is.

210
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,320
- But that's all right.
 - Why so?

211
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,122
I'll just wash dishes later.

212
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:58,300
Hey, what's up?

213
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:04,282
Beni, I'd like to introduce you to someone.

214
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,701
This is my father.

215
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,995
He's the owner of the bar.

216
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,669
- Nice to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you, too.

217
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,505
This is my girlfriend, Beni.

218
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,923
- Your girlfriend?
 - Yes.

219
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,557
Seriously?

220
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,930
She's way too beautiful to be your girlfriend.

221
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,808
Why are you dating someone like him?

222
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,061
He's the one who's too good to be my boyfriend.

223
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,938
No, it's the other way around.

224
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,923
You're way too good for him.

225
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,945
You can work him hard as much as you want.

226
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,198
And if he ever causes you any trouble,

227
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,200
just let me know.

228
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,286
I'll punish him for you.

229
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,631
Yes, boss! Roger that!

230
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,249
Okay then!

231
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,585
What? Come on, Dad.

232
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,172
I'll be always on your side, Beni.

233
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,748
Okay?

234
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,493
Good for you!

235
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:08,221
Do you remember the rude girl...

236
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,373
who dumped you before?

237
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:13,768
- She is a thousand times better than her! 
 - All right, that's enough, Dad.

238
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,146
Why? Shall I buy you a drink?

239
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:20,316
- You should get going, Dad.
 - What's wrong?

240
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,043
Good luck, kid.

241
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,439
The rude girl?

242
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,336
So, why did you break up...

243
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:42,112
with that "rude girl"?

244
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,258
Well...

245
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,219
She just dumped me.

246
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,554
Really?

247
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,640
- Without any reasons?
 - Right.

248
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,143
She said I was frustrating

249
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:58,604
because I wouldn't say anything from time to time.

250
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:07,197
There are many things we can't express in words, no?

251
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:11,850
And you're trying to express them in writing.

252
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:18,750
There's something special in your writing
 that's all your own.

253
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,843
And that's why I like it.

254
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:28,133
You'll be a great writer one day.

255
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,649
Thank you,

256
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,885
Beni.

257
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,806
Yun Oh.

258
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,360
The fact that

259
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,522
I can love you tomorrow as much as
 I do today and did yesterday

260
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:53,451
makes me

261
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,811
so incredibly happy.

262
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,020
 Seoul, the present. 

263
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,399
Hello?

264
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,677
 Have you arrived? 

265
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,454
Yes, I just got here.

266
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:16,808
 How is it in Seoul? 

267
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm not sure yet.

268
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,031
 I should've come with you. 

269
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,987
 Hey, we just got the draft for the book earlier. 

270
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,323
 There are some parts I want you to check. 

271
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,284
Can't I do it after I get back?

272
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,996
 Well... 

273
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,330
 All right then. 

274
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,876
 By the way, I'll be in Fukuoka next week 

275
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,104
 - for Mr. Kudo's lecture. 
 - Yes.

276
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:49,799
 Fukuoka is actually pretty close to Korea. 

277
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,742
Yes, it is.

278
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,680
 Is something wrong, Jungo? 

279
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,832
 You don't sound that well. 

280
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,186
I'm fine.

281
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,189
I should go. I need to get to the interview.

282
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,109
 All right. Good luck with the interview. 

283
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,543
Thanks.

284
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,857
Okay.

285
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,310
Great.

286
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,725
Sorry. Could you look to your right?

287
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,660
Please look to the right.

288
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,693
Yes, that's great.

289
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,119
That looks great.

290
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,795
That's it.

291
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,206
Could you please fix the collar on your sweater for me?

292
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,292
Mr. Sasae, can you fix your collar?

293
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,551
Department Head,

294
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,785
can you help him out?

295
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,531
Pardon me.

296
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,362
Are you all right?

297
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,702
Yes, I'm fine.

298
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,248
So, I heard that this is your first time in Korea.

299
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,501
Do you know any Korean phrases?

300
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,671
"I heard that this is your first time in Korea.

301
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,515
Do you know any Korean phrases?"

302
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,285
I do.

303
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,370
I know "annyeonghi gaseyo" 
 ("Goodbye", said by the one who is staying) 

304
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,499
and " annyeonghi gyeseyo. "
 ("Goodbye", said by the one who is leaving) 

305
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:29,728
We don't have different greetings in Japanese

306
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,199
depending on whether you’re leaving or staying behind.

307
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:38,711
I think those phrases show thoughtfulness towards the other person.

308
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,332
The person who taught me those phrases

309
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:47,294
was the one who inspired me to write my novel.

310
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,868
"I know ' annyeonghi gaseyo' 
and ' annyeonghi gyeseyo. '

311
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,181
The person who taught me those phrases

312
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,434
was the one who inspired me to write this novel."

313
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,661
Oh, I see.

314
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:07,648
Could you perhaps tell us a little about that person?

315
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:14,347
"Could you tell us about that person?"

316
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,279
I apologize,

317
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,014
but I'd rather not.

318
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:24,690
But I can say

319
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,860
that we didn't have

320
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,698
a happy ending like the characters in this novel.

321
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,329
"I apologize, but I would rather not.

322
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,518
The way things ended between us

323
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:46,455
wasn't a happy ending, unlike the novel."

324
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:49,940
Is that person still in Japan?

325
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,785
Reporter Park, I think we're behind schedule.

326
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:02,913
Why don't we focus on questions about his work?

327
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,556
Oh, should I?

328
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,190
Yes.

329
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,352
Your novel depicts Kyoto as a place

330
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:13,607
that holds a beautiful memory for the two protagonists.

331
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:17,869
Is there a particular reason why you chose Kyoto as the setting?

332
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,530
"Kyoto appears in the novel

333
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,266
as a place that holds a beautiful memory

334
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,786
for the two protagonists.

335
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:29,881
Is there a particular reason why you chose Kyoto as the setting?"

336
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:37,138
Kyoto was...

337
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:47,815
 Kyoto, five years ago 

338
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:50,443
Amazing.

339
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,339
 Kyoto was the first place we visited 

340
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,775
 after we started living together. 

341
00:31:56,775 --> 00:32:01,204
 Beni told me she always wanted to see Kyoto. 

342
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,510
 Yay! 

343
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,360
 BIKE RENTAL 
100 BIKES KYOTO 

344
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:09,604
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

345
00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:11,231
Could we use two of these, please?

346
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,758
- Is that for the whole day?
- Yes.

347
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:15,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

348
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,309
This is nice.

349
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,620
 Nishiki Marketplace 

350
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,720
Wow!

351
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,762
It's so pretty.

352
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:13,059
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

353
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,336
- That'll be 1,000 yen  (≈ $7) .
 - All right.

354
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,173
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

355
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:20,283
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

356
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,953
 Doshisha University 

357
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,701
This place feels really nice.

358
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,811
It really does.

359
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,842
Oh, it's stopped.

360
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,880
Is that the place?

361
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,723
Yes.

362
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,976
This must be it.

363
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,222
Right, it is.

364
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,516
I've always wanted to come here.

365
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:54,609
 Yun Dong Ju 

366
00:34:04,277 --> 00:34:07,538
"Outside the window, the night rain whispers.

367
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:11,284
Outside this hundred-square feet room is a foreign land.

368
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:15,230
Even with knowledge of my sad fate as a poet,

369
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,007
I should still write a few lines.

370
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,754
After receiving an envelope filled with tuition money

371
00:34:22,754 --> 00:34:26,140
embracing the sweet scent of love and sweat,

372
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:31,110
I head out for an old professor's lecture with my college notebook under my arm."

373
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,500
Is that one of his poems?

374
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,877
Yes.

375
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,878
What's it about?

376
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,383
It's hard to explain.

377
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:46,303
It's about a lonely international student

378
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,588
who studies overseas.

379
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,499
Just like me.

380
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:55,979
Are you lonely?

381
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:58,239
Once in a while?

382
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:01,126
When you're not around.

383
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,361
Really?

384
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,754
Don't worry about it.

385
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:06,847
It's the same for everyone who lives overseas.

386
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,729
I'll stay right next to you.

387
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,654
Let's wait here.

388
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,468
It's really pouring down.

389
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,536
It really is.

390
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,171
- Beni.
 - Yes?

391
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,144
Yun Oh.

392
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,879
Yes?

393
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:46,231
Can I ask you a favor?

394
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,342
So suddenly?

395
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:52,070
Can we stay the night here?

396
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,272
- In Kyoto?
 - Yes.

397
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,625
There's someone I'd like to meet.

398
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,937
Good evening.

399
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:27,522
Excuse me.

400
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Welcome, but I'm so sorry.

401
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,305
The studio is already closed for the day.

402
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:37,806
My apologies.

403
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:42,167
I am... Choi Han's daughter, Choi Hong.

404
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,831
Kyoto is famous for its cuisine,

405
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:04,090
but I'm not exactly a good cook.

406
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,140
Here you go.

407
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,921
I don't know if it'll be to your taste,

408
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:10,465
but please enjoy the meal.

409
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:11,925
No, this looks wonderful.

410
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:15,411
Thank you so much for the fantastic feast.

411
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,478
I haven't asked about

412
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:25,314
your friend.

413
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:26,832
This is my boyfriend.

414
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:28,549
My goodness.

415
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,594
You look so good together.

416
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:36,224
We're sorry to barge in like this.

417
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,370
My father gave me your address

418
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,140
before I left for Japan.

419
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,835
He told me to pay you a visit if I'm ever in Kyoto.

420
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:49,570
I see.

421
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:52,824
Your father and I

422
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:55,844
studied at Doshisha University together.

423
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:59,030
He was an international student,

424
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,141
yet he was also the editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper.

425
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:05,771
I respect him more than anyone else in the world.

426
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,649
Oh no. Please dig in.

427
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:09,691
I'm so sorry.

428
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:13,562
I rambled on for so long.

429
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,096
- Thank you for the food.
 - Thank you.

430
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,430
Here you go.

431
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,437
By the way, where are you staying tonight?

432
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,918
We're going to look for a place nearby.

433
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:31,797
It may not be easy to find a place at this hour.

434
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:35,575
Most places only take reservations these days.

435
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,820
If you don't mind,

436
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,155
why don't you stay here?

437
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,808
It's nothing special, but you're welcome to stay.

438
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,310
- That won't be—
 -  Really? Thank you very much!

439
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,796
I've always wanted to stay at a place like this.

440
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,553
Please go ahead and eat.

441
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:13,988
Yun Oh, are you asleep?

442
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,914
You're so cute when you're upset.

443
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:26,042
I can't stop looking at you.

444
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,065
Yun Oh.

445
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,660
Are you mad?

446
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,170
Yeah.

447
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,274
Why?

448
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:00,451
Is it because I took her up on that offer?

449
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,531
Yeah.

450
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:06,767
Why?

451
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:10,579
By staying here, we even saved money.

452
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:15,007
It was Ms. Shizuko who suggested us to stay here.

453
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,056
I think she was just being polite.

454
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:26,720
She was probably surprised when you took her up on her offer.

455
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,638
Actually,

456
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,983
she might have thought that we were rude.

457
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,784
Fine.

458
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,037
Don't go.

459
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,465
For so long,

460
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,719
I've been curious about

461
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,307
what kind of person she was.

462
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,603
Why?

463
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,391
Ms. Shizuko was

464
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:16,027
my dad's first love.

465
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,648
Really?

466
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:21,282
Yes.

467
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,288
But, in the end...

468
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:33,252
they had to break up because my grandfather disapproved.

469
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,633
Later on, he met my mom and got married.

470
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:45,389
My mom says that my dad sometimes...

471
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,061
misses Ms. Shizuko, even to this day.

472
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:58,736
She believes that a man never gets over his first love.

473
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,576
Isn't that funny?

474
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,844
What do you think?

475
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,048
I wonder...

476
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:29,767
if one day,

477
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,729
we'll also break up.

478
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,442
No.

479
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,407
We're different.

480
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:49,245
We will never break up.

481
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,500
Even if time passes...

482
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:58,254
and the seasons change...

483
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,302
and even if the world changes,

484
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:10,766
we will never break up.

485
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,706
Kyoto was...

486
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,710
 Seoul, the present 

487
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:42,632
just a place that I chose.

488
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,837
He says that there was no special reason.

489
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:48,505
I see.

490
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,713
My next question is

491
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:55,293
what I was most curious about after reading the novel myself.

492
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:59,388
Do you... still have feelings for that person?

493
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,771
And I'm curious if you also believe

494
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:07,883
that everlasting love exists in this world,

495
00:45:07,883 --> 00:45:10,117
just like the male protagonist.

496
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:18,834
Chief?

497
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:23,965
"Do you...

498
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,887
still have feelings for that person?"

499
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:42,024
I'm regretting it.

500
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:47,780
For the past five years...

501
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:55,037
I've never once forgotten about her.

502
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,793
I'm sorry, but could we take a short break?

503
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,942
 For the past five years, 

504
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,696
  I've never once forgotten about her. 

505
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,741
- Thank you so much for today.
 - Thank you.

506
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,184
Thank you.

507
00:46:41,184 --> 00:46:44,287
Thank you for today, Mr. Sasae.

508
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:47,666
"Thank you for today, Mr. Sasae."

509
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,418
Thank you.

510
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:52,154
Thank you in advance for tomorrow.

511
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:55,932
A professional interpreter will assist you tomorrow.

512
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:57,993
Mr. Sasae,

513
00:46:57,993 --> 00:47:01,012
it was an honor to meet you.

514
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:04,190
I hope the rest of your visit also goes well.

515
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:11,857
After you, Mr. Sasae.

516
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:14,700
Yes. Thank you.

517
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:59,429
 That day, 

518
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:02,499
 she shouted at me with a look 

519
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:04,776
 that I'd never seen before. 

520
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:07,895
 That day, 

521
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:10,482
 a scar of regret... 

522
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:13,609
 was engraved in my heart. 

523
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,680
 Jungo, 

524
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,758
 let's break up. 

525
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,334
 If I had said something in that moment, 

526
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:40,062
  would it have kept me from losing you? 

527
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:21,950


528
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,800
♫  I believe you're saying about love  ♫

529
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,800
♫  Even if it's not the words I know  ♫

530
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:02,650
♫  I know you're at the end of the road  ♫

531
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:12,050
♫  So I run to you through the night  ♫

532
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:21,580
♫  Count the lights in the distant night  ♫

533
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:29,680
♫  Our distance is closer than the stars  ♫

534
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,150
♫  Tomorrow, when we are together  ♫

535
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,270
♫  I'll run with you  ♫

536
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,870
♫  Can you see me reaching out?  ♫

537
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:57,850
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

538
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:04,070
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

539
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:13,330
♫  We're the only ones  ♫

540
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:18,560
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

541
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,110
♫  Promise me  ♫

542
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,980
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

543
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,800
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

544
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,520
♫  Know we need each other  ♫

545
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,560
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

546
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,440
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

547
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,780
♫  I heard you whisper  ♫

548
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:02,380
♫  I believe you're saying about love  ♫

549
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,330
♫  Even if it's not in words I know  ♫

550
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:18,150
♫  And I wanna tell you in your words  ♫

551
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:23,880
♫  In any shape  ♫

552
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,400
♫  I'll be your meaning  ♫
