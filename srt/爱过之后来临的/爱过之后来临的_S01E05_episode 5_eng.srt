 "What Comes After Love" 
 Sasae Hikari, Book signing 

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,310
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,061
Thank you.

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,586
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,070


6
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:34,090
Sir?

7
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,521
Choi Hong.

8
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,611
You know her, right? 
 (In English) 

9
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,028
Yes.

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,747
Yes, I know her.

11
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:55,188
Could we... talk for a minute?

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,565
Okay.

13
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,946
I'm sorry, but can we take a short break?

14
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,675
Sure.

15
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,919
Let's take a break for ten minutes.

16
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,562
Yes. Sure.

17
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,010
How may I help you?

18
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:27,402
Please... Stay away from Hong.

19
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,768
She's my fiancée.

20
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,930
There must be some...

21
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,480
misunderstanding.

22
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,757
Misunderstanding?

23
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:52,244
There is nothing going on between Hong and me.

24
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,050
It's...

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,770
just this book.

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,114
It talks about her.

27
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:07,837
Indeed.

28
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:11,777
I cannot stand this book.

29
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,194
You are being a hypocrite.

30
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:18,687
It's disgusting to me.

31
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,604
No matter why you wrote this book, it doesn't matter anymore.

32
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:27,648
Please... Stay away from my Hong.

33
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,618
I'm going to propose to her tonight.

34
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,406
Would you do me a favor?

35
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,405
Please...

36
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:59,259
Promise me... that...

37
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:06,092
you'll never make her... feel alone.

38
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,307
Is that it?

39
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,020
It's such an easy one.

40
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,641
I see.

41
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,855
I'm sorry

42
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,525
but I should get going.

43
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,510
 Book Concert 
 "What Comes After Love" 

44
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,962
 It's such common sense. 

45
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:54,873
 Why didn't I understand it back then? 

46
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,980
 Tokyo, 5 years ago  

47
00:03:55,986 --> 00:04:01,563
 Hong... continued to run every single day. 

48
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:05,028
 Even on the day we broke up. 

49
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,139
Thank you for waiting.

50
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,065
Here's your order.

51
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:09,975
Let me take these for you.

52
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:14,171
 I can't remember exactly when it was, 

53
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,074
 but as our relationship started to fall apart, 

54
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:19,910
 she started to run for much longer 

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,246
 and much farther. 

56
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,767
Put it down here, please.

57
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,880
Please sign here.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,665
Just here.

59
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:48,199
 The Inokashira Fireworks Festival will be kicking off 

60
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,914
 in the middle of summer this year. 

61
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,682
 Last year, the Inokashira Fireworks Festival 

62
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:56,605
 was a resounding success... 

63
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:00,717
 The 50th Inokashira Fireworks Festival 

64
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:07,720
 One day, I asked her why she ran so hard. 

65
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,020
- Scan these, please. 
  - She said, 

66
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,482
 "No reason," and not much else. 

67
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:21,530
 We are now here at the Inokashira Fireworks Festival, 

68
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,991
 hailed as the longest fireworks festival. 

69
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:29,412
 It has been around 20 minutes since the fireworks have started. 

70
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:40,104
 I didn't ask her any more questions after that. 

71
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,105
 I was scared to find out the reason. 

72
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,536
- What's the meaning of this?
 - You're being annoying.

73
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,023
- About what?
 - I told you just now. Period.

74
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,774
- Huh?
 - Just do it yourself then.

75
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,802
What do you mean?

76
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:02,487
You should take care of everything.

77
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,281
- I've already made up my mind to move out.
 - Aren't you his mom?

78
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,886
 When my mom left me as a kid, she asked me a question. 

79
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,247
 "Do you want to live with your dad, 

80
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,834
 or do you want to live with me?" 

81
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,919
With you, Mom!

82
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,305
 I answered without any hesitation. 

83
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:28,576
 But that wasn't the answer she wanted. 

84
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,982
We have to look out for each other from now on. All right?

85
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,609
I'm counting on you, kid.

86
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,195
 I regretted this for so long. 

87
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:47,521
 I shouldn't have said anything on that day. 

88
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:53,085
 I realized that things don't go the way you want. 

89
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,190
 And also at times, 

90
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,211
 there are things that you shouldn't say. 

91
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,004
 Such were the things 

92
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,807
 I learned way too young, because of my mom. 

93
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:44,337
 Is unfufilled love still love? 

94
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,100
 What Comes After Love  

95
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,200
  Seoul, present  

96
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,070
Who was that earlier?

97
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,880
Do you know him?

98
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,074
Yeah.

99
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,518
He's a friend of a friend.

100
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,231
Shall we go for a drink at the hotel later?

101
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,556
Tonight?

102
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,834
- I don't think—
 - I know.

103
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,112
You have plans with the publishers.

104
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,906
I have other plans, too.

105
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,908
Let's meet up afterward.

106
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,942
I'll be waiting.

107
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,856
All right.

108
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,007
 Beni, 

109
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,909
 did you get home safely? 

110
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,858
 You've been gone for a month already. 

111
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,272
 But I feel as if... 

112
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,300
 I'm still stuck on the day that you left. 

113
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,910
 Why couldn't I... 

114
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,239
 notice how lonely you were? 

115
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,544
 I shouldn't have 

116
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,871
 left you alone like that. 

117
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,701
 I shouldn't have 

118
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,845
 let you leave me like that. 

119
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,130
 Why did I think 

120
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,675
 that we were together the whole time, 

121
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,353
 although I left you alone for so long. 

122
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,359
 However... 

123
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:58,771
 I'll bury my regrets in my heart 

124
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,454
 just as the poet says 

125
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,639
 in the book that you left me. 

126
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,424
 Sky, Wind, Stars and Poetry 

127
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,419
 I'll try 

128
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,066
 to walk down my own path from now on. 

129
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,548
 If I continue down that path, 

130
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,182
 I feel that 

131
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,957
 I might see you one day. 

132
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,980
  "What Comes After Love"  

133
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,797
Mr. Sasae.

134
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,425
Thank you very much for today.

135
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,935
You did great today, Mr. Sasae.

136
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,297
Thank you for your assistance.

137
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:06,743
- You know about the get-together tonight, right?
 - Yes.

138
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,912
But, where's Ms. Kanna?

139
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:12,892
Oh, she had other plans and had to leave early.

140
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:16,378
I see.  Should we get back to the office, then?

141
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:17,432
- Yes.
 - Sure.

142
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,859
Shall we get back to the office?

143
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,538
 Book Concert 

144
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,080
Where did you go during work hours?

145
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,148
Oh, I...

146
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:40,777
Something urgent came up, so I got permission before I left.

147
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,938
- Did I miss anything?
 - Something huge.

148
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,927
Was there an emergency surgery?

149
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:49,244
No, not that.

150
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:53,197
I created a huge event for you as a wedding gift.

151
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,668
"Event"?

152
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:59,370
What's with the mystery?

153
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,070
Don't pass out when I tell you.

154
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,970
I won't, so just tell me quickly.

155
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,998
- Come on, I need to head to the ER.
 - The director gave me confirmation.

156
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,601
Confirmation?

157
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,294
The training program in the States.

158
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,839
"Training program"?

159
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,108
Isn't that great? You owe me one now.

160
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,596
Seonbae!

161
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,215
- You should've told me before...
 - Oh, come on.

162
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:30,560
Telling you after the confirmation makes me look a whole lot cooler.

163
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,547
Do you know how fierce the competition among the fellows was?

164
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:39,799
Wow, you have no idea how much I begged the director daily,

165
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,780
do you?

166
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,907
I need to talk to Hong about this.

167
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm sure she'll be happy. It's a great opportunity.

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,454
She'll be a professor's wife when you're done,

169
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,449
and it'll be nice to travel around in Seattle, too.

170
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,669
- Do you think so?
 - You bet.

171
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,203
Trust me.

172
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,006
My wife absolutely loved it.

173
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,235
I'll tell the director that you're on board.

174
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,470
Seonbae. No, wait.

175
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,643
I'm sorry, but can I let you know by the end of the day?

176
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,104
I should really talk about it with Hong first.

177
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,146
Sure.

178
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,482
Of course you should get your wife's approval.

179
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,317
Call me later.

180
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,951
Yes.

181
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,662
 Hong 

182
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,445
 Cash or card, ma'am? 

183
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,514
 Card, please. 

184
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,817
 - Here you go. Thank you.
 - Thank you.

200
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,195
It's nice to meet you.

201
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm Choi Han, the president of Sodam Books.

202
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,002
Thank you very much for making your way over to Korea.

203
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,914
Nice to meet you, too.

204
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,376
Thank you for inviting me.

205
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,922
Why don't we have some tea in my office?

206
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,307
Please follow me.

207
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,932
You must be busy in Japan as well.

208
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,229
I really appreciate you giving us the time to promote your work in Korea.

209
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,614
Thank you very much.

210
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,158
It's a pleasure to be here.

211
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,862
Thanks to your help,

212
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,824
the book signing event went well today.

213
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,410
Is this

214
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,703
your first time in Korea?

215
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,371
It is.

216
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,424
It took me so long to visit somewhere so close by.

217
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,305
We're close but also far at the same time.

218
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,343
Your Japanese is very good, Mr. Choi.

219
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,512
Right.

220
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,431
I was an overseas student in Japan,

221
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,584
and I also worked there for about five years

222
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:42,545
as a foreign correspondent for a newspaper company.

223
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:45,664
You were there for quite a while.

224
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,684
Maybe that was the reason

225
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:52,821
why I was deeply touched by your book.

226
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,934
Thank you.

227
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,952
As I read through your book,

228
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,081
a thought passed through my mind.

229
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,284
I wondered if love ever had an ending.

230
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,048
There's definitely a beginning,

231
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,118
but I don't ever remember seeing an ending.

232
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,157
This book also seems to have

233
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:23,268
the same message in it.

234
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,231
Right.

235
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,725
It seems I've become wordy in my old age.

236
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,822
My daughter tells me

237
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,032
that I'm going through a mid-life crisis.

238
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,277
Enjoy your tea.

239
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:42,387
Thank you.

240
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,260
Please look around upstairs as well.

241
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,762
Our employees are there.

242
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,373
Although there's not much to look at.

243
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,113
I look forward to working with you.

244
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,465
"I look forward to working with you."

245
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,366
- Thank you, sir.
 - Likewise, Mr. Sasae.

246
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,660
Everyone here is a fan of your work.

247
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,814
- Oh, right. The autographs!
 - You're so handsome.

248
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,765
"You're so handsome."

249
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,977
Since you're here, could we also get some autographs?

250
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:14,331
"Could we also get some autographs?"

251
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:15,982
Of course.

252
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,517
Please.

253
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,181
Should I do it here?

254
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,767
Yes, please.

255
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,661
All right.

256
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,080
Thank you for your kindness.

257
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,156
Likewise.

258
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,068
 Spring blossoms are the response to winter snowflakes. 

259
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,709
Are you done, Mr. Sasae?

260
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:00,228
No, not yet.

261
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,081
By the way...

262
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,470
Is Ms. Choi Hong here?

263
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,640
She's working out of the office today.

264
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,435
After you are done,

265
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,797
we'll all go to the restaurant together.

266
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,282
All right. Understood.

267
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,254
The autograph...

268
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,911
Oh, I see.

269
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:36,155
- I'll give it a shot after dinner.
 - Sure.

270
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,547
Are you coming back from Mr. Han's office?

271
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,651
Yes.

272
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,062
You know we're having dinner with Mr. Sasae, right?

273
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,907
I already have plans with Min Jun, so...

274
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,517
I see.

275
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,394
You should at least drop by

276
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,321
and tell Min Jun that you'll be a bit late.

277
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:21,359
- I'll call him and ask.
 - All right.

278
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm going in Manager Lee's car. I'll see you later.

279
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,767
 What Comes After Love 

280
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,202
Hey, Assistant Yun. Can you talk for a moment?

281
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:15,080
 Yes, Department Head. What is it? 

282
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,339
I need to ask you a favor.

283
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,968
That's right.

284
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,449
Is Harmonica Alley by Kichijoji Station

285
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:28,859
still a popular shopping spot?

286
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:33,599
Have you been to Harmonica Alley?

287
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,033
No.

288
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:38,269
My daughter lived in Kichijoji

289
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,313
when she was studying in Japan.

290
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:44,549
I remember hearing about it from her then.

291
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,820
I see.

292
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,116
She's currently working at Sodam Books as well.

293
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,119
Do you remember the interpreter

294
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,789
who came to meet you at the airport?

295
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,824
That was my daughter.

296
00:24:57,824 --> 00:24:58,974
Yes.

297
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:01,017
I've heard about her.

298
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,226
Hey, you're here.

299
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,992
Take my seat, Department Head.

300
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:19,669
Thank you.

301
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,875
We should bring out the cake now that she's here.

302
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,409
Sure.

303
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,588
We just need the candles.

304
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,797
Why did you have to wait?

305
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:33,674
We just couldn't start without you.

306
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,686
All right, then.

307
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:46,746
Shall we?

308
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:50,317

00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,400
Mr. Sasae.

314
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,694
Happy Birthday.

315
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,876
Thank you very much, everyone.

316
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:24,226
Go ahead and blow them out.

317
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:26,235
Thank you.

318
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,431
I really like Mont Blanc cakes.

319
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,473
Oh, right.

320
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:42,001
Department Head Choi chose it for you.

321
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,364
I see.

322
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,333
Excuse me, Mr. Sasae.

323
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,279
Can I ask you a question as a fan?

324
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,879
"Can I ask you a question as a fan?"

325
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,925
Yes. Of course.

326
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,387
What happened between you and the woman

327
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,456
who was the model for the female lead?

328
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,275
"What happened between you and the woman

329
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,819
who was the model for the female lead?"

330
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,112
The story in the book has a happy ending...

331
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,611
but it wasn't the case in real life.

332
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,706
Since I failed to see how lonely she was,

333
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,034
she left for Korea

334
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,588
without saying a word.

335
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,100
  Tokyo, 5 years ago  

336
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,243
Hey, Rock. It's me. Is something wrong?

337
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,332
Is something wrong?

338
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,918
 Oh, Eonni, why wouldn't you answer the phone? 

339
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:16,003
Sorry. It's raining, so I was bringing in the laundry.

340
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,840
 This is so bad. What's going to happen to us? 

341
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,134
Why? What's going on?

342
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,578
 Eonni, what are we going to do? 

343
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,890
 I think Dad's publishing company went out of business. 

344
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,041
What?

345
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,378
 I only just heard from Mom earlier. 

346
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:35,148
 Dad apparently filed for bankruptcy yesterday. 

347
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,192
What?

348
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:38,527
Bankruptcy?

349
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,737
 I'm so scared, Eonni! 

350
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:44,241
 I couldn't contact Dad all day, 

351
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,184
 and Mom... 

352
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,925
 Beni 

353
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,354
 Beni 

354
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,472
What am I doing here?

355
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,285
Beni.

356
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,226
You're still up?

357
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:48,761
Yes.

358
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,291
I was waiting for you.

359
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,900
Today one of our star writers suddenly passed away.

360
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,787
Sure.

361
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,555
There's always a reason for you, Jungo.

362
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:09,650
And those reasons are more important to you than me.

363
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,980
I actually knew him personally.

364
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,065
I even had drinks at his house once.

365
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,986
You could have given me a call, at least.

366
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,030
I couldn't help it. It was so hectic today.

367
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,659
We couldn't stop receiving calls from the press.

368
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,662
Everyone else went to the funeral.

369
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:30,414
I was all by myself at the office.

370
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,183
Couldn't you even make a phone call?

371
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:34,717
Beni...

372
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,462
It's not like I was out having fun.

373
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,632
Can't you just say that you're sorry?

374
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,425
Is it so hard to apologize?

375
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,846
Do you even know how I feel right now?

376
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,781
You don't even know that yet,

377
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:50,041
but you're busy talking about yourself.

378
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:53,036
Just say you're sorry.

379
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:55,981
No one will be bothered by you for apologizing.

380
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,910
Why can't you say you're sorry?

381
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,800
- Beni...
 - What? Am I wrong?

382
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,207
I know.

383
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:10,044
You don't even care about me anymore.

384
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,040
You have no idea

385
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,049
how I've been doing

386
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,001
or what I'm worried about.

387
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,897
I was working really hard all day.

388
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:23,717
Does that mean you can break our promises?

389
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:28,055
Don't you remember we promised to talk over dinner tonight?

390
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,323
What's the point of making promises?

391
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,682
You might as well do nothing but work.

392
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,020
Why do you even make promises?

393
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,105
Why am I the only one who is worried

394
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,857
and who is  always waiting?

395
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,652
This isn't easy for me, either!

396
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,695
Do you think I like living like this?

397
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,948
We see each other at home, anyway.

398
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:49,266
When one is busy, promises can't always be kept.

399
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,379
Why can't you understand that?

400
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,054
So

401
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,597
are you saying...

402
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,178
that it's all my fault?

403
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,180
Beni. That's not what I meant—

404
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,682
Please! 
 (switches to Korean) 

405
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,484
Can you please just say you're sorry?

406
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,700
Do you know why this is so hard for me?

407
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,800
You always turn me into a bad person when I deserve an apology.

408
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,460
It's your fault, Jungo!

409
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,089
You were the one who neglected me and left me alone.

410
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:30,801
How many times do I need to tell you not to leave me by myself?

411
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:35,237
I'm in a foreign country, and I'm all alone without you.

412
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:40,009
Why do you leave me by myself and make me feel lonely?

413
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,380
Do you know 
 (Japanese again) 

414
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,746
what happened today?

415
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,264
Did something happen back home?

416
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,232
Nothing.

417
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,575
Jungo.

418
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,279
Let's

419
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,245
break up.

420
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,711
- Beni...
 - I'm...

421
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,048
too tired.

422
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,387
I can't...

423
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,392
live like this anymore.

424
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,540
  Seoul, present  

425
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,512
If you failed to understand her loneliness...

426
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:53,263
doesn't that mean that your love for her changed?

427
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,773
No.

428
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,696
My love has never changed.

429
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,908
I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me.

430
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,619
I have a prior engagement.

431
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,035
You're leaving already?

432
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,431
I'm already late for it.

433
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,708
I'm sorry.

434
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,876
Mr. Sasae.

435
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,395
I look forward to working with you at Sodam Books.

436
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:27,271
Hey.

437
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,815
Sorry. Did you have to wait long?

438
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:33,752
My dad was insisting that I stop by the get-together.

439
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:36,296
Don't worry about it. Did you eat?

440
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,354
No.

441
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:40,448
What should we get?

442
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,120
How about some shrimp? It's your favorite.

443
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,413
Or scallops?

444
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,847
Sure.

445
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:48,257
I'm good with anything you like.

446
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,920
Did something happen at work?

447
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,132
No. I'm just not craving anything in particular.

448
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,598
All right then.

449
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,490
I'll just order what looks good.

450
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,124
Yes.

451
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,740
 The River 

452
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,561
This is nice.

453
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,789
It's nice to get out once in a while.

454
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:12,624
You must be tired these days.

455
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:15,860
Especially with work and the wedding preparations.

456
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,545
I wasn't that busy.

457
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:21,457
And even if I were, it's nowhere as bad as for resident doctors.

458
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,297
Hong.

459
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,459
I have some good news.

460
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,628
Good news?

461
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,131
I got accepted.

462
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,842
For the training program in the States.

463
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,559
Seriously?

464
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,650
Yes.

465
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,056
Hong.

466
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,118
Will you come with me to a new place

467
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:50,444
and start a new life together?

468
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,548
It's a little late, but this is my proposal.

469
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,003
I'm sorry I haven't done it sooner.

470
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,346
And also for making excuses for my shyness.

471
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,733
Will you marry me?

472
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,411
- Min Jun...
 - Hong.

473
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,041
You're all that I need.

474
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,670
I promise you.

475
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,799
I'll never make you feel lonely.

476
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,089
Wherever we are,

477
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,217
and whenever it may be,

478
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,143
I promise.

479
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,565
I'll never leave you by yourself.

480
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,200
Are you...

481
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:29,710
Here.

482
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,380
Don't cry, Hong. Why...

483
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,719
I didn't think the proposal would move you that much.

484
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm sorry.

485
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,061
Min Jun...

486
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,777
I don't know what's wrong with me.

487
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,114
I don't mean to be like this.

488
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,498
I'm really sorry.

489
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,296
But I'm not so sure.

490
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:22,012
I was sure that I got over it.

491
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,777
Is that why...

492
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,031
you went to the signing event today?

493
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,246
I was there, too.

494
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,336
Because I was anxious.

495
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,604
If...

496
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,226
I had told you how I felt about you

497
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,153
before you went to Japan

498
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,743
would things be different for us now?

499
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,750
Min Jun.

500
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,130
Even if we were dating...

501
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:43,294
before I met him,

502
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:46,172
or even if we were married

503
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,058
with three children...

504
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,221
My heart would drop

505
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,448
the moment I saw him, just like it did now.

506
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,022
When he leaves,

507
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,989
and you leave me,

508
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,368
I'll be all by myself again.

509
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:15,334
But I can't lie to you just because I'm scared of being lonely.

510
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,582
Because I genuinely like you.

511
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,716
Because you like me?

512
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,282
Because you genuinely like me?

513
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,744
I didn't know that word...

514
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:57,618
could sound so cruel.

515
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,802
I'm sorry, Min Jun. I have to go.

516
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:40,211
 I don't know why I suddenly started to cry. 

517
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:44,174
 The moment Min Jun proposed... 

518
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:50,263
 I suddenly thought that I had to fend for myself. 

519
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,384
 Actually, it wasn't just a thought. 

520
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,685
 It was more of a realization. 

521
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,433
 And all of a sudden, 

522
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:04,527
 I was reminded of the look on Jungo's face. 

523
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:09,691
 Our love was beautiful 

524
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,743
 because we were reckless and naive. 

525
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,660
 Our love had come to an end 

526
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,875
 without a moment to say goodbye. 

527
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,049
 And his face was grimaced in pain 

528
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,885
 because of our love. 

529
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,460
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

530
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:47,480

532
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:55,879
 Assistant Yun 

533
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:57,530
 Yes, Department Head. 

534
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,532
Assistant Yun.

535
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,259
Are you still having dinner?

536
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:05,730
 No, Mr. Sasae seemed tired, so we wrapped up earlier than we expected. 

537
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,193
 - I just drove him to his hotel. 
 - I see.

538
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:12,295
Thank you for your hard work today.

539
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:13,713
Have a good night.

540
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:16,799
 Yes, Department Head. Have a good night.

Excuse me.

548
00:46:14,163 --> 00:46:17,344
Can you tell me which room Mr. Sasae Hikari is staying in?

549
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:19,112
I'm sorry, ma'am.

550
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:22,115
We can't disclose the room numbers of our guests.

551
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,242
Right. Of course.

552

Excuse me, ma'am.

554

I can't tell you his room number,

555
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:39,382
but I think he went to the bar on the first floor earlier.

556
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,267
Thank you.
