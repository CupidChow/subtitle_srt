1
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:30,000


2
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,060
  Tokyo, 5 years ago 

3
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,877
Are you all right?

4
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,644
Beni?

5
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:13,673
Don't worry.

6
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,409
I'm all right.

7
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:21,239
I'm really all right.

8
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,611
Yun Oh?

9
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,805
Yun Oh.

10
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,570
 Seoul, present 

11
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,283
 Kobayashi Kanna 

12
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,829
Hello?

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,974
 Morning. Did you sleep well last night? 

14
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,569
Yeah.

15
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,748
I was drunk last night, wasn't I?

16
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,575
 Sorry. 

17
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,554
You don't need to apologize. It's fine.

18
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,764
 You don't sound well. 

19
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,098
Are you all right?

20
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,075
Are you not feeling well?

21
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,395
I'm fine.

22
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,263
It's because I just woke up.

23
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:31,110
 You know we have the Japanese expat meeting at one o' clock, right? 

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,695
It's not too far from the hotel,

25
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,658
so let's meet in the lobby 30 minutes prior to the meeting.

26
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,410
That early?

27
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,970
Why? Do you have any other plans?

28
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,956
 I'm sorry, Kanna. 

29
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,000
Could we cancel all my appointments for the day?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,435
 Cancel your appointments? Why? 

31
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,806
They are important people for the promotion of the book.

32
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,551
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,353
Please let me rest for today.

34
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,298
All right then.

35
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,685
Rest up today.

36
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,062
Tomorrow's book signing is more important anyway.

37
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,398
 I'll let Manager Lee know about it. 

38
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,191
Thanks.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,567
Talk to you later.

40
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,302
 Bye. 

41
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,142
 Marry me, Jungo. 

42
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:35,212
 Please... come back to me. 

43
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,712
 I'm sorry. 

44
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,407
 It's all right. 

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,350
 I'll stop now. 

46
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:07,623
 It's been a long day for me, too. 

47
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,542
 When I heard you were going to Korea, 

48
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,036
 I was so anxious... 

49
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,867
 that I couldn't get any sleep for many days. 

50
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,244
 Good night. 

51
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,368
 What's does a miraculous reunion mean? 

52
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:59,034
 What reason does it contain? 

53
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,814
 Were we given a chance to get back together? 

54
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:05,013
 Or  

55
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:10,708
 was it a forewarning ... of a definitive ending? 

56
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:18,591
 I hope this isn't the end. 

57
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:28,055
 I hope... this isn't the end. 

58
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:37,813
 What Comes After Love 

59
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,817
 Min Jun: Are you up? 

60
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,019
 Hong, how are you feeling? 

61
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:08,225
 I wish I could make you breakfast every day. 

62
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,728
Hi.

63
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,387
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?

64
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:22,132
Well...

65
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,660
Could you call a taxi for me, please?

66
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,216
Sure. Do you want a driver who speaks Japanese?

67
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,568
Yes, thank you.

68
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,080
What on earth? Look at this mess!

69
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,815
Mom, do you want to try one?

70
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,150
No, thanks.

71
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,778
Clean all this up before you leave, all right?

72
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,574
- Dad.
 - Yes.

73
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,992
Have some breakfast.

74
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,552
I made it myself.

75
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,913
What a surprise!

76
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,148
Thank you.

77
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:06,877
- It's good, right?
 - What?

78
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,786
Maybe I should open a bakery.

79
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,665
A bakery? Weren't you thinking about a workshop before?

80
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,325
Candles, was it?

81
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,185
Leather workshop, Dad.

82
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,229
Leather?

83
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,525
But candles or leather aren't edible.

84
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,402
I think baking is the way to go.

85
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,321
I love seeing people enjoying their food.

86
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,242
- Speaking of which, Dad—
 - No, no.

87
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,660
Tell your sister instead.

88
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,521
You know I'm just a figurehead.  She makes the final decisions.

89
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,625
Eonni.

90
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,726
Why don't you try this, too?

91
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,905
Oh, later.

92
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,048
I got heartburn.

93
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,551
- Wait, were you having drinks with oppa Min Jun?
 - Yeah.

94
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,763
What? Why didn't you call me?

95
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,737
The three of you partied after the fitting?

96
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:56,685
  Which dress did you pick? 

97
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,678
Good morning, Manager Lee.

98
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,706
The writer canceled?

99
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,234
I see...

100
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,654
Well, it's the weekend, after all.

101
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,282
Let him get some good rest for now.

102
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:15,037
Please pay extra attention to him, Manager Lee.

103
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,954
All right.

104
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,958
What's going on?

105
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,419
- Something happened?
 - Well...

106
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,880
The visiting author from Japan wasn't feeling too well,

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,758
so he canceled today's appointment.

108
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,592
Sasae Hikari?

109
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,600
Shouldn't you check up on him, too, Eonni?

110
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Me? Why should I?

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,062
I'm sure Manager Lee will take good care of him.

112
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:40,437
Wait, Eonni.

113
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,590
Do you think I could borrow your old guitar?

114
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,671
- My guitar?
 - Yes.

115
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,511
What for?

116
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:51,531
I need a prop for my pastries post online.

117
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,084
It's in the storage closet.

118
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,659
I know that.

119
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,454
But you told me never to touch it.

120
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,000
  Seoul, 5 years ago  

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,214
I can't believe he actually sent it.

122
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,299
Your boyfriend's really something.

123
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,602
You mean, ex-boyfriend.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,154
Right, your ex.

125
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,132
I guess this means that it's really over, right?

126
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,007
Eonni, come on.

127
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:27,743
You'll be fine.

128
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,028
Just forget him.

129
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,400
By the way...where's my present from Japan?

130
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,239
- Is it in here?
 - Don't touch that.

131
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,833
Why not?

132
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,009
Just don't.

133
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,279
Don't open it.

134
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,492
 It took me a long time to figure out. 

135
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,637
 I wasn't trying to forget Jungo 

136
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,724
  but the me who loved him. 

137
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:05,221
 So, I just sealed away everything about him. 

138
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,800
  Seoul, present  

139
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,176
Here you go.

140
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:22,012
Thanks. I'll make sure to put it back right after I'm done.

141
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,533
Excuse me, sir.

142
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,575
Yes?

143
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:03,747
I haven't been there myself, but the lake you've mentioned

144
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,124
is apparently pretty big.

145
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:15,116
I'd like to go where I can see the path around the lake.

146
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:17,761
I'm sorry for being difficult.

147
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,346
Don't worry about it.

148
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,973
It's just part of my job.

149
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,846
Isn't that too much pruning?

150
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,848
You can be so cruel.

151
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:50,210
It's got to be done in order to see a full bloom next year.

152
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,022
You didn't know, did you? It's not easy helping things grow.

153
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:57,843
I know it's hard. Whether flowers or kids.

154
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,430
Do you really know? Push that one over, will you?

155
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,340
Yes.

156
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,826
No, don't drag it. Lift it up.

157
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,063
How's that?

158
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,190
That's good. All set.

159
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,794
Have you found a venue yet?

160
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,504
Min Jun is looking into it.

161
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,907
You’re not buying a house, so don’t be too picky.

162
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,743
Just quickly take whatever looks decent.

163
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,995
He’s a busy person, too.

164
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,629
Right.

165
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,794
- What's wrong?
 - What?

166
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:33,128
Did you two have a fight?

167
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,238
No, we didn't.

168
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,286
It's  cold. I'm going inside to warm up.

169
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,975
What's gotten into you?

170
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,228
I used to do this all the time when I was little.

171
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,772
You did.

172
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,608
Back when you used to listen to me.

173
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,236
You were so lovable back then.

174
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,947
So, am I not anymore?

175
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,115
No. Not in the slightest.

176
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,410
That's why I want Min Jun to hurry up and take you away.

177
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,746
Do you like him that much?

178
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,207
I do. I really do!

179
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,667
I’ve seen him since he was little.

180
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,826
Kind and steadfast.

181
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,714
It’s not easy to meet someone like him.

182
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,425
I know he’s a good person, too.

183
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,805
Hong.

184
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,934
You don’t marry someone because of love.

185
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,878
You marry someone who’s a good person.

186
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,779
 The kind of marriage Jungo and I used to talk about 

187
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,075
 was definitely not the kind of marriage that my mom talked about. 

188
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,326
  To be honest… 

189
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,121
 Rather than marriage,  

190
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:53,667
 it was a wish to love each other forever 

191
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,962
 and be together forever, expressed in fewer words. 

192
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,147
 Tokyo, 5 years ago 
 Ichiro's Ramen 

193
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,718
Hey, everyone!

194
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,928
- Welcome.
 - Hello, Ms. Nozomi.

195
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,396
Good evening, Ms. Nozomi!

196
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,698
 Dear Ms. Choi Hong 

197
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,934
What's... this?

198
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,684
It's a wedding invitation.

199
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,898
Oh, my god!

200
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,106
Boss!

201
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,775
I can't believe this.

202
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,026
You can't be serious!

203
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,029
This is a miracle!

204
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,773
On the tenth proposal to her,

205
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:31,704
she finally said "Yes"!

206
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,656
All right, everyone. First things first.

207
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:39,512
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

208
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:45,175
- That's so good!
 - That hit the spot.

209
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,367
What's got into you?

210
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,102
What's wrong?

211
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,104
It's nothing.

212
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,564
- I just...
 - What's the matter?

213
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,442
Are you sad that I'm getting married?

214
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,906
I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same way about you.

215
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,033
If you had confessed to him sooner,

216
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,285
I could've gotten away from him.

217
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,703
That's too bad!

218
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,297
No, it's not like that.

219
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,175
It's just that...

220
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,004
I don't have any family or friends in Japan.

221
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,715
So, I've always felt lonely.

222
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,516
But...

223
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,220
now you are

224
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,930
inviting me to your wedding

225
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,517
and treating me as if we're family.

226
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,185
All right.

227
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:40,023
To celebrate Hong for becoming our family,

228
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,483
shall we have a toast?

229
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,520
That sounds good.

230
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,197
- Jjan!
 - "Jjan"?

231
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,741
Yes, Hong taught me this.

232
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,953
That's how you say "cheers" in Korean.

233
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,121
- Really?
 - Yes.

234
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,566
- Ready?
 - Jjan!

235
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,676
- Jjan! 
 - Jjan!

236
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,719
What's this?

237
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,054
It's a wedding invitation.

238
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,349
My boss is finally getting married.

239
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,685
Really?

240
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,895
You're invited too.

241
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,464
- Me too?
 - Yes.

242
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:23,941
And he wants to know if you are allergic to some food.

243
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,736
Isn't he really considerate?

244
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,205
People don't usually ask that in Korea.

245
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,312
You're coming, right?

246
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,334
I'll think about it.

247
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,865
Hey, don't be like that! You should come.

248
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:45,312
Come on, let's go.

249
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,465
Why aren't you sure?

250
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,443
Is it because of your work?

251
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,511
I mean, that's one reason...

252
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,305
Don't worry.

253
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,060
I'll prepare a gift for them.

254
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,392
A gift?

255
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,186
I've already thought about it.

256
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,971
Look forward to it.

257
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,460
What are weddings like in Japan?

258
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,887
I've only been to weddings in Korea.

259
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,783
Well...

260
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,252
I'm sure they're both pretty similar.

261
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:21,833
 It's totally different from a Korean wedding. 

262
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,794
 It's totally different there. 

263
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,262
Right?

264
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:28,048
Jungo won't ever talk about these things.

265
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,465
 It's so frustrating. 

266
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,467
He probably doesn't want you feeling pressured.

267
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,194
What are you talking about?

268
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,679
 Don't get me started. 

269
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,307
 I was totally flustered when my cousin got married there. 

270
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:42,519
First of all, the cash gift there starts at the equivalent of 300,000 won  (≈$220) .

271
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,148
Seriously? That's so much.

272
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,526
That's why they only invite close family and friends.

273
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,178
And if you said yes to the invite,

274
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:52,571
you can't not show up like we do in Korea.

275
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,707
 You have to be there in person. 

276
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,950
 I heard it's really rude not to go. 

277
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,410
I see...

278
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,579
 Hey, start writing this down. 

279
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,941
 You need to buy a special envelope for the cash gift, too. 

280
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,418
- A special envelope?
  - That's right. 

281
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,654
It's so different over there.

282
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,673
You're right.

283
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,257
 Oh, right. 

284
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,609
 When are you getting your hair done? 

285
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:13,760
Why would I need it done?

286
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,012
The guests go all out in Japan.

287
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,391
They show up in sparkly dresses with perfect hair.

288
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,351
And the men put on clean-cut suits.

289
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,216
 Have you decided what you'll wear? 

290
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,521
Clothes?

291
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,523
Oh, no.

292
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,761
You don't have any.

293
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,008
Ji Hui told me something.

294
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,302
Yes?

295
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:57,679
Apparently, I need to dress nicely for weddings in Japan.

296
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,896
That sounds about right.

297
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,062
What kind of wedding do you want to have?

298
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,483
I would like to have...

299
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,695
a small wedding.

300
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,574
Just like the one in "About Time."

301
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,826
Then, I guess you'll also need some rain in the middle of it.

302
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,120
Of course.

303
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,038
With umbrellas turning inside out!

304
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,376
That sudden downpour was what made the wedding so special.

305
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,656
I'd invite Ji Hui and everyone from "Ichiro's Ramen".

306
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,699
I'd like to ask your father

307
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:38,078
to perform with his band, too.

308
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,146
I bet he'd be more than happy to help.

309
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,922
But...

310
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:50,196
I don't think my mom would come if I got married in Japan.

311
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:54,654
Haven't you been able to get a hold of your mom?

312
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,930
Don't worry.

313
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,823
I'll reconcile with her one day.

314
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,272
It's so pretty.

315
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:38,429
Yun Oh?

316
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,017
- Welcome.
 - Hello.

317
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,060
Hello.

318
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,412
Would it...

319
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,564
Would it be possible to try on that dress?

320
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,576
No, Yun Oh. It's fine.

321
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,445
Of course, you can.

322
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:58,589
We'll start by taking your measurements.

323
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,407
This way, please.

324
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,774
See you in a bit.

325
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,430
Are you ready?

326
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,557
Pardon?

327
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:27,103
You know that your first reaction matters the most, right?

328
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:30,914
- Of course.
 - All right, then. Here she comes.

329
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,011
You look... so beautiful.

330
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,812
That was a great reaction.

331
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,856
The best reactions

332
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,617
are the ones that flow from your heart.

333
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,791
- Hey.
 - Hi.

334
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,026
Here you go.

335
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,236
Thanks. I'll take good care of it.

336
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,713
Do you have an interview?

337
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,717
No. I was invited to Hong's friend's wedding.

338
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,801
Is she doing well?

339
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,094
- Yes, she is.
 - I almost forgot.

340
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:11,082
I heard senpai* Sato was looking for someone to do some work for him. 
  (senior at school or at work) 

341
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,375
Are you interested?

342
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,938
You've been looking for a publishing job, right?

343
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,007
Senpai Sato's looking for people?

344
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:20,734
I'd love that.

345
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,344
You should meet up with him tomorrow.

346
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,763
He seemed to be in a hurry.

347
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,348
You have his number, right?

348
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:28,475
I do. I'll give him a call. Thanks.

349
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,260
- I'm off. Thanks again.
 - No problem!

350
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,720
 Seibunsha 

351
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,984
- Do you know where it is, Yoshino?
 - Check the top shelf on the right.

352
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,587
Over here, Aoki.

353
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,563
Thank you for meeting with me today, sir.

354
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,006
How's the writing coming along?

355
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,050
I haven't written much yet.

356
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,885
I thought you had the most potential

357
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:07,305
among all your classmates.

358
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,506
Thank you very much.

359
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,353
Let's set aside the nagging for now.

360
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:14,703
Can you start today?

361
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,081
Since two people quit suddenly,

362
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,383
we're in a real bind.

363
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,544
Do you want me to start today?

364
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,679
You don't want to?

365
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,074
That's not what I meant, but...

366
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,630
 Happy Wedding 

367
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,990
- Congratulations on the wedding.
 - Thank you.

368
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,800
- Thank you.
 - Please go on in.

369
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,620
- Congratulations.
 - Thank you.

370
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,871
Thank you for coming.

371
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:06,137
 

372
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:10,116
 Ms. Choi Hong 

373
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,170
 Ms. Choi Hong 

374
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,693
- Hong!
 - Hey!

375
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,387
- Hello.
 - Good to see you.

376
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:32,975
Didn't Jungo come with you?

377
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:36,872
He'll be here soon. He had to stop by for an interview.

378
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:39,580
Are you ready for today's special performance?

379
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,611
I'm not ready. It's my first time doing such a thing.

380
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,702
I'm so nervous.

381
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:47,781
Don't worry about it.

382
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:51,049
Everyone's going to be blown away if you do what you did at rehearsals.

383
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,735
- He's right.
 - You'll be fine.

384
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,470
I'm not sure about that.

385
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,056
- You'll be fine!
 - Seriously, don't worry.

386
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,935
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much

387
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,838
for taking the time out of your busy schedules

388
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:07,550
to attend the wedding of Mr. Nitta Ichiro and Ms. Gato Nozomi.

389
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,654
The groom and bride will soon make their entrance.

390
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,948
When you see them,

391
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,144
please welcome them with a warm round of applause.

392
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:21,815
Now, I'd like to ask you all to direct your attention to the back.

393
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:25,025
Please welcome the bride and groom!

394
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,970
Boss, you look so cool!

395
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,380
He's so nervous!

396
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,770
This draft needs to be proofread by seven o'clock.

397
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,013
- I got it.
 - Thanks.

398
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:08,493
 Missed call, Beni 

399
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:14,758
Next, we have a special surprise

400
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:19,305
that we secretly prepared for the bride and groom.

401
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,581
Actually,

402
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:23,476
we were supposed to invite TWICE

403
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,286
that our boss loves a little more than his bride.

404
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,648
Hey, shut it!

405
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,341
- I guess his angry response confirms it.
 - Come on.

406
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,803
I think that's enough joking around.

407
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:36,640
Ichiro's Ramen's very own K-pop star,

408
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,767
Choi Hong, will give us a performance.

409
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:41,811
Please give her a big round of applause!

410
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,916
Mr. Ichiro, Ms. Nozomi.

411
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,985
Congratulations on your wedding.

412
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:50,778
I might not be very good,

413
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:54,564
so I'd appreciate it if you'd listen with kindness.

Beni...

438
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,056
Are you angry?

439
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,388
The publisher I interviewed with

440
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:32,058
asked me to start today.

441
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,019
I see.

442
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,270
Today of all days?

443
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:41,151
I've always wanted to work there,

444
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,369
so I couldn't help it.

445
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,968
What's this?

446
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,763
Your thank-you gift from the wedding.

447
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,310
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

448
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,107
I feel bad.

449
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,258
What was that?

450
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,122
It's just...

451
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:21,815
I didn't give them any congratulatory money.

452
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,194
It'd be rude of me to accept a thank-you gift.

453
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,029
If you're so well-versed in manners,

454
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,365
why did you not show up?

455
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,574
But this was...

456
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,950
Didn't you say you'd make it to the wedding?

457
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,912
I did say that but...

458
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,705
I didn't say I'd definitely make it.

459
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,667
You could've just said that you didn't want to go in the first place.

460
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,651
What?

461
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,878
You shouldn't have said anything

462
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,388
if this was how it was going to be.

463
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:52,622
Wait, Beni...

464
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,773
Don't follow me.

465
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:21,008
 It didn't take very long for me to realize... 

466
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:25,212
 that everlasting love didn't exist. 

467
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,860
  Seoul, present  

468
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:28,373
Here we go, Min Jun.

469
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,666
Great. Forehand, now.

470
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,376
You need to see the ball through.

471
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,303
There you go. Backhand, now.

472
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,266
Are you all right?

473
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,811
Seonbae,

474
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,582
let's call it a day.

475
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:47,890
I feel I'm going to throw up.

476
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,191
-  You'll soon be looking for a place to live, too.
 - Well...

477
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,111
Not yet. Hong's been busy, too.

478
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,030
How is she doing?

479
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,948
- Why do you ask?
 - Well,

480
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:06,244
I remember how sensitive my wife got before the wedding.

481
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,580
She only told after we were married for a few years.

482
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,508
That she was scared at the thought of actually getting married.

483
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,130
Why, your wife is the bravest woman in the world.

484
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,440
She was scared?

485
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,091
I know, right?

486
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,136
I was so nervous right up until the night before the wedding.

487
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:28,399
Anyway, remember not to let your guard down until you walk down that aisle.

488
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,904
 Hong, you haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right? 

489
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,448
 Get a good night's sleep. See you tomorrow. 

490
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,542
 All right 

491
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,346
Hey, Lightning.

492
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,592
You know, right?

493
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,853
How bad my memory is.

494
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,270
But why can't I forget

495
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,947
about Jungo?

496
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,868
Why do you think that is?

497
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,788
What are you doing sitting outside in the cold?

498
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,131
What do you want?

499
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,377
Here.

500
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,053
What's this?

501
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,540
I found it in your guitar case.

502
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,843
I imagine you already have a lot on your mind,

503
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,120
so I wasn't sure if I should give it to you.

504
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,147
But I couldn't just pretend I didn't see it.

505
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,810
It's fine.

506
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,070
Aren't you going to read it?

507
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,847
Really? Already?

508
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:10,818
Yes, I understand. We'll be there as soon as we can.

509
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,495
Thank you.

510
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,772
It's a success!

511
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:16,189
There's a huge line outside already!

512
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:18,125
Are you serious?

513
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,576
The book signing's not for another four hours.

514
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:23,131
- That's great news!
 - Amazing.

515
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,865
I almost forgot.

516
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,554
Department Head.

517
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:33,224
I heard it was writer Sasae's birthday.

518
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,826
Oh, is it?

519
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,076
What should we get for his gift?

520
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:38,711
Pardon?

521
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,400
Why are you asking me?

522
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,236
I heard from Manager Lee that you spent some time

523
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,072
- studying in Japan—
 - Assistant Yun.

524
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,991
How are those two things related?

525
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:54,303
I'll try to figure it out on my own.

526
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,700
  Tokyo, 5 years ago  

527
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:15,792
Please come in.

528
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:19,479
Ah, I'm so full.

529
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:23,041
Bulgogi is going to be my favorite from now on.

530
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,567
And it was even better today

531
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:28,404
because Beni treated me.

532
00:41:28,888 --> 00:41:32,992
Dad, you had three servings by yourself.

533
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,843
Do you know how hard she worked to pay for that meal?

534
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,915
- Come on. I can afford that much.
 - Right!

535
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,518
I couldn't help it because it was so good.

536
00:41:41,518 --> 00:41:45,363
I'll treat you again on your next birthday.

537
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,048
Really?

538
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:49,359
I'm so happy.

539
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,177
Thank you, Beni.

540
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:53,638
I should be thanking you.

541
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,490
Jungo and I wouldn't be together

542
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,950
if it weren't for you.

543
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:22,999
Is this... your grandmother?

544
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,635
That's right.

545
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:30,633
She raised Jungo when he was young

546
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,060
because his mom left us.

547
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:49,486
This cake is very unique.

548
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,864
Don't kids usually have cakes

549
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:56,326
that are decorated with fruits or cartoon characters?

550
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,384
My grandmother really liked Mont Blancs.

551
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:02,624
A Mont Blanc cake

552
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:07,045
is supposed to look like a snowy mountain top in the Alps.

553
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,542
The Alps?

554
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,049
- The mountain range?
 - Yes.

555
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:15,303
She always wanted to go to the Alps.

556
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:19,040
But she had weak legs since she was a child,

557
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,519
so she loved to watch documentaries on trekking.

558
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,863
That's why she always bought me a Mont Blanc cake.

559
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,989
Jungo!

560
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:40,954
Look!

561
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:42,035
Pardon?

562
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,473
Did you say 5,200 yen  (≈ $ 35) ?

563
00:43:45,817 --> 00:43:47,235
Beni.

564
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:50,238
I'm still full after that bulgogi.

565
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:52,240
I don't think I can have anything else.

566
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,391
Let's have it next time.

567
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:58,997
Can we buy by the slice?

568
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:00,515
I'm sorry.

569
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:03,101
We don't sell the Mont Blanc by the slice.

570
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,380
Cutting it ruins the shape.

571
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,798
I see.

572
00:44:08,798 --> 00:44:12,735
Shall we get something else, then?

573
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,974
Beni, I'm really full right now.

574
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:19,100
What was it?

575
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,352
I'm full. Full.
 (in bad Korean accent) 

576
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:21,728
- Are you full?
 - Yes.

577
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,980
- Really?
 - Yes.

578
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,982
Let's come back another time.

579
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:29,893
I really wanted to treat you today...

580
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:34,882
- We'll come back another time.
 - Please come again.

581
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,394
I had such a nice day today.

582
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:49,923
It was so nice to hear stories about you.

583
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:52,634
- Stories about me?
 - Yes.

584
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:57,671
You usually don't talk about yourself.

585
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:01,034
I don't?

586
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:05,387
Oh, come on. You know it's true.

587
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:11,461
We cannot express everything in words,

588
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,847
but there are things that need to be said.

589
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,651
You're right.

590
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,889
But I'm just...

591
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:26,101
not good at expressing myself in words.

592
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,728
Even without expressing in words,

593
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,523
sincere feelings will be

594
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,508
conveyed naturally.

595
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:37,451
Even still.

596
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:39,936
It'd be nice if you could tell me.

597
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,660
Even though I already know your feelings,

598
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,955
there are words that I'd like to hear many times.

599
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,889
Like what?

600
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,252
"I love you."

601
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,386
That could be one of them.

602
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,561
That's a hard one.

603
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,641
But instead,

604
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:08,435
I'm going to write a novel

605
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:12,272
about how I feel about you one day.

606
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,733
- Really?
 - Yes.

607
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,775
I promise.

608
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,260
I can't wait to read that novel.

609
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,139
"One star for memories

610
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,093
and one for love.

611
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:45,413
One star for loneliness

612
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:48,516
and one for yearning.

613
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:52,979
- One star for poetry..."
 - "One star for poetry..."

614
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:55,381
When did you memorize that?

615
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,944
Whenever you recited the poem,

616
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:02,572
somehow I really liked

617
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:04,498
that part.

618
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:11,606
"One star for poetry..."

619
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:13,732
Did you know?

620
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,088
Apparently, we're all parts of a star.

621
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,424
The earth was born when a star exploded,

622
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:24,886
and that's how we were created.

623
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:28,473
Our races and nationalities may be different,

624
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,725
but ultimately,

625
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:33,986
we're all stardust from the same star.

626
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:38,733
That's amazing.

627
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,235
Isn't it?

628
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,869
It is.

629
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:48,702
We're the stars of Inokashira.

630
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,662
"Stars of Inokashira"?

631
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,191
Right.

632
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,995
I'll buy you a Mont Blanc cake on your next birthday.

633
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:04,384
Just like your grandma did when you were younger.

634
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,480
Thank you.

635
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:17,412
 We only spoke of a bright future together. 

636
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:21,151
 We went out of our way to avoid our problems. 

637
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,445
 And those uncertainties 

638
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,364
 and the illusions 

639
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:31,494
 rolled into a snowball and buried us inside. 

640
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:34,898
 We were blind to the harsh realities of the world 

641
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:38,084
 when we were at the peak of happiness. 

642
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,320
 At that time, we were nothing but a couple of stars 

643
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,449
 that were shining ever so naively in love.

 Sasae Hikari  
 Book Concert 

646
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,994
Let's take a question from the livestream this time.

647
00:48:55,994 --> 00:48:59,789
We'll now take a question from the livestream.

648
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,860
"I've also had a similar experience to the female protagonist,

649
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,420
so I could easily relate to the story as I read it.

650
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,656
But in reality, it was incredibly difficult

651
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:13,103
to overcome borders and cultural differences with only love.

652
00:49:13,103 --> 00:49:16,581
Do you still believe that that is possible?"

653
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:19,042
"I had a similar experience to the female protagonist..."

654
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,528
This event is amazing.

655
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:24,630
I'm very happy to hear that.

656
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,705
If I'm being honest,

657
00:49:31,705 --> 00:49:38,343
I did not write this novel to deliver an overwhelming message.

658
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,582
"If I'm being honest, I did not write this novel

659
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:45,844
to deliver an overwhelming message."

660
00:49:45,844 --> 00:49:48,430
In this novel,

661
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,975
I wrote about my regrets and my unforgettable memories

662
00:49:51,975 --> 00:49:55,145
about one particular person.

663
00:49:55,145 --> 00:49:58,857
It's a recollection of my honest feelings.

664
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:04,195
If that person happens to read my book,

665
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:05,903
I hope she understands

666
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:09,701
my past self who was foolish

667
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:12,121
and immature back then.

668
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:17,834
That was the sliver of hope I held onto while writing this book.

669
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,127
I see.

670
00:50:19,127 --> 00:50:23,023
The fact that you were so honest in your writing

671
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,843
must be why so many readers could empathize with your story.

672
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:30,822
It seems like we've come to the end of the book concert portion.

673
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,491
Let's now move on to the book signing.

674
00:50:33,491 --> 00:50:37,495
The signing will take place in five minutes.

675
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,555
Thank you.
