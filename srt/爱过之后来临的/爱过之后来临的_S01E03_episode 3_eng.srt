1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,489
Thank you.

 Timing and subtitles brought to you by the ✨Nostalgic team ✨@ Viki 

3
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:27,585
 Min Jun 

4
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,228
 Hong, was it okay? 

5
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,390
Fine. I just got off.

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,611
It must have been tiring, judging by your voice.

7
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,307
I'll say.

8
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,718
I guess it was tough because I haven't interpreted in a while.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,854
You're off tomorrow, right?

10
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:50,566
I don't have to work late tonight either. Do you want to go for a drink in my neighborhood?

11
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,611
Sure. I'll call you when I get home.

12
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,245
Okay.

13
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:01,160
Hong, what's wrong? Are you all right?

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,163
 What happened?  

15
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,089
 Hong? 

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,460
 Hong! 

17
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,495
 Did you hit something? 

18
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,290
No.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,293
 What happened? 

20
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,257
I'm all right.

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,553
It wasn't anything.

22
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,974
Are you sure you're all right?

23
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,685
Yes.

24
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:04,064
I'll call you back.

25
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,623
Why aren't you saying anything?

26
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,461
If you have something to say, say it.

27
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,287
I wanted to ask you something.

28
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,542
If I ever saw you again,

29
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,270
I wanted to ask you.

30
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,247
But...

31
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:54,584
I don't think I need to anymore.

32
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,070
What it was I wanted to say,

33
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,789
or whether I really had something to say,

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,301
I can't even...

35
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,392
remember.

36
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,693
Beni.

37
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,260
I don't even know where to begin.

38
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,311
There's so much

39
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,622
I want to tell you...

40
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,669
I know that

41
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:36,091
we've been apart for too long,

42
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,465
and there's a big wall between us.

43
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,516
No matter what I say

44
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:50,397
I know that it won't touch your heart.

45
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,904
I also know that

46
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,408
running into you like this is my last chance.

47
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,571
That's why I don't want to miss out on this.

48
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,806
That's one thing for sure.

49
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,295
Please believe me.

50
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,009
Beni...

51
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,464
If you misunderstood anything,

52
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:25,300
I want to clarify it.

53
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,142
Mr. Sasae.

54
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,931
It's already been far too long.

55
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,208
- Beni—
 - I'm...

56
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,028
getting married soon.

57
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,110
So...

58
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,286
don't say anything anymore.

59
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,270
♫  I believe you're saying about love  ♫

60
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,680
♫   Even it's not the words I know  ♫

61
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,350
♫  I know you're at the end of the road  ♫

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,800
♫  So I run to you through the night  ♫

63
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,270
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

64
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,420
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,700
 I didn't know I wouldn't be able to forget. 

66
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,360
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

67
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,794
 Actually, 

68
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,116
  although I knew I might not be able to forget, 

69
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:17,762
 still I didn't realize that I would be unable to forget 

70
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,688
 for such a long time. 

71
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,640
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,929
 What were you thinking... by showing up? 

73
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,142
 Min Jun 

74
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,970
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

75
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:45,781
 It was nothing ... 

76
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:55,658
 What Comes After Love 

77
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,857
Look how gorgeous these are.

78
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,126
Hong is too skinny for a mermaid dress.

79
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,128
Maybe a princess line dress would suit her better.

80
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:09,589
An off the shoulder one wouldn't be bad, either.

81
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,650
I should go and pick one for her.

82
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,511
You know it's not your wedding, right?

83
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,847
I would if I could.

84
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,091
I'm all for it, Mom.

85
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,935
All of your hysteria?

86
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,746
It all stems from lack of affection.

87
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,881
Let's get you a boyfriend first.

88
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,232
Speak for yourself.

89
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,826
Scoot over, will you?

90
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,743
- I'm home.
 - Hey.

91
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,686
Are you...

92
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,537
Why do you look so tired?

93
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,880
Oppa Min Jun called and told me that you weren't answering.

94
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,648
Is something going on?

95
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,193
No, I'm just tired.

96
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:14,328
Let me change first.

97
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,073
Here.

98
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:21,077
- What's this for?
 - Dad asked me to read it, so I did,

99
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:24,254
and the story sounded similar to the story of someone I know.

100
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,085
I could be wrong, though. Read it. It's pretty good.

101
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,111
Good night.

102
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,855
 What Comes After Love 

103
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,138
- See you soon. 
 - Thank you.

104
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:59,317
   
I wanted to ask him... Why did you let me cry alone?  

105
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,128
  Why didn't you stop me from leaving? 

106
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:10,042
  You didn't stop me or look for me. 

107
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,865
 So, why did you come here after all this time? 

108
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,210
- Eonni!
 - Hong!

109
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,268
I didn't know you were coming, Min Jun.

110
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,463
- Why do you look so down?
 - What?

111
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,066
Wait. Where's your luggage?

112
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,443
I was in a rush, so...

113
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:37,219
I see.

114
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,276
Welcome back.

115
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,941
I thought you were busy with the exam these days.

116
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,903
Oh, come on. I thought you'd be so happy to see me.

117
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,530
Of course, I'm happy.

118
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,074
Let's quickly go see Dad at the hospital first.

119
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,908
At the hospital?

120
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,300
 Patient Name: Choi 

121
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,511
Dad!

122
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,855
There's my little girl.

123
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,518
- Are you all right?
 - Of course, I am.

124
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,063
- It's not that serious.
 - Why are you back?

125
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,024
You acted as though you'd never come back.

126
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,509
Still, you should have told me.

127
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,613
- Did you say anything when you left?
 - Come on. Don't start.

128
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,749
- It's been ages since we saw her.
 - Who is worrying about whom?

129
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,751
Come on, Honey. That's enough.

130
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:48,065
Welcome home. Did you eat yet?

131
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,672
Hong.

132
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,131
Coffee.

133
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,665
Thanks.

134
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,125
Is my dad really going to be all right?

135
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,544
Thankfully, he got over the crisis.

136
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:11,006
Now he'll get better after some more treatment.

137
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,890
Thank you.

138
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,511
Rok told me everything.

139
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:19,681
I heard you dealt with everything when he collapsed.

140
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,082
I should have been there for him.

141
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,719
Don't say that.

142
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:28,982
When my parents went to the States, your parents took such good care of me.

143
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,734
It's the least I could do.

144
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:34,520
Even still. Thanks for everything.

145
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,952
Hong.

146
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,609
Yes?

147
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,958
Did something happen when you were in Japan?

148
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,592
What?

149
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,006
Just a second.

150
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,668
Sorry. They want me in the ER.

151
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,804
You must be tired too.   Hurry  home and get some rest.

152
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,514
I'll call you.

153
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,149
Okay.

154
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,924
Sign here and here as well.

155
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,536
As you instructed, I applied for a loan using the publishing building as collateral,

156
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,140
but they said we'll have to wait to see if it passes appraisal.

157
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,709
I'm putting you through a lot of trouble, aren't I?

158
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,212
Yes. A whole bunch.

159
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:36,549
- So you'd better get well soon.
 - Fine. I will.

160
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,218
What are those manuscripts over there, anyway?

161
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,480
- Writer Han sent in some more of his work.
 - Another one?

162
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,717
All the employees left, so I'm proofreading this one, too.

163
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,707
You must be starving. How have you still not eaten?

164
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,817
The fridge was completely empty.

165
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,345
- Let's just eat.
 - Thank you for the meal.

166
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:41,156
 What Comes After Love 

167
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:44,541
 I assured myself then. 

168
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,870
 That it was all over. 

169
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,582
 That what happened... was just a passing moment. 

170
00:14:55,954 --> 00:15:00,607
 But the two of us were both trying desperately. 

171
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:08,244
 He was trying to cross my path... and I was trying to avoid him. 

172
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,400
 Seoul, present 

173
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,507
- Hello. You're early.
 - No, I just got here.

174
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:35,084
- I'm so sorry about yesterday.
 - Don't be.

175
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:39,164
Department Head Choi was there to help us, so it went well.

176
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:40,273
Right.

177
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,483
This is Ms. Miyazawa Hiroko.

178
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:47,280
She'll be working as your interpreter from now on.

179
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,075
Hello, Mr. Sasae. It's a pleasure to meet you.

180
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,204
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

181
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:58,872
I found it interesting that you included a poem by Yun Dong Ju in your recent work.

182
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:03,930
Is there a favorite line or poem that was written by the poet?

183
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,275
"I found it interesting that you included a poem by Yun Dong Ju in your recent work.

184
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:14,172
Is there a favorite line or poem that was written by the poet?"

185
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,721
Mr. Sasae?

186
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,538
I'm sorry. What was the question again?

187
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,423
I'll make sure to.

188
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,759
- Thank you for your time.
 - Thank you.

189
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,493
Let's go.

190
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,833
That was great. Thank you.

191
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,852
You have about an hour before the next interview.

192
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:46,087
Would you like me to get you some coffee?

193
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,316
Yes, please. Thank you.

194
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,636
- By the way...
 - Yes? What is it?

195
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:56,532
Will Ms. Choi from yesterday be joining us today?

196
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,617
Do you mean Ms. Choi Hong?

197
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,329
Do you need to talk to her?

198
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:07,335
No. Don't worry about it.

199
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:11,589
Actually, may I have her phone number?

200
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,050
Her number?

201
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,684
Yes.

202
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,747
I'm sorry,

203
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,293
but I'll need to ask her if that's all right with her.

204
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,087
Right, of course.

205
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,731
Then maybe where she lives?

206
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:34,200
I think... she lives near the Bundang district.

207
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,681
- Bundang?
 - Yes.

208
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:42,245
I heard she lives near a big lake in the area.

209
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:45,030
But I don't know exactly.

210
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,450
I see.

211
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,817
A big lake...

212
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,623
Jungo!

213
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,970
 Tokyo, 5 years ago 

214
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,996
What's up with him?

215
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,550
I heard he got dumped.

216
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,564
What are you looking at me for? I dumped him ages ago.

217
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,090
Right?

218
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,636
I wondered if you two had got back together.

219
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:34,447
Some people get back together after breaking up.

220
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,758
He has been popular lately.

221
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:39,202
Is that why he has no time to write?

222
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:44,874
Here I am, writing every day, and I barely get anything done.

223
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,685
But he's out getting girls all the time.

224
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,647
- I wonder if he gets any time to write.
 - Right.

225
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:54,551
What's the point of writing quality stuff?

226
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,377
I want to have some romance, too.

227
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:22,419
Can I have one?

228
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:42,416
I do feel a bit upset.

229
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:47,495
You didn't have such a hard time when we broke up.

230
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,189
I haven't broken up yet.

231
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,699
Is that how she sees it, though?

232
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:57,363
If you really miss her that much, shouldn't you try

233
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,781
something to get her back?

234
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,784
What do you know?

235
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,037
I know enough.

236
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,957
I know you probably haven't contacted her,

237
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,793
although you miss her like crazy.

238
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,345
Jungo.

239
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,758
If you're having such a hard time...

240
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,022
why don't we get back together?

241
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,940
 Seoul, today 

242
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,651
I thought you were busy.

243
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:46,195
You're the star of our company.

244
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,389
I was worried knowing you're here all by yourself.

245
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:52,852
And the promotion in Korea is pretty important for the company, too.

246
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:57,065
Everyone's taking really good care of me here.

247
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,116
You've got nothing to worry about.

248
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,693
I know, but still.

249
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:05,715
I thought you'd be really happy to see me if I showed up like this.

250
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,809
Can't you at least act as if you're happy to see me?

251
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,270
I am happy.

252
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,704
I'm leaving on Tuesday for Fukuoka anyway

253
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:18,022
to meet Mr. Kudo.

254
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,172
So, I'll keep you company until then.

255
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,510
Thanks.

256
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,389
- Send Mr. Kudo my regards.
 - Sure.

257
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:34,050
Let's go get something good when you're done with the interview.

258
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,647
Hello. You must be Ms. Kobayashi.

259
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,274
- Yes.
 - It's a pleasure to meet you.

260
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:43,194
- I'm Lee Min Jae from Sodam Books.
 - Pleased to meet you.

261
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:46,805
We've only met in online meetings before.

262
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,517
It's great to finally meet you in person.

263
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,619
Likewise, Ms. Kobayashi.

264
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:54,639
I heard that you've been taking great care of Mr. Sasae.

265
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,957
Thank you for your assistance.

266
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:59,777
I should be the one thanking him.

267
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,131
He is a very special person to me,

268
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:06,408
so please take good care of him.

269
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:14,566
This should be better than something thick, right?

270
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,678
What?

271
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,198
Right.

272
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,403
Let's go with this one, then.

273
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:28,681
All right. And what about your tie? Did you have anything in mind?

274
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,135
I think you'd look better in a bow tie than a standard one. What do you think?

275
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:34,503
Which one should I go with?

276
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,374
- Hey.
 - What?

277
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,920
Right.

278
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,857
- I think they're both nice.
 - Me too.

279
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:49,819
It's hard to pick something when he looks good in anything, right?

280
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,463
Why do you have to be so good-looking?

281
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,309
Let's go with the bow tie, then.

282
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,938
Do you want to try the second shirt on again?

283
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,789
- Sure.
 - Great. This way, please.

284
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,993
What's going on?
 You know this is your wedding, right?

285
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,830
Just tell them if you don't like the suit.

286
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,000
- It's not that.
 - What is it then? Is it Min Jun?

287
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,226
Hey!

288
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:25,063
How could you say something like that, all of a sudden?

289
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:26,965
What?

290
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:30,234
Why are you so angry?

291
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:31,511
Honestly!

292
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,938
Are you ready to try on the dresses?

293
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,254
What's taking you so long? Don't you like it?

294
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,151
Can't you at least show us what it looks like?

295
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:49,173
Do you think she fainted because it looked so good?

296
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:51,473
Do I have to put a stop to this wedding?

297
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,978
What are you talking about?

298
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,327
It's just the cheesy comments.

299
00:23:56,327 --> 00:24:00,380
I don't know if she can put up with it for the rest of her life.

300
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,918
- Are you jealous?
 - Excuse me?

301
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:14,618
Could you turn toward the mirror?

302
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,241
Does it feel uncomfortable?

303
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:20,009
Well...

304
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,704
Is it supposed to feel like this?

305
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:27,442
It's not exactly your everyday dress. Most people find it awkward at first.

306
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:29,736
It looks so good, though!

307
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,364
It's not easy to pull this one off, but it looks like it was made for you.

308
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:36,074
You look absolutely stunning!

309
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,202
I'll wait for you outside.

310
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,795
Remember to give her a big smile, all right?

311
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:50,731
Oh, of course.

312
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,862
 I'm regretting it. 

313
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:08,006
For the past five years...

314
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:15,164
I've never once forgotten about her.

315
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:39,405
It's so pretty.

316
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,298
It's hard trying on dresses, isn't it?

317
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,569
- You must be exhausted.
 - No. It was fun.

318
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,720
But the dresses weren't my style. That's all.

319
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,568
It's all right. I didn't like this place either.

320
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,284
I'll call a few more places.

321
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:45,311
Let's call it a day and get something good.

322
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:49,334
We haven't had tripe in a while. It's your favorite, isn't it?

323
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,527
- Tripe?
 - Oh, right.

324
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,797
We'll just have to go without you since you can't handle it. Sorry about that.

325
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:58,243
I feel like having a girl's night out tonight.

326
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,119
Is that all right?

327
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:02,930
Well, sure.

328
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,850
You two can go and enjoy yourselves tonight.

329
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,976
Thank you.

330
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:10,145
- Let me borrow her just for today.
 - Okay.

331
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,907
- It's all right. Go.
 - Come on.

332
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,003
- See you!
 - See you.

333
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,623
This is so good.

334
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:32,835
Don't you think the off the shoulder one was much better?

335
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:36,631
- It was so pretty.
 - But what should I do with my upper arms?

336
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,950
I'm going on a diet starting tomorrow.

337
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,361
What a joke. You're basically just skin and bones.

338
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,721
Hey!

339
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,807
Are you having second thoughts?

340
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,500
- About what?
 - The wedding.

341
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,395
I mean, he's handsome, has a great job,

342
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,397
and was like a son when your dad got sick.

343
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:54,124
You got yourself a keeper,

344
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:57,135
but you looked so upset whenever you tried on a new dress.

345
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,328
It felt like I was at a funeral!

346
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:02,323
Just break it off.

347
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:03,491
What has he got to lose?

348
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:07,419
I bet there's a line of girls who would die to marry Min Jun.

349
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,458
What's with the long face?

350
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,584
I feel bad now.

351
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,792
What's with the look?

352
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:38,133
No, really, Hong, what's wrong with you?

353
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,115
Ji Hui.

354
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,749
What is it?

355
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:50,395
He's here.

356
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,958
He's in Seoul.

357
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,252
He? Who?

358
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,989
Jungo...

359
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,600
 Tokyo, 5 years ago 

360
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,254
 Jungo was always on the move. 

361
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,108
 I've never seen him just sitting around. 

362
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:21,552
 Not even once. 

363
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:26,950
Are you all right?

364
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,984
I'm all right.

365
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:37,877
 But even when he was busy, 

366
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:41,581
 I always wanted to be by his side. 

367
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:44,008
 I wanted to know everything about him 

368
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:46,177
 and be involved in everything he did. 

369
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:50,289
 I wanted to be a part of him. 

370
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:52,934
I made you wait for so long.

371
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:55,144
You could've gone home without me.

372
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,729
It's fine.

373
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:58,856
It's been so long since we walked home together.

374
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,650
It's so nice.

375
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,610
- Has it been that long?
 - Yeah.

376
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,574
I'm hungry.

377
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,620
- Shall we stop by the convenience store?
 - Sure!

378
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,249
Let's go.

379
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,385
- Is it good?
 - Yes.

380
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:31,514
- Beni?
 - Yes?

381
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,573
Can I have a bite?

382
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,704
That's enough!

383
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,874
 Back then, I didn't know what it meant. 

384
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:50,641
 I simply thought that was normal for people in love. 

385
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,221
Goodbye.

386
00:30:57,582 --> 00:31:00,610
Are you sure you'll be all right without me?

387
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,489
I feel so bad leaving you by yourself.

388
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:08,034
- Sorry for going without you.
 - Don't be.

389
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:12,362
People were born to be alone.

390
00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:16,357
Hong. Stop doing that.

391
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:18,344
Stop pretending to be fine when you're not.

392
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,397
I know that it's tough sometimes.

393
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:22,857
You can tell me anything.

394
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:25,902
It's all right to tell me when you're feeling down.

395
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:27,578
Got it?

396
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:31,482
I'm actually fine.

397
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,410
There you go again.

398
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,587
Call me when you get to Seoul.

399
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:40,032
Come here.

400
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,939
Jungo can take care of you now.

401
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:50,093
Don't cry too much when I'm gone.

402
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:54,362
- I won't! Just go. Get on the bus.
 - See you!

403
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:13,866
Jungo. Let's close up and have a drink.

404
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:17,887
- Oh, no, thanks.
 - There's still time before the first bus.

405
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:20,223
- I have plans tomorrow.
 - Just stay for once!

406
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:22,233
Jungo,

407
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,862
it's Nana's birthday today.

408
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:29,215
I need you to be my wingman, so help me out!

409
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,094
Come and have a drink, Jungo!

410
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:36,514
- Yes, come on.
 - Take a seat here.

411
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,349
Come on, let's have a drink.

412
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:40,784
Come on, Jungo!

413
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:06,794
 Back then, 

414
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:11,106
 I was very reckless and clumsy. 

415
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,518
So?

416
00:33:22,518 --> 00:33:26,213
- What about the house?
 - We're moving soon.

417
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,876
- Where to?
 - We're moving to Bundang.

418
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,320
Isn't Bundang too far from your school?

419
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,030
 Yes, it's pretty far. 

420
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,074
Three hours there and back.

421
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,536
Whatever.

422
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:43,714
 I wish I could move out like you. 

423
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:47,126
What about Dad?

424
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,762
- How's he doing?
  - What do you think? 

425
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:53,215
His life's work is about to get closed down.

426
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:56,385
 He's all over the place these days. 

427
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,225
Hey, did you get into graduate school?

428
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:06,311
- What?
  - Haven't you heard back from them yet? 

429
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,964
No, I have.

430
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,192
I failed.

431
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:18,908
- You must be so upset.
 - It's probably for the better.

432
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:21,168
It was too expensive, anyway.

433
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:28,525
 Doshisha University Letter of Acceptance 

434
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,260
I'm an honest person.

435
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,660
You're such a liar.

436
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,671
Hey, Miss.

437
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:18,666
You're always running alone. Do you want to have a drink with me?

438
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:22,395
Hold on! Just stay for one.

439
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,382
Are you all right?

440
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:29,729
Miss! It's only one drink!

441
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:32,147
Hey, come back!

442
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,045
Excuse me!

443
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:48,297
Is everything all right?

444
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:53,627
Are you all right?

445
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:08,084
I'm sorry.

446
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:11,187
Your friend's not answering his phone.

447
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,923
Would you like to wait here a little longer?

448
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,009
I see.

449
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,668
I'm fine now.

450
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,988
Thank you.

451
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:23,099
- Will you be all right by yourself?
 - Yes.

452
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,250
I'll be fine.

453
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:37,212
Thank you for everything.

454
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,296
 Ishigami Hospital 

455
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:57,400
Fortunately, it doesn't look too serious.

456
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,187
It might be tough to go home with crutches.

457
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,381
Do you have anyone to help you?

458
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,574
Just a moment, please.

459
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,305
 Yun Oh 

460
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:14,083
Good evening, gents. Come on in.

461
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,961
This way, please.

462
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,946
A party of three.

463
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,400
Can you drink more?

464
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,792
 Beni 

465
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:34,061
Thank you, that's 30,000 yen  (≈ $200) .

466
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:41,085
Here's your change of 120 yen.

467
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:47,373
This is your statement, receipt, and medication.

468
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:51,320
- Have a good night.
 - Thank you very much.

469
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,639
All done.

470
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,243
I'm so sorry.

471
00:37:57,243 --> 00:38:00,313
You're so busy but I troubled you.

472
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:04,258
Not at all. It's really no trouble at all.

473
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:08,554
- I'll put your medicine here.
 - Thank you so much for your help.

474
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:11,765
- Can you manage?
 - I'll be fine.

475
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,029
Did you lose your phone?

476
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:54,182
No...

477
00:38:57,353 --> 00:39:01,516
- We were completely swamped tonight.
 - I'm sure.

478
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:05,693
You're always busy with work, Jungo.

479
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:08,539
I'm always second to everything else.

480
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:11,192
What are you talking about, Beni?

481
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,635
But it's true.

482
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,938
Do you even know what I'm worried about

483
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,941
or what's going on with me these days?

484
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:22,651
I'm so sorry about today.

485
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,805
Only today?

486
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,305
If you're really sorry, quit all your jobs.

487
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:33,973
Come on, Beni.

488
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:38,311
Work is like a life lesson for aspiring writers like me.

489
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:39,879
You know that.

490
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:43,601
On top of that, I need to work to pay for college.

491
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,608
What about me?

492
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,439
What am I to you, Jungo?

493
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,085
Whether I go to the police station or a hospital,

494
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,604
does any of that matter to you?

495
00:39:56,604 --> 00:40:01,526
- That's not what I meant— 
 - Why do I always have to be alone?

496
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:03,778
How are you alone, Beni?

497
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,197
We go to bed and wake up together every day.

498
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,082
I...

499
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,079
I...

500
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,873
I only work very hard

501
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:18,877
because I want to be with you.

502
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,837
I can't...

503
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,989
understand

504
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:26,308
why you're working so hard.

505
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,305
I can't stand the fact that

506
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,308
I have no one else I can vent to.

507
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,943
You're the only one I have.

508
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:49,290
 Solitude can make a person anxious. 

509
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,388
 Solitude... 

510
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:58,132
 weakens love. 

511
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,028
 And... 

512
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,789
 when youth is added to the mix, 

513
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:08,009
 everything... 

514
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,227
 becomes precarious. 

515
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,225
 Seoul, present  
 Hey, just forget it. Forget all about it.

516
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,352
It's all good now.

517
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,229
So, you said to that guy...

518
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:22,248
You told that good-looking guy what the deal was, right?

519
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:24,292
You told him you're getting married soon.

520
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:27,028
Yes. I did.

521
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:29,520
- I told him straight out.
 - Well done.

522
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,450
- There's no reason for you to see him again, anyway.
 - That's right.

523
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,705
As long as the interpreter shows up,

524
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:40,083
or unless I run into him on the streets out of the blue,

525
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,830
I won't ever have to see him again.

526
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,020
- Okay! 
 - Okay!

527
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:46,265
- One more drink!
 - Yes!

528
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:49,676
I'm down. Excuse me, sir.

529
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:53,655
Can you drop us off at the street bar up ahead?

530
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:54,839
- Hey, ma'am!
- Ta-da!

531
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,875
We're here.

532
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,602
- Look who's here!
 - Did you miss us?

533
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:01,362
Sure did.

534
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,040
What?

535
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,743
- Mr. Min Jun!
 - Min Jun?

536
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:10,613
Hey!

537
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:13,658
I need to stop by my house. You two can start without me.

538
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:17,195
- Why are you suddenly going home?
 - What?

539
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:19,039
A package.

540
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,750
- I was supposed to receive a package!
 - A package?

541
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,295
It's a really important package. I can't believe I forgot.

542
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,588
Hong. I better get going.

543
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,967
- Sorry. I'm in such a rush.
 - Hey!

544
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,601
Bye.

545
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,233
- We were just meant to be.
 - How can you have this without me?

546
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,494
I've still got some left over. See?

547
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,282
Here you go.

548
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:57,626
- Auntie, can we get another bottle of soju?
 - Sure thing.

549
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,166
Pour me a glass.

550
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,942
Yes, ma'am.

551
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,220
I’m happy that we’re finally able to

552
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,772
have a meal with just the two of us.

553
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,275
Yun Oh.

554
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,025
- "Yun Oh"?
 - Doesn't it sound nice?

555
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:34,698
Apparently, that's how your name is pronounced in Korean.

556
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,583
Your interpreter told me.

557
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,795
What have you been thinking about?

558
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,088
What do you mean?

559
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:54,366
Well, you seem bothered by something I don't know about.

560
00:43:56,678 --> 00:44:01,182
But don't you always know what I'm thinking?

561
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,526
Not really.

562
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,030
You're the only one, Jungo...

563
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,201
whom I could never get a read on.

564
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:22,044
That might be why I keep thinking about you.

565
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,549
You already know, don't you?

566
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,743
About what?

567
00:44:28,743 --> 00:44:33,097
The fact that I'm not here just for work.

568
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,851
The thing is...

569
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,263
I'm actually here

570
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,581
to take you back, Jungo.

571
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,727
I've been waiting

572
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:49,238
for you to fall in love with me again

573
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,994
for five years.

574
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,718
By any chance...

575
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,807
Did you...

576
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:22,062
meet her?

577
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:47,030
What is it?

578
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,041
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

579
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,610
When I look at you, I feel at ease.

580
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,005
When I look at you...

581
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,063
it's like I'm looking at a lake.

582
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:06,941
A lake?

583
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,647
So...

584
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:16,659
How long have I looked like a lake to you?

585
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:22,373
We were always friends, right?

586
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,460
Let's see.

587
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,047
The day you arrived at the airport.

588
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,764
 Hong! 

589
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,428
 Welcome back. 

590
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,814
That's when I thought I should muster up the courage.

591
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,191
Seriously?

592
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,155
But I looked terrible that day.

593
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,408
I know, right?

594
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:00,411
But, you know what?

595
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:05,950
I must've really missed you while you were in Japan.

596
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,162
You have no idea how happy I was

597
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:13,215
knowing that you were back home.

598
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:21,716
- Min Jun...
 - Yes?

599
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,767
I...

600
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:27,922
I might be much worse than you think.

601
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,691
Is that so?

602
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,384
I can't wait to see.

603
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,165
Thank you.

604
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,372
The thing is...

605
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,257
- I actually have— 
 - Here.

606
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,763
Eat some food before it gets cold.

607
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,011
Just enjoy the food and drink.

608
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,020
That's the best for you right now.

609
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,006
One day,

610
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:15,395
you might have a change of heart,

611
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,740
and you might even forget what you were going to say.

612
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:23,953
They say that feelings change.

613
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:29,458
We constantly change as we live.

614
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,219
You must be exhausted. Get some rest.

615
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,638
What about you, Kanna?

616
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,968
I don't think I can sleep like this.

617
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,721
I might grab a drink at the bar first.

618
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,181
All right.

619
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,199
Well, I'll see you tomorrow then.

620
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,900
Jungo.

621
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,505
Yes?

622
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:03,276
When I see people clinging to their memories,

623
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:05,744
I feel sad.

624
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,407
Sleep tight.

625
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,427
Thanks.

626
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:33,682
- Get home safely.
 - I will.

627
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,601
I know it's a hassle, but take a warm shower before bed.

628
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:39,145
I don't want you to catch a cold.

629
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:42,232
Fine. I will.

630
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,992
- Goodbye.
 - Bye.

631
00:50:30,588 --> 00:50:34,067
 Japan's Rising Author Sasae Hikari Appears makes his first public appearance in Korea.

 What Comes After Love 

633
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:20,063
 I wanted to ask you something. 

634
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:23,449
  If I ever saw you again, 

635
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:25,168
  I wanted to ask you. 

636
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:28,488
  But I don't think I need to anymore. 

637
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:31,391
  What it was that I wanted to say 

638
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,326
  or whether I really had something to say 

639
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:39,897
  I can't even... remember. 

640
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:43,360
- Beni... 
 - I'm...

641
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:47,122
getting married soon.

642
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:12,591
Kanna?

643
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:24,078
Marry me, Jungo.

♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

657
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:38,790
♫  We're the only ones  ♫

00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,630
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

659
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,530
♫  Promise me  ♫

660
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,670
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

661
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,080
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

662
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,040
♫  Know we need each other  ♫

663
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,820

664
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,210
♫  Hold me in your eyes  ♫

665
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:18,890
♫  I heard you whisper  ♫

666
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:27,860
♫  I believe you're saying about love  ♫

667
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,660
♫  Even if it's not in words I know  ♫

668
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:43,380
♫  And I wanna tell you in your words  ♫

669
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,200
♫  In any shape  ♫

670
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,580
♫  I'll be your meaning  ♫
