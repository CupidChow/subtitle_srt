00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,990


2
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,150
 Inokashira Park Station 

3
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:50,900
 Do you believe in everlasting love? 

4
00:01:52,523 --> 00:02:00,770
 What Comes After Love 

5
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,258
 Tokyo, 2019 

6
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,777
 Ladies and gentlemen,  

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,900
 our flight will be landing at Narita International Airport shortly. 

8
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,976
 Please return your seats to their upright positions, 

9
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:17,227
 stow away your tables, and fasten your seatbelts. 

10
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:20,639
 Ladies and gentlemen, our flight will be landing
 (in Japanese) 

11
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,695
 "Sky, Wind, Stars and Poetry
  at Narita International Airport shortly.  

12
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,614
 Please return your seats to their upright positions... 

13
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,926
 I've always had a dream, but I've never had a plan. 

14
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,849
 Back then I knew I wanted to do many things, 

15
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,200
 but I didn't know what I should be doing. 

16
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,457
 I didn't have the courage nor the confidence to chase   

17
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,892
 my childhood dream of pursuing a career in music. 

18
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,780
 I wasn't exactly ready to jump into society, 

19
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,465
 so I just left forJapan without a plan. 

20
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:56,826
Let me take your bags.

21
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,886
Thank you.

22
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:01,748
- Hello.
 - Hello.

23
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,600
Thank you very much. Please take a seat.

24
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:35,272
 It was by pure chance that I chose Japan. 

25
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:41,246
 I had a friend in Japan who was willing to split the rent with me. 

26
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,389
 Seoul, 5 years ago 
   

27
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,461
Are you listening to me?

28
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,088
Japan is not an option, all right?

29
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,856
Yes, Mom. I hear you.

30
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,009
 And more importantly, 

31
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,511
 I didn't care where I went.  
  Tokyo, 5 years ago 
   

32
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:01,390
 I just wanted to leave the nest to try living my own life. 

33
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,330
 To Kichijoji 

34
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,564
 I was a little afraid, 

35
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:12,475
 but I felt that I could do anything on my own. 

36
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:16,188
 Gate Closed, Under Maintenance 

37
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,402
Oh, why is it stuck?

38
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,823
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,907
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,423
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,566
Sorry.

42
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,560
 Inokashira Park Station 

43
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,189
Are you all right? 
  (In Japanese) 

44
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,807
Oh, I'm...
  (In Korean) 

45
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,067
Wait... 
 (In Korean) 

46
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,152
Yes, I'm all right. 
 (In Japanese) 

47
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,071
That's good.

48
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,047
Here you go.

49
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,594
 Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poetry 

50
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,038
Are you from Korea?

51
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,772
Yes, I am.

52
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,043
Here you go.

53
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,369
Thank you very much.

54
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,692
Would you like me to hold this for you?

55
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,844
- Yes, thank you.
 - It's all right.

56
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,616
Choi Hong!

57
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,394
Ji Hui!

58
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,902
It's been so long!  How did you come this far?

59
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:19,803
It's so hard to transfer subways in Japan.

60
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,649
Good job. First things first.

61
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,225
Let's take a selfie together for your arrival.

62
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,576
-  Right here?
 - Yes.

63
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,870
All right. Look at the camera.

64
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,854
Up here!

65
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,933
Say, "Cheese"!

66
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:39,507
I'm so sorry.

67
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,384
- Yes?
 - The...

68
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,902
guitar...

69
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:46,830
Oh. Here.

70
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,466
- Thank you.
 - No problem.

71
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,705
- Who's this?
 - Oh, no one.

72
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,898
No way...

73
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,024
Already?

74
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,734
It's not like that.

75
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,945
- Two denials equal a yes. 
 - Oh, come on.

76
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:04,658
Sorry, but could you take a picture for us?

77
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,034
Sure.

78
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,677
Your Japanese is very good.

79
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,790
She lived in Tokyo when she was in elementary school.

80
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,308
And she's...

81
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,727
- also singleâ€”
 - Please take a picture with this.

82
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,329
Okay.

83
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,091
Well then.

84
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:29,639
Say, "Kimchi"!

85
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,850
There we go.

86
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,144
- Thank you very much.
 - Thank you.

87
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,245
Don't mention it.

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,903
Goodbye.

89
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,168
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,524
Oh, what the heck!

91
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:07,679
I have to say, your place is a bit different from what I saw on social media.

92
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,572
I can't believe you actually came.

93
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,017
You said to come!

94
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:15,353
Anyway, congratulations on finally moving out.

95
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:16,688
On an international level at that.

96
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,723
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

97
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,963
- The sweetness of freedom.
 - By the way,

98
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,865
what did you tell your mom?

99
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:29,034
- I thought she said you could never.
 - That's right.

100
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,243
So, I didn't tell her.

101
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,246
- What?
 - I didn't want her to worry.

102
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,624
I always knew that you were crazy,

103
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,125
but this is next level.

104
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,336
It's not like she's paying for it.

105
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:42,255
I'm paying with my hard-earned cash from my part time job.

106
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,065
It's my life.

107
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,300
So, I'll do what I want with it.

108
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,177
Oh, come on.

109
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:50,138
When have you ever not lived like that?

110
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,349
Still, you did the right thing.

111
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:56,019
- I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you can't miss.
 - You're right.

112
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,146
- Shall we?
 - Yes, we shall.

113
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,397
- Cheers!
 - Cheers.

114
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,413
What's up with him?

115
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,572
Why is he smiling?

116
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,608
Why are you up so early?

117
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,583
Are you up?

118
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm going for a run around Inokashira Park.

119
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,073
Inokashira Park?

120
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:36,077
You know, it's actually much bigger than it seems.

121
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:39,113
- Do you want to come?
 - No way.

122
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,971
 When I run, 

123
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:58,799
 I am surrounded by the ever-changing scenery. 

124
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,079
 And I like that. 

125
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,833
 It feels like I'm not just stuck in a rut. 

126
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,737
 It feels like... 

127
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,857
 I'm moving forward gradually with each passing day. 

128
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,960
Have you looked into what you want to study

129
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,378
after you complete your language course?

130
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:31,591
Yes, I have. I'd like to continue studying literature.

131
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:36,388
I'm especially interested in Korean poets who studied in Japan.

132
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:38,390
And I'm also very much into haikus.

133
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,808
I see.

134
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,494
You are interested in literature and poetry.

135
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,814
Yes. I still have a long way to go to become a poet,

136
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,607
but I love reading poetry.

137
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,818
I see.

138
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:53,321
Let me know if you need any assistance in entering college.

139
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,448
I'll do my best to help you out.

140
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,925
I will. Thank you.

141
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,428
Thank you so much.

142
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,871
It's my pleasure.

143
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,824
- Let's give it everything we've got.
 - Yes.

144
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,734
Looks yummy.

145
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,443
Seriously?

146
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,170
Why do they want a resume for a part-time job?

147
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,557
Hey, you have no choice.

148
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,425
It's a must in Japan.

149
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:08,171
You can't define a person by what's written on a sheet of paper.

150
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,341
The person I was yesterday is not who I am today.

151
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:14,794
Then, just call your mom. You could ask her to wire you some money.

152
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,762
Seriously...

153
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:19,174
Listen, Hong.

154
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,160
Can't you just scribble something?

155
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,329
You can't even afford this month's rent.

156
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:26,405
Oh, right.

157
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,583
I totally forgot.

158
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,253
Rent!

159
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,362
The rent...

Excuse me.

Excuse me!

Yes!

179
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,822
Hello.

180
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,159
Hello.

181
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,007
After you, please.

182
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,484
No, that's okay.

183
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,643
Please. Go ahead.

184
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,602
Excuse me.

185
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,895
Hello.

186
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:56,155
I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.

187
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,207
- The part-timeâ€”
- The part-timeâ€”

188
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,505
I want to apply for the part-time job.

189
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,333
Same here.

190
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,402
Hey, boss!

191
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,948
- Are you Korean?
- I am.

192
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,011
I lived in Japan for five years when I was in elementary school.

193
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:28,746
So, communication won't be a problem.

194
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:34,035
And your Japanese must be perfect

195
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,729
since you're a literature major.

196
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,605
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,167
Not only am I good at Japanese,

198
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,736
but I can speak Korean, too.

199
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,139
So I can serve Korean customers.

200
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,451
We do get a lot of Korean tourists these days.

201
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,760
Can you speak Korean?

202
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,990
No, I can't speak Korean.

203
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,860
Yes!

204
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,600
However, I've worked all kinds of part-time jobs,

205
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,066
in order to pay for my tuition.

206
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,552
I'm struggling financially this semester, too.

207
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,695
That must be tough.

208
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,578
Since I came to Japan by myself,

209
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,065
I won't be able to pay the rent for this month unless I start working immediately,

210
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,233
and I may get kicked out of my apartment.

211
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,752
Rent...

212
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,737
Yeah, the rent is pretty high around here.

213
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,364
It really is!

214
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,981
And since I'm an international student,

215
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:33,150
I can't even apply for a loan.

216
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,890
All right, I've heard enough.

217
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,667
You need money for living expenses,

218
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,061
and you need money for your tuition.

219
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,087
Unfortunately,

220
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:45,022
we only have one position open.

221
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,220
How about this?

222
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,006
Why don't you stay for tryouts today?

223
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,227
After observing how you two work today,

224
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,646
I'll hire the one who does better.

225
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,574
That's fair, isn't it?

226
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,635
All right. Let's do this.

227
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,416
 OPEN 

228
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,502
Thank you for waiting. Please come in.

229
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:16,121
- Welcome!
 - Welcome!

230
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:17,747
Sorry to keep you waiting.

231
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:19,974
- Thank you.
 - Thank you so much.

232
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,227
Here you go. One large ramen.

233
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,337
- I'll bring you your rice, too.
 - Here you go.

234
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,113
Thank you.

235
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,984
Thank you for waiting.

236
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,653
- I brought the noodles!
 - I got it.

237
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,179
One al dente shoyu ramen, ready to serve!

238
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,698
Thank you.

239
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,077
Thank you for waiting.

240
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,270
This way, please.

241
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,773
- Thank you, ma'am.
 - Thank you. I enjoyed the meal.

242
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,901
Thank you for waiting.

243
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:48,335
Thank you for waiting.

244
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,660
- Welcome!
 - Welcome!

245
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,272
Hey! Menu!

246
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,501
Here you go, sir.

247
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,759
This is our tonkotsu shio ramen, 
 (pork cutlet salty ramen)  

248
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,887
and this is our tonkotsu shoyu ramen.
 (ramen light broth that is flavored with soy sauce) 

249
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:17,515
The  tonkotsu shio ramen is our best seller.

250
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:21,802
Please take your time and let me know when you've decided.

251
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,801
Is there a waiter who speaks Japanese here?

252
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,048
How may I help you, sir?

253
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,117
So many stores hire foreigners these days,

254
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,236
and people like me feel uncomfortable.

255
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:40,956
In that case, I'll be happy to take your order.

256
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:44,793
You need to think of what's best for the customers.

257
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:48,254
You should teach your staff to speak Japanese properly.

258
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,451
Before that,

259
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,054
please apologize for what you just said.

260
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:58,223
What?

261
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,724
You want me to apologize?

262
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,768
Yes, sir.

263
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,020
Please apologize first.

264
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,430
Then, I'll take your order.

265
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,870
Have you lost your mind?

266
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,152
You've got some guts, kid.

267
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,526
You can stare at me all you want,

268
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,802
but I'm not going to apologize.

269
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,405
Well then,

270
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,866
please leave.

271
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,702
You're making the other customers uncomfortable.

272
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,471
Well, I've lost my appetite now,

273
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,574
thanks to you.

274
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:01,103
I was rude to that customer earlier,

275
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:03,021
I'm sorry about that, sir.

276
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,564
Not at all.

277
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,149
I'm sorry that it happened.

278
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,151
It's all right.

279
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,611
You.

280
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:12,112
Please start tomorrow.

281
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,865
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,318
Here you go.

283
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,749
You did well today.

284
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,075
Thank you, sir.

285
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,770
 Iseya 

286
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,397
That must be it.

287
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm telling you!

288
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,759
What do you mean?

289
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,280
What are you saying?

290
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,990
He came to your rescue.

291
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,658
He wanted brownie points.

292
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,618
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,537
Well, look at you!

294
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,665
You were pretty much forever alone in Korea.

295
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:06,460
But look at what you've achieved as soon as you came to Japan.

296
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,670
Come on, I was never forever alone.

297
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,132
I mean, have you ever dated anyone who was half-decent?

298
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,800
One ghosted you and one went to the army.

299
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,304
When did you ever snag a catch?

300
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,823
Then there's Min Jun, who's actually not that bad.

301
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:22,616
But you insist he's just a friend.

302
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,895
Listen.

303
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:28,707
How many times must I tell you? He really is just a friend.

304
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,751
Sure, whatever.

305
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:34,463
Did he cry when you left Korea?

306
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,365
Poor Min Jun.

307
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:40,202
I'm sure "friend" is Min Jun's most hated word.

308
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:44,413
Enough already.. Not like you don't have male friends.

309
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,466
I feel bad for your knight in shining armor, though.

310
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,159
You said he needs to earn money for tuition.

311
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,996
I think he got a job at a food truck across the street.

312
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,148
Which is a relief.

313
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:55,010
A food truck?

314
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,690
 Inubushi Kitchen Car 

315
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,871
Here you go.

316
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,028
 Closed 

317
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,995
Here is your order. Thank you for coming!

318
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,325
Thank you.

319
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,201
What can I get you?

320
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:52,541
You're staring at the food truck again.

321
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,608
What?

322
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,335
Who, me?

323
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,629
I wasn't.

324
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,406
I was just...

325
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:03,017
checking to see if it was raining outside.

326
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,639
Hong.

327
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:11,192
- Yes, sir?
 - Can you get some hot dogs for us?

328
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:15,988
Yes, sir.

329
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,350
 Best Hot dogs Here 

330
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,196
- Thank you for your waiting!
 - Here we go!

331
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,681
Hong finally passes centerline

332
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,409
and runs straight into the opponent's territory!

333
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:28,894
I wonder...

334
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:31,163
if Hong will finally get to score her first goal.

335
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:32,831
The suspense is real!

336
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:35,041
However,

337
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:39,029
did she have to go out with that headwrap on her head?

338
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,839
What a terrible sight!

339
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,676
It shouldn't be too hard to figure it out.

340
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,887
I guess she's really nervous.

341
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,872
Perhaps she's not experienced enough.

342
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:51,558
Not experienced. I see.

343
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,277
Thank you. Please come again.

344
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,234
Hello.

345
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,910
Hello.

346
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,096
It's been a while.

347
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,604
Are you here for some hot dogs?

348
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,231
Oh, yes.

349
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:16,807
Can I have five cheese hot dogs, please?

350
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,835
- Five?
 - Yes.

351
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,553
Five cheese hot dogs.

352
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:30,229
That headwrap looks good on you.

353
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:33,232
Thank you.

354
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,310
And you, too.

355
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,570
You look good in your apron.

356
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,490
Thank you.

357
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,536
Thank you very much.

358
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,990
Here she comes!

359
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,750
Get back to work!

360
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:53,537
One hot dog for each!

361
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,588
- Great.
 - Thanks.

362
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,883
Here you go.

363
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,962
- Thanks.
 - Here you go.

364
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,131
Oh yeah.

365
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:08,368
It's our turn to clean the shopping district this week.

366
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,662
We've always had the newbies do it.

367
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,639
So, you'll be doing that from now.

368
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,365
It starts at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Can you do it?

369
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,078
Of course. Leave it to me.

370
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:20,439
Good luck!

371
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,114
Yes, sir!

372
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:31,266
The stores of the Kichijoji Prosperity Association

373
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:34,394
work hard to keep the shopping district clean.

374
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:38,957
We clean one area each morning.

375
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,376
We appreciate your cooperation.

376
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:42,903
- Thank you very much.
 - Thank you very much.

377
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,270
Let's start by taking attendance.

378
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,730
Ichiro's Ramen?

379
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,258
- Here.
 - Thank you.

380
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,468
Murakami Bookstore?

381
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,595
- Here.
 - Great.

382
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,930
Inubushi Kitchen Car?

383
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,999
Inubushi Kitchen Car?

384
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,460
Is there anyone from Inubushi Kitchen Car?

385
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,570
I'm here!

386
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,568
- Sorry for being late.
 - That's all right.

387
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:09,029
- Wasabi Store?
 - Here.

388
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,572
Eclin Store?

389
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:11,656
- Present.
 - Thank you.

390
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,575
All right. Let's get to work.

391
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:14,910
Can you get this?

392
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,544
Over here.

393
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,103
Oh, that's cold!

394
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,380
 Rock 

395
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,240
- Eonni!
 - What's up, Rock?

396
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,325
You promised only to call in emergencies.

397
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,302
It's actually an emergency right now.

398
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,003
 Choi Hong! 

399
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,374
What's wrong with you?

400
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:04,693
You said you were going to Jeju Island.  What on earth are you doing in Japan? 

401
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:06,753
It's pretty much the same.

402
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,421
It's about as close as Jeju, and Japan's an island, too.

403
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,341
Come back home right now.

404
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,344
If you're done with college,  you should be thinking about getting a job! 

405
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,330
 How can you think to run away like a kid? 

406
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,773
I'm not a kid. That's why I moved out.

407
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,894
Are you listening to yourself right now?

408
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:25,714
Stop wasting your time and get back here

409
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,382
 or you'll regret this later! 

410
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:28,567
Listen, Mom.

411
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,969
It's for me to regret, if I do,  and my own time to waste.

412
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,279
It's my life.

413
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,116
You don't even know why I came here and what it is that I want to do, do you?

414
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,827
You're always the same. You dip your toes in this and that,

415
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:41,204
 then quit when things don't work out. 

416
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:44,730
I know you ran away because you're afraid to get a job.

417
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,730
- Mom!
 - What? 

418
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,900
 Am I wrong? 

419
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,548
No, you're right.

420
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:54,384
I did run away.

421
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,143
I ran away from you.

422
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:16,038
Talk about perfect timing.

423
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,072
You know...

424
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:57,371
If you're free after work tonight...

425
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,186
do you want to go for a drink?

426
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,340
I wonder if it's this way.

427
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,895
I see.

428
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,934
So, you might end up staying in Japan for a while then.

429
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:29,254
I'm not sure yet.

430
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:32,698
I'm getting ready to go to graduate school...

431
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,678
but I don't know if I'll stay here

432
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:39,322
or just move on.

433
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:42,083
I'm not even sure if I'll like it here.

434
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,790
You can take your time and think about it while you're here.

435
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,417
Just as you said,

436
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,211
I just want to take things slow.

437
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:55,638
In life...

438
00:30:56,281 --> 00:31:00,325
don't we have times when we need to buffer?

439
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,186
"Buffer"?

440
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:04,831
I mean,

441
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:08,351
Kind of like putting the brakes on.

442
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:12,446
I see. You mean to put the brakes on.

443
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,823
The closest person to me

444
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:25,644
can't understand me at all.

445
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:28,588
She doesn't even try to understand me.

446
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,049
Has that ever happened to you?

447
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,676
It happens sometimes.

448
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:44,204
That's why it hurts so much more.

449
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,039
It's so frustrating.

450
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,691
That's why I came all the way here.

451
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,482
Oh, by the way.

452
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:58,110
You're a literature major, right?

453
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,887
- Right.
 - So am I!

454
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,663
No way!

455
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:07,536
We have quite a lot in common.

456
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,663
How so?

457
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:13,291
Well, we both have the same major,

458
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,836
and we're both working hard.

459
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,254
And...

460
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:19,138
What else...

461
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,366
Right!

462
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:24,176
We're both buffering!

463
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,462
You're right.

464
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,362
So, why did you choose literature?

465
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:41,803
I wanted to become a writer.

466
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:45,713
Actually, I feel more comfortable

467
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,165
expressing my thoughts on paper.

468
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:52,463
What are you writing these days?

469
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,318
Well, just this and that.

470
00:32:56,318 --> 00:33:00,238
I just write down whatever comes to mind,

471
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:03,933
but I'm still an amateur at writing.

472
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:12,334
I think you'll make it.

473
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:14,311
Pardon?

474
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,153
As a writer, I mean.

475
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,324
You think so?

476
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,827
Trust me.

477
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,455
I've got a hunch.

478
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,089
Can I...

479
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,251
trust your hunch?

480
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,859
If you don't believe it,

481
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,506
then come with me.

482
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,181
What?

483
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,565
Come on.

484
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:02,275
Come on!

485
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:03,951
You've got this.

486
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:12,001
Come on, Bonobono!

487
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,712
Come on! Come on!

488
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,471
That's too bad.

489
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,982
I was hoping it'd be a Bonobono.

490
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:38,128
Since you got Dai Nee-chan,

491
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:41,481
it means your hunch was wrong, right?

492
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,984
You know Dai Nee-chan?

493
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:47,696
Not many people know about that character though.

494
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:51,658
She's the older sister of Shimarisu-kun, who is Bonobono's friend.

495
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:53,535
Oh, no way!

496
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:55,670
You really do know her!

497
00:34:56,413 --> 00:35:00,851
Since your hunch was wrong, shall we call it a day?

498
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,420
Did you say we're going for another drink?

499
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,922
What? You seem pretty drunk already.

500
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:07,591
I'm not drunk at all.

501
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:10,510
I drank very little earlier.

502
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,722
You had ten lemon sours.

503
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:15,864
Hey, this is Choi Hong you're talking to.

504
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,392
What was that?

505
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:18,852
Choi?

506
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:21,605
That's right. Choi Hong.

507
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,337
My last name is Choi,

508
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,639
and my first name is Hong.

509
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,363
I'm Jungo.

510
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:32,790
My name's Aoki Jungo.

511
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,619
- Jungo.
 - Right.

512
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,378
Jungo...

513
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,882
Hey, Jungo.

514
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:47,047
Doesn't Dai Nee-chan look lonely to you?

515
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,480
How about...

516
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,510
We look for her boyfriend!

517
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,804
- You mean Pippo?
 - That's right!

518
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:57,390
Let's get Pippo so they can be together!

519
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,692
- Sure.
 - Good.

520
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,444
Come on, Pippo!

521
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,488
You got one again!

522
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,122
That's amazing!

523
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,254
Are you all right?

524
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:31,675
I could've got Pippo if I just played one more round.

525
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:36,555
Dai Nee-chan needs to have Pippo by her side.

526
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:39,391
Don't worry.

527
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,518
Even without your help,

528
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,396
they'll always be together.

529
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:46,364
Eternally.

530
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,201
Eternally...

531
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:59,752
Do you believe in everlasting love?

532
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:06,884
That's a difficult question.

533
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:14,475
I guess it exists somewhere.

534
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,356
"Somewhere"?

535
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:25,319
I made up my mind!

536
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:30,317
I'm going to stay here.

537
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:33,953
I want to go and see where that "somewhere" is.

538
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,618
By the way,

539
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:42,037
where do you live?

540
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:43,830
I'll be fine.

541
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,090
I can go home by myself.

542
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,044
Goodbye.

543
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,046
How are you going to get home?

544
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:53,423
I'm going to run.

545
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:55,224
Now?

546
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,553
Don't worry.

547
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:03,316
I'm probably much faster than you.

548
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:12,192
You know,

549
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,544
I may look very frail,

550
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,880
but I run around Inokashira Park

551
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,598
five times every morning.

552
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,762
That cannot be true.

553
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,306
What do you mean? You don't believe me?

554
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,974
Of course not.

555
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:31,353
Inokashira Park is actually pretty big.

556
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,188
Unbelievable.

557
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm being serious!

558
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,442
I can prove it.

559
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,652
Don't get surprised.

560
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,037
Make sure to watch me run.

561
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,826
Wait! You're way too drunk.

562
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,952
Hong?

563
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,670
Hong!

564
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:58,762
She can actually run.

565
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,062
Well, look who it is.

566
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,238
If it isn't the resident lunatic.

567
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,568
So, tell me.

568
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:23,037
How much did you have to drink?

569
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,327
That's weird.

570
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,830
Did I bump my head somewhere?

571
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,672
Eat up for your hangover.

572
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,459
So?

573
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,877
What was he like?

574
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,421
You met him, didn't you?

575
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,138
The hot dog man?

576
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,883
Yes.

577
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,510
I did.

578
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,554
And?

579
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,230
Well...

580
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:57,988
 Give me money. 

581
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,844
Good going, my friend.

582
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,478
Yeah...

583
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,892
Hey, don't worry about it too much.

584
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,443
You'll see him again if you're meant to be.

585
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,781
I don't think I can ever...

586
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,880
 I've never believed in such things. 

587
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,174
 Rather than believing in fate or miracles, 

588
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:10,394
 I've always wanted to believe in myself. 

589
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,850
 Ji Hui thinks it's fate when coincidences repeat, 

590
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,936
 but I think that's just wishful thinking. 

591
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,356
 People who believe in fate 

592
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,991
 are the ones who hope for a miracle to happen. 

593
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,869
 But... 

594
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,176
Hey.

595
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,425
Wait! Hong?

596
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,935
Stop!

597
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,430
Wait up! Don't go!

598
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,314
Hong!

599
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,694
Oh, no.

600
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,200
Are you all right?

601
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,911
No, I'm not.

602
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,130
That really hurts.

603
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,261
I'm so sorry about the other night.

604
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,097
Don't worry about it.

605
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:33,762
You're a little later than usual today.

606
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,348
It's already past 11 a.m.

607
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,308
What?

608
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,025
By any chance...

609
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,645
Thanks to you,

610
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,892
I'm late for school today.

611
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:49,903
Have you been waiting for me all morning?

612
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:55,992
Finally,

613
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,710
I got it.

614
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:03,875
Is this...

615
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,294
When did you get this?

616
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:10,465
I went back to the area yesterday.

617
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:13,760
So, I just wanted to try,

618
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,812
and I got it on the first try.

619
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,405
 Please be it. 

620
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:37,541
 Yes! 

621
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,422
 I did it! 

622
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:03,609
 That was the moment when I realized 

623
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,896
 that fate 

624
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:09,065
 really did exist 

625
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:11,158
 in this world. 

626
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:19,951
 It was a moment I've never felt before. 

627
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:23,538
 It was also a moment 

628
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:25,714
 that I would never get to experience again. 

629
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,920
Please hand in your work next week.

630
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,772
All right. That's it for today.

631
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:34,932
Well done, everyone.

632
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:39,603
Please come and ask me if you have any questions.

633
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,070
Jungo!

634
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:04,003
A cherry blossom.

635
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:20,853
 Closed 

636
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,101
- I'll see you tomorrow, everyone.
 - See you!

637
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,062
Hold on. Did something good happen to you?

638
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,438
- What?
 - That look on your face...

639
00:45:30,438 --> 00:45:32,581
Nothing really happened.

640
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,930
What?

641
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:40,807
I knew it, Hong!

642
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,475
You finally scored!

643
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:44,919
It's not like that.

644
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:47,890
I'll see you tomorrow!

645
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,551
- Bye!
 - Have fun!

646
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:55,580
They're enjoying their youth.

647
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,841
She's got some moves.

648
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,892
It's nice to be young.

649
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,006
It's so beautiful.

650
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:36,095
How do I say "beautiful" in Korean?

651
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,716
It may be a little hard to say.

652
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,976
You say, " yeppeuda. "

653
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,603
 Yeppeuda. 

654
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,515
That was pretty good!

655
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:49,525
So, it's  yeppeuda. 

656
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,784
 Yeppeuda. 

657
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,214
Hong.

658
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,666
Sorry.

659
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,265
 The spring of that year was... 

660
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,428
 my first... 

661
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,687
 and my last... 

662
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,271
 Back then, 

663
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,648
 I firmly believed that if I truly loved someone... 

664
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,442
 Seoul, 5 years later 

665
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:24,578
 ...the abundance of the universe would be there to help me. 

666
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,498
 That was what I believed. 

667
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,838
 Everyone knows 

668
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,633
 that even love has an expiration date. 

669
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:43,764
 But I believed 

670
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,302
 things would be different for me. 

671
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,478
 I believed our love would be different. 

672
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,104
 After I broke up with Jungo and came back from Japan, 

673
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,447
 I was tormented by the fear 

674
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,277
 that I would end up destroying myself 

675
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:07,072
 if I didn't immerse myself in something. 

676
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,074
 Sodam Publishing House 

677
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:11,618
I've made some notes on it.

678
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,752
Would you like to take a look?

679
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,540
Manager Lee, this is the final version.

680
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,501
All right.

681
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,960
Ms. Choi.

682
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,629
This is the final version.

683
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,507
We'll go ahead and print it if you don't find any issues.

684
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,092
Could you take a look?

685
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,968
I'll get back to you after one last review.

686
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,811
Sure.

687
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,729
 If I knew that I was going to meet Jungo... 

688
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:17,942
 I wouldn't have gone. 

689
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,600
Chief, did you see the snow outside?

690
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:30,405
I did.  I was stuck in traffic because of it.

691
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,115
Right.

692
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,701
If everyone is here, let's start, shall we?

693
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,244
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:39,539
First, let me show you the cover design for the reprint.

695
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,583
We've already seen it last time.

696
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,460
Let's move on to the next item on the agenda.

697
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,919
Yes, ma'am.

698
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:48,740
We couldn't decide on the copy for the cover in our last meeting.

699
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,217
I've narrowed it down to these two options.

700
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:53,078
Let me read them to you first.

701
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:56,689
That's fine. Let's just read it ourselves.

702
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:02,604
Have we still not received Writer Park Ji Hui's manuscript?

703
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:07,074
Well, we haven't been able to contact her since yesterday.

704
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,153
All right.

705
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,197
I'll try to get in touch with her.

706
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,822
Manager Lee, are you ready for next week's event?

707
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,957
Yes, Chief.

708
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:19,037
Writer Sasae is scheduled to arrive by lunchtime tomorrow.

709
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:23,166
Once he arrives, the interview will proceed at 4 p.m.

710
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:27,543
Manager Lee, can you continue working with the CEO on the Japanese section?

711
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,589
I know you're busy with the South American section.

712
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,216
Don't worry about us.

713
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:33,684
Everything's going to be perfect.

714
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:40,308
Sir, can we make the color a bit darker?

715
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,610
Of course, we can.

716
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,022
This way.

717
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:49,867
- Have we received the first shipment?
 - Yes, it's all here.

718
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,780
And the second batch is arriving in two days, right?

719
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,915
Yes, it will all get here in time.

720
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,018
When did you get here?

721
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,356
Just now.

722
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:21,032
What's that?

723
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:24,953
It's a cake.

724
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:27,531
I was craving something sweet.

725
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:29,283
How did you know?

726
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:32,752
How do you always know me so well?

727
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:36,681
It's nice to hear such a lovely compliment,

728
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:39,835
but it feels like you're happier to see this than me.

729
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:41,211
How did you know?

730
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,613
See? I'm an open book to you.

731
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,359
Hold on.

732
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,219
You didn't forget what day today is, did you?

733
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:50,762
Today?

734
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:53,240
Is it Valentine's Day? No, it's not.

735
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,999
No way.

736
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,078
Is it Cake Day?

737
00:52:58,078 --> 00:53:00,997
It's your mother's birthday today.

738
00:53:00,997 --> 00:53:04,084
You're right! What time is it now?

739
00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:06,653
Come on, Hong.

740
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:08,230
Didn't you forget last year as well?

741
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,274
But lunar birthdays are so confusing.

742
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,901
I forgot to get her something.

743
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:14,769
Let's just go.

744
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:16,820
What? All right.

745
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,933
Min Jun.

746
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:22,227
Can we tell her that this is from me?

747
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:23,937
Please?

748
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:27,399
Don't give me that look. You can't convince me that easily.

749
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:30,085
Please, Min Jun. Can we?

750
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,512
Just this once. Please.

751
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,803
Did Jun say he'll be here by 7 p.m.?

752
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,054
Yes, he did.

753
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,681
I told you he said he would be.

754
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,933
Why do you have to keep checking?

755
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:48,311
You should've picked him up yourself.

756
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:50,271
What's with the attitude?

757
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:52,948
I just want to make sure there's enough food.

758
00:53:53,858 --> 00:53:57,854
If I ever get a boyfriend, I'm never going to tell you.

759
00:53:57,854 --> 00:54:00,122
Sure. Don't bother.

760
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,917
That must be them.

761
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,729
Hello, my brother-in-law-to-be.

762
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:08,056
Hi, have you been well?

763
00:54:08,056 --> 00:54:10,567
"Brother-in-law"? That's so weird.

764
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,834
Hey, let her be. She's just practicing. Right?

765
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,213
Hello, Jun.

766
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:16,256
Come on in.

767
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,050
Happy birthday, Mother.

768
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,345
Thanks, Min Jun. You must be hungry.

769
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,682
This makes me so happy.

770
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,810
This is such a lovely cake!

771
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,730
Didn't you hate birthdays because it made you feel old?

772
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,794
What's gotten into you?

773
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:35,150
I'm celebrating with my future son-in-law.

774
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,154
You have no idea how happy I am.

775
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:42,615
Just wait until you meet yours later. You'll know exactly how I feel.

776
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,617
Can you stop getting ahead of yourself?

777
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:46,286
Why are you and Rock being so weird?

778
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:50,040
No, you're being weird. We're basically a family now.

779
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,715
That's right.

780
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:54,285
I'm so sorry.

781
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:56,004
I had to take this call.

782
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,331
So, what did I miss?

783
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:01,868
Don't worry. You didn't miss anything important.

784
00:55:01,868 --> 00:55:03,203
By the way, Hong.

785
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:06,414
- Can I ask you for a favor?
 - A favor?

786
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:08,541
Can you go to the airport for me tomorrow?

787
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:11,394
- What?
 - I need a substitute interpreter

788
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:14,673
because Ms. Miyazawa had something urgent come up at home.

789
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:16,966
You want me to interpret?

790
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,220
Come on, Dad. I can't.

791
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,723
It's been years since I last spoke Japanese.

792
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:25,392
Why can't you go instead?

793
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:27,224
You're good at Japanese, too.

794
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:30,572
Dad's going to Busan for work tomorrow.

795
00:55:30,572 --> 00:55:33,441
I just need you to cover for tomorrow.

796
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:36,319
I already made plans with Min Jun for tomorrow.

797
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,738
Don't worry. You should go.

798
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:41,090
He needs your help.

799
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,726
All right?

800
00:55:46,988 --> 00:55:48,598
That's my son-in-law.

801
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:50,333
- Help yourselves.
 - Thank you.

802
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:53,368
- Thank you.
 - Thanks, Mom.

803
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:58,925
I'm sorry.

804
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:02,012
We'll have to check on the venues next week.

805
00:56:02,012 --> 00:56:03,530
It's fine. I understand.

806
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,267
I'll look for a few more places for us to check out next week.

807
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:08,901
All right.

808
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,739
Min Jun.

809
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,612
Yes?

810
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,780
Thank you.

811
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,614
Oh, come on. I told you not to say that.

812
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,672
Whenever you say that,

813
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:28,624
you sound so distant.

814
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,865
Good night.

815
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,261
Go inside. It's cold.

816
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,500
 Passenger Terminal 1 

817
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,640
You're a lifesaver, Chief Choi.

818
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,109
I didn't realize you knew Japanese.

819
00:56:58,109 --> 00:56:59,653
Did you study there?

820
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:04,006
No, I lived there for a bit when I was little.

821
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:08,161
I took classes for a year and got pretty good grades,

822
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,472
but I get nervous when it really matters.

823
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,556
I still get so nervous.

824
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,087
He'll be here soon. Shall we?

825
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:19,104
Right, of course.

826
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:32,801
 Welcome to Korea, Writer Sasae Hikari 

827
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,629
I didn't expect him to be so late.

828
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,789
Where is he?

829
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:43,395
Yes, Mr. Park.

830
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,549
I'm at the airport.

831
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,351
- Excuse me, Ms. Choi.
 - Sure.

832
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:54,935
 Time stood still... 

833
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:58,821
 like a neatly folded piece of paper. 

834
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:05,845
 If I knew that I was going to meet Jungo... 

835
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,157
 I would have never come. 

836
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:06,070


837
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:37,680
â™«  I believe you're saying about love  â™«
