1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:15,550


2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,727
What kind of a person do you think I am?

3
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,792
What kind of a person?

4
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,358
Yes.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:29,488
I just got curious about how you saw me as a person

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,939
out of the blue.

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,912
Let me see.

8
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,306
The Kanna I know...

9
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,878
has always been confident

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,926
and always honest about how she feels.

11
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,594
I see.

12
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,712
Why do you ask?

13
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,475
I don't know when it started,

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,894
but whenever I'm with you,

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,556
I feel different from my usual self.

16
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,419
That's why I will go back

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,700
to my old self again,

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,968
back to being confident and honest like the Kanna that you once knew.

19
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:28,380
I finally realized that love is something

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,970
I can't control.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Don't you think that's good news for you, too?

22
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,848
That's such a Kanna thing to say.

23
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,890
Didn't you feel uncomfortable

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,612
working with me up until now?

25
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,402
- Just a little.
 - Really?

26
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,234
Kanna?

27
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,035
What's wrong?

28
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,789
I guess she also knew...

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,460
that it was your birthday today.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,503
Who?

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,332
That one that you can't get over.

32
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,471
She was...

33
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,308
just here.

34
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,904
What?

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,643
She was standing by the entrance but saw me and took off.

36
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,053
 Mom 

37
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,700
 I wanted to tell him how I felt. 

38
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,430
 I wanted to thank him 

39
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,524
 for being good to me and showing me what love is. 

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,981
 I wanted to apologize for complaining all the time 

41
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:38,159
 and never being able to tell him that. 

42
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,616
 And I wanted to say that we should let go of our regrets. 

43
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,999
 A wise man once said, 

44
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,629
 "Not getting what you want can be a blessing." 

45
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,214
 I wanted him to know that. 

46
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,060
 That's what I almost told him before I realized 

47
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,520
 that Kanna and he were together. 

48
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:21,946
 Things that time makes you realize. 

49
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:32,056
 What Comes After Love. 

50
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,332
 Back then, Hong had grown tired 

51
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,168
 of being lonely in a foreign country 

52
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,437
 and even more so from living with me. 

53
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,733
 We were physically in the same space... 

54
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,562
 but deep inside, 

55
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,520
 we were in two different dimensions. 

56
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,598
 I didn't understand any aspect 

57
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,893
 of her loneliness. 

58
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:53,705
 I thought she was only 

59
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,649
 thinking about herself. 

60
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,210
 You might as well do nothing but work. 

61
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,487
 Why do you even make promises? 

62
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,547
 Why am I the only one who is worried 

63
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,174
 and who is always waiting? 

64
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,285
 This isn't easy for me, either! 

65
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,387
 Do you think I like living like this? 

66
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,972
 We see each other at home, anyway. 

67
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:13,315
 Why can't you understand that? 

68
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,621
 She was behaving like that 

69
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,578
 because of her pent-up loneliness, 

70
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,416
 and I was the one who caused the problem. 

71
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,493
 I wonder who came up with the word for regret? 

72
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,140
 What is God trying to teach us 

73
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,333
 by letting us regret? 

74
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,671
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

75
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,815
I regretted it all night.

76
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,320
Me too.

77
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,855
What?

78
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,819
I was up all night thinking the same thing.

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,800
So? What are you going to do now?

80
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,509
I wonder what I can do.

81
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,690
Jungo.

82
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,629
You may be a man of a few words,

83
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,600
but you need to tell her how you feel.

84
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,852
Look her in the eyes

85
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:17,200
and honestly tell her how you feel.

86
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,700
If you do that, she will understand your feelings.

87
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,290
Even all the misunderstandings

88
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:30,561
can be cleared up.

89
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:39,120
Go and be happy.

90
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:44,667
I really hope that you will.

91
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,653
Thanks.

92
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,028
I'd better get going.

93
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,391
I'll walk you to the lobby.

94
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,877
No, I'll be fine on my own.

95
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,337
I'm sorry to leave you behind.

96
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,173
Have a safe flight tomorrow.

97
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,907
Thanks.

98
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:18,910
Good luck, Jungo.

99
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,645
Thanks.

100
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,175
- Department Head.
 - Yes?

101
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,094
Today's interview will be Mr. Sasae's last item on the agenda.

102
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,229
Will you be there?

103
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,601
I can't. I have something else to take care of later.

104
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,337
- I'm sure you'll be fine without me, Manager Lee.
- Yes, ma'am.

105
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:49,733
Mr. Sasae said he'd be fine to get to the airport tomorrow by himself.

106
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,318
I don't think we need to accompany him.

107
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,736
Would that be all right?

108
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,532
Sure. I'll let the CEO know.

109
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,617
Thank you.

110
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,883
Has Jungo left?

111
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,149
No.

112
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,872
When is he leaving?

113
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,403
Tomorrow.

114
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,672
Are you all right?

115
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,792
Yes.

116
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,949
Really?

117
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,577
Why? Would it be better if I weren't?

118
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,872
Of course not. That's not what I meant.

119
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,125
Look here, Ji Hui.

120
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,252
- This was my favorite paragraph.
 - What?

121
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,880
"Just let yourself go and let the moment take over.

122
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,216
Then, look back on yourself,

123
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,968
almost as if you were a spectator.

124
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,348
Once the waves in the river in your heart subside,

125
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,727
keep watching until your eyes hurt determining where it wants to flow.

126
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,521
If you do that, it might be the most honest approach

127
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,667
we can have toward our lives."

128
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,986
I couldn't agree more.

129
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,196
I'm glad.

130
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,615
As soon as I read it,

131
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:24,494
it felt like you saw right through me for the very first time.

132
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,830
I actually wrote that while thinking about you

133
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,306
after we met two days ago.

134
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:34,947
Right. I should've known.

135
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,760
Today's interview will start at two o'clock,

136
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,530
and it will be held at a book cafÃ© near the office.

137
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:50,216
In that case, could we make a quick stop at the office?

138
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,506
Sure. It's pretty close by, so it should be fine.

139
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,208
Let's make a quick stop.

140
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,126
It should be fine since it's close by.

141
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,573
Sir, can we stop by the office first?

142
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,050
Yes, of course.

143
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:09,790
The book signing went well, thanks to all of you.

144
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,500
It was such a wonderful experience.

145
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,045
"The book signing went without a hitch thanks to everyone.

146
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,798
It was such a wonderful experience."

147
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,841
I hope to work with you again soon.

148
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,126
Thank you.

149
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:33,945
Ms. Choi had a meeting to get to today, so she's currently out of the office.

150
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,775
Oh, I see.

151
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,777
It's snowing.

152
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,845
It's snowing.

153
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,558
Mr. Sasae.

154
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,562
Shall we head over to the interview now?

155
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,023
Yes.

156
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:58,816
 What Comes After Love 

157
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,671
It's a shame, but we've come to the last question already.

158
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,799
"It's a shame, but we've come to the last question already."

159
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,943
Writer Sasae,

160
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:10,679
what do you believe comes after love?

161
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,017
Regret, loneliness, and other emotions certainly come to mind,

162
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:19,062
but it felt as if the title had a special meaning to you.

163
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,691
"What do you believe comes after love?

164
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:28,432
It felt as if the title had a special meaning to you."

165
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,909
For the past five years,

166
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,721
I've thought about a lot of things while writing this novel.

167
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,583
What comes after love is,

168
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,862
I believe

169
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:49,040
that we gain an understanding of what love is.

170
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,161
It feels very ironic.

171
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,872
"It feels very ironic."

172
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:55,800
Yes, you're right.

173
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,544
It's such a sad irony.

174
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:04,608
Only after love

175
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,660
do we realize what love truly means.

176
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:13,005
That's why I believe we're always filled with regret.

177
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:17,210
Maybe that's why the deeper our love is,

178
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,389
the bigger our regret becomes.

179
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,140
 Five years ago. 

180
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:37,889
There are so many things we can't express in words.

181
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:42,201
And you're trying to write out those things.

182
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:48,731
There's something special about the way you write.

183
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,887
And that's why I like it.

184
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,194
Thank you, Beni.

185
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,406
 So, in the end, 

186
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,179
 the only thing I could do was write. 

187
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,766
 To understand how she felt 

188
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:06,717
 and to take a step toward her heart once again. 

189
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,961
 One moment is like eternity 

190
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:28,059
 and eternity is like one moment. 

191
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,663
Oh, that's cold!

192
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,537
That's amazing!

193
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,959
- That's enough!
 - When I think about her smile... 

194
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:10,441
 all I can remember is the beautiful seasons 

195
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,971
 and the wonderful times we had. 

196
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:36,167
 I can never forget the innocent smile on her face. 

197
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,140
 It was the most genuine smile, 

198
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,800
 that hadn't been tainted by hatred, betrayal, or doubt. 

199
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,370
â«  I believe you're saying about love  â«

200
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,240
â«  Even if it's not in words I know  â«

201
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,330
Ms. Hong. 
â«  Even if it's not in words I know  â«

202
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,860
â«  I know you're at the end of the road  â«

203
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:32,760
â«  So I run to you through the night  â«

204
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,160
â«  Count the lights in the distant night  â«

205
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:47,122
 It was just another day. 

206
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:50,201
 The sun was shining in the sky. 

207
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:54,689
 We woke up from our happy slumber... 

208
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:59,803
 looked at each other with sleep in our eyes, 

209
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:02,055
 and smiled. 

210
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,723
It feels as if I'm dreaming.

211
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,327
If I am really dreaming...

212
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,662
I don't ever want to wake up.

213
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,833
I'll always be

214
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,571
by your side.

215
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,350
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

216
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,203
 We were just as uneasy as much as we were happy, 

217
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:28,707
 but on that day, she was definitely happy 

218
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:32,634
 while she was by my side. 

219
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,880
Good evening, gents. Come on in.

220
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,998
This way, please.

221
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,640
 Beni 

222
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,690
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

223
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,160
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

224
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,766
 Happiness is meant to last forever. 

225
00:22:57,528 --> 00:23:01,612
 That was what the two of us tried to believe back then. 

226
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,600
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

227
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:12,059
You shouldn't have said anything

228
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,644
if this was how it was going to be.

229
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,420
â«  I believe you're saying about love  â«

230
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,717
Beni...

231
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,950
Leave me alone.

232
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,980
â«  Even if it's not in words I know  â«

233
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,968
 But from a certain point, 

234
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,670
 her gaze started to waver. 

235
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,300
â«  And I wanna tell you in your words  â«

236
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:41,900
 Even when she smiled, it didn't seem genuine. 

237
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:48,161
 Her smile turned numb and number by the day. 

238
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,630
â«  Count the lights in the distant night  â«

239
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,070
â«  Our distance is closer than the stars  â«

240
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,722
 Ultimately, it was because 

241
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:10,870
 I couldn't fill her loneliness. 

242
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,390
â«  I'll run with you  â«

243
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,640
â«  Can you see me reaching out?  â«

244
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,110
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

245
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,770
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

246
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,370
â«  We're the only ones  â«

247
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,640
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

248
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,160
â«  Promise me  â«

249
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,990
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

250
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,590
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

251
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,580
â«  Know we need each other  â«

252
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,620
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

253
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

254
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,580
â«  I heard you whisper  â«

255
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,390
â«  I believe you're saying about love  â«

256
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,140
â«  Even if it's not in words I know  â«

257
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,840
â«  And I wanna tell you in your words  â«

258
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,480
â«  In any shape  â«

259
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,860
â«  I'll be your meaning  â«

260
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:17,153
 What Comes After Love 

261
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,239
You did great today.

262
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:27,843
Mr. Sasae, thank you so much for your hard work today.

263
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:30,007
Have a safe flight tomorrow.

264
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:33,285
I look forward to seeing you again.

265
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:37,498
Thank you both for everything.

266
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:41,909
I look forward to seeing you again as well.

267
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:45,188
Excuse me, Ms. Miyazawa?

268
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,298
Yes?

269
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:48,258
I'm sorry,

270
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,794
but could I get Ms. Hong's contact information?

271
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,642
I wanted to thank her properly.

272
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:59,102
Sure.  I'll text it to you right away.

273
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:01,395
Thank you very much.

274
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,256
 Here is Ms. Hong's number. 

275
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,969
 New Contact, Beni 

276
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:26,111
 Beni 

277
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,216
Hello?

278
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,558
Hello.

279
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,970
Beni...

280
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:56,015
Thank you for calling me.

281
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,438
Thanks for the keychain.

282
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,558
I wanted to let them be together.

283
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,232
 That's what you told me. 

284
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,621
 You said... 

285
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,589
that they had to be together.

286
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:25,479
You're leaving tomorrow, right?

287
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,191
 I can't see you off in person, 

288
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,559
so I wanted to at least call you to say goodbye.

289
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,615
Beni, can I see you tomorrow?

290
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:39,510
Actually, can I see you right now?

291
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,648
No.

292
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,427
I just called to say "thank you."

293
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,597
Please, Beni.

294
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,675
I have something to tell you.

295
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:56,176
I feel you misunderstood something.

296
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:57,654
 Kanna was 

297
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:01,158
only here as the editor in charge.

298
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,202
 There's nothing going on between us. 

299
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,146
 Please, Beni. 

300
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:09,960
I want to meet you in person and talk things out

301
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:13,461
about how we left things in Japan.

302
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,213
 I'm begging you. 

303
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:26,098
Beni?

304
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,400
Where are you right now?

305
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,124
Beni...

306
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:13,378
Thank you for coming to see me.

307
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:17,259
I can't stay for long.

308
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,568
I have plans with my boyfriend.

309
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,546
I see.

310
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,352
He seemed to be a nice guy.

311
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,500
Yeah. He is.

312
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,382
He told me...

313
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:48,330
that he was going to propose yesterday.

314
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:53,552
It was a wonderful proposal.

315
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,175
I see.

316
00:30:58,175 --> 00:30:59,909
Yeah.

317
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,668
Beni,

318
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:11,767
I don't know where or how I should start.

319
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:17,168
If there are any misunderstandings between us,

320
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,787
I wanted to clear things up...

321
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,199
before I leaveâ

322
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:24,131
I didn't...

323
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:28,738
misunderstand anything about you.

324
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:36,858
I just called... to thank you properly before you left.

325
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:45,107
I wanted to thank you for loving me back then.

326
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:57,985
Me, too.

327
00:31:57,985 --> 00:32:00,126
Thanks for everything.

328
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,768
To be honest,

329
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:11,164
I wanted to ask you this if I ever saw you again.

330
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,410
Why did you...

331
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:22,716
leave me alone when I was crying back then?

332
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:27,806
Why didn't you try to stop me or find me?

333
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:32,375
Why did you come here after all this time?

334
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:39,623
But those things don't matter anymore.

335
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:44,797
Reading your book made me realize...

336
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:48,059
what really matters are

337
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:52,014
the moments we shared

338
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,515
as we loved each other...

339
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,602
and felt each other's love.

340
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:08,822
I deeply...

341
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,627
regretted that

342
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,732
I didn't see your loneliness

343
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:22,276
as something to be taken seriously at that time.

344
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,381
I was so pathetic.

345
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:33,085
That's why I put it down on paper.

346
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:41,729
You can stop regretting it now.

347
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:45,634
You said it yourself in your novel.

348
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,693
Love is...

349
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:52,640
a blessing in itself.

350
00:33:55,494 --> 00:34:00,845
Thank you... for taking the time to read it.

351
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:06,563
I should be thanking you

352
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:13,876
for writing about us.

353
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:25,089
I'm sorry.

354
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:27,366
I should get going.

355
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,548
Already?

356
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,311
Yes.

357
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:41,404
I hope you have a safe trip tomorrow.

358
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,054
Thanks.

359
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,659
I will.

360
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:05,922
Wait, Beni.

361
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:21,053
Promise me you'll be happy.

362
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,268
Promise.

363
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,549
Yes.

364
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,053
You too, Jungo.

365
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,123
Bye.

366
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,000
 Tokyo, 5 years ago 

367
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,347
There you go.

368
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,773
Thank you.

369
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,800
Is your father well?

370
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,344
Yes.  He's doing very well.

371
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:45,990
I heard my grandfather was against you and my father dating.

372
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,438
Did you ever hold it against my dad?

373
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:51,339
No.

374
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,776
I was actually thankful

375
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:58,697
that he didn't ask me to go to Korea.

376
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:05,133
Being lonely in a foreign country with only one person to lean on?

377
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:08,234
I don't think I could've done it.

378
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,092
We were quite different, too.

379
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,815
I hope you two make it, though.

380
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,319
Thank you.

381
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:28,375
I sometimes...

382
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:34,399
wonder if unfulfilled love has any meaning to it,

383
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,818
and I feel scared.

384
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,176
Sometimes, it takes a lot of time

385
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:47,111
for us to realize something.

386
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,767
There is no such thing as meaningless love.

387
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,644
No matter what kind of love it is,

388
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:57,947
love is a blessing in itself.

389
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,619
I only realized that after a long time.

390
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,520
 Seoul, present day 

391
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,109
Hello.

392
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,736
Would you like to check out?

393
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:26,839
Yes, please.

394
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,499
Okay, thank you.

395
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,596
Please wait a moment.

396
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:34,505
Excuse me, sir.

397
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,447
These flowers were supposed to be given to you.

398
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:43,568
But they were handed to another customer yesterday.

399
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:47,338
We do apologize for our mistake, sir.

400
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,359
We're really sorry.

401
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,958
Thank you.

402
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,396
- Dad.
- Yes?

403
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,942
Do you really have to follow my account?

404
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,569
I thought you wanted more followers.

405
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,821
Yes, but you're not just "a follower."

406
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,991
What are you trying to say? Is family not important to you?

407
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,251
No, that's not what I'm...

408
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,964
Hey, Manager Lee.

409
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,800
Yes.

410
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,637
Can't you just take care of it?

411
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:45,482
Hey, what side of the bed did you wake up on?

412
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,484
What are you trying to make up for?

413
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,444
Have you lost weight?

414
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,237
Oh, come on. No way.

415
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,031
I never realized you were so small.

416
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,533
Oh, knock it off, will you?

417
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,702
You'll catch my cold if you don't.

418
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,830
Well, I don't actually mind.

419
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,923
You don't have work today?

420
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,918
Rok.

421
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,796
I was on my way home last night,

422
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:11,549
and I got this random warm feeling.

423
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:15,387
So, I'm going to give myself a small gift today.

424
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:16,846
What are you talking about?

425
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:18,848
Were you out drinking again?

426
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,433
No.

427
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,645
How about a movie date with Mom? It's been a while.

428
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:25,647
I'm in if you're paying.

429
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,149
Can you see what's on while I go for a run?

430
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:29,867
I'll be back soon.

431
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,123
Hey, Lightning.

432
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,216
See you in a bit.

433
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:11,158
 I'm sorry about earlier.  
 Happy Birthday - Hong 

434
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:54,027
Hello.

435
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:55,945
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

436
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,664
- Hello.
- Hi, Ji Yun.

437
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,910
All right, Seo U. Let's take a look at your leg.

438
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,536
Good.

439
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,455
- Did you sleep well?
 - Yes.

440
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,131
Then...

441
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,377
How about this blue?

442
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:12,379
Would the blue make it brighter?

443
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,973
This one does seem a bit too dark.

444
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,300
I haven't stopped running since then.

445
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,280
Ever since we broke up,

446
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,325
I wanted to be closer to your heart.

447
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:05,413
So, I just kept running.

448
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:10,681
While I was running around Inokashira Park,

449
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,344
I always thought about you.

450
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,839
At first,

451
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,907
it was because I missed you.

452
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,596
But as I kept running...

453
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,958
I started to understand...

454
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:38,203
how you must've felt back then.

455
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,781
You were running alone

456
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,654
to get over your loneliness.

457
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,363
I thought...

458
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,432
that I knew everything about you.

459
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,436
But in reality...

460
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:09,211
I didn't see what was actually important.

461
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,494
As for me...

462
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,489
ever since we broke up,

463
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,252
I couldn't run all this time.

464
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,253
It's just as you said in your novel.

465
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,380
To be honest,

466
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,729
I was regretting, too.

467
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,563
When we were together...

468
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,138
I couldn't understand you

469
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,507
and I was selfish.

470
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,936
I was just the same as you.

471
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,387
I didn't see what was actually important.

472
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,488
I finally realized that

473
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,115
I made you feel...

474
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,967
lonely and miserable, too.

475
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,355
No.

476
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,453
It was my fault.

477
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,464
I made you lonely.

478
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:38,941
I'm sorry.

479
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:46,553
No.

480
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,651
We were both at fault.

481
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:54,460
I'm...

482
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,645
sorry, too.

483
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:52,601
 Spring blossoms are the response to the snowflakes of winter. 

484
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,790
â«  Our distance is closer than the stars  â«

485
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:06,330
â«  Tomorrow, when we are together  â«

486
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,830
â«  I'll run with you  â«

487
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:16,590
â«  Can you see me reaching out?  â«

488
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,390
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

489
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,540
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

490
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:42,600
â«  We're the only ones  â«

491
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,760
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

492
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,360
â«  Promise me  â«

493
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,060
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

494
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,150
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

495
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,930
â«  Know we need each other  â«

496
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,070
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

497
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,290
â«  Hold me in your eyes  â«

498
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,130
â«  I heard you whisper  â«

499
