1
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,950
Kim Seok.

2
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,470
What's wrong?

3
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,250
Have breakfast.

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,150
What do you want?

5
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,370
Nothing.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,250
Well.

7
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,600
What's the smell? What is it?

8
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,020
It's the seaweed soup from mom yesterday.

9
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,400
Yes. Happy birthday.

10
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,420
Thank you.

11
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,070
Get up. The soup will go cold.

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,570
Wait.

13
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,050
Who is it?

14
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,770
What?

15
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,320
I said, who is it?

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,620
Wait.

17
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,270
Are you crazy?

18
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,570
Give me.

19
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,570
Sorry.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,800
Where are you going?

21
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,850
Hey.

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,350
I picked up on my way here.

23
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,750
Thank you.

24
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,170
Did you have a fight?

25
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,420
What did they say?

26
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,570
What?

27
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,550
I'm okay.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,750
How did you end up with your ex?

29
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,050
What do y ou md-l ooking men get their way.
What do you mean?
Good-looking men get their way.

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,470
I'm jealous.

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,400
Jealous? Why are you jealous?

32
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,170
Relationship is not just about one person.

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,850
It's about you two.

34
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,470
Why are you talking nonsense?

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't remember my last relationship.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
Do you want me to help you?

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,250
Weren't you in an one-night relationship?

38
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,300
I feel sick, seriously.

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,020
There's a delivery.

40
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,470
You are back.

41
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,400
What is it?

42
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,500
Photos. Memory.

43
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,770
Bring it when you are in army.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
Are you crazy?

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,770
What if I get caught with this?

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,350
Who cares?

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,370
You must bring it. Understand?

48
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,900
I know.

49
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,400
What is this?

50
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,270
Birthday gift.

51
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,470
You drew it by yourself?

52
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,950
You should take this to the army.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,550
Of course.

54
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,420
Sorry for my leaving in the morning.

55
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,820
No. I should feel sorry.

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Why did you do that?

57
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,150
Yes.

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,200
I have a question.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,050
Who is Kang Sung-hoon?

60
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,700
He had a crush on me.

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,570
Now he appeared again.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,150
It's nothing. Don't worry.

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,350
Okay.

64
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,750
I believe you can deal with it.

65
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,120
Let me see.

66
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,820
Why do you like me?

67
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,350
Do you remember the first time we met?

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,200
What? That date?

69
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,070
The moment I saw you, I fell in love.

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know why.

71
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,700
I thought you didn't like me.

72
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,370
That's insane.

73
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,800
I dyed my hair for the first time in my life.

74
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,100
I also bought new clothes.

75
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,770
I did that to make you like me.

76
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,150
You should be confident.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,300
Kim Seok.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,050
I know it's difficult. But I'll wait.

79
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,020
I hope you can be with me.

80
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,570
I love you.

81
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,700
Hello.

82
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,570
Kim Seok's boyfriend?

83
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,650
You know who I am?

84
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,850
Kang Sung-hoon is typing...

85
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,820
Yes, I know you well.

86
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,000
Seung-kyu, nice to meet you.

87
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,620
What is this?

88
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,250
You will know after you read it.

89
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,820
This is...

90
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,520
This is all the cha ts Kim Seok a nd I have has
This is all the chats Kim Seok
and I have has since we first met.

91
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,350
Do you think I'll believe it?

92
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,120
Why did you come?

93
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,270
What's your relationship with him?

94
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,750
Maybe I'm his ex?
Maybe I'm his ex?

95
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,670
Actually, no. I thought we were in love.

96
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,620
Why did you keep calling him after you're done?

97
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,270
You should know the whole thing first.

98
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,870
Ask me what I want.

99
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,800
Where is my money and my stuff?

100
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,870
Money?

101
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,100
I guess you don't know it.

102
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,720
I gave him money and I bought him Gucci.

103
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,150
I will pay you back.

104
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,170
Do you know what Kim Seok's job was?

105
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,170
I'm not interested.

106
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,400
Why may think differently when you know it.
Why?
You may think differently when you know it.

107
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,220
He took nude photos for his collage admission.

108
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,600
Madman...

109
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,200
Don't come to us. Don't contact us anymore.

110
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,670
Take a look at the last page.

111
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,950
Romeo's kiss.

112
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,920
This is the first time you come here.

113
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,120
What would you like?

114
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,200
Coffee? Green tea?

115
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,650
No. I'm alright.

116
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,300
I'll show you our boys.

117
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,800
Come in, everyone.

118
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,770

119
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,750

I'm Geon Mu.

122
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,920
Take off.

123
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,150
Go out.

124
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900

Joo Yong is a new boy.

125
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,520

126
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,960

If you decide to do so,
shared spa services are also provided.

127
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,800
What do you think?

128
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,000
So rry.
Sorry.

129
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,150
I think I'm in the wrong place.

130
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,300
I believe you.

131
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,600

The user you dial is unable to connect.
After the beeping...

132
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm late.

133
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
You come.

134
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,670
The professor delayed the class.

135
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,250
What is this?

136
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,600
I made some dishes.

137
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,720
Wanna taste it?

138
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,800
If I know it, I'll come earlier.

139
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,670
It's okay. Let have the dinner.

140
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,150
Okay.

141
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,400
Don't you feel worried?

142
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,820
What?

143
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,400

We are not gonna see each other
when we go to the army.

144
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,950
It's not like we are never gonna see each other.

145
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,920
We can meet on holidays.

146
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,570
That's not easy.

147
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you know Hyun-seung?

148
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
He went to the same boot camp as his boyfriend.

149
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,070
They meet in the church every weekend.

150
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,120
We can also do that.

151
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,170
Well.

152
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,250
Just eat.

153
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,000
Cheers.

154
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,150
Why do you look so serious?

155
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,400
What if I miss you?

156
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,800
You can see my photos, just like this...

157
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,950
Right?

158
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,650
Can you accept it?

159
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,220
Of course.

160
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,870
Is that person contacting you?

161
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,600
Who? Hyun-seung?

162
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,520
No. You know. That person.

163
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,370
I blocked him.

164
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,020
In fact, today...

165
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,670
Don't mention him again.

166
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,550
This is...the last time.

167
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,200
I want to make it clear.

168
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,120
The last time?

169
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,150
Today is your last time?

170
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,020
I don't mean that.

171
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,220
I won't ask you why you did this.

172
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,150
I just want us to be honest with each other.

173
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,650
If you believe me...

174
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,770
Don't talk about it.

175
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,070
I don't want to talk about it, too.

176
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,470
I have a phone call.

177
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,000
See you in the church.
From Kim Seok.
