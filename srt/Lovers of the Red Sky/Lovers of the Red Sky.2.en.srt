The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to any historical facts.

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,910
(Seongjo, the fourth king of Dan dynasty)

7
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,500
(Yeongjong, the third king of Dan dynasty)

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,520
Ma Wang's whisperings have made me shed too much blood. (Ma Wang : God of death which existed since ancient times)

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,660
The throne has become secure

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,600
but the consequences have haunted me endlessly.

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,640
I shall take all my wrongdoings with me to the grave.

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,210
You must keep Ma Wang sealed

13
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,220
and focus on avoiding his rage.

14
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,250
I shall heed your words, Royal Father.

15
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,320
Have you found Ma Wang's traces?

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,970
He has hidden himself, Your Majesty.
(Wol Seon : 5th Head Shaman of Shamanist Bureau)

17
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,240
Ma Wang cannot die.

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,830
Only sealing him...

19
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,320
Royal Father!

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,510
Royal Father! Royal Father!

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,030
Swiftly restore the royal portrait and prepare the sealing ritual again.

22
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,150
However, we must first find the painter who will restore the portrait.

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,970
We must find someone who can breathe divine powers into the painting

25
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,330
and seal the demonic energy in it

26
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,750
as Gan Yun Guk and Hong Eun Oh did in the past.
(Gan Yun Guk : Master Painter of Painting Bureau)
(Hong Eun Oh : Painter of Painting Bureau)

27
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,400
Find one.

28
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,880
We must find one at all costs.

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,540
(Mi Su : 4th Head Shaman of Shamanist Bureau)

31

Episode 2: The Divine Painter

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,340
Baegyu Painting Institute

33
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,750
(19 years later, in the 28th year of King Seongjo's reign)

34
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,140
Over here. Look.

35
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,620
Wow, so beautiful.

36
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,990
My heart feels so strange.

37
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,350
My heart is pounding from just watching.

38
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,640
If your heart pounds upon seeing Cheoyonghwa, the sehwa* (Sehwa : A painting to celebrate new year and block disasters)
(Cheoyonghwa : A painting of Cheoyong that drove out evil spirits in Hyanggi of Silla Dynasty)

39
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,980
perhaps you should go to the doctor.

40
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,140
- Sir, you're here.
- I'm sorry, sir.

41
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,350
Go, hurry.

42
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,280
Now. Today, I will teach you about

43
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,450
Suseongnoindo, one of the sehwas.

44
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
What is the most critical element of a sehwa?

45
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,610
(Hong Cheon Gi, Baegyu Painting Institute painter)

46
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,430
Isn't it to finish the painting before the deadline?

47
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,590
No one will buy it if the right time passes.

48
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,880
- That's the answer.
- That is true.

49
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,560
Finishing a sehwa quickly isn't everything.

50
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,350
Observe the short height, the deer he is riding, and the crown of his head bulging.

51
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,690
Only copying these elements exactly

52
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,080
will effectively repel wicked spirits and bring good fortune.

53
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,660
You had the keen insight to hire Jeong as the teacher for today, sir.

54
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,300
Choi Jeong, the painter of the Painting Bureau, demonstrating directly in front of them.

55
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,610
is the best lesson for the students.

56
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,260
Hey, Annoying One.

57
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,950
What use is replicating paintings exactly?

58
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,590
The most crucial elements of a sehwa are the bold colors

59
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,540
and conveying the celebratory spirit.

60
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,170
In other words, we must paint the fortune, joy,

61
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,370
happiness, and beauty that people want to feel.

62
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm just saying we must paint people's wishes.

63
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,130
- I see.
- As expected of Hong Cheon Gi.

64
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,990
Painter Hong. If you are done painting,

65
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,450
stop being obnoxious and leave right away.

66
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,790
I was just about to.

67
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,460
Headmaster!

68
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,940
Uncle Chun Bok, here is the Cheoyonghwa.

69
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,010
I just need to go out front for a moment. I'll be right back.

70
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,730
Where is that grownup young lady running off to again at this hour?

71
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,710
Where is Cheon Gi going every night these days?

72
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,280
Wouldn't she be going to the market street to see painter Hong Eun Oh?

73
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,340
Chun Bok, do you know what?

74
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
- Cheon Gi has been looking after her father for—
- Twenty years.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,890
Yes, you have told me countless times.

76
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,380
- So you don't have to tell me—
- She was completely blind

77
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,680
and only this tall,

78
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,070
but on the day it rained, she showed up with her sight restored.

79
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,910
She said she had to make a living for her father,

80
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,190
saying she would chop firewood or do the dishes.

81
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,830
She said she would do anything to learn painting.

82
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,490
Heaven was surely touched by filial devotion and restored her sight.

83
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,300
And what is more, she is undoubtedly Hong Eun Oh's daughter.

84
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,850
She learned painting so fast

85
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,210
and her painting is so indescribably well done.

86
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,240
How could I not look after her?

87
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,030
Seomungwan*

Aquamarine-colored starlight

90
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,960
Ha Ram, Seongmungwan Supervisor and Cheonmungwan Leader

91
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,100
Look how handsome he is.

92
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,970
That is not all. He is also very gentle-mannered.

93
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,120
His Majesty the King favors him dearly.

94
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,250
His face glows.

95
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,060
What is going on? Why are they so excited?

96
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,420
Don't you know?

97
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,940
Supervisor Ha is on duty tonight.

98
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,520
Even as a man, I must admit

99
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,150
he is almost as handsome as me.
(Jang Wuk Jin : supervisor of Seomungwan, manager of geography division)

100
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,750
Even so, he is only a blind man.

101
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,910
- These women...
- Supervisor Jang, sir.

102
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,370
I heard that Supervisor Ha was the seokcheokdongja in the rain ritual nineteen years ago.

103
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,150
Yes.

104
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,370
Then, is the rumor true that he became blind that day?

105
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,190
Yes, certainly.

106
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,380
That day, it rained for the first time in nine years.

107
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,260
So that is why he is called this palace's protector god.

108
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,330
Protector god my foot.

109
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,910
He is just the palace's monster. A red-eyed monster.

110
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,000
Supervisor Ha is coming.

111
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,960
Supervisor Ha, welcome.

112
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,450
Welcome.

113
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,110
Let us begin the observation of the hour of the tiger*.
(3 a.m. to 5 a.m.)

114
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,900
We will start with observing the seven constellations of the southern sky.

115
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,410
Observe the seven constellations of the southern sky!

116
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,610
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,990
We shall begin the observation.

118
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,120
The fifth star of the sixth constellation is particularly bright.

119
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,010
That signifies heading east will lead to an important person.

120
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,040
Who are you?

121
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,510
You're here!

122
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,020
My friends. Come in.

123
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,260
What took you so long?

124
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,340
This technique of painting the mountain tops like swirling clouds

125
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,320
and the technique of expressing the sharpness of the pine tree tips...

126
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,800
Could this be...
(Choi Jeong, Gohwawon Painter)

127
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,230
Park Yi's work?

128
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,230
Gosh, you do have a good eye.

129
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,450
(Cha Yeong Uk, Baegyu Institute Painter)

130
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,120
As expected of Wolseongdang.

131
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,150
They only trade valuable paintings...

132
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,670
- What happens if it rips when I touch it...
- Hey, stop!

133
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,120
Don't you dare lay a finger on it.

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,480
It is worth the price of four tiled roof houses.

135
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,100
Four... four tiled roof houses?

136
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,980
It's finally finished!

137
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,770
Hey, come here.

138
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,220
How is it? Well?

139
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,390
Your skills are extraordinary as expected, Obnoxious One.

140
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,880
You've really done it.

141
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,390
It's as if Park Yi had reincarnated.

142
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,520
Long Face, what is the virtue of imitation?

143
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,230
First, bring the technique.

144
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,160
Second, bring the spirit of the original.

145
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,560
Third, it has to be exactly the same, to put it simply.

146
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,920
I beg you...

147
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,780
don't be so arrogant, you obnoxious one.

148
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,960
Fine.

149
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,190
Even Grand Prince Yangmyeong, known for his exceptional painting skills,

150
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,370
would not suspect my imitation works.

151
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,760
I bet my precious white fox hair brush.

152
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,120
Aigoo, why would they build a shed here?

153
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,860
I would never come to a place like this.

154
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,320
Hey, hey, did you both hear about the owner of Wolseongdang?

155
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
Il Wol Seong?

156
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,270
He is the richest man in Gwanyang.

157
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,430
The best merchant in this country.

158
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,850
True, if he is rich enough to buy Park Yi's "Sochundo".

159
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,980
Come on now. Not just Sochundo.

160
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,500
Remember how many original paintings were at Wolseongdang?

161
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,780
That is true.

162
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,250
And there is another very, extremely important secret.

163
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,970
If you submit your question into the box in front of Wolseongdang,

164
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,710
Il Wol Seong will reply to your message.

165
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,150
And what will he say? That he'll tell you what you want to know, if you pay the price.

166
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,700
In other words, Il Wol Seong is an information central

167
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,100
who knows everything.

168
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,840
But you must be careful.

169
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Among those who have dealt with Il Wol Seong, no one has seen his face.

170
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,470
He sits behind the draped curtain

171
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,110
and you can only hear his otherworldly voice.

172
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,020
Anyone who discovers his real identity...

173
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,300
will lose their heads, I hear.

174
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,050
You better watch that mouth of yours.

175
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,650
Do not believe everything he says.

176
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,870
Half of what he says is a full-blown lie.

177
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,480
What? Then do you still believe half of it?

178
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,990
I'm not interested in the other half.

179
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,650
Il Wol Seong...

180
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,520
Hey, wait for me!

181
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,920
Wolseongdang

182
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,610
Wolseongdang

183
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,190
(Il Wol Seong : Head of Wolseongdang)

184
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,310
Yu Si Hong, the brother of Yeon Dynasty's emperor, is to come to this country as an envoy...

185
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,910
It is a matter of high security.

186
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,740
Is there some other reason you are working at Janghwangjang today, sir?
(Janghwangjang : a workshop where paintings are made into hanging scrolls)

187
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,970
The stars last night told me that an important person would visit me from the east.

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
The entryway of Janghwangjang faces east.

189
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,730
(Mu Yeong: Il Wol Seong's bodyguard)

190
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,900
Is there anyone you suspect?

191
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,750
Perhaps.

192
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,260
Who would be an important person to me?

193
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,460
Are you here? Mister Jeong.

194
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,090
Well, look who's here.

195
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,540
Painter Hong.

196
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,020
You should pay me first.

197
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,560
Let me see the new painting first.

198
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,790
It truly is difficult to tell the fake from the original.

199
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,810
This is why I like you.

200
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,980
How should I say it? Shall I say you have no pride as a painter?

201
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,990
It is exactly the same.
(Jeong Soen Nae : Deputy Chief of Wolseongdang)

202
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,130
- Is that a compliment?
- The highest compliment.

203
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,930
Daubers usually paint fakes but still go crazy, trying to leave their personal mark somehow.

204
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,410
They aren't even scholars who passed the civil service exam.

205
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,810
Even an imitation work is that painter's one and only piece.

206
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,120
Boy, I didn't know that.

207
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,690
Here it is.

208
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,470
Let me check.

209
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,010
Looks right.

210
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,070
What is this?

211
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,000
My last sign of respect?

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Come now, stop acting as if you're quitting.

213
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
I am.

214
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,960
I have enough money for my father's medicine now.

215
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,050
So this is my final imitation work.

216
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,120
Do keep quiet about this as you promised.

217
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,890
Quitting, eh?

218
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,450
That's nice. Nice.

219
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,020
But, Painter Hong ...

220
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,570
It will not be easy quitting imitation now that you have gotten a taste of it.

221
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,360
It is like opium, shall I say?

222
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,820
Why are you being like this?

223
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,790
You know why.

224
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,110
Do you have to ask?

225
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,210
We act friendly and call you "Painter Hong"...

226
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,340
and now, you think you are all that.

227
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,030
Let's see.

228
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,750
I can't cut your hand off.

229
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,880
Are you threatening me?

230
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,370
- Have you forgotten who I am?
- Of course not.

231
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,390
You are the only female painter in this town.

232
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,530
The only girl at Baegyu Painting Institute.

233
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,110
Would Wolseongdang maintain its reputation as the most established painting institute

234
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,620
if you keep acting this way?

235
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,450
What?

236
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,710
Do you plan to strike me with this?

237
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,480
Go ahead.

238
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,950
Here is my hand.

239
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,050
You are more fearless than an average man.

240
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,540
And you have better hearing than an average man.

241
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,870
Hurry and go.

242
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,130
Before I change my mind.

243
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,190
Don't go back on your word.

244
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,760
What are you doing?

245
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,100
Is someone there?

246
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,410
I told you to go. What are you doing?

247
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,240
Don't speak nonsense and leave right now.

248
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,820
All right.

249
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm leaving.

250
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,680
Thank you for everything!

251
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,740
Same to you both.

252
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,540
Hyeong-nim.

253
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,800
Are you really going to let her go like this?

254
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,600
Hurry and prepare to adorn the paintings with silk.
(Janghwang : To put on silk or thick paper on the paintings to make hanging scrolls)

255
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,780
His Excellency Lee in Bukchon is waiting.

256
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,770
Make sure you don't mix up the real and the fake.

257
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,850
My, I didn't know the color of medicine could be so beautiful.

258
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,130
Do you see?

259
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,370
This color is taken from the ten-thousand-year-old turtle

260
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,300
whose shell is golden and neck is yellow.

261
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,580
This is a sacred medicine made from a 10,000-year-old golden turtle.

262
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,650
Unless it's the real heaven's medicine from a 10,000-year-old golden turtle,

263
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,000
you cannot have a color like this.

264
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,940
Yes, sir. It is wonderful.

265
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,950
This is the 10,000-year-old golden turtle sacred medicine
(in Chinese)

266
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,580
that has a miraculous effect on mania disorders.
(in Chinese)

267
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,850
All you need is a single dose, all of your symptoms will disappear.
(in Chinese)

268
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,290
Even a single dose of this medicine

269
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,930
will have gradual effects from the day you take it.

270
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,270
Really?

271
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,500
That will do it! This will fix my father's illness.

272
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,840
Well, is this cheap?

273
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,330
No, no! There's no need to bargain.

274
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,770
It will bring bad luck.

275
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,320
No, no. I won't bargain. Fifty nyang. Fifty.

276
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,530
Come now, they say never take on a fight but always take on a bargain.

277
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,450
Gosh, no. To receive the spirit of a valuable medicine like this...

278
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,430
There. Here it is.

279
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,370
Fifty silver nyang.

280
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,260
You can check.

281
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,260
I will be going.

282
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,480
Thank you so much!

283
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,940
Buy silk!

284
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,900
Father, it's me, Cheon Gi.

285
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,560
Cheon Gi?

286
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,180
My Cheon Gi is only a baby.

287
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,880
Today's painting looks good.

288
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,460
Could you draw me?

289
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,690
Yes, miss.

290
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,460
Ajeossi, you've only been making hoes, sickles, and plows since yesterday, right?

291
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,110
I hear sounds that are rounded and blunt like my hands.

292
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,570
Do you know how long I have been looking for you?

293
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,040
I did tell you, though.

294
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,620
Father, have you forgotten again?

295
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,390
What?

296
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,160
Whoa, what a beautiful painting.

297
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,680
All right, I shall pay you with this for the painting.

298
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,410
Say "ah".

299
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,040
What are you doing?

300
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,390
I thought my Cheon Gi would be hungry, too.

301
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,510
I didn't even feed her breakfast properly.

302
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,910
I brought enough food. You can have it all.

303
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,970
Father, it is all for you.

304
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,580
And... this is something very precious.

305
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,950
What is...

306
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,510
Try this as well.

307
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,560
Savor the smell of this medicine first

308
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,060
then savor the taste.

309
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,950
You must eat it twice like that.

310
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,540
Here.

311
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,250
What is this?

312
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,050
It is my everything.

313
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,920
I wish you would call me "My daughter, Hong Cheon Gi"

314
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,450
and hold my brush with me like before.

315
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,070
I wish you would scold me never to draw imitations again.

316
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:46,240
Tell me that there's no use in painting without sincerity.

317
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,250
That stench.

318
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,410
She didn't notice, did she?

319
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,040
She is quite quick-witted.

320
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I made sure she didn't notice a thing.

321
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,540
Here, sir.

322
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,900
- Let us go.
- Sir...

323
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,480
Please! Please give me back the house deed.

324
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,460
It's a house that has been passed down for three generations.

325
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,190
Who instigated the human sacrifice?

326
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,050
I acted alone, Your Majesty.

327
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,470
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.

328
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,690
If not for the human sacrifice, it would not have rained.

329
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,890
There would have been more upheavals among the people

330
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,360
and the royal court would have been deeply distressed.

331
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,780
Is that not right, Your Majesty?

332
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,600
It did rain, so I shall spare your life.

333
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,300
You shall leave the palace as soon as dawn breaks.

334
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,940
And never return, even in death.

335
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,200
Your Majesty, I wish you good health.

336
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,740
The Grand Prince asks for you.

337
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,180
It seems only yesterday that you came to me after Father discarded you.

338
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,560
It has already been 20 years.

339
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,240
You haven't forgotten your oath, have you?

340
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,740
How could I?

341
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,880
I told you then it was not I who found you

342
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,850
but the heavens that chose you, Grand Prince.

343
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,300
Yes. When will that day come?

344
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,150
When you receive the spirit of Ma Wang,

345
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,690
the immortal ruler of death,

346
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,220
that will be your time.

347
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,000
I have heard that for years.

348
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,970
Compared to the gods, humans only live a short moment.

349
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,780
Time passes differently for them,

350
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,700
so please do not be anxious.

351
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,910
Isn't that a white crow?

352
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,900
It signifies a good fortune in a thousand years.

353
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,060
It was found dead in the mountain recently.

354
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,140
A big disaster will fall soon.

355
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,630
A big disaster...

356
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,510
Father, will I really be able to see again?

357
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,350
Of course. Do not worry.

358
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,130
Om mani padme hum. Om mani padme hum.

359
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,910
Om...

360
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,190
It has been a while.

361
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,140
You...

362
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,680
Inquisitor Kim Gok Rae...

363
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,640
Inquisitor?

364
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,310
Had you died that day at the cliff,

365
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,310
it would not have been so cumbersome.

366
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,830
Why are you doing this?

367
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,820
It has already been ten years since the abdicated King's orders.

368
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,850
Even after a hundred years, the King's orders are heaven's orders.

369
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,470
- King's order?
- I risked my life to seal Ma Wang!

370
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,370
My son lost his sight to bring the rain!

371
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,540
Is this how we are to be repaid?

372
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,360
Father!

373
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,580
Mother!

374
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,030
Please don't do this!

375
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,020
- Father!
- Please, no!

376
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,670
Do you mean to leave me with my husband's corpse and take my son as well?

377
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,070
It is the King's orders.

378
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,810
- Mother!
- Ha Ram!

379
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,410
Do you wish to die?

380
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,320
Mother, Mother... Mother!

381
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,110
You killed three people that day.

382
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,600
I will get revenge for that day's bloodshed.

383
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
No matter what.

384
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,970
You are late, Mu Yeong.

385
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,470
A message arrived from the palace.
(Jeonseogu : a trained pigeon to carry secret messages)

386
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,750
- Is it regarding the crown prince?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,110
The crown prince was attacked by an assassin

388
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,320
on his way to the hot springs.

389
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,590
Who was behind it?

390
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,790
We have dispatched agents from Wolseongdang.

391
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,920
We should hear from them soon.

392
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,790
His Majesty has been unwell for a long time

393
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,660
and His Highness the Crown Prince is weak.

394
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,000
It would have been a valuable opportunity to those who have their eye on the throne.

395
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,200
Now I think ... my time has come too.

396
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,450
An important guest will visit the request box tonight at Wolseongdang.

397
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,200
Mu Yeong, go collect it for me.

398
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,810
Yes, sir.

399
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,120
Bull's eye again, Your Highness.

400
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:39,160
Did you hear His Royal Highness was attacked by an assassin on his way to the hot springs?

401
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,710
Could it be a sign of a treasonous group threatening the throne?

402
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,640
I cannot sleep these days.

403
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,330
It is too early to be certain.

404
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,740
But if it concerns you so,

405
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,220
I advise you to meet Il Wol Seong.

406
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,450
- Il Wol Seong?
- Yes.

407
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,130
He is known to be as wise and all-knowing as Zhuge Liang. (Chinese statesman whose name has become synonymous with wisdom and strategy )

408
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,430
Why have I not heard of this man until now?

409
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,970
I am sorry, Your Highness.

410
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:23,760
He acts so carefully and secretively that no one knows his face nor his voice yet—

411
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,130
That's not a lie, is it?

412
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,780
No, Your Highness.

413
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,110
How would I dare speak carelessly in your presence?

414
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,060
If what you say is true,

415
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
don't you think we should do everything

416
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
to get him on our side?

417
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,490
Where can I meet him?

418
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,180
His request box is located on the market street.

419
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,600
Wolseongdang

420
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,680
I am Mu Yeong of Wolseongdang.

421
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,890
I am here to collect the requests.

422
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,770
Take me to your master.

423
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,000
Make haste, for an important guest is here.

424
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,500
I apologize, but my master will not show his face to anyone.

425
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,940
What impertinence! How dare you! Watch your mouth.

426
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,850
But my master already knew Grand Prince would visit.

427
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,830
As long as you do not try to find out his identity, you will receive the answer you desire—

428
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,830
You insolent—!

429
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,410
All right.

430
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,010
- Your Highness.
- Be at ease.

431
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,380
I understand...

432
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,690
Il Wol Seong's message.

433
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,990
A week from now, during the hour of the swine* at Simcheonggak. Il Wol Seong.
(9 p.m.- 11 p.m.)

434
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,250
Il Wol Seong...

435
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,260
That's not it. I wanted a Cheoyonghwa for my front door.

436
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,680
What are you drawing? What is this?

437
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,720
You swindler!

438
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,470
Hey, go over there.

439
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,530
You're here.

440
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,220
Did you buy that ancient sacred golden medicine thing?

441
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,340
Yes, I did.

442
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,380
How are the results?

443
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,660
Can't you tell by her expression?

444
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,130
Look, look at that cold look in her eyes.

445
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,590
She definitely got scammed.

446
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,700
Hey! Did I not tell you that you should watch your mouth?

447
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,420
Give me this painting.

448
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,300
I cannot.

449
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,080
Come now. Don't be like that.

450
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,960
Give this to me.

451
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,890
No...

452
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,940
I'll give you enough for the painting!

453
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,150
So just give it...

454
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,440
- I said no.
- Give this to me, you scoundrel!

455
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,750
Grandma, what are you doing?

456
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,200
Don't do that, it will rip.

457
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,840
Give it to me.

458
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,770
Nice, isn't it?

459
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,290
Give it back.

460
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,480
You know, you will ride a palanquin soon.

461
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,130
I'm sorry?

462
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,650
Have no worry, my dear! It will be a flower palanquin!

463
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,830
Hey, grandma!

464
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,800
Father.

465
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,700
It's me, Father.

466
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,250
Your daughter, Hong Cheon Gi.

467
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,980
Shall I paint you something?

468
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,080
Oh, no.

469
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,680
Don't stand in the rain. Come in.

470
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,910
Oh, no! My daughter!

471
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,820
Father!

472
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,860
You can't go. The shower will stop soon.

473
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,980
Let me go. My daughter is blind.

474
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,220
She's probably caught in the cold rain.

475
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,440
I'll go get her. Wait here.

476
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,360
All right. Then... she's about this tall.

477
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,260
- And she has a cane?
- Yes.

478
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,230
I got it.

479
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,530
Don't go anywhere. Sit and wait here.

480
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,900
I'll bring her back.

481
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,750
About Cheon Gi...

482
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,380
It doesn't sit well with me to fool a poor girl like that.

483
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,570
Watch your mouth.

484
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,670
Our lives depend on it.

485
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,990
We only have to pretend we don't know.

486
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,920
Gosh, look here.

487
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,170
Why did you have to fall into gambling?

488
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,010
Even if she finds out she bought fake medicine,

489
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,760
we cannot be the ones to tell her.

490
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,720
C-Cheon Gi...

491
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,280
What do you mean you fooled me?

492
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,580
What do you mean, Ajeossi?!

493
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,390
I'm so sorry, Cheon Gi.

494
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,010
What do you mean by that?

495
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,990
Simcheonggak

496
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,800
Sir, you're here!

497
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,830
Why did you drink so much?

498
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,490
Ja Ran, you pretty thing.

499
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,000
10,000-year-old golden turtle sacred medicine.

500
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,530
- You shameless scoundrel!
- Oh, my gosh!

501
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,260
Hey, stop right there!

502
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,460
Hey! Stop right there!

503
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,490
Goodness!

504
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,800
- Hey!
- Hold on!

505
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,150
Stop right there!

506
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,860
Hey! You son of a whore!

507
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,220
- Hey!
- Move!

508
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,130
How could you! Only to earn that money for my father's medicine,

509
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,950
I was berated and worked without sleep or food!

510
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,850
You think you'll be able to live now?! Give back my money!

511
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,930
Stop right there!

512
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,170
My! That woman is quite something.

513
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,260
Stop right there, you scum!

514
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,970
You!

515
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,810
What's going on?

516
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,050
Sounds as if someone is being chased.

517
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,030
Aigoo, Hyeong-nim!

518
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,660
It's good to run into you in a place like this.

519
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,190
Yes, Yul.

520
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,000
Are you having another poetry competition here?

521
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,560
Yes.

522
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,740
It is a pleasure to meet you. I'm Mae Hyang.

523
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,200
I hear you are the flower of Simcheonggak.

524
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,940
You are Grand Prince Juhyang, right?

525
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,290
I have heard a lot about you.

526
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,210
Come now, we can introduce ourselves later.

527
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,030
You are right on time.

528
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,640
Come and join us.

529
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,920
I declare we must do this another time.

530
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,830
I have an urgent engagement.

531
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,790
Well!

532
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,980
It is no fun...

533
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,420
to see you greet me so formally all the time.

534
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,840
How is it that you never change?

535
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,360
They say that changing suddenly means you'll die.

536
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,920
Come on now.

537
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,860
There will be other nights.

538
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,080
You will soon host a painting gathering at Maejukheon.

539
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,540
We can drink the night away then.

540
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,970
Pardon?

541
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,630
You are really coming, Hyeong-nim?

542
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,330
Wow! This painting gathering will go down in history.

543
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,150
Well then, enjoy yourselves.

544
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,890
Have a good night, Hyeong-nim!

545
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,560
Are you Il Wol Seong?

546
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,990
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,560
Please have a seat.

548
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,100
I shall.

549
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,730
Have you looked over my question?

550
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,580
There was a very precious green jewel out of reach,

551
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,100
but, a few nights ago, someone came and tried to steal it.

552
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,710
Was he a simple thief blinded by the gleaming jewel

553
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,020
or a master thief who risked his life knowing the value of the jewel?

554
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:30,280
So, do you understand my concern?

555
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,370
A green jewel would mean jade,

556
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,890
referring to your brother, the Crown Prince, Kang.
(Kang : Crown Prince of Dan Dynastry, Juhyang's older brother)

557
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,310
The unreachable place is the sky,

558
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,180
referring to the Crown Prince's Palace.

559
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,740
Thus?

560
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,900
If he were a simple thief,

561
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,600
Your Highness wouldn't have become involved directly.

562
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,120
So it must have been a master thief.

563
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,570
Such a thief regards himself as grand and exalted.

564
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:04,820
If someone like him reached for the unreachable sky,

565
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,080
that would signify treason.

566
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,360
What basis do you have to say such things?

567
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,420
I hear his highness the crown prince was ambushed by an assassin

568
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,960
on his way to the hot springs.

569
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,770
If this is not the sign of treason

570
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,310
referred to in the written question,

571
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,720
what else could it be?

572
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,660
You are suggesting...

573
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,440
the assassin incident is treason?

574
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,290
Do you truly wish to know?

575
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,580
- Speak!
- Then...

576
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,520
instead of coming to me,

577
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,700
you should face yourself in the mirror.

578
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,200
It was Your Highness ...

579
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,530
who sent the assassin.

580
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,590
Do you wish to die by my sword?

581
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,770
If the one behind this plot were to be revealed,

582
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,730
you, who have tested me with this question,

583
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,060
would not be safe either, Grand Prince Juhyang.

584
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,370
You...

585
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,990
- You can't be...
- Have you forgotten...

586
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,540
your oath...

587
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,490
not to seek my identity?

588
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,050
What swayed Zhuge Liang

589
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,570
was not a sword.

590
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,550
I assume Your Highness is not impatient.

591
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:24,060
Seeing that you are protecting the current king.

592
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,370
When the time comes,

593
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,340
you shall see me again.

594
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,620
I tested you today.

595
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,450
Your wisdom and mettle.

596
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,630
Surely as expected of Il Wol Seong, as they say.

597
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,580
I look forward to seeing you again.

598
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,850
Should I follow him?

599
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,870
No need.

600
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,920
He will not bend to a sword.

601
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,830
- Let's go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

602
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,970
You! You swindler!

603
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,210
Give me back my money! I said, give me back my money!

604
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,010
How vicious! I don't know anything!

605
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,160
- Jeong Soen Nae told me to do it!
- What?

606
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,370
Jeong Soen Nae?

607
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,250
Wolseongdang is behind this, too?

608
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,110
These scoundrels work in a pack!

609
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,160
I don't know anything!

610
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,460
Stop right there, you Wolseongdang scoundrel!

611
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,840
I did not mishear that, did I?

612
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:00,200
Yes, she definitely said, "Wolseongdang scoundrel!"

613
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,200
Tell Mu Yeong to investigate what has been happening at Wolseongdang.

614
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,130
Yes, My Lord.

615
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,660
This way, that's right.

616
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,090
I made you wait too long, Go Pil.

617
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,880
It's nothing new.

618
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,510
The sun isn't even up yet.

619
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,890
Are you suggesting that I drown myself in drinks every night?

620
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,470
(Go Pil: Grand Prince Yangmyeong's Chief Steward)

621
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:25,600
Perhaps you visit the courtesan house too often.

622
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,780
What else can I do? I'm under the world's scrutiny.

623
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,060
Scrutiny?

624
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,400
They say I have grown too powerful.

625
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,500
What power, Your Highness?

626
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,520
The issue is that the people I gather with are all noblemen.

627
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,780
Do they think it is easy for a country's Grand Prince

628
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,780
to be this good-looking and to have such exquisite calligraphy skills?

629
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,220
If it is only a misunderstanding stemming

630
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,760
from my good looks and love for literature and painting,

631
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,570
I am rather satisfied with this life, too.

632
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,540
Perhaps I misspoke.

633
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,160
No, repeat yourself again, Go Pil.

634
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,610
Start with what you said about my "good looks."

635
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,100
Good looks and...

636
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,160
This is why I like you.

637
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,350
Jeong Soen Nae...

638
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,080
Wolseongdang...

639
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,970
Hey, what are you doing?

640
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,040
Why do you look like that?

641
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,890
You must help me.

642
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,930
Gather around.

643
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,740
I'm going to...

644
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:46,030
All right. This is a Mukjukdo* from Jong Dynasty's Wun Dong.
(ink wash painting of a bamboo plant)

645
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,340
I hear this place is the best in art mounting and...

646
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,390
you know.

647
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,520
That you sell valuable paintings for a good price.

648
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,310
- So here I am today.
- You've come to the right place.

649
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,200
Wait!

650
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,770
It is worth more than a hundred silver nyang

651
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,180
so please do be careful with it.

652
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:10,040
We will send word once the painting sells so just relax and wait.

653
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,510
Careful, careful!

654
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,120
Careful. To the left. Stop!

655
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,940
Anyone here?

656
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,820
What is it?

657
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,720
Someone reported that

658
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,020
you copy paintings entrusted to your care and sell them as originals.

659
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,420
Inspect the place!

660
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,990
Yes, sir!

661
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,370
Inspect what... What are you doing?

662
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,680
What are you doing?

663
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,150
Where did you hear such slander?

664
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,870
Where?

665
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,190
This isn't fake!

666
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,390
This is real!

667
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,480
Appraiser!

668
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,880
He is a painter of the Painting Bureau holding Eighth Junior Rank.

669
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,410
He will evaluate whether this painting is authentic or counterfeit.

670
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,880
It is a counterfeit.

671
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,450
What a load of dog crap!

672
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,390
This isn't fake!

673
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,520
A bug in Wun Dong's Mukjukdo?

674
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,870
- What?
- That is simply impossible.

675
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:15,180
The paper was bought from Munseong Paper Goods across the street.

676
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,250
Look here.

677
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,330
It is marked with the store's emblem.

678
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,850
It can't be!

679
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,010
It can't be!

680
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,880
- Arrest him!
- Yes, sir!

681
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,370
This isn't fair!

682
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,580
This is slander!

683
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,190
I know nothing of this!

684
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,070
I would never do such a thing!

685
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,320
It is nothing!

686
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,320
I am only going to talk with them!

687
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,720
It is nothing!

688
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,240
First, this branch should show the bamboo's spirit.

689
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,120
It should show the spirit of the bamboo that might bend but won't break.

690
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,230
Showing off, again.

691
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,520
- Hold on.
- Jeez!

692
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,490
The branch needs to be painted first.

693
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,290
Sure, sure, Dr. Branch.

694
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,610
♫ Hey Ya Jihwaja, all is well ♫

695
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,400
♫ Hey Ya Jihwaja ♫

696
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,270
♫ Hey Ya Jihwaja, all is well ♫

697
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,300
♫ Eh Heh Heh Jihwaja ♫

698
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,800
♫ Hurrah! ♫

699
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,970
What do you think?

700
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,140
No one will know. It's well hidden.

701
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,880
I'm only going to talk with them!

702
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,280
- What's going on?
- Look what's happened.

703
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,060
Hong Cheon Gi, this is your doing, wench!

704
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,540
Are you out of your mind?

705
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,940
You just wait!

706
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,510
You worthless little piece of crap!

707
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,420
I will get you!

708
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,270
Gosh, I feel as if a dead weight had been lifted.

709
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,340
Is that enough?

710
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,870
Now you can face off any rascals.

711
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,220
Have you looked into the incident at the courtesan house?

712
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:18,500
The deputy leader, Jeong Soen Nae, has been making money illegally by selling counterfeit paintings.

713
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,710
When the painter who helped with counterfeit paintings tried to quit,

714
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,530
he tricked the painter and took her money.

715
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,210
- So that's what he was caught doing.
- Yes.

716
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,480
- Jeong Soen Nae was taken to the Police Bureau today.
- The Police Bureau?

717
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,900
He tricked the counterfeit artist, and that was the cause of his trouble.

718
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,860
You mean he was arrested because of the painter?

719
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,610
Yes, sir.

720
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,040
Close Wolseongdang... and find the counterfeit artist and get more details.

721
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,200
Sir, it is time to go to court.

722
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:08,420
The crown prince would not have been shot with an arrow had this not been treason.

723
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:13,780
I do not understand how all the guards were not able to catch that one person.

724
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,770
Among the five stars of the Jami constellation* representing the palace,
(northeast of the Big Dipper)

725
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,870
the crown prince's star shines big and luminous.

726
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,940
I believe there is no need to worry for his highness' safety.

727
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,400
Is that so?

728
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,480
But shouldn't we find what group is threatening the royal family and punish them accordingly?

729
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,510
I have heard that the blood shed by a king

730
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:39,310
follows his descendants for a thousand years, even after his death.

731
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:44,810
Your Majesty is still uneasy about the blood shed by the previous king.

732
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:49,130
You must be firm at times like these.

733
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,890
Yes.

734
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,430
That is what I must do.

735
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,130
Come closer.

736
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,170
From now on, among the five northern stars,

737
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,310
carefully observe the second and third stars

738
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,390
that represent Juhyang and Yangmyeong.

739
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,320
It is a secret order that I hand down to you.

740
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,570
I shall obey your order, Your Majesty.

741
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,720
Do you still have no memories of the past?

742
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,930
That's right, Your Majesty.

743
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:34,980
The memories following the rain ritual nineteen years ago have yet to come back to me.

744
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:42,700
But... there are times when fragments of a memory come to me.

745
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,870
I am glad to know that there is some improvement.

746
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,460
Yes.

747
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,490
It is fortunate.

748
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,570
Your Majesty.

749
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,960
I say that I have forgotten the events of that day.

750
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,350
But how could I forget everything?

751
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,260
Until those who killed my father,

752
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,360
brought down my family and ruined my life

753
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,160
pay for their sins,

754
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,550
I can never forget...

755
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,530
nor stop.

756
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,620
- Did you do it?
- I did.

757
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,090
Hyeong-nim!

758
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,530
What took you so long?

759
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:42,420
They asked for three times the money.

760
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,100
They got triple the money and treated me like this?

761
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,700
They said we should be thankful they let you go...

762
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,110
Hong Cheon Gi. Where is that wench?

763
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,670
You got what you deserve, Jeong Soen Nae.

764
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,640
Evil scoundrel.

765
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,830
Revenge doesn't give me my money back, though.

766
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,940
Everything that has happened to you is not within the human will.

767
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,720
It isn't your fault!

768
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,220
Somehow, those words...

769
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,150
still bring me comfort.

770
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,710
All right.

771
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,460
Hey, Annoying One.

772
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,400
Why? What is it this time?

773
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:38,330
I've been swindled of 50 nyang by Wolseongdang's Jeong Soen Nae.

774
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,190
As his master, Il Wol Seong must give me 100 nyang in return.

775
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,960
Caught you. Painter Hong, you're so busy running around all over these days.

776
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,450
Why are you doing this to me?

777
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,680
What do you mean?

778
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,850
I was supposed to rot in jail but I got out early.

779
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,800
A 100 nyang?

780
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,610
You shrewd wench.

781
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,160
- Hey!
- Aish! Catch her!

782
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,100
Hyeong-nim! Hyeong-nim!

783
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,800
Where did she go?

784
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,550
- Get in there!
- Yes, sir!

785
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,730
That sneaky wench!

786
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,050
Supervisor, we're at the town entrance.

787
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,840
I shall show the guards the night pass.

788
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,730
All right.

789
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,520
(Man Su: page belonging to Ha Ram's household)

790
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,010
What? Jeong Soen Nae?

791
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,150
Wolseongdang is behind this, too?

792
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,130
How did I...

793
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,630
I don't know who you are, but please pretend you didn't see me!

794
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,990
- Who are you?
- Hush! Please be quiet!

795
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,440
Did we lose her?

796
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,200
It is past curfew, so she couldn't have gone beyond the walls.

797
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,310
- Find her!
- Yes, Hyeong-nim!

798
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,080
Wait until I catch you, bloody wench.

799
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,190
I'll break your wrist and make sure you never paint again.

800
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,280
This woman, could she be ...?

801
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,210
Who are you?

802
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,570
Let me ask you something.

803
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,940
Have you seen a girl on the run?

804
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,510
A girl?

805
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,630
May I look inside the palanquin?

806
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,900
- Let's go, Man Su.
- Yes, sir.

807
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,580
- Go!
- All right! One, two...

808
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,270
Wait!

809
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,660
What is the meaning of this?

810
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,490
I need to see the face of the rider.

811
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,330
Do you know who this is?

812
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,280
What is going on outside?

813
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,060
Sir, it is nothing.

814
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,780
- You should go...
- Sir.

815
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,490
I don't know who you are,

816
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,910
but I am looking for a maidservant who ran away.

817
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,550
She definitely ran off this way.

818
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,950
I have looked everywhere...

819
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,480
I am the only one in the palanquin.

820
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,080
I cannot let you leave before I see with my own eyes.

821
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,690
Wait...

822
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,010
Open it if you dare.

823
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,850
Red eyes?

824
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:05,850
This palanquin was given to me by His Majesty himself.

825
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,550
Do you understand what that means?

826
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,060
I have been disrespectful. I should have been more careful.

827
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,460
Consider yourself lucky.

828
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,170
Had you opened the door,

829
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,420
you would have lost your life.

830
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,670
Let's go, Man Su.

831
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,740
Move!

832
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,620
Make haste.

833
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,170
Thank you.

834
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,710
You saved my life.

835
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,790
Were you very startled?

836
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,950
I was scared to death.

837
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,280
I was also startled it was not a woman

838
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,760
but a man in the palanquin.

839
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,180
I only ride the palanquin because I can't see.

840
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,860
I'm sorry?

841
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,620
I see.

842
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:19,580
But why did you help me?

843
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,760
What if I really am a runaway maidservant?

844
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,140
I smell a strong scent of ink from you,

845
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,370
so I knew you could not be a maidservant.

846
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:29,150
A maidservant would not have dared to hide in a stranger's palanquin.

847
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,210
I thought you had a reason.

848
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,350
That is right! I'm a painter.

849
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,070
That is remarkable.

850
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,540
It is nothing.

851
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,590
Because I can't see, I inspect my surroundings with sounds and scents.

852
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,650
Were you waiting for someone, by chance?

853
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,200
It is quite late at night.

854
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:55,020
Actually, I was being chased by them from the beginning.

855
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:59,290
What is your reason for being in such a distressful situation?

856
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,000
I was swindled by that jerk.

857
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,180
He is just dreadful.

858
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:10,740
Have you heard of Wolseongdang at the main market street?

859
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,810
I am not sure.

860
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:15,290
It is a gallery famous for selling valuable and expensive paintings.

861
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:18,280
But in truth, they are a despicable swindling bunch

862
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,780
that sell counterfeit works as authentic.

863
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,650
That scoundrel swindled me and stole my money

864
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,590
and I made sure to repay him.

865
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,770
I even saw him being taken to the Police Bureau.

866
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,170
I didn't think he would be out so quickly.

867
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,630
Oh, right!

868
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:36,030
Il Wol Seong, that man must have helped him!

869
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,210
I hear he is a dangerous man.

870
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,290
- Il Wol Seong?
- Yes.

871
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,480
He is the worst and most dangerous man.

872
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,700
Anyone who discovers his real identity

873
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,300
will lose their neck.

874
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,850
I have heard of his name before.

875
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,580
- But I hear he is virtuous and well-educated...
- What?

876
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,560
That sounds as preposterous as a date palm getting struck by a lightning bolt on a thunder and lightning day.

877
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,190
Gosh, you have it all wrong!

878
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,130
Could you...

879
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,260
by any chance...

880
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,400
be Il Wol Seong's acquaintance?

881
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,570
- Of course not.
- Thank goodness.

882
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:22,600
Why would you jest about such a thing? You really startled me.

883
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,640
Here it is.

884
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,580
Thank goodness. Why would you jest about such a thing?

885
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,290
You really startled me.

886
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:33,580
Why am I reminded of her?

887
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,490
- The road is becoming rough!
- Yes.

888
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:53,610
Your eyes are really beautiful.

889
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:57,220
They are like red, red jaspers.

890
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,520
Are you all right?

891
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,200
Yes, I'm all right.

892
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,530
No one has ever said that to me before.

893
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:19,250
People call me a monster when they see my eyes.

894
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,230
To eyes this beautiful?

895
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,240
They are the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

896
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,000
I mean it.

897
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,780
Are you all right? The palanquin is...

898
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,300
Scholar Sir?

899
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,070
What is wrong?

900
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,020
Are you unwell?

901
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,580
- I think you should get off now.
- Pardon?

902
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,970
So suddenly?

903
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:27,270
Man Su, stop the palanquin.

904
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,870
Pardon?

905
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:30,150
Yes, Supervisor Sir.

906
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,090
- Stop the palanquin.
- Sir?

907
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,650
Scholar Sir, at least tell me your name.

908
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,530
Hurry, Man Su.

909
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,440
Ye... yes, Supervisor Sir.

910
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,360
Supervisor?

911
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,210
Be careful on your way home.

912
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,810
Let's go.

913
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,300
Wait, Scholar Sir! Your name!

914
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,320
But, Sch...

915
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,650
Will she be all right alone at night?

916
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:25,400
The town is just ahead, but...

917
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,030
Sir?

918
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,970
I mean, how could he just tell me to get off so suddenly?

919
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,680
I wonder how Annoying One and Long Face are doing.

920
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,050
What's wrong with these people...

921
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,770
Hold on tightly.

922
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,310
The road is rough here.

923
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,920
The palanquin keeps shaking!

924
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,470
No, wait.

925
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,280
It's shaking too much.

926
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,180
Hold on!

927
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,040
Put down the palanquin!

928
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,310
What are you doing?

929
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,000
Sir, are you all right?

930
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,410
Sir?

931
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,360
What is that?

932
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,340
- What is it? A tiger?
- No!

933
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,250
It's a monster! A monster!

934
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,750
Sir!

935
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,230
He's not here.

936
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,930
Run!

937
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,150
Hurry!

938
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,660
You have made a mistake, Ha Ram.

939
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,620
You have left the palace proper on the night of winter solstice,

940
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,320
when the energy of yin is at its fullest.

941
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:14,740

Something terrible happened in Inwang Mountain!

949
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,100
He dropped straight from the sky and just fainted.

950
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,960
What do you mean all the guards died last night?

951
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,490
There is no quality of living beings in these bodies. How bizarre.

952
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,220
It is surely the sign of Ma Wang.

953
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,230
Is this truly counterfeit?

954
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,640
Find me that cheeky counterfeit painter from earlier.

01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,690
- Lock her up this instant!
- Headmaster!

That's Hong Cheon Gi from the Baegyu Painting Institute. What is taking so long?

01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,250
Her mad father is always out front.

958
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,670
Go out and get her!
