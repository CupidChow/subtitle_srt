1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,970
Lovers of the Red Sky

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,990
Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,660
Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,040
Lovers of the Red Sky

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,600
The characters and settings of this drama are fiction and have no connection to historical facts.

6
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,450
Your Highness, why are you so kind to me?

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,740
Because it aches.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,320
Pardon?

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,170
Every time I see you, my heart aches.

10
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,870
We should first escape the rain.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,270
Hold on a while longer.

12
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,570
Forgive me, Your Highness.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,030
But her promise to me was first.

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,480
Your Highness, one moment...

15
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,340
Stay here.

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Promise?

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,500
Were you the one who made Painter Hong walk in this rain?

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,570
- That is not—
- Answer me.

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,890
Was it you, Supervisor Ha?

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,700
I did not know the maiden was walking in the rain.

21
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,970
You did not know?

22
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,990
You made someone walk in this rain and did not know?

23
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,170
How perplexing.

24
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,980
We shall see each other later.

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,790
- We should go.
- Your Highness.

26
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,190
The scholar cannot see...

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,510
Do your eyes not see me?

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,990
Forgive me.

29
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,390
Grand Prince Yangmyeong!

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,150
You suddenly disappeared.

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,300
I was looking for you everywhere.

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,340
We must be going.

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,760
I shall be back at Maejukheon.

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,620
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,120
Let us go, Scholar Sir.

36
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,030
What is it?

37
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,820
What made you look for me in this rain?

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,100
Nineteen years ago, the day we made our promise...

39
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,980
That day,

40
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,560
I lost my sight.

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,470
It was the price of bringing rain to this nation after a prolonged drought.

42
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,300
I could not go meet you with such eyes.

43
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,320
Even if I had met you,

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,300
what could I have done?

45
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,590
After that day, I have only walked one path.

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,600
I lost both my father and mother.

47
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,070
I have turned my back against the world ever since.

48
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,410
I lived like that...

49
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,460
until I met you who remember me

50
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,820
from the past.

51
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,950
I missed you...

52
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,990
so much.

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,000
But I cannot have you...

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,740
by my side.

55
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,900
If I stay by your side,

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,200
I keep wanting to be the old Ha Ram.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,170
Because I keep yearning to return to the me of the past

58
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,870
who promised to go pick peaches with you.

59
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,760
And now for me

60
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,000
I cannot live like that anymore.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,100
So I ask you...

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,230
to continue living...

63
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,000
as if you do not know me.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,100
I beg you.

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,500
There are moments when I also...

66
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,200
feel fearful and afraid of living.

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,450
And whenever that happens

68
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,730
I remember what you said to me that one day.

69
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,390
"Don't blame yourself."

70
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,390
I may not know much,

71
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,930
but it is not your fault.

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,390
Your blindness,

73
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,500
your father's death and everything that happened to your family.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,800
They all could not be helped, Ha Ram.

75
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,780
Every once in a while, just like you did today,

76
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,740
tell me how you truly feel.

77
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,870
That is all I ask.

78
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,000
I shall be going now.

79
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,740
Wait for me.

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,600
Until the day when I can go to you.

81
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,270
Episode 8: The Burnt Portrait of the King

82
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,820
Grand Prince Juhyang knows that the seal on Ma Wang was undone on the day of the rain ritual.

83
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,960
He seems to have been seeking Ma Wang ever since that day.

84
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,760
Your Majesty must stop Grand Prince Juhyang.

85
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,660
If you have received this secret letter,

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,750
danger has befallen me.

87
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,220
To Yangmyeong

88
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,520
To Juhyang

89
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,270
King, come closer.

90
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,940
You cannot escape me.

91
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,320
Is there not much time left?

92
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,420
I must end this at any cost

93
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,950
before I abdicate in favor of Yi Kang.

94
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,850
Send this to Grand Prince Yangmyeong

95
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,990
and this to Grand Prince Juhyang.

96
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,230
We must hasten the restoration of the predecessor king's royal portrait.

98
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,910
You have one month.

99
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,430
Master Han, you must complete the restoration

100
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,460
of the royal portrait with the divine painter.

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,380
That is too little time, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,570
Even for a divine painter,

103
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,680
- it is impossible.
- Make it possible.

104
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,580
There is not much time left.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,410
Your Highness,

106
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,740
why are you so kind to me?

107
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,300
I have come to like you.

108
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,780
The scholar cannot see...

109
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,470
How...

110
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,050
- Grand Prince Yangmyeong.
- Goodness!

111
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,650
Someone is here from the palace.

112
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,570
That surprised me.

113
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,420
Didn't he say anything else?

114
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,830
He asked you to go straight to the Painting Bureau and meet with Master Han Geon.

115
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,820
All right. I shall do so.

116
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,840
Support me.

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,100
Hyeong-nim!

118
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,730
You must run, my lord! I shall stop Ma Wang!

119
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,950
The eyes. Do not look him in the eyes!

120
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,170
Ma Wang.

121
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,380
Without fail

122
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,910
I must find him.

123
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,490
Sit.

124
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,030
Royal Shaman.

125
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,460
Do you remember a painter named Hong Eun Oh?

126
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,630
Hong Eun Oh?

127
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,620
He was a painter at the Painting Bureau and painted the royal portrait.

128
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,870
He was the one who drew King Yeongjong's royal portrait at the sealing ritual of Ma Wang.

129
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,840
The winner of this Maejukheon Painting contest,

130
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,850
Hong Cheon Gi, is his daughter.

131
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,560
Pardon?

132
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,170
Hong Eun Oh's daughter…

133
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,610
Stop!

134
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,620
Please stop!

135
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,440
Lord Ha Seong Jin, this is my daughter.

136
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,460
I'm Hong Cheon Gi.

137
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,550
How could a blind person see again?

138
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,990
The son of Ha Seong Jin lost his sight

139
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,810
and the daughter of Hong Eun Oh gained hers…

140
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,530
If that painter is truly Hong Eun Oh's daughter,

141
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,550
she could be the divine painter

142
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,570
to restore the royal painting that will seal Ma Wang.

143
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:35,140
Is the royal portrait the reason Father sought a divine painter?

144
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,950
You must confirm the presence of Ma Wang in Supervisor Ha's body.

145
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,700
Yes, we must confirm before Father finds out.

146
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,370
We need Supervisor Ha's blood.

147
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,320
Blood?

148
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,830
Send word to Supervisor Ha's residence that I wish to see him tonight.

149
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,240
I shall go.

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,670
I must take care of something first.

151
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,140
Amira amira para...

152
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,490
Who are you?

153
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,510
We were sent by Grand Prince Juhyang.

154
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,460
Grand Prince Juhyang requests your presence at his residence at the hour of the dog* tonight.
(7-9 p.m.)

155
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,220
All right.

156
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,200
- You may go now.
- And...

157
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,190
Maiden Hong left this behind.

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,340
What is this?

159
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,820
It is a painting.

160
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,430
It seems to be a sehwa of a tiger.

161
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,180
A Hodo*?
(tiger painting)

162
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,690
I mention this to ease your concern in finding a divine painter.

163
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,910
She shall work on restoring King Yeongjong's royal portrait.

164
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,790
The sealing ritual…

165
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,780
Is it related to that day?

166
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,590
Your Highness, someone is here from the palace.

167
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,460
By nature, there is one who interprets the stars in the sky,

168
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,590
one who roams among them, and one who draws them.

169
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,990
You should enjoy the stars.

170
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,430
Stay among them.

171
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,220
You shall be safe that way.

172
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,830
I have received the message.

173
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,770
- You may go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

174
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,860
Royal Father, I will be sure to keep this in mind.

175
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,040
So do not let me see you with your guard down.

176
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,340
I shall not have my place stolen ever again.

177
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,800
I missed you so much.

178
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,800
But I cannot have you by my side.

179
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,780
A man's heart is always so perplexing.

180
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,690
Your Highness, why are you so kind to me?

181
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,280
Because it aches.

182
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,180
Every time I see you, my heart aches.

183
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,710
I suppose this would be enough for the price of cheongsimwon.

184
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,000
Is anyone there?

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,630
I must be crazy.

186
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,950
Now I'm hearing things.

187
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,600
Is no one there?

188
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,670
Here they are.

189
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
Are these cheongsimwons?

190
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,470
Yes, they are the cheongsimwons you so wanted.

191
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,800
Your Highness, I am not sure I deserve to receive these.

192
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,970
Harder to earn than a thousand pieces of gold,

193
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,300
it was the promise of this nation's prince, Yi Yul.

194
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,180
Accept them.

195
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,570
I apologize.

196
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,200
It did not sit well with me that day to part with Your Highness like that.

197
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,210
I have prepared something to give to Your Highness.

198
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,510
Nothing is free in this world.

199
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,900
Never mind. What could you offer?

200
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,490
But I worked hard to prepare it.

201
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,890
You did not even hear what it is.

202
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,750
Are you looking down on me?

203
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,540
Poverty is not a sin, so don't be embarrassed.

204
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,790
I am fine.

205
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,140
You truly will not regret it?

206
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,940
I am not such a calculating man.

207
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,350
I painted something only for Your Highness.

208
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,800
But I shall leave it. You cannot go back on your words.

209
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
P-painting?

210
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,430
The payment for the cheongsimwon was a painting?

211
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,610
Poverty is not a sin.

212
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,800
I shall sell it and pay for Father's medicine.

213
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,570
How dare you! How narrow-minded for a painter.

214
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,300
Well, now. You say you drew it for me.

215
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,050
I might as well look at it.

216
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,920
My, isn't this anhwado?

217
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,900
A quail representing wellbeing, and rice that represents peace.

218
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,080
The four paddy birds in the painting,

219
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,110
five ears of rice...

220
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,280
Does it not imply peace for the four seasons and abundance of the five grains?

221
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,470
I drew a gilsangdo in the hope that

222
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,740
Your Highness who has shown me grace

223
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,310
will achieve everything that you desire.

224
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,830
Do you like it?

225
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,220
I do. Of course, I do.

226
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,190
"Gilsando", a picture expressing wishes for things like wealth and happiness.

227
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,510
But I have something to ask you.

228
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,350
What is it?

229
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,200
What happened that day?

230
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,090
Never mind.

231
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,600
Silence is also an answer.

232
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,100
The painting still seems wet.

233
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,960
I shall send servants to collect it in the morning.

234
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,820
Your Highness.

235
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,010
What is it that you wanted to hear from me?

236
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,430
Supervisor Ha blocked me in the rain that day.

237
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,700
Do you truly not know what that means?

238
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:46,810
Is the reason you cannot be honest with me because of Supervisor Ha?

239
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,070
You truly are bad at hiding your feelings.

240
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,910
I shall be going now.

241
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:17,500
♫ Our love which hurt and hurts and was so ardent ♫

242
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,800
Father, this is cheongsimwon.

243
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Take them, and you must get better soon.

244
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,610
♫ The world is filled with the fragrance. ♫

245
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,300
♫ of the one person who is you ♫

246
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:40,550
♫ Deep in my heart, the only person is just you ♫

247
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,310
Please come inside.

248
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,710
Grand Prince Juhyang, it is Supervisor Ha.

249
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,990
Come in.

250
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,230
I shall take your cane.

251
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,710
Come this way.

252
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,690
A pleasure to meet you.

253
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,800
I hear His Majesty favors you a lot.

254
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,160
I am Mi Su, once the head shaman at the Royal Shamanist Bureau.

255
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,960
A new voice. It is a pleasure to meet you.

256
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,190
So you are Mi Su, the head shaman at the Shamanist Bureau.

257
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,550
Looking at you up close, I see you're the spitting image of Lord Ha Seong Jin.

258
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,230
Now then, let me offer you a drink.

259
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,820
You two have met before.

260
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,720
Did you know that?

261
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,270
Is that so?

262
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,720
Yes. I was the royal shaman of the Shamanist Bureau

263
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,080
who led the lizard rain ritual on the day you lost your sight.

264
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,750
Do you remember?

265
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,260
I apologize. I was too young to remember.

266
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,000
How could I forget?

267
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,320
I remember that day as clearly as if it were yesterday.

268
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,820
The moment you set foot on Gwanyang with your father, Lord Ha Seong Jin

269
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,330
and when you fell into the water during the rain ritual

270
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,950
and came back to life.

271
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,700
But I still could not find the answer as to what spirit

272
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,630
moved your body that day.

273
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,720
Still no answer?

274
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,400
Then...

275
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,950
do you know what that spirit was, Supervisor Ha?

276
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:46,430
Forgive me, but I also do not know what it was.

277
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,930
If you answer me like that,

278
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,050
it makes me a fool for inviting you.

279
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,290
After that day, I lost my sight, and my memories became blurry,

280
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,160
so my answer will be the same no matter how many times you ask me.

281
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,330
How can I...

282
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,120
believe you?

283
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,130
I read the secrets of the heavens.

284
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,090
How could I dare lie to Your Highness?

285
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,010
Your Highness, I worry that His Majesty will gather us all,

286
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,730
should Supervisor Ha lose his memories again.

287
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
Right.

288
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,960
You lost your memories when you had that incident on Inwang Mountain.

289
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,820
How about now?

290
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,590
Yes.

291
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,980
At times...

292
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,100
the memories...

293
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,050
become fragmented.

294
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,740
When do you usually lose your memories?

295
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,370
The day my father died.

296
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,600
On Inwang Mountain not too long ago...

297
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,400
and—

298
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,690
How could this be? They all happened on days I met Cheon Gi.

299
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,780
What do you remember?

300
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,280
Your Highness...

301
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,090
What are you seeking from me?

302
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,600
- I do not remember anything.
- Ma Wang.

303
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,190
Do you know Ma Wang?

304
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,140
Ma Wang?

305
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,500
Lord Ha Seong Jin! You must run, my lord!

306
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,770
I shall stop Ma Wang!

307
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,390
No.

308
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,060
I have never heard this before.

309
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,330
What is it?

310
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,740
Well now.

311
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,700
His Highness must be worried that you lose your memory at times, Supervisor Ha.

312
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,850
Anyhow, I hear you are skilled at playing the geomungo.

313
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,900
May I request some geomungo music?

314
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,040
If you could only forgive the insolence that day,

315
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,100
I shall play it as much as you wish.

316
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,310
Bring in the geomungo.

317
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,400
If Your Highness could set up a meeting with Supervisor Ha,

318
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,610
we shall come up with a plan.

319
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,990
Are you curious...

320
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,810
what Ma Wang is?

321
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,630
What is it?

322
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,160
Red eyes.

323
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,720
As expected, you are quite extraordinary.

324
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,170
What are you saying, Your Highness?

325
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,650
It seems you can withstand the spiritual aura of the tiger sword.

326
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,800
You will soon find out about Ma Wang.

327
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,510
This will replace the 300 seoks of rice you owe me.

328
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,200
Are you all right?

329
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,300
Find Ma Wang.

330
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,310
That seems to be related to everything.

331
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,660
Even with my past.

332
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,720
Yes, sir.

333
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,070
How marvelous!

334
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,260
Truly marvelous.

335
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,000
Cheon Gi, I packed some of your favorite snacks.

336
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
- Eat them alone in secret.
- Huh?

337
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,570
- You must eat them alone.
- Gyeonju Daek.

338
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,720
I expected Obnoxious One.

339
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,780
- But I didn't know you would come along, Long Face.
- Why?

340
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,500
Master Han Geon said that all painters who made it to the third round at the contest

341
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,390
are eligible to join the Painting Bureau, no?

342
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,130
Ink, brush, and paper always go together.

343
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,070
So the three of us must always go together too, right?

344
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,650
Cheon Gi, since you are joining the Painting Bureau,

345
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,240
you must make sure you live up to your father's name.

346
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,910
Where is Headmaster?

347
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,980
He said he would not come out since he already said his goodbye.

348
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,100
Is that so?

349
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,480
But, still...

350
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,100
All right.

351
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,960
We shall be going now.

352
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,110
Careful on your way.

353
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,100
- We will be back.
- Goodbye.

354
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,200
- Goodbye!
- You can come back.

355
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,600
If things become too tough, don't hold back and come back.

356
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,690
I will.

357
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,190
Make sure you pay respect to the elder painters who joined the Painting Bureau before you.

358
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,990
Yes, I will.

359
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,230
Don't throw your brush just because they make you paint the same thing every day.

360
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,210
Yes, yes, Headmaster.

361
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,510
Don't worry.

362
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,810
When you come back, you should finish the folding screen for Lord Yu.

363
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,040
- Pardon?
- Never mind the Painting Bureau.

364
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,990
You must still do your work for Baegyu Painting Institute.

365
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,290
Headmaster!

366
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,140
Hey, we are not to greet the people who are below us?

367
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,380
Be quiet.

368
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,720
This was the dan... something.

369
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,850
Dancheong*.
(traditional decorative colouring on wooden buildings and artifacts)

370
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,230
- Dancheong.
- Good to see you all.

371
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,600
We meet again.

372
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,650
Who...

373
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,190
Hey, is he that Satgat?

374
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,830
Oh, the Magic Painter!

375
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,760
What is a free spirit like yourself doing at the Painting Bureau?

376
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,290
I was tired of roaming the land and decided to settle here a while.

377
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,270
I see...

378
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,980
All right, I shall introduce the new painters today.

379
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,060
- Come.
- Wow, so many...

380
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,320
Now, these painters were admitted to the Painting Bureau

381
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,250
at His Majesty's special orders.

382
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,390
Wow.

383
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,290
They made it to the third round of the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

384
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,020
This week, you will be busy making lotus folding screens,

385
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,810
and next week, you must paint peacocks on fans for the head person.

386
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,760
In a month, we must prepare for the feast for the queen dowager's seventieth birthday.

387
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,780
So the Painting Bureau's work is crucial.

388
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,200
This is the storage with all the painting supplies.

389
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,070
Everything from Yeon Empire, too, comes straight here.

390
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,270
This...

391
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,350
Isn't this a brush made from sheep hair?

392
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,100
Look here. Ink stone made from Nampo* rock, too.
(today's Boryeong in Chungcheongnam-do)

393
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,700
Anything that could possibly exist in this country is here.

394
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,540
Should you try to smuggle anything, thinking no one would notice,

395
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,300
you will lose your hand if you get caught.

396
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,570
We are keeping track one by one of all the quantities of every item.

397
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,290
Understood.

398
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,630
- Hey, what are they doing?
- How much is this one?

399
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,450
The storage is also where the painters rest, too.

400
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,270
Tell me your name instead.

401
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,040
- While drawing portraits?
- Her name is Ok Hui!

402
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,830
What a beautiful name.

403
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,880
Have you heard as well?

404
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,100
The rumor that the girl who fools around with Supervisor Ha joined the Painting Bureau.

405
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,000
The woman painter who seduced Grand Prince Yangmyeong with her looks to join the Bureau?

406
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,360
If anyone were to be admitted here because of their looks,

407
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,510
our Ok Hui would have been first place.

408
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,030
Painter Jang, you are so...

409
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,320
You, people.

410
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,510
Hey, hey!

411
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,090
How dare you speak such nonsense.

412
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,720
Master Painter Han would be so proud if he knew you were in the storage

413
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,340
drawing the palace maids' portraits.

414
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,820
What the heck are you doing in the palace?

415
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,150
Hey, I was looking for you.

416
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,330
Don't mind them and let's go.

417
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,850
Let go.

418
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,690
- How can I sit back when they spew such nonsense?
- Painter Hong!

419
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,570
Painter Hong!

420
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Master Painter Han Geon... is looking... for you.

421
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,970
Me?

422
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,910
At the fifth gyeong* at night, a guest star was seen
(Night hours were divided into five gyeong)

423
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,520
within 90 degrees above the Azure Dragon of the East*.
(One of the 4 regions of the sky, represents spring)

424
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,260
After that, we could not follow it,

425
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,030
as the sky became cloudy and it rained.

426
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,250
Grand Prince Yangmyeong, you are here.

427
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,700
Welcome, Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

428
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,490
What brings you here?

429
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,490
Supervisor Ha.

430
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,950
I must speak with you.

431
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,350
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,630
Let me ask you.

433
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,660
What is the relationship between you and Painter Hong?

434
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:36,090
Maiden Hong saved my life at the paint-making house.

435
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,790
I am certain you two have known each other from before then.

436
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,530
Yes.

437
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:45,630
We've known each other since a long time ago.

438
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,660
- What?
- I said we've known each other since a very long time ago.

439
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,260
- Then, let me ask you again.
- Before that...

440
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,370
Your Highness must answer me first.

441
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:03,420
Why is Your Highness so interested in my relationship with Maiden Hong?

442
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,790
Even if I have feelings for her,

443
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,080
that is my personal sentiment.

444
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,630
Is that not so?

445
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,520
Do you realize what you are saying right now?

446
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,370
This is a confession of your feelings toward Painter Hong.

447
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,500
I cannot help it, even if that is what you think.

448
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,020
- Are you sincere?
- I am.

449
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Then why is it that I cannot feel your sincerity?

450
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,400
Sincerity is not something you only speak of.

451
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,940
If what you say is true,

452
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,600
if you are sincere about her, then,

453
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,230
do not ever, never again...

454
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,610
let Painter Hong walk in the rain.

455
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,210
Then...

456
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,500
will Your Highness get her in trouble with your reckless curiosity?

457
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,210
Did you ask me if I am sincere?

458
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,800
It does not seem to be a question that Your Highness should ask me,

459
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,690
when you should keep the royal dignity and fulfill your duties as a grand prince.

460
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,670
I see.

461
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:44,090
I shall keep your advice in mind.

462
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,100
Supervisor Ha, remember this day.

463
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,270
From now on,

464
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:03,470
I shall do everything within my power to win Painter Hong's heart.

465
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Forgive me, Your Highness.

466
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,480
I cannot let Cheon Gi go like this.

467
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,300
Master Painter, Painter H... Hong is h... here.

468
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,630
Yes. Tell her to come in.

469
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,090
So, have you looked around the Painting Bureau?

470
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,180
Yes, sir.

471
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,570
How was it?

472
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,050
I suppose you are not yet settled in.

473
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,300
After hearing the Taskmaster speak,

474
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,600
I thought for a moment why there was so much to do.

475
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,720
The Painting Bureau exists solely to serve His Majesty.

476
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,440
Did you expect the work to be easy?

477
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
Oh, that's not what I meant...

478
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,000
Your father and I were once close friends at the Painting Bureau.

479
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,650
Is that true?

480
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,350
Yes. We shall catch up later.

481
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,510
The reason I called you here

482
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,460
is because I have a confidential directive to give you.

483
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,800
Yes, sir.

484
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,870
I am about to entrust you with a very important task.

485
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,650
An important task?

486
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,470
From now on, you will continue the official duties at the Painting Bureau by day

487
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,960
and take on another task with me at night.

488
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,680
By another task, you mean...

489
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,220
Would I be the only one to work on it?

490
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,190
The details are not settled yet.

491
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,590
Let me just say that it will be a different kind of painting from what you have painted so far.

492
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,470
Yes, Master Painter Sir.

493
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,590
Now, go outside to check your special assignment

494
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,720
and meet me in front of Gyeongwonjeon at the hour of the dog*.
(7-9 p.m.)

495
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,170
The taskmaster will guide you.

496
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,950
Special assignment?

497
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,900
In the storage, there are old m-ma...

498
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,200
Oh, find the maps and replicate them, correct?

499
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,310
That's right.

500
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,730
I suppose I cannot carry around the maps with me.

501
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,350
Should I go there every day to paint them?

502
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,470
That's right.

503
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,310
H-here is S-Seomungwan.

504
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,090
- Let us go inside.
- Yes, sir.

505
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,500
T-this here, she is- new here.

506
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,500
- Taskmaster, you are here.
- Long time no see, Calendarist Park.

507
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,190
Oh, no. Where d-did he g-go?

508
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,620
Supervisor Jang...

509
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,700
Aigoo, this won't do.

510
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,100
I must be going, so wait here.

511
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,400
- He will be here soon.
- Who will?

512
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,840
Oh, Supervisor Jang.

513
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,580
He is s-supervisor of the g-geomancy division.

514
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,460
He will s-supervise the restoration process.

515
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,150
- I understand.
- All right, good day.

516
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,010
Oh, forgive me.

517
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,120
Scholar Sir!

518
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,380
What are you doing here?

519
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,480
That is what I would like to ask you.

520
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,080
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, well...

521
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,280
I was assigned by the Painting Bureau to restore the maps

522
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,100
and came here on a special assignment.

523
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,750
Map restoration room is that way.

524
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,860
Yes.

525
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,610
I did come from that way...

526
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,130
but I was looking around...

527
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,910
I remember you were Supervisor Ha of Seomungwan.

528
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,210
Yes.

529
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,150
Seomungwan is where I work.

530
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,900
Well, I shall be going now.

531
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,730
What is it?

532
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,280
I was wondering if you caught a cold that day.

533
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,080
So why the wrist...

534
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,720
I am good at pulse diagnosis.

535
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,460
Is your pulse always this fast?

536
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,620
You seem unwell.

537
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,590
Oh, no. It is nothing.

538
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,640
I must be going to the map restoration room.

539
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,690
Do you know where it is?

540
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,530
Pardon?

541
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,950
The floor is quite unique.

542
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,130
It is the path that I walk.

543
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,060
This is my office.

544
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,220
You cannot come in without my permission.

545
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,870
I wouldn't even if you did permit me.

546
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,440
What is this painting?

547
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,570
This is the Celestial Classified Field Map.

548
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,210
Celestial...

549
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,570
A map!

550
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,020
It is a drawing that displays the heavenly bodies by twelve sectors and fields.

551
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,020
The name is quite complicated,

552
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,250
but the drawing is truly magnificent.

553
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,770
There is somewhere I think Painter Hong would truly like.

554
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,760
So beautiful!

555
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,180
This is the Astronomy Tower.

556
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,260
It is where we observe the movement of the stars.

557
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,330
I see the Big Dipper there.

558
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,510
This is a star?

559
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,740
Yes. The Big Dipper.

560
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,380
I see. The Big Dipper.

561
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,860
Do you remember?

562
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,400
It was the first star I drew.

563
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,590
How could I forget it?

564
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,250
Do you know what kind of star the Big Dipper is?

565
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm not sure.

566
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,390
What kind of star is it?

567
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,640
It is the star that watches over all the good and bad, lucky and unlucky aspects of life

568
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,940
ever since a person is born, allotted a span of life by Grandma Samshin.

569
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:34,390
Then, is a person's destiny decided at birth?

570
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,200
At least, in the world I live in, yes.

571
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,560
Then isn't it pointless for people to strive in life?

572
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,270
It is not easy to change the fate assigned to you.

573
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,560
I suppose that is true.

574
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,710
What is this special assignment at Seomungwan?

575
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,270
His Majesty commanded all stages of restoration

576
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,070
of King Yeongjong's portrait be carried out without the knowledge of any court official.

577
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,420
If we dispatch Painter Hong on a special assignment to Seomungwan,

578
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,140
nobody at the Painting Bureau will take interest in her work.

579
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,720
A good plan.

580
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,100
But what is the reason he is rushing to restore the royal portrait?

581
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,300
I am not sure, but His Majesty seems to be growing weaker by day.

582
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,210
Is that how it is...

583
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,360
We must hurry without further delay.

584
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,380
This is the Seomungwan storage.

585
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,470
This is where you will restore the maps.

586
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:58,950
But I heard there was a supervisor to oversee my work with the map restoration.

587
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,780
I wonder when he will get here. I should greet him before I leave.

588
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,980
The supervisor to oversee your map restoration work... is me.

589
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Pardon?

590
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,550
Is that true?

591
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,830
Do not worry that I would feel uncomfortable.

592
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,180
Do not worry.

593
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,840
We do not know each other anyhow.

594
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,920
Oh, look at the time already.

595
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,150
I must be going now, Scholar Sir.

596
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,860
Thank you for today.

597
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,700
By the way, Scholar Sir, do you know where Gyeongwonjeon is?

598
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,430
Let me take you.

599
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,940
Samshin, you worked hard.

600
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,550
Ho Ryeong, Goddess of Mt. Inhwang and the palace

601
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,270
Master Painter.

602
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,190
There you are.

603
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,270
Aren't you Supervisor Ha?

604
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,180
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, yes.

605
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,290
The maiden said she does not know where Gyeongwonjeon is yet.

606
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,750
I shall be going now.

607
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,430
All right. Go on.

608
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,840
Thank you, Scholar Sir. Be careful on your way back.

609
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,010
Let us go inside.

610
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,180
Gyeongwonjeon: Pavillion where the rituals honoring the king's ancestors were held

611
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,690
This is where the royal portraits of King Gojo, King Gwangjo, and Hyejo,

612
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,850
and King Yeongjong are enshrined.

613
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,940
It is Gyeongwonjeon.

614
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,590
Master Painter Sir.

615
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,230
Why have you brought me here?

616
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:38,800
Do you know what the last painting that your father, Eun Oh, drew was?

617
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,930
Wasn't it a royal portrait?

618
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,430
Yes.

619
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,000
The painting that you will work on each night from now on is that very royal portrait.

620
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,770
Pardon?

621
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:59,930
Only the most skillful of the Painting Bureau can paint a royal portrait.

622
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,180
And how dare I...

623
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:10,040
Carefully observe these royal portraits.

624
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,740
The lines depicting the facial features are fine and meticulous.

625
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,770
Other than the wrinkles and the contour of the royal face, strong brush lines are sparingly used.

626
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:23,700
Countless brushstrokes were applied around the eyes, nose bridge and curves of the cheeks

627
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,710
for vivid portrayals.

628
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:31,500
This type of brushstroke is very delicate and the color matches that of the face, so that the brush mark is not prominent.

629
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,880
I see.

630
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,280
It is truly remarkable line drawing.

631
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,430
This is the secret behind the portrait painting technique,

632
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:46,200
capturing even the soul and character through the power of line drawing.

633
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,660
Portrait painting technique...

634
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,040
It is a technique you must necessarily master to capture all elements of the person in a portrait.

635
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,280
Also, the doctrine about the hair.

636
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,240
It says that even a hair wrongly drawn would mean it is not the same person.

637
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,470
So it is a given that you must depict realistically.

638
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:08,040
You must realize the art of portrait drawing and render even the model's character and inner world in the picture.

639
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,920
Do you understand?

640
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,930
Master Painter Sir.

641
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,920
I have never even drawn a portrait before.

642
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,000
Cheon Gi, you can do it.

643
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,290
Just as your father did.

644
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,780
Is the royal portrait that Father painted also here?

645
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:08,910
Is this... the royal portrait that Father painted?

646
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,430
But... why is the painting...

647
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:18,380
Nineteen years ago, there was a fire at Gyeongwonjeon.

648
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:25,200
It was then... that King Yeongjong's royal portrait that your father painted was burned.

649
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,500
This is the royal portrait that you will paint.

650
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,640
You must restore this burnt royal portrait.

651
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,120
What is the matter?

652
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,680
Are you all right?

653
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,220
Yes, I'm all right.

654
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,160
What is...

655
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,410
This won't do. Let's leave this place for now.

656
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,450
So, are you feeling better now?

657
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,090
Yes.

658
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:24,540
Master Painter, a portrait is to capture a person exactly as they are.

659
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,100
So how must I paint now that the royal portrait was burned?

660
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,910
You shall observe King Haejo's royal portrait to copy the royal body first.

661
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,480
Afterward, the royal face of the predecessor King Yeongjong,

662
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,850
shall be drawn through chusa*.
(remembrance of the dead)

663
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:41,970
Chusa?

664
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,950
You shall paint while listening to the description of the royal face.

665
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:49,680
As you saw, the royal portrait of King Yeongjong cannot be copied since it was destroyed.

666
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,070
Someone will help you with chusa.

667
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,000
This is where you will work.

668
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,800
Who is he?

669
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,750
Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

670
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,950
Are you surprised?

671
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,860
Why is Your Highness...

672
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,450
Did I not tell you that I saw Royal Grandfather's portrait before?

673
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,200
I shall even describe the number of Royal Grandfather's beard strands.

674
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,650
So do not worry.

675
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,040
Do you truly remember everything?

676
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,000
I trust you will do well even if I give you the wrong description.

677
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,220
You are Painter Hong, after all.

678
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,570
Now, sit here respectfully.

679
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,230
Yes, sir.

680
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,530
You shall work here for the next two to three days

681
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,950
to draw a study of the royal portrait.

682
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,490
All the oiled jukcheongji*, charcoal, ink, and delicate brushes needed
(paper for drawing portraits)

683
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,570
for your practice work are here in this room.

684
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,000
Since today is your first day, practice the folds of the clothes.

685
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,180
Of course, you must paint in a solemn and respectful mood.

686
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,930
Yes, sir.

687
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,480
So...

688
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,600
will Your Highness be here the whole time?

689
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,410
Yes, there is no way around it now.

690
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:20,590
We shall be together like this every night, so grow used to it.

691
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,130
Every night?

692
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,660
What is the matter? Are you all right?

693
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,900
What is it again?

694
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,650
Pardon?

695
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,870
I think I left something at Gyeongwonjeon.

696
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,290
I will be right back.

697
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,640
[Seventy-five]

698
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,530
A guest star has appeared near the Samtae* constellation.
(three stars belonging to the Big Dipper)

699
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,720
Did the guest star linger?

700
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,080
It seems it will.

701
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,430
What is the meaning of this?

702
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:21,200
It means someone important in the palace will die or be in grave danger.

703
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,070
I was here with the Painting Bureau's Master Painter Han just now.

704
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,630
Could I go in for one moment?

705
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,310
Not without a pass.

706
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,830
Oh, well...

707
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,750
- I left something inside—
- Maiden.

708
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,690
Scholar Sir?

709
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,100
Is everything all right?

710
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,640
Pardon?

711
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,080
I left something important in Gyeongwonjeon.

712
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,320
Let us through.

713
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,520
It will only be a moment.

714
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,940
You must come out quickly.

715
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,380
- We will.
- Thank you.

716
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,730
- Thank you.
- Let us go in.

717
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,460
All right.

718
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,500
But why were you here?

719
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,270
Ah, well, Master Painter Han Geon...

720
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,880
told me he would teach me how to paint a royal portrait.

721
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,870
The royal portrait of King Yeongjong...

722
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,830
One moment, I will look for it quickly.

723
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,990
My eyes.

724
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,270
My eyes.

725
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,450
They are my eyes.

726
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,370
My eyes.

727
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,650
My eyes.

728
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,820
They are my eyes.

729
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,240
My eyes.

730
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,650
Are you certain he is Ma Wang?

731
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,770
Congratulations, Your Highness.

732
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:47,120
It is certain Ma Wang is inside that Supervisor Ha.

733
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,740
The royal shaman?

734
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,290
Where is she right now?

735
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,680
She is preparing to summon Ma Wang.

736
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:59,030
Has my time finally come?

737
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,220
I have found it, Scholar Sir.

738
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,500
Scholar Sir!

739
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,640
What is the matter?

740
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,580
Do you have a headache again?

741
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,550
We must leave this place first.

742
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,400
This way.

743
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,200
Are you all right?

744
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,910
Scholar Sir?

745
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,720
Scholar Sir, are you all right?

746
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,650
Scholar Sir?

747
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,100
Scholar Sir, pull yourself together! Scholar Sir!

748
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,600
Scholar Sir, are you all right?

749
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,720
Scholar Sir!

750
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,890
Could it be?

751
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,010
Has Ma Wang emerged already?

752
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,420
I must find him quickly.

753
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,230
Scholar Sir, are you all right? Scholar Sir!

754
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,260
Scholar Sir!

755
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,330
Painter Hong! What has kept you?

756
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,990
- Your Highness.
- Are you all right?

757
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,530
Yes.

758
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:24,810
♫ Now I will not let go of our love ♫

759
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:28,490
♫ which hurt and hurts and was so ardent ♫

760
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,460
♫ Beside you I will protect you ♫

761
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,570
♫ The world is filled with the fragrance ♫

762
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:39,400
♫ of one person who is you ♫

763
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:48,200
♫ Deep in my heart the only person is just you ♫

764
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,550
♫ Those times that were too painful from deep despair ♫

765
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,460
Lovers of the Red Sky

766
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,390
We have searched for Ma Wang for twenty years.

767
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,130
Have someone follow Yangmyeong.

768
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,760
You are very dear to me, Scholar Sir.

769
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,640
Could Supervisor Ha also be connected to the incident of the royal guards' corpses at Inwang Mountain?

770
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,960
It seems the time has come for you to know everything.

771
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,330
I wish you do not see Painter Hong for a while.

772
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,310
You mean I should eliminate Yul?

773
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,520
What can I help you with?

774
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,960
I must become king.

775
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,670
The future of this nation's royal family is at your hands.

776
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:22,320
You must never paint the royal portrait!

777
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:31,410
♫ Deep within it, there is only you ♫

778
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:37,380
Lovers of the Red Sky
