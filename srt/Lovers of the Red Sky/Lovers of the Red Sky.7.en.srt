1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,070
Lovers of the Red Sky

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,090
Kim Yoo Jung, Ahn Hyo Seob

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,090
Gong Myung, Kwak Si Yang

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,000
Lovers of the Red Sky

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,700
The characters and settings of this drama are fictional and have no connection to historical facts.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,040
I have seen this nation's future

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,630
in the painters gathered here today.

8
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,480
This painting contest

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,790
was more challenging and tiring than any other.

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,290
You have all done well.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,960
With this

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,070
the Maejukheon Painting Contest ends.

13
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,170
Lord Ha Seong Jin! You must run, my lord!

14
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,450
Oh, dear!

15
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,250
Your Highness.

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,390
I shall stop Ma Wang!

17
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,470
Do not look him in the eyes!

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,410
My lord!

19
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,670
Father!

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,620
Is that not Eun Oh?

21
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,720
Father!

22
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,470
- Father!
- What is this ruckus!

23
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,400
Eun Oh! Eun Oh!

24
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,460
Grand Prince Juhyang, please have mercy.

25
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,870
He is my father.

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,770
He has done this because he is not mentally well.

27
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,440
Please show mercy this once.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,770
- Forgive us, Your Highness.
- Your Highness, just this once—

29
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,260
Apologies, Hyeong-nim.

30
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,200
Everything that happens at Maejukheon is my responsibility.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,570
If you wish to hold someone responsible, it should be me.

32
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,630
Yul.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,850
If you are the host of Maejukheon, act accordingly.

34
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,110
Hyeong-nim.

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,370
Do you understand this is a crime worthy of death?

36
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,050
Yes. I was the one who committed the crime and deserves to die, Your Highness.

37
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,090
If you acknowledge your father's crime,

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,080
it is the child's duty to take the punishment for him.

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,940
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,330
If the father could not control himself because he was mad,

41
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,880
the child can take the punishment in his place.

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,850
Isn't that right?

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,450
This is my last act of grand mercy.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,480
Answer me.

45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,680
Would you receive the punishment in your father's place?

46
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,350
Yes, Your Highness.

47
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,400
- Hyeong-nim—
- Act like a prince, Grand Prince Yangmyeong!

48
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,700
Should you try to argue with me now,

49
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,870
it will be because of this painter.

50
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,830
If you still insist on stepping forward,

51
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,380
my anger will only grow.

52
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,870
The painter's father, who could have had his life spared,

53
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,910
as if it were a mistake, could die.

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,100
What do you think of that?

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,850
Will you give up even your talented wrist?

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,240
Yes, Your Highness.

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,820
I will gladly accept any punishment.

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,250
I understand it is out of my place,

59
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,760
but it is a waste of the 300 seoks of rice.

60
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,420
I have bought your painting for 300 seoks of rice because you were talented.

61
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,030
Do you not know your place?

62
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,900
Grand Prince Yangmyeong.

63
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,540
I cannot give 300 seoks of rice to a painter with such an insolent father.

64
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,920
But I cannot take back the goods that have already left my hands.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,690
Grand Prince Juhyang.

66
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,480
I failed to differentiate between a good and a foolish painter because of my blindness

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,130
and caused Your Highness distress.

68
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,070
I would like to offer you the 300 seoks as an apology.

69
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,190
Please accept it.

70
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,900
Supervisor Ha.

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
Did Hyeong-nim not say multiple times?

72
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Do not get involved.

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,600
However, I am also concerned by Supervisor Ha's plight.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
Hyeong-nim.

75
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,740
How about accepting Supervisor Ha's offer with your vast mercy?

76
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,830
Supervisor Ha.

77
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,890
Would you sacrifice anything for this woman painter?

78
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,480
What is your command?

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,670
I shall repay you for my foolishness.

80
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,210
I see.

81
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,780
I shall overlook it because of Supervisor Ha's earnest pleas.

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,930
I shall send word soon.

83
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,400
I shall look forward to that day, Your Highness.

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,770
Should Grand Prince Yangmyeong discard his dignity as a prince

85
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,720
and involve himself with matters like this again,

86
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,340
I shall hold you responsible then.

87
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,710
Yes, Hyeong-nim.

88
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,890
Forgive me.

89
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,910
Get up.

90
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,960
- Hey, hey.
- Get up.

91
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,510
Father...

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,320
Father?

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,960
- Father.
- Painter Choi Jeong.

94
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,200
- Father.
- Move out of the way.

95
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,700
Thank you, Supervisor Ha.

96
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,960
You have done well.

97
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,670
We shall discuss this matter another time.

98
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,740
Yes, Your Highness.

99
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,190
- I must speak with you.
- Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,100
Episode 7: Reunion

101
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,330
Painter Hong did not hesitate to paint imitations

102
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,810
to earn money for her ill father's medicine even as a child.

103
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,110
So that is how it is.

104
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,270
Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,310
That is so.

106
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,690
That was so.

107
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,120
That was surely what happened.

108
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,750
Lord Ha Seong Jin! You must run, My Lord!

109
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,850
I shall stop Ma Wang!

110
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,670
Do not look him in the eyes!

111
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,940
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,020
I will gladly accept any punishment.

113
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,550
Would you sacrifice anything for this woman painter?

114
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,400
I shall send word soon.

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,910
Sir.

116
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,840
You are here.

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,970
Yes, Sir.

118
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,850
Have you investigated the paintings from the second round?

119
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,570
Can they be bought through auction?

120
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,010
According to what I have found,

121
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,180
all the paintings from the second round will be owned by

122
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,540
Grand Prince Yangmyeong as the host of the contest.

123
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,030
I see.

124
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,420
Should I obtain them on behalf of Wolseongdang?

125
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,140
What happened to Jeong Soen Nae?

126
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,800
I have locked him in Wolseongdang.

127
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,250
Please spare my life.

128
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,260
I was planning to leave with my brothers—

129
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,530
Do not bother the woman painter Hong Cheon Gi further

130
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,290
and wash away your evil relationship with her with that silver.

131
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,340
How does Master know about Hong Cheon Gi?

132
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,250
No more questions.

133
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,460
Should you break the agreement with me,

134
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,510
- it will not end with just a warning.
- Yes!

135
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,100
Do not worry, Master!

136
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,360
It is time to meet the inquisitor.

137
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,020
Your Excellency, why...

138
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,830
- Why are you doing this?
- Did you think His Highness would not know?

139
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,730
Or how long did you think you could

140
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,200
hide your loyalty to His Majesty?

141
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,550
Get him.

142
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,220
Everything is the will of the heavens.

143
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,550
Do not blame me.

144
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,030
Father.

145
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,480
I shall repay them exactly

146
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,900
in the same way as they wronged you.

147
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,840
Royal Inquisitor Kim Gong Rye

148
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,420
Kim Gong Rye

149
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,240
The King

150
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,820
Grand Prince Juhyang

151
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,190
Grand Prince Yangmyeong

152
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,420
Mi Su

153
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,150
You are next.

154
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,710
Mi Su

155
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,580
Are you the person who called the highest bid at the auction, Supervisor Ha?

156
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,940
How did you recognize a divine painting?

158
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,830
Have you perhaps begun to see even a little?

159
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,090
Unfortunately, my eyes do not seem to be improving.

160
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,910
But my attendant described them by drawing them on my hand.

161
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,010
And listening to the judge's evaluation

162
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,030
was as if the painting was drawn in front of my eyes.

163
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,420
It made me covet it.

164
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,540
I would like to see that painter's painting soon.

165
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,600
Let us hurry.

166
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,300
The plum blossoms...

167
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,740
look to be enduring the cold moonlight

168
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,490
as it portrays strict and upright fidelity.

169
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,720
This is the painting that surprised everyone

170
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,570
when a real butterfly landed on it.

171
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,990
The technique of this painting is lustrous

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,610
and the brushstrokes are exquisite.

173
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,710
The aura is indeed incredible.

174
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,290
An unexplainable aura exudes the more I look at it.

175
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,020
It is a divine painting.

176
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,750
My, this painting...

177
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,200
This painting depicts the butterflies chasing the scent of petals

178
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,190
stirred by the horse hooves after the horses have passed.

179
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,360
It is so lively and realistic that I can see and hear it.

180
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,620
In the time of the crown prince's illness

181
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,140
and my uncertainty,

182
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,660
this painting has given me great comfort.

183
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,060
As was the reason for hosting the Maejukheon Painting Contest,

184
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,850
she is a painter who achieved her place

185
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,900
not through status and rank, but only through her skills.

186
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,650
Although she is a woman, her skill is exceptional as displayed here.

187
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,630
Is it not right to admit her to the Painting Bureau?

188
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,430
Have her assist you by your side and bring you solace.

189
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,530
This is the painter that you have been searching for, Royal Father.

190
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,970
Is that so?

191
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,260
You are not the one who wishes to have her by your side?

192
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,880
Pardon?

193
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,200
I mentioned this to ease your concern

194
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,270
of finding a divine painter, Your Majesty.

195
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,490
I was jesting.

196
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,330
Let's do that.

197
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,660
This is my command in this place.

198
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Admit Painter Hong Cheon Gi to the Painting Bureau and for three months,

199
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,260
she will work at the Painting Bureau by day

200
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,370
and work on restoring King Yeongjong's royal portrait by night.

201
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,300
Thank you for your graciousness.

202
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,300
A divine painter to restore King Yeongjong's royal portrait?

203
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,260
I shall be going now.

204
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,760
Farewell, Master Han.

205
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,230
Your Highness.

206
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,830
Wait.

207
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,180
One moment, Supervisor Ha.

208
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,090
It will only take a moment.

209
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,830
Here.

210
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,160
Supervisor Ha.

211
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,800
I have something to ask you regarding the woman painter, Hong Cheon Gi.

212
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,380
Yes. Ask anything, Your Highness.

213
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,120
Right.

214
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,520
So, are you...

215
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,870
quite close with Painter Hong?

216
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,860
I met her for the first time at the paint-making house.

217
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,080
When Painter Hong brought the list to Maejukheon,

218
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,830
the air was quite charged between Your Highness and Painter Hong.

219
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,290
So I had meant to ask you about it.

220
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,880
Quiet!

221
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,540
What are you talking about?

222
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,950
- We are not like that yet.
- Yet?

223
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,560
You say?

224
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,640
No, I mean...

225
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,930
What am I saying...

226
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,250
One may try to conceal a scent, but it travels far and wide.

227
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:27,070
I have grown an interest in her as a painter.

228
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,160
Get going now.

229
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,140
I hear His Majesty was searching for a divine painter.

230
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,140
And His Majesty commanded the admission of the winner of the painting contest,

231
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,790
Hong Cheon Gi, to the Painting Bureau.

232
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,270
A divine painter.

233
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,760
Was that the reason for this Maejukheon Painting Contest?

234
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,080
There has to be a reason His Majesty is searching for a divine painter.

235
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,620
That painter's father spoke of Ma Wang.

236
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,220
He knows Ma Wang for certain.

237
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,520
But...

238
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,580
why did Father accept that woman's admission into the Painting Bureau?

239
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,800
It seems we will have to investigate the reason.

240
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,380
Do you have a plan?

241
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,300
Sim Dae Yu.

242
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,570
He is the man who competed with Hong Cheon Gi until the end.

243
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,990
Him?

244
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,500
How?

245
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,510
By black enchantment.

246
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:55,280
We shall stick the thorn of a citron tree dipped with his blood into a straw doll and enchant it.

247
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,770
♫ You say... ♫

248
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,780
♫ you will go without me... ♫

249
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,470
Once we get the black enchantment to bind to him,

250
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,780
we can control his actions whenever and wherever.

251
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,040
Thus, he becomes my moving doll.

252
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,930
We shall put him close to the divine painter.

253
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,510
So we can find out what the divine painter

254
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,980
that His Majesty sought after is up to.

255
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,100
But is it not dangerous to carry out such dark enchantment?

256
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:56,730
Yes. Dark enchantment puts the person putting out the spell in danger as well.

257
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,710
But no harm will come to Your Highness.

258
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,040
Have you found the medicine?

259
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,630
I almost did, but

260
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,950
- now it seems unlikely.
- Oh, my...

261
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,080
Apparently, an illegal trade ship is coming in from Yeon Empire at Yeowunpo.

262
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,670
You might be able to find it there.

263
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,500
I don't even have any money.

264
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,910
How unfortunate.

265
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,050
We are running out of time.

266
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,260
H-how much does it cost?

267
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,560
At least three hundred seoks of rice, for sure.

268
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,710
Th-three hundred?

269
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,350
Give him the herbal decoction I made three times a day

270
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,320
and he will hold on for now.

271
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,770
All right.

272
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,510
- Have a safe trip back home.
- I will.

273
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,270
Cheon Gi.

274
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:38,110
It seems I have been wrong all this time.

275
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,340
About what?

276
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,800
I shall take care of Eun Oh.

277
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,700
You should go to the Painting Bureau.

278
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,440
What do you mean?

279
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,050
His Majesty has commanded that you enter the Painting Bureau

280
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,150
as the winner of the Maejukheon Painting Contest.

281
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,020
How could I leave my ill father?

282
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,170
I shall plead with him and tell him I cannot go.

283
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:13,050
My goodness. Do you think you can put it off like that?

284
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,880
I cannot leave the house when Father may not live another day.

285
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,850
Fine, don't go.

286
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,810
Even if you go to the Painting Bureau...

287
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,290
See, what did I tell you?

288
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,460
I told you it would not end well if you go to the contest and others notice you!

289
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,080
Still, if Father hadn't appeared that day,

290
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,010
I could have earned the cheongsimwon.

291
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,510
T-that is... true.

292
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,710
How about joining the Painting Bureau for now and looking for a solution while working as a painter?

293
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,770
Headmaster, are you asking me to go or not?

294
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,440
- Will you go?
- No, I won't.

295
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,270
-Then don't go.
- Headmaster!

296
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,730
Did she say she would join the Painting Bureau?

297
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,430
I desperately tried to convince her,

298
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,030
but she continues to insist that she will not go.

299
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,910
Anyhow, why didn't you come inside?

300
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,810
Even after Eun Oh fell ill, I was too occupied with myself

301
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,320
and couldn't look after him.

302
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,790
I did not even know that he had a daughter named Cheon Gi.

303
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,530
How could I sit there without shame?

304
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,290
If she joins the Painting Bureau,

305
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,340
I will pay her back for what I failed to do.

306
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,930
Look, Geon.

307
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,800
The thing is, Cheon Gi is quite determined.

308
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,050
Once she sets her mind on something, she is unfalteringly devoted to it.

309
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,170
Even if it means she has to jump into the river water with her painting,

310
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,190
she will not join the Painting Bureau.

311
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,650
We can no longer hide her skills, now that the whole world knows about her.

312
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,540
We cannot stop her fate as a painter.

313
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,000
Why are you telling me that?

314
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,310
I didn't say anything.

315
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,670
Because you seem unwilling.

316
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,440
Do you plan to go against His Majesty's solemn order?

317
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,010
How could I dare defy His Majesty's orders?

318
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,960
However, it does indeed worry me.

319
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,810
What will you do...

320
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,980
if she becomes like Eun Oh?

321
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,410
What happened to Eun Oh was an accident.

322
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,180
Cheon Gi will be different.

323
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,190
I will protect her.

324
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,720
Once she paints the same paintings every day at the Painting Bureau,

325
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,710
the dangerous skill you worry about will disappear.

326
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,020
Have you forgotten?

327
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,740
Eun Oh also painted the same paintings every day at the Painting Bureau?

328
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,870
Your Highness, Master Han is here.

329
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,220
So, have you met with her?

330
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,510
How is Painter Hong?

331
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,330
Is the date set for her arrival at the Painting Bureau?

332
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,860
It seems it will take more time.

333
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,070
More time?

334
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,470
She seems hesitant to leave her mentally ill father

335
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,310
to work at the Painting Bureau.

336
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,100
She would go against the king's wishes to look after her father.

337
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,260
What a devoted daughter.

338
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,440
The man who threw an ink brush at Hyeong-nim

339
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,080
is the royal portrait painter Hong Eun Oh?

340
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,290
Yes, Your Highness.

341
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:40,770
So she looked after her father alone for a long time.

342
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,430
A mentally ill father...

343
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,000
must not be easy for her.

344
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,250
Indeed.

345
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,160
The Big Dipper is exceptionally bright tonight.

346
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,890
I told you to observe the stars, not enjoy them.

347
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,020
Is that so?

348
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,340
Supervisor, welcome.

349
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,950
After your disappearance last time,

350
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,820
the superintendent has warned me not to let Supervisor Ha come to the Astronomy Tower.

351
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,760
Do not scold me too much.

352
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,500
It is my life's only joy to see the stars.

353
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,820
Yes, sir.

354
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,260
How was the Maejukheon painting contest?

355
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,340
Everyone is saying that it truly pushed the boundaries of the contest.

356
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,460
It was a contest disregarding status and rank, where the contestants competed only with painting skills.

357
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,600
It was quite a special contest.

358
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,410
Disregarding status...

359
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,570
Then, were there any eye-catching paintings—

360
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,210
Forgive me.

361
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,880
There was... a painting that remained in my memory.

362
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,940
Smelling of peach blossoms.

363
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,750
Look, there's the Big Dipper.

364
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,080
Is it there?

365
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,420
The sky that night.

366
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,540
♫ The once clouded moon shines upon us ♫

367
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:43,280
♫ Our love hurt so and our love was earnest ♫

368
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,030
♫ I won't let go anymore ♫

369
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,860
♫ I will protect you by your side ♫

370
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,100
♫ The only one in the world ♫

371
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,640
♫ My heart is full of your scent ♫

372
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,190
♫ Deep within it ♫

373
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,050
♫ There is only you ♫

374
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,740
Painter Hong.

375
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,150
Huh?

376
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,900
Your Highness!

377
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,770
Why are you so surprised?

378
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,530
Why is Your Highness...

379
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,870
I happened to find out about your father, Painter Hong Eun Oh.

380
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,280
Apologies, Your Highness.

381
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,790
I have been a big nuisance to you.

382
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,920
I do not know how to make up for it...

383
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,920
It is all right.

384
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,100
You know, in this world, there are painters who can breathe divine energy

385
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,290
into their paintings, even when they draw the same thing as any other painter.

386
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,400
By chance... can you guess who is such a painter?

387
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,380
It is Painter Hong.

388
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,960
Pardon?

389
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,730
Besides me, is there another person named Hong?

390
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,220
Who is it?

391
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,650
Me?

392
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,950
But weren't you the one who scolded me for not finding my own style...

393
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,010
I am glad you finally recognized my talent.

394
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,600
You truly have no humility.

395
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,890
What is that?

396
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,100
Is it something you eat?

397
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,320
I do not know such a thing.

398
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,510
So I am asking you...

399
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,560
to use that skill for me, for this nation.

400
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,040
At the Painting Bureau.

401
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,090
- Your Highness, the truth is—
- I understand.

402
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,500
You cannot join the Painting Bureau because of your father's mental illness.

403
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,940
Is that what you wish to say?

404
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,200
So I shall look after him.

405
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,530
Pardon?

406
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,600
I, of the royal blood of this nation,

407
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,220
shall look after your father with care.

408
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,120
You do not have to.

409
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,110
I am not so shameless.

410
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,970
It is not a simple gesture of good will.

411
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,510
Have you ever thought of the reason why your father became mentally ill?

412
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,370
By chance, do you know the reason?

413
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,940
When I was young,

414
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,590
I was amazed at Royal Grandfather's portrait at Gyeongwonjeon.

415
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,610
The portrait was drawn by a divine painter

416
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,320
and my royal father is still searching for the descendant of that painter.

417
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:27,090
That divine painter is your father, Painter Hong.

418
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,370
Perhaps your father...

419
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,600
became mentally ill while painting Royal Grandfather's portrait.

420
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,330
That is my suspicion.

421
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,760
Why do you think so?

422
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,360
After I saw that painting,

423
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,780
I mean, the royal portrait, when I was young,

424
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
for a while, I could not collect myself.

425
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,550
It was as if I could not be myself.

426
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,930
I felt that way after only looking at the painting.

427
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,820
Then how about your father who drew it?

428
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,940
What do you say?

429
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,360
Will you join the Painting Bureau and investigate the truth with me?

430
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,890
Han Geon and me,

431
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,540
and even the headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute

432
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,720
will constantly look after your father.

433
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,980
You are not banned from seeing your father.

434
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:44,000
After your work at the Painting Bureau, you can visit him as you do now.

435
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,800
Well, but...

436
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,620
What about my wish?

437
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,070
The cheongsimwon...

438
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,120
Oh, regarding that.

439
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,200
I have personally ordered it from the Royal Physician's Office.

440
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,490
Is that true?

441
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,690
Is that indeed true?

442
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,620
Yes.

443
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,380
Thank you so much, Your Highness!

444
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,970
Thank you, thank you, Your Highness!

445
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,700
Thank you, truly—

446
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,670
Are you so grateful?

447
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,710
Yes.

448
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,460
I am truly grateful.

449
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,590
Then, do not worry about anything else.

450
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,790
Think about it...

451
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,630
until you come to Maejukheon tomorrow afternoon to collect the medicine.

452
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,930
Tomorrow afternoon?

453
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,630
Yes.

454
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,520
See you tomorrow then.

455
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,790
Yes, Your Highness.

456
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,560
Have a safe trip back home.

457
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,860
Han Geon and me,

458
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,530
and even the headmaster of Baegyu Painting Institute

459
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,870
will constantly look after your father.

460
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,210
My father is a divine painter?

461
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,830
Perhaps your father...

462
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,820
became mentally ill while painting Royal Grandfather's portrait.

463
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,440
What do you say?

464
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,960
Will you join the Painting Bureau and investigate the truth with me?

465
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,090
Father.

466
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,080
Cheon Gi.

467
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,430
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

468
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,260
Here, eat up. Tell me if you want more.

469
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,530
Thank you.

470
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,740
Thank you for the meal.

471
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,480
Headmaster.

472
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,280
What?

473
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,090
Have you still not held Gyeonju Daek's hand?

474
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,930
Well done!

475
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,030
You are too much.

476
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,960
Has it not been almost twenty years?

477
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,360
You cannot meet a woman like Gyeonju Daek easily anywhere.

478
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,200
Yes.

479
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,890
What?

480
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:18,190
Before you regret it, muster up the courage and make sure that you do what you want or must do.

481
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,410
Cheon Gi...

482
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,830
What are you talking about out of the blue?

483
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,280
Quit talking while eating and eat up.

484
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,680
That was good.

485
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,730
I have made up my mind.

486
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,780
About what?

487
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,400
I shall join the Painting Bureau.

488
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,190
- You have decided?
- Yes.

489
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm finished, so I shall get going first.

490
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,510
Go where?

491
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,810
Oh, well...

492
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,290
Grand Prince Yangmyeong said that he would obtain the medicine for Father.

493
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,910
I might as well tell him of my decision to join the Painting Bureau,

494
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,770
so I shall go to his place.

495
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,500
Grand Prince Yangmyeong has granted your wish?

496
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,670
Yes.

497
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,080
W-wait.

498
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,520
Here.

499
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,220
What is this?

500
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,530
This is...

501
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,800
Why did you put my tiger munbae* drawing on a silk scroll?
(Painting on doors/gates to drive out evil spirits in the new year)

502
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,840
It was a shame to throw it away after using it for the new year.

503
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,580
So I have held onto it.

504
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:57,500
Grand Prince Yangmyeong liked your paintings, so you should take it to him.

505
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,380
A human who does not know how to be grateful

506
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,810
is no different from an animal.

507
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,120
Headmaster!

508
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,900
Ow! I can't breathe!

509
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,400
Let me go.

510
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,450
I can't breathe, you lass.

511
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,650
- Aigoo.
- Thank you!

512
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,470
Do not forget.

513
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:33,790
You are a painter from Baegyu Painting Institute and my student.

514
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,760
I'm saying you are a part of Baegyu Painting Institute until the day you die.

515
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,390
Do you understand?

516
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,780
Headmaster.

517
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,050
How long will you go on like this?

518
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,970
It is not as if I can't leave anymore once I enter the Painting Bureau.

519
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,710
That is all.

520
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,840
What more can I say to you?

521
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,180
Hurry and go.

522
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,450
Go!

523
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,870
My.

524
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,570
I won't forget.

525
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,050
When everyone laughed at a blind child for painting,

526
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,820
you did not laugh.

527
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,320
When my eyes started to see, you were happy for me.

528
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,830
I used more ink and paper than anyone,

529
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,260
but you did not say anything.

530
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,290
And I won't forget that I am

531
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,220
a part of Baegyu Painting Institute where you are, Headmaster.

532
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,350
I will never...

533
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,500
never forget it.

534
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,710
Aigoo, Cheon Gi.

535
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,200
Goodness...

536
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,620
I shall be going now.

537
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,930
Cheon Gi!

538
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,140
Be well. We shall see you soon.

539
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,260
I hope nothing bad happens to her...

540
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,800
Cheon Gi will do well.

541
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,980
And...

542
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,290
What? Why?

543
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,340
What? Why are you looking at me like that—

544
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,570
I also want to be courageous.

545
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,410
Well, what courage...

546
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,470
- No way.
- Come here!

547
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,580
Grandma!

548
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,980
Show me your painting.

549
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,940
Pardon?

550
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,160
Oh, not this one.

551
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,790
This one already has an owner.

552
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,710
Come now.

553
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,610
The owner has changed.

554
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,010
Pardon?

555
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,020
This is all because of you...

556
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,190
That is all.

557
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,100
It will find its way now.

558
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,330
Pardon?

559
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,730
What do you mean by that?

560
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,680
She keeps trying to steal my painting...

561
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,010
What?

562
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,990
Grandma?

563
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,310
Where did she go?

564
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,550
She was just here.

565
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,820
Is this grandma a ghost or a human?

566
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,170
Goodness.

567
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,450
What?

568
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,320
I keep walking, but why do I keep ending up at the same house?

569
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,680
Am I beguiled by a ghost in the middle of the day?

570
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,330
Strange things keep happening every time I meet that grandma.

571
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,940
Anyone there?

572
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,020
Anyone here?

573
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,610
Pardon me.

574
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,490
Let me ask you something.

575
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,620
My.

576
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,320
What are you doing here?

577
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,540
You are the scholar's attendant.

578
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,130
What are you doing here?

579
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,010
This is Supervisor Ha's residence.

580
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,410
Of course, I should be here.

581
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,720
Pardon?

582
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,490
This is...

583
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,720
Supervisor Sir, you have stepped outside.

584
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,520
Yes, Man Su.

585
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,380
But this scent is...

586
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,230
By chance, do we have a guest?

587
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,890
Yes, sir.

588
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,880
It is me, Scholar Sir.

589
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,940
Have you been well?

590
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,170
Yes, I have been well.

591
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,660
But ... what brings you here to my home?

592
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,000
Ah, well...

593
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,020
I just happened to...

594
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,630
What a happy coincidence.

595
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,750
Because I had something to tell you.

596
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,030
Is that so?

597
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,660
We can talk inside.

598
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:27,960
I wanted to tell you that I am grateful

599
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,340
and I also wanted to apologize.

600
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:36,180
I won the contest due to your kindness

601
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,840
and my father's life was spared too.

602
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,920
It is too much gratitude for buying just one painting.

603
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,230
You spent as much as 300 seoks of rice on that one painting.

604
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,880
The auction incited the bidding war.

605
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,590
There is nothing you should apologize to me for.

606
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,750
It is your magnificent painting that won.

607
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:05,400
When Grand Prince Juyhang said that he would exact the price of my father's wrongdoing,

608
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,190
I regretted it.

609
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:12,140
I should not have attended the contest.

610
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,560
- I should not have won—
- We both...

611
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,850
did what we had to do.

612
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,860
I entered Maejukheon with the intention of buying a good painting.

613
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:34,130
And if I can see someday, I would like to see that painting for sure.

614
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,790
I did not do what I did just for you and your father.

615
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,420
Do not worry about it any longer.

616
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:48,500
Sir Scholar, how do you carry all that burden within your heart?

617
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,620
If the boy I knew had grown up,

618
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,690
I imagined he would be just like you.

619
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,350
I was mistaken.

620
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,480
That boy does not want me to recognize him.

621
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:23,800
So, I may not know the circumstances, but I will protect it.

622
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,450
Protect what?

623
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,700
If that boy does not want me to recognize him,

624
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:40,360
he is either dead or there must be a reason why he lives as if dead.

625
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,300
So I decided to live as if I didn't not know him.

626
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,010
Is that so.

627
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,730
However...

628
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:57,020
I shall remember this moment for a very long time.

629
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:02,230
The gratitude I feel right now, the delight in seeing him.

630
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,650
These thoughts.

631
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,020
Because of that, I think that those moments in the past

632
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,470
will remain as more pleasant memories, even if by a tiny bit.

633
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,800
At some point in your life...

634
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:32,540
if the day comes again when it becomes

635
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,830
too difficult to keep your promise,

636
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,460
do not forget then...

637
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,650
that there was someone

638
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,480
who believed in you

639
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,180
and waited for you.

640
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,630
Do not think too much of what I said.

641
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,990
I must be going.

642
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,400
Actually, I had another destination but got lost on the way.

643
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:36,410
♫ Do you see it? My feeling for you ♫

644
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:44,680
♫ Like destiny always cannot leave your side ♫

645
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:51,670
♫ On a day still like this, can you hug me? ♫

646
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:57,680
♫ I am waiting again just for you ♫

647
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,070
This will not do.

648
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,830
Do you plan to get rained on by all the rain in the world?

649
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,680
- Your Highness.
- Hold onto this.

650
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,350
Let's go.

651
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,300
Are you unwell?

652
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,530
I am all right.

653
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
You have a fever.

654
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,370
This will not do.

655
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,550
Get on my back.

656
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,120
Pardon?

657
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,470
It is all right, Your Highness. How dare I...

658
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,340
Come now. It is the order of a grand prince.

659
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,810
Hurry and get on my back.

660
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,410
But...

661
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,680
You are too light... even for a woman.

662
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:32,620
Your Highness, why are you so kind to me?

663
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,400
Because it aches.

664
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,700
Pardon?

665
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,570
Every time I see you, my heart aches.

666
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,800
We should first escape the rain.

667
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,310
Hold on a while longer.

668
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:16,280
♫ Whichever way the wind blows ♫

669
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,540
Aren't you Supervisor Ha?

670
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,940
Scholar Sir?

671
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,340
Forgive me, Your Highness.

672
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,640
But her promise to me was first.

673
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,420
♫ Just stay wherever you are ♫

674
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:46,590
♫ Am I it? The person who lives in your heart ♫

675
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:53,630
♫ The one person you long for endlessly? ♫

676
00:57:53,630 --> 00:58:01,700
♫ Even if you say it's not so or you hate me ♫

677
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:09,220
♫ I'll stay by your side like destiny ♫

678
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:17,720
♫ Even any day under the sun all day ♫

679
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:24,570
♫ Without you I've never been impressive ♫

680
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:31,440
♫ Without you, it won't do ♫

681
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,600
Lovers of the Red Sky

682
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,950
You have one month.

683
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,670
We must get on with restoring the abdicated king's portrait.

684
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,660
Royal Father.

685
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,200
I shall not have my place stolen ever again.

686
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,700
You must make certain of Ma Wang in Supervisor Ha's body.

687
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,410
I shall introduce the new painters.

688
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,080
At night, you will be assigned to another task with me.

689
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,590
Grand Prince Yangmyeong?

690
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,270
Why is Your Highness...

691
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,880
We shall be together like this every night, so grow used to it.

692
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,130
Every night?

693
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:03,980
Will Your Highness get her in trouble with your reckless curiosity?

694
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,710
Is a person's destiny decided at birth?

695
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,100
In the world I live in, yes.

696
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,220
Then, isn't it pointless for people to strive in life?

697
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,520
Forgive me, Your Highness.

698
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,390
I cannot let Cheon Gi go like this.

699
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,210
♫ I can't live even for a day without crying ♫

700
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,180
♫ If only you are here ♫

701
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:32,180
Lovers of the Red Sky
