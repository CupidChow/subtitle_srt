4
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,000
The information is fine.
The donor committed suicide.

5
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,590
Oh, why do you do this at such a young age?

6
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,759
That is to say

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,220
Where's the surgeon?

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,590
I am coming

9
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,300

10
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,180
What is the status?

11
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,180
Need to be removed now

12
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,930
What is the situation

13
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,140
Is this a tattoo?

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,190
-tatoo? -tatoo

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,320
- I think I've seen it somewhere.
- I also think I've seen it somewhere.

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,320
I seem to have seen it in a history book.

I've said it several times, it doesn't hurt

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,686
This is no way to defeat the original body.

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,050
I was supposed to vomit and drool.

47
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,970
Because a strange heart has
entered the body. This entry

48
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,180
Stand firm on your feet

49
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,760
You're abnormal.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,179
Isn't it a good thing to not feel any pain?

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,850
Yes.

52
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,140
No pain is a good thing.

53
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,429
But it may not be a good thing, so I...

54
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,100
So please let me leave the hospital.

55
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
If it doesn't hurt, you'll have to act.

56
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,820
What's on your wrist? Do you have a tattoo?

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,660
No, I don't know if this is
a side effect of the surgery.

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,490
Did you make some bad friends?

59
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,779
Where do my friends come from?

60
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Don't lose your temper and eat slowly

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,580
Look, my heart rate is over 90.

62
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,710
Besides

63
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,380
Don't buy this stuff

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,940
- You have no money again.
- Why does your father have no money?

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,396
If you want to make something
or eat something, just ask.

66
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,436
I have something I want to do

67
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,130
Even though

68
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,730
- I want to go back to Taekwondo. - No.

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
Didn't you let me just say it?

70
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,156
No, Taekwondo is definitely
not allowed. It's dangerous.

71
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,866
The doctor clearly said that
I could exercise moderately.

72
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,099
What do doctors know?
Only your father and I know

73
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,156
Why should I get a heart
transplant if I can't even exercise?

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,809
If you really want to exercise,
you can go to college and do Pilates.

75
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,100
- Dad. - Your dad.

76
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,666
My heart stops beating when I
think of you in the middle of a race

77
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,030
Sleeping can be scared to death

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,450
Your mother

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Your mother also had a heart attack.

80
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,530
Your grandfather also
died of a heart attack.

81
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,540
If even my child is
like this, I, as a father,

82
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,080
It's better to just follow along.

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,110
Organs are not batteries.
This is the first time

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,110
This time it's the pancreas

91
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,620
Anyway, fortunately, my father
should be able to leave this time.

92
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,370
Anyway

93
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,700
I'll hand it all over.

94
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,460

Give me some grilled meat

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,390
Okay, be more moderate.

102
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,100
Reach out

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
- Dad. - No.

104
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,926
- I haven't said it yet.
- Taekwondo is definitely not an option

105
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,070
No, I'm not saying this.

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,800
Did you exercise in PE class? I
can see your heart rate is rising.

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,426
- I didn't exercise.
- Then why did your heart rate increase?

109
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,580
What is

110
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:42,040
I really am. If you do this
again, I will throw this away.

111
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,340
I'm going to be a designated driver today

112
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,840
You go back first

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,970
Buy a new pair of shoes on the way back

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,946
If you have money, buy some
healthy food with your friends.

115
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,390
Okay, that's all for today.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,020
I don't have any friends

117
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,310

118
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,060
You are late today, so I will punish you.

119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,730

122
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,820
I was just about to explain it to you.

123
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,660
Oh, look at this kid.

124
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,740
Boy, are you kicking like that
to pick a fight or to make friends?

125
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,806
Sister, when I was your age

126
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,580
You can do a 540 turn now. Let's go.

127
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,000
I said this for your own good.

128
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,840
Keep your center of gravity

129
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,000
Stare at your target

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,470
Zhong Bi, you did this.

131
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,680
What happened?

160

Is this possible just because
I received a pancreas donation?

161
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,260
Then I'll accept it once.

162
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,930
So I think

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
Anyway, this

164
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Maybe the donor has a special physique.

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,420
Is he an exhibitionist,
a stalker, or a kidnapper?

180
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,220
All three are crimes

181
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,680
Arm Hello Arm

182
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
My Arm

183
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,010
arm

184
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,440
The heart is really strong.

185
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,286
I think I need to go to the doctor
to get a diagnosis certificate.

186
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,650
Such a big guy was gently grabbed
by a female junior high school student

187
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,189
Why does a female junior high
school student have such a tone?

188
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,780
Because my grandfather raised
me when I was learning to speak

189
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
You don't know the
extent of your ability yet.

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,530
I thought my growth
disk was opened too fast.

191
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,056
Who would have thought
this was a super power?

192
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,040
- Does your mother know?
- I don't have a mother.

193
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Do you have a dad?

194
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,290
Dad has

195
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,646
If he knew this, he would probably
cry for three days and two nights.

196
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,670
Then he made a scene, so I
absolutely couldn't tell him

197
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
well done

198
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,050
Super powers are
supposed to be kept secret.

199
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,300
So what secret superpower do you have?

200
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,460
But who is the donor who has such ability?

201
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,396
Did you know that a person
can donate six organs?

202
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,090
Have no idea

203
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,300
Heart Lungs Cornea Kidneys Liver Pancreas

204
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,566
It means there are four other
people besides the two of us.

205
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,156
If we find the other four transplant
recipients, we'll probably have some clues.

206
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,140
How to find it?

207
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:54,430
-= "The 17th Share Hope Transplant Sports Meet" was held at
Shengwangli=- The 17th Sharing Life Transplant Sports Conference

Held today in Seoul

209
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,400
The National Transplant Sports
Conference is held every two years

210
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,650
Prospective transplant
recipients and their families

211
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,940
A total of about 100 people participated

212
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,359
Huang Zaiyuan, President
of the Transplant Association

213
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,370

-=The 17th Sharing Hope Transplant Games=-

Run well, this is the track

Nike

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,310
I just need shoes.

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,670
Have you looked carefully?

221
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,270
No No

222
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Hey, take it away.

223
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,449
Look for it carefully.

224
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,410
Why do you look at your phone every day?

225
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,520
Uncle, you don't have any friends, right?

226
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,969
Why do we need friends?

227
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,690
Try this

228
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,329
No, this is a free tasting.

229
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,919
I'm very healthy after my kidney transplant

230
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,240
I give it to you because I am so grateful.

231
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,520
Good for the stomach

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,420
Thanks

233
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,010
What is there?

234
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,999
If you have a bad stomach

235
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,909
It contains prebiotics and probiotics

236
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,820
Can clean the stomach

237
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,869
-Vitamins and vegetables -Auntie

238
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,870
Look at your arms.

239
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Arm?

240
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
The other arm

241
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,300
What happened to your arm?

242
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,139
- No apple flavor? - Yes.

243
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,999
But if you eat too much of
this, your stomach will hurt.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,379
Ah, we still have food and salad.

245
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,369
Salads are 5% cheaper
if delivered regularly

246
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,250
Let me show you what's going on.

247
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,230
I ran fast after my heart transplant

248
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,140
Like this, my strength has also increased.

249
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,800
This man received a lung transplant.

250
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Show it

draft beer! Hit the target every time from 7pm to 10pm =-

252
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,839

253

Feed Dried fish

254
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,640
What is that?

255
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,730
Auntie, what are you capable of?

256
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,089
Me

257
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,650
No

258
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,699
Did you experience any
changes after the surgery?

259
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,569
Although I can't see

260
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,629
But everyone says my skin has improved.

261
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,320
Become beautiful

262
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,490
Oh, how am I beautiful?

263
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,250
Is it a superpower to become beautiful?

264
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,309
-Being beautiful is a superpower
nowadays -It's not to that extent

265
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,570
No

266
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,659
Recently many people pretend to buy Yakult

267
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,500
You always ask me for my number?

268
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,586
They all say they think of their first love
I said no.

269
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,660
Please use slowly

270
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,580
Auntie, don't you have a tattoo?

271
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,060
If you have a tattoo

272
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,049
It must be a superpower. It
seems you haven't discovered it yet.

273
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,879
This uncle is a superpower
who knows everything.

274
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,980
When people with special
abilities gather together

275
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,270
There will also be unknown abilities

276
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,529
You'll know when you find the rest.

277
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,060
How to find the rest

278
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,179

Is Do Kyungsoo a member of BTS?

284
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,780
It's EXO

If you were born in 1975, you
are a rabbit and you are unmarried.

287
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,300
First love is still written on her face

289
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
- Occupation - Stop talking

290
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,479
Who are you

291
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,449
I am Huang Qidong, the
one who started it all

292
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,860
I had a corneal transplant.

293
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,170
How did you find us?

294
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,019
Don't we all have a tattoo?

295
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,510
If this is within a few
kilometers radius, it will glow.

296
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,130
But since I'm the only one who
can see it, I can't explain it

297
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,219
So what the uncle did just now was

298
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,160
Control electromagnetic waves,
WIFI or something like that?

299
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,070
This

300
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,190
Here it comes

301
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,369
Another 500cc cup, please

302
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,370
good

303
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,519
It's amazing

304
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,569
You can be our superpower captain.

305
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,530
- Captain is shit - As
captain, find someone else

306
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,170
It's not a military regime.

307
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,309
Doesn't it mean that you have to
be within a few meters to see it?

308
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,439
Who knows where they are?

309
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,279
Then let's do the same
hacking attack as before.

310
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,459
- Hacking is bullshit. - Not in the movies.

311
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,660
Is it a dictatorship?

312
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,859
If you are caught spying on civilians

313
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,389
Will violate the Privacy Protection Act
and the Information and Communications Act

314
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,389
Personal information
leakage and reputation damage

315
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,219
It seems you don't know this.

316
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,179
Didn't you say you wanted to find it first?

317
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,249
I mean this method is unfair.

318
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,810
You think it's troublesome?
I'm too busy

319
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,640
You don't have a job?

320
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,869
- Who said that? - What do you do?

321
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,679
I'm a screenwriter. I write scripts.

322
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,700
What script to write

323
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,139
-Hero -Show me

324
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,619
Ends next week

325
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,290
You like heroic themes?

326
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,306
Then you know the community
in that circle, right?

327
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,479
We have a lot of hero information there.

328
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,769
- So you like us? - Yes

329
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,890
We are one of the people there. The
local distortion of facts is very serious.

330
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
You are a leftist.

331
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,189
I'm telling you, this is
the end of our conversation.

332
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,359
You're almost saying this in plain
language. What year were you born?

333
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,599
-88 -I am 87

334
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,159
- I was born in early 1988.
- What month exactly?

335
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,829
- How fast is April?
- Is April still considered the beginning of the year?

336
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,399
- Isn't this a national regulation?
- What's the basis for it not being a national regulation?

337
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,849
What is the basis for the basis?

338
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,689
Hey, what are you doing?
It's such a nice day.

339
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,679
Reborn from a body

340
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,010
Live like a family.

341
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,410
Uncle, didn't we agree to split the bill?

342
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,809
Oh, it's really not quiet

343
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,300
What show will you show me this time?

344
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,710
Do I want these poor souls to work for me?

345
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,900
If you complain about the high price now

346
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,960
I'll go find someone else.

347
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,930
You know that the Republic of
Korea is full of evil, right?

348
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,640
So many tricks

349
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,330
All out

350
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,469
Eternal Life and Eternal
Spring, the God of Sai is Coming

351
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,959
Omniscience and Blessings God Returns

352
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,569
Congratulations on your
resurrection, Lord Saishen

353
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,889
You, a busy man, are here.

354
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,220
Because I want to save one more poor soul.

355
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,729
We must learn from Sai Shen.

356
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,570
Why does it sound to me like
you're trying to steal my opportunity?

357
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,170
Did you get an ear
injury when you were a kid?

358
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,479
You heard wrong

359
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,110
No No

360
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,460
I can hear clearly.

361
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,989
How much money does my daughter want?

362
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,610
If we hand over the consortium,

363
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,139
But she didn't want to hand
over the pharmaceutical company.

364
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,590
Because this is the
business her father founded.

365
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,300
A filial daughter, your daughter

366
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,870
Bingchun

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,920
Our family has no filial sons or
daughters from generation to generation.

368
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,770
Blood is greedy

369
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,189
Originally, each follower counted as 45.

370
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,899
Then I'll give you 50

371
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,339
If you give me the Renaissance

372
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,690
Isn't it because of you
that my ears are injured?

373
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,129
When performing stunts at Zhengshan Market

374
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,479
- You dialed the wrong number.
- 550,000 won

375
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,809
So I beat you like a dog

376
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,250
It's on my pants.

377
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,359
- We sold a lot of drugs that day.
- Don't say it, brother.

378
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,939
The drug dealer's henchman,
the guy who shits in his pants

379
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,679
You really think you're a god.

380
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,689
Damn it, stop talking, you drug dealer

381
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,679
Stop talking about poop. Damn it.

382
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,410
You guy

383
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,510
There are 5 minutes left at noon.

384
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,740
You have to be back to
your position 5 minutes ago

385
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,280
To do exactly what you should do
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

386
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,680
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

387
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,149
Accurate time will keep us safe

388
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,150

389
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,340
Please wear a helmet

390
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,780
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

391
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,741
Three minutes left
-=Sai Shen Consortium=-

392
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:53,600
Three minutes left

393
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,130
Users cannot force time to work

394
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't you know this is a
violation of the Labor Standards Act?

395
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,239
You know so much about the
law, why don't you become a judge?

396
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,739
Why do this here?

397
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,829
Please do not treat us differently
because we are contract employees.

398
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,399
It's not the contractors'
problem, even the president

399
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,340
If the rest time is observed

400
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,179
That's the law I know.

401
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,819
The one who doesn't
comply is this consortium.

402
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,539
In order to catch up with the date
of the revival meeting or something

403
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,129
Working overtime every day and
not having enough safety equipment

404
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,120
If something happens, will you save us?

405
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,819
That leader will save

406
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,769
In the hell college, the guy
who didn't even get redemption

407
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,100
How dare you mention the god of race?

408
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,880
- What happened to him?
- He fell from above

409
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,839
No, I've said it many times.

410
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,680
Let you change that, really

411
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,320
Answer the phone?

412
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,040
When will someone come?

413
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,760
-=You who put safety
first are superheroes=-

414
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,260
I saw

415
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,829
Why don't you believe what people say?

416
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,389
It's not that I don't believe

417
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,480
This is called cataract in medical terms.

418
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,730
- Of course, dopamine is secreted when you are excited.
- No, no

419
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,130
I'm not excited. I can see it clearly.

420
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,590
Why do we have to eat meat
that we rarely eat before?

421
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,440
Huang Shenling suddenly grew white hair

422
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,850
That tree too

423
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,459
- At that time,

424
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,219
Do people who donate organs
have special physical conditions?

425
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,719
It may also be a special physique

426
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,430
People who receive organ transplants

427
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,000
There should be more.

428
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,960
One more time

429
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,260
Where does the pollen come from?

430
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,290
That's it.

431
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,170
Go ahead. It's already started.

432
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,640
Don't you go out to play on weekends?

433
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,150
No friends?

434
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,640
I have no friends

435
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,090
Why

436
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Because of dad?

437
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,270
No, although there is also this reason

438
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,380
But I took a year off due to
illness, so I don't have any friends

439
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,930
I understand

440
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,880
When I was sick, I didn't

441
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,720
When I am not sick, I am afraid of
getting sick, so I have no friends.

442
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,240
People with super powers are lonely.

443
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,570
Do you know that?
Have no idea

444
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,360
Do you know what it is?
What is

445
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,790
Bad Guy

446
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,000
Among the same kind of superpowers

447
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,469
And will attack other superpowered people

448
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,090
Why

449
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,776
Do you want to have all the
super powers for yourself?

450
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,429
That's why we have to
find the bad guys first.

451
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,639
Before the power is taken away

452
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,220
We

453
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,390
To us

454
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,479
People with super powers are meant to
be friends with people with super powers.

455
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,270
Don’t rich people hang
out with rich people?

456
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,770
Uncle You try this

457
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Why Give it a try

458
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,530
Uncle

459
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,579
If you get caught by a
bad guy, just tell me.

460
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,660
I will rescue all the people in our team.

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,330
Wanshu

462
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,130
But

463
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,340
How do you spot the bad guys?

464
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,670
Just look and you will know

465
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,220
You can tell at a glance

466
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,550
This guy is a bad guy

467
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,600
Just take care of yourself

468
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,600
Eat two chicken wings at a time

469
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,810
Wanshu

470
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,140
Zhixing

471
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,270
Oh my god, I found it. I found it.

472
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,939
I found out what my super power is.

473
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,150
Take a look

474
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Look at it.

475
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,530
Boom boom boom boom

476
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,210
I don't have super powers, do I?

477
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,340
Why only my tattoo?

478
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,840
Round like a knockoff owl

479
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,550
Auntie, why do you want super powers?

480
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,350
If you have super powers

481
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,890
It can save lives, right?

482
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,930
Like a hero

483
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,380
Having super powers doesn't
necessarily make you a hero.

484
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,770
Why

485
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,810
Experience

486
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Positivity

487
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,570
Number of people saved

488
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,979
Degree of self-sacrifice

489
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,740
These are all scored.

490
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,530
Not everyone can be a hero

491
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,780
I don't really like the score line style.

492
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,700
Hey, is he coming or not?

493
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,290
Can he find it with his
amazing hacking skills?

494
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,310
Have no idea
Ask again when you come.

495
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,329
If you eat too much, you
will have a stomachache

496
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,500
You said you would
come, but you came so late

497
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,250
Young

498
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,630
You can also send a message

499
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,389
-=OK=-

500
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,010
-=Park Ji-sung: Okay, let's do this=-
-=Huang Qidong, save me=-

501
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,206
I will return the money to you

502
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,230
Is money an issue, you son of a bitch?

503
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,310
How can you win 11
jackpots in one location?

504
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,190
Eleven times

505
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,206
This machine seems to be
broken. What do you want to do?

506
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,070
Take off your glasses

507
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:53,490
No, this doesn't seem to be bad.

508
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,280
I will compensate

509
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,120
Nonsense

510
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,450
I see you hit the jackpot with
just a flick of your finger, right?

511
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Are you Pikachu?

512
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,330
Will it create static electricity?

513
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,040
No, I'm not Pikachu.

514
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,080
It's a superpower

515
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,090
Wow you are so funny

516
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,760
I have to call your brother Long Jiu

517
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,220
Let me send a text message first.

518
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,570
That one needs to be pushed.

519
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,489
I've already said that if you eat
too much, you'll get a stomachache.

520
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,700
I ate five more

521
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,030
Where did you go?

522
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,676
Junior high school students
are not allowed to enter here

523
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,766
This is not an internet cafe

524
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,936
I was supposed to be in high school.

525
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,660
But I took a year off.

526
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:48,016
No matter if you are a high school student
or something, this is not an Internet cafe

527
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,056
Auntie, I don't drink Yakult

528
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
stomachache

529
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,669
I'm not here to sell Yakult

530
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,379
I'm here to take him away.

531
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,260
I've said he's not someone
you can just take away.

532
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,139
This guy caused a scene in the store.

533
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,196
I'm in debt and I've turned off my
phone. What do you think I should do?

534
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
Hello

535
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,970
No more paper

536
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,930
there

537
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Hanging

538
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,909
Is it your friend?
No

539
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,449
Uncle

540
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,870
Let him go.

541
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,409
My dad is a Taekwondo master

542
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,425
My dad is a convict with
four prior convictions.

543
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,369
You didn't hear me just now, did you?

544
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,330
This uncle made a mess in the store.

545
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,686
So this uncle suffered a heavy loss.

546
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,606
The person who caused the accident
shall bear the compensation for the loss

547
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,920
Not a friend

548
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,170
He has no friends

549
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,010
He needs to be taught a lesson.

550
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,139
It's really useless

551
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,219
no

552
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,600
We're going to eat ribs.

553
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,469
Wait till you finish your lesson.

554
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,809
I feel like I've been reborn.

555
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,600
Otherwise, leave

556
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,681
I walk my own Yangguan Road

557
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,310
Don't do this

558
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,520
Just let him go

559
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Ah, what?

560
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,450
This is a gift for you.

561
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,570
You guys

562
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,756
You really ignored my words.

563
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,740
They say I have a bad stomach.

564
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,390
Beef ribs or pork ribs

565
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,670
I've been in there for ten minutes.

566
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,310
Are all four of you here?

567
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,650
It took exactly 4 minutes and 28 seconds

568
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,090
Go fast

569
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,520
Call your dad.

570
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,850
Just called

571
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,910
What is that?

572
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,170
Exceed the past

573
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,800
That guy

574
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,790
what to do

575
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,710
Power 5

576
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,810
Get out of the way

577
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,800
what to do

578
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,680
kick off

579
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,050
This won't work. Stop it.

580
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,640
I've said it before.

581
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,930
It's my brother who sees you as pitiful.

582
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,900
Take off your glasses, bastard.

583
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,920
So dirty

584
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,230
Stop

585
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,860
Four people

586
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,990
We are full.

587
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,620
This buffet is quite delicious.

588
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,266
Because someone has suffered so much

589
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,330
In the end, they didn't
even settle the bill.

590
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,646
If you don't know, you might
think it was you who paid the bill.

591
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,879
Are you speaking plain language?

592
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,750
This is like a honorific, right?

593
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,049
Stop arguing, we are all
friends with super powers

594
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,710
Friend is a ghost

595
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,180
Do you still want to keep him with you?

596
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,930
If you have the ability, then
hack in and find it yourself.

597
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,180
Is it because I can't
do it that I don't do it?

598
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,560
It's because it's against the law.

599
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,560
Then you who abide by the law

600
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,520
Why would you plagiarize
someone else's script?

601
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,860
Did you doxx me?

602
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Yes

603
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,939
Talking about justice all day long

604
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,030
So I looked at

605
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,490
What screenwriter

606
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,780
A script that was sold
with great difficulty

607
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,370
Stealing from friends?

608
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,200
That's why I have no friends.

609
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,340
This guy is a well-known
malicious commenter.

610
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,510
How many times have you been sued?

611
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,446
I'm not the kind of guy who gives bad
reviews without even watching a movie.

612
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,640
This is a beggar boy.

613
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,020
Did you know that your coin
has now dropped to a quarter?

614
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,600
Only 80,000 yuan left

615
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,480
-=One throw=-

616
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,610
You have to earn money honestly.

617
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,440
A mother who works as a nanny
for others and earns money for you

618
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,610
Don't you feel pity for her?

619
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,546
I would have committed suicide long ago.

620
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,200
How can you talk like that?

621
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,240
Some things can be said,
some things cannot be said

622
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,120
He actually said suicide

623
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Let's go

624
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,476
Brother Jixing, please be patient

625
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,750
What are you enduring?

626
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,010
Really, why are you like this?

627
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,290
Didn't we agree to be friends?

628
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,986
I just want to play with you
because I feel sorry for you.

629
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,840
You really thought you were friends.

630
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,350
Come here

631
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,990
What are you guys doing?

632
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,910
In this case, let's not meet for now.

633
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,310
Why didn't you answer the
phone? Where have you been?

634
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,470
How did it become like this again?

635
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,280
Who are you with?

636
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,650
Are you with friends?

637
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,860
I have no friends

638
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,870
What are you doing alone so late?

639
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,806
Who is your friend? Give me your number.
I've said I don't have any friends.

640
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,910
I thought you were in trouble and ran
to the police station and the hospital.

641
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,620
Even the morgue

642
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,460
I even searched the morgue.

643
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,880
I'm not feeling well now.

644
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,339
Is it time to play with friends?

645
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,760
Really, I have no friends.

646
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,680
I said I have no friends

647
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,930
None

648
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,970
Everybody hates me

649
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm a useless person

650
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,060
Since everyone hates me so much

651
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,640
I might as well have died.

652
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,400
Why are you dying?

653
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm suffocating because of my dad.

654
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,780
It's not because my heart hurts.

655
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,449
It's because Daddy is
about to stop beating.

656
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,860
Am I a dog?

657
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,990
Why did you put a dog collar on me?

658
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,500
I'm really suffocating because of my dad.

659
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,830
I don't need a dad at all

660
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,800
Wanshu

661
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,340
Don't run, you'll slip.

662
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,080
Have a cup of tea before you go.

663
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,710
Don't bring anything here anymore.

664
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,180
Sorry

665
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,850
I heard you had a heart transplant.

666
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,390
Looks like a success.

667
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,390
Looks much better.

668
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,810
Look, your skin has improved.

669
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,320
Madam, you look very young.

670
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,910
After all, I took someone else's life.

671
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,280
Of course you have to get better.

672
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Isn't it?

673
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,290
I was wrong

674
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,870
The rest of life

675
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,420
I will do good things
for the rest of my life.

676
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,260
Do what your husband couldn't finish.

677
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,949
Save many people

678
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,960
I hope you don't go on living.
It's better to commit suicide again.

679
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,530
I hope you don't fail
this time and succeed.

680
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,909
Stop saying you're going to die.

681
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,030
Let someone like my husband die.

682
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,330
I hope you die

683
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,480
Let's do it

684
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,370
What

685
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,150
Study this to develop new drugs

686
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,700
- What are you talking about?
- Dean Song retired

687
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,170
Three more years?

688
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,279
Three years and four months

689
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,560
After retirement

690
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,439
Going to change the grandchildren's diapers

691
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,560
Or be the vice president
of a pharmaceutical company?

692
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
What

693
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,580
my country

694
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,840
It's time for a Nobel Prize in Medicine

695
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,250
So what to do

696
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,640
Feel like you can do it

697
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Why are you here?

698
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,090
Have you really missed everyone?

699
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,949
Didn't auntie say goodbye?

700
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,930
Didn't you say you were
looking for bad guys?

701
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,130
I have found the bad guy.
Don't look for him anymore.

702
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,670
This, this uncle is not a bad guy, just...

703
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,009
A bit like a minion

704
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,120
Not that guy. I mean I'm the bad guy.

705
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,569
You were sick too, you know.

706
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,916
If you feel uncomfortable physically,
you will also feel uncomfortable mentally.

707
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,980
Then I don't want to
see those powerful people

708
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,070
I don't want to see myself hiding
behind those people and cursing at them.

709
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,796
It is a formula for people who have accomplished
nothing and have nothing to be bad people.

710
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,860
But you have super powers.

711
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,810
What can this do?

712
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,530
If I had super powers, like that guy

713
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,136
It would be great if it
was a useful superpower.

714
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,760
What kind of superpower is this?
It's obviously not a superpower.

715
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,006
Are you sure you want this?

716
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,990
That's how I am, that's
why I live like this

717
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,490
I didn't plagiarize the script.

718
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,209
We were supposed to write together

719
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,460
He left and said he wanted
to write something else.

720
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,550
Uncle

721
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,040
Are you really playing with me
because you feel sorry for me?

722
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,540
This sentence cancels

723
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,310
Say sorry to Aunt Shannv.

724
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,150
Go there and tell it yourself.

725
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,420
Where to go

726
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,590
They said they found a
liver transplant candidate.

727
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,630
Monitor

728
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,059
Now these people are not our followers.

729
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,300
If we improve safety and treatment, etc.

730
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,706
Then it won't be finished
before the Day of Resurrection.

731
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,799
I climbed 50 or 60 floors without a rope.

732
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,049
Safety first, as stated by Shinshin

733
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,450
So where is the place blessed by the new
god? Where is the need for safety equipment?

734
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,489
It's all because of no trust

735
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,030
I became scared.

736
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,420
Let’s go eat Regional Director

737
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,760
Fifteen minutes until lunch time

738
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,299
Let’s do it after dinner.

739
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,420
We are not robots.

740
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,789
- How can this be completed in one day?
- It's a robot.

741
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,870
Let's go eat.

742
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,650
I want to finish this today.

743
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,709
Someone must faint.

744
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,710
Good

745
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,586
When you come back, bring
me a bucket of instant noodles

746
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,699
knew

747
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,700
good

748
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,809
He won't come. He doesn't
want to come at all.

749
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,810
What to do when you come?
You must give me oxygen.

750
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,440
I've been arguing all
day over useless abilities.

751
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,200
Excuse me

752
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,990
I'm leaving first

753
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,870
You go see it.

754
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,220
Why

755
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,490
Don't you want to find super powers?

756
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,330
I'm sorry, Wanshu.

757
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,889
Not eligible

758
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,170
How can you say that?

759
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,630
Didn't we agree to find super
powers together and become heroes?

760
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Start up

761
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,260
You've seen me too, right?

762
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,760
I'm not qualified.

763
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,280
I didn't... I didn't look that closely.

764
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,970
Such a precious ability
should be used in a good place

765
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,030
I'm sorry for causing trouble
to you all during this period.

766
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,630
I won't do it anymore

767
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,710
Really annoying

768
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,459
In a world where it’s hard to feed yourself

769
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,900
What kind of superhero is it?
Why do you want to help others?

770
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,820
Disbanded today.

771
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,170
The group chat was also disbanded

772
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,620
Nothing happened

773
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,909
Don't be nervous.

774
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,130
What are you doing?

775
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,420
Didn't you hear the sound?

776
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,510
- Get out quickly.
- You just said it was nothing.

777
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,489
The regional director
asked us to stay on the job.

778
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,540
If you die, will the
district chief be responsible?

779
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,820
Get out now

780
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,730
Two lines two lines

781
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,180
Slow down. Slow down.

782
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,720
Where did this come from?

783
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,630
Have you found the right path?

784
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,630
I don't know either

785
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,900
Lee Soo-geun

786
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,390
Lee Soo-geun

787
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:26,800
I'm here, monitor.

788
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,190
But we were here before, right?

789
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,069
Help!

790
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,090
Lee Soo-geun

791
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,570
Wear a hard hat

792
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,450
Uncle, get out of the way

793
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,260
Auntie, no

794
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,849
There's someone inside

795
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,079
Start Open Door

796
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,920
Wait a moment

797
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:39,389
Start Quickly

798
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,609
Should I open the door?

799
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,610
Open

800
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,920
Sorry for last time.

801
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,046
Are there any swimming goggles
or anything like that here?

802
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,790
The smoke is so thick I can't see anything.

803
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,010
Turn off the song.

804
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,639
Start up

805
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,640
good

806
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,450
Found it

807
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,899
I'll tell you, go in.

808
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,270
Who are you to command me?

809
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,229
I told you I would be your guide.

810
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,599
If there is navigation, then you go in.

811
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,509
Are you two crazy? How can you quarrel now?

812
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,810
No, I opened the door for you.

813
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,079
Ask me to tell you the
way, and I will tell you.

814
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,080
What else do I need to do for you?

815
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,729
I'm not asking you to do anything else.

816
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,219
I asked you not to command me.

817
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,839
You command me so I won't command you

818
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,439
Why do you give me instructions?

819
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,519
I didn't tell you what to do.

820
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,969
I asked you not to command me.

821
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,399
- You told me not to boss
you around - Damn you two

822
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,100
As soon as they see each other,
they start to quarrel and go crazy

823
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:01,679
You two are stupid.

824
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,120
Don't let me in.

825
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,360
Uncle, tell us the way

826
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,620
left

827
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,750
A little further

828
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,280
Not there

829
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,190
Yes, that's it.

830
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,650
Going forward

831
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,730
Yes, that's it.

832
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,000
Shougen

833
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,100
Here, here...

834
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
Lee Soo-geun

835
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,280
Hey, Shougen, wake up!

836
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
Uncle

837
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,710
Water... water?

838
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,590
Hurry and get some water

839
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,370
Water Water...

840
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,540
what to do

841
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,680
- Water - What to do? What to do?

842
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,160
Don't just stand there,
at least do something.

843
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Auntie, what's going on?

844
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,110
Stop

845
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,540
Where to start

846
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,009
Not where I am

847
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,010
You asked me to get some water and
asked me where it was. How would I know?

848
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,530
What about superheroes?

849
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,580
Uncle, please go out first.

850
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,100
I know where the water purifier is.

851
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,740
Come with me

852
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,839
Send him outside

853
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Please

854
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,950
Shougen

855
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,640
This way

856
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,679
Just walk another hundred meters.

857
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,180
There's no gas mask at
this construction site?

858
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,080
Sorry

859
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,490
I just saw a lot of tanks here

860
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,350
Is there such a thing as an oxygen tank?

861
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,910
Here comes the oxygen tank

862
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,870
Not over there

863
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,279
My name is Xu Yaoshan

864
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,750
Had a liver transplant

865
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,179
Occasionally treat existing
underlying medical conditions

866
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,069
Fractures and injuries
caused by accidents alone

867
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,179
Shoulder discomfort, chronic fatigue, etc.

868
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,550
I can cure them all.

869
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,170
If you need anything, tell me.

870
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,869
Are you also a designated driver?

871
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,050
-My dad does it, too. -Just now I saw you

872
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,319
You seem to be transferring
other people's pain away

873
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,010
It's okay. I just need a glass of water.

874
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
It will be fine

875
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,530
real

876
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,010
People like you are truly heroes.

877
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:41,640
Isn't it?

878
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,090
Applaud

879
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,540
applaud

880
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,670
Miss What

881
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:50,410
I think you are a real hero

882
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,399
And saved my life

883
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,520
Thank you very much

884
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,449
What what

885
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,789
What are you looking at?

886
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,619
Ah, Auntie, don't cry.

887
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,829
You were cursing just now. Why are you
crying now? This doesn't suit you at all.

888
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,420
This is even more terrifying

889
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:20,129
Actually, I used to have depression
and anger regulation disorder.

890
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,339
I have to take medicine vigorously

891
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,799
Then after the operation,
the patient became healthy.

892
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,800
Do you think things have
really gotten better now?

893
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,470
- I thought swearing was your superpower.
- Ouch

894
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,849
Forget about what happened just now

895
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,229
Should we give each of our heroes a name?

896
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,519
What's the name again?

897
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,109
No, don't you see those
foreign superhero movies?

898
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,149
What kind of hero, what kind of woman

899
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,369
As for me, I rely on my
strength to save people.

900
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,699
How about saving women? The
abbreviation is saving women.

901
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,080
Do you think it's OK?

902
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,369
The English word is "NINE" ("救"
is pronounced the same as "九").

903
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,370
NINE GIRL

904
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,789
- Uh... - Uncle, you are an oxygen tank

905
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,460
Jar Jar Boy Bar Jar Jar Boy

906
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,459
What's your name, Auntie?

907
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,879
I was originally doing fresh delivery and
was thinking of calling myself 'Fresh Girl'

908
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,969
Is that a bit like that?

909
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:09,010
But fresh girl is more
catchy than fresh woman, right?

910
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,060
Just call it that.

911
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:11,350
As long as we don't call you.

912
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:17,059
- Your name is Yaoshan. - Yes

913
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,530
Let's call it medicine hand.
The hand is medicine hand.

914
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,569
You, because your name is Startup

915
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:28,989
- Bluetooth Man, the wireless one.
- Oh, ok, ok.

916
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:29,990
Hey, save the girl

917
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,539
- You are a bad student, right?
- My dad said that he just wants me to be healthy.

918
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:40,210
I actually have a name in mind.

919
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,130
I can save people and replenish my energy.

920
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:45,970
Battery Man

921
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,220
- Everyone uses English names, so it can be unified.
- Yeah, OK. Battery

922
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,889
Okay, we've come up with a name
and the atmosphere is pretty good.

923
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:00,480
Bluetooth Man, in line with
today's atmosphere, music follows you

924
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,570
Super amazing

925
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:07,700
But uncle, this is
really amazing, look at it

926
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:09,910
Action

927
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,010
again

928
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,670
Enough

929
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,980
-=Barcelona Taekwondo=-

930
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,480
Where did you go?

931
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,230
Go meet friends

932
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,109
Didn't you say you have no friends?

933
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,280
I made friends

934
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,110
- Do you need my help?
- You don't have the strength

935
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,800
You will get hurt. Get out of the way.

936
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:58,869
See?

937
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,669
Dad is still okay, right?

938
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,840
- It's OK. - Since it's OK

939
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,969
Leave everything to Dad, okay?

940
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,470
- Dad. - Where's Dad?

941
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,430
Even if you become an old
lady, as long as you call me dad

942
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,390
I will also appear like a hero
and help you solve all the problems.

943
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,560
Colds are bad for your health

944
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,990
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
You should go back to bed early.

945
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,160
Sai Shen Hospital prays
for a speedy recovery

946
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,200
Always focus...

947
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,330
Sorry, please take the next elevator

948
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,210
Feel sorry

949
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,419
What you may experience during treatment...

950
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,000
Come up, fellow believers.

951
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,920
Which department?

952
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,719
The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

953
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,469
I am Xu Yaoshan, the stage equipment
construction team leader of Saishen Group.

954
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,470
It's a pleasure to meet you

955
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:57,469
Were you scared by the
explosion a while ago?

956
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,230
- Are you hurt? - I'm fine.

957
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:00,600
Thank you for your concern

958
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:02,860
Thank you for your faith.

959
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:05,310
Yes

960
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,980
I will try harder to believe

The Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai God Descends

962
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,219
You got a tattoo?

963
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,969
This is not a tattoo. I was lucky
enough to have an organ transplant.

964
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,100
What was transplanted

965
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,416
Underwent liver transplantation

966
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,100
Did anything change after the transplant?

967
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:49,069
The surgery went well and my body became healthy and I don't feel tired anymore...
- I'm not talking about that.

968
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,590
Is it that you have any special place?

969
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,530
Although I'm not sure

970
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:59,240
But people say I look younger.

971
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,370
Of course, you need to rely
on your liver to become younger

972
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,550
What's your name?

973
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,220
My name is Xu Yaoshan

974
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,720
Xu Yaoshan, Construction Team Leader

975
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,020
Take good care of your body

976
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,890
See you next time

977

-=A book to help you
learn how to be a nurse=-

978
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,900
Looks like she's preparing
for the nursing exam.
-=A book to help you

-=A book to help you

980
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,900
No, just watching for fun

982
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,950
Wow, so cool
-=A book to help you

983
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,070
Wow, so cool

984
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,699
I'm so sorry, driver.

985
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,789
Suddenly said we want to meet here

986
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,990
Do you need me to turn around?

987
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,870
Ouch. I'm so sorry.

988
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,710
Let me see where the Saishen
Pharmaceutical Headquarters is.

989
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:52,590
Oh, Saishen Pharmaceuticals?
I work next door.

990
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,550
I know the way

991
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,589
Very good

992
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:00,260
- Please get through safely. - Okay.

993
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,640
- Do you have any gum?
- Do you have any gum?

994
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,650
Why not start

995
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:08,230
Yeah

996
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:12,320
This first requires a
pathological examination

997
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,450
Even a lethal dose of
anesthesia would not work

998
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,570
Is it Little Sai Shen?

999
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,200
Great! I am Xu Yaoshan, the
construction team leader of Saishen Group.

1000
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:26,369
Little Sai Shen, where is
this? I... want to go home.

1001
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:32,130
Oh, by the way, there is a book that will
teach you how to be a nurse. I forgot that.

1002
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,549
- We have to go there...
- What's the anesthesia?

1003
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:35,550
Directly

1004
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,969
Little Sai Shen

1005
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,730
Shut up

1006
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,770
Little Sai Shen

1007
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:51,110
Since anesthesia doesn't work, we
have to find a way to make him pass out.

1008
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,069
What are you standing there
for? Why don't you start?

1009
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,650
-Yes. -Who are you waiting for?

1010
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,530
Are you waiting for me?

1012
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,790
You have planned
something very interesting.

1013
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:14,249
See you again, Xu Yaoshan, construction
team leader, it's okay, it's okay

1014
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,470
Who did it?

1015
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,509
Dean Song is a Saishen

1016
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,349
I heard that if you take just a little
bit of the liver it will grow back.

1017
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,220
- Right? - Yes, that's right.

and live forever in my body

1021
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,400
sorry

1022
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:18,649
It seems that the same kind cannot

1023
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:21,950
Then let's do surgery.

1024
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,970
- Mr. Zhao - Yes, President

1025
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,810
It's better to strike first.

1026
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:51,729
Catch them all

1027
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:56,109
Take it easy. Ouch. Take it easy.

1028
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,290
Auntie, this way

1029
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,040
Okay, here we come

1030
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,420
Oh, thank you.

1031
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:38,109
- Is there anything to drink?
- Yes, yes, yes. How could there be nothing?

1032
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:53,119
Daughter, daughter,
daughter, what are you doing?

1033
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,370
What are you doing? Is
your leg okay? It's okay...

1034
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,790
Hey, this is simple.

1035
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,959
Hey, isn't it just a child?

1036
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,090
Who are you?

1037
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,089
- Let's go. - Where are we going?

1038
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,090
Very soon

1039
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:07,890
Daughter, go over there, far away

1040
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,680
Go to the very edge

1041
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,120
Ahhh my waist my waist I
almost thought I was going to die

1042
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,200
Pause Pause Pause

1043
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,760
Go up again

1044
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,660
come on

1045
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,080
All together up

1046
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,080
Ah damn

1047
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,580
Hey, do you know 540 degree rotation?

1048
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:00,580
Oh mom

1049
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,590
Xinqi finished eating a long time
ago. I'll give you the empty bucket now.

1050
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,009
Didn't I tell you to call
dad if you have any problem?

1051
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:09,970
Get me some water

1052
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:11,611
- Water. - There's something in that bag.

I just said it

1055
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,009
You got the wrong guy, sir.

Let me out first.

1057
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,309
Please let me go

1058
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,899
Did my father promise to give you a job?

1059
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,610
I don't need an official
position. What I want is very simple.

1060
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,110
A few Nobel Prizes are enough

1061
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:14,080
You're on the wrong side

1062
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,590
It's no use for an old
man to become younger.

1063
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:20,130
Who do you think will live longer?

1064
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,040
Go check it out.

1065
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,720
Who are you

1066
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,941
Why did you come just now? I've
been waiting for you for a long time.

1067
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,939
Who are you, bastard?

1068
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,359
Have you been drinking in broad daylight?

1069
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,240
Why don't you recognize me, your father?

1070
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,779
Did I tell you

1071
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,660
Your father was a handsome
man when he was young.

1072
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,710
Plz follow me

1073
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:53,590
This way, follow me.

01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,930
- This preacher - Be
careful on the steps, go up

1075
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:00,179
Follow this way too

1076
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,219
Newcomers, please follow me here.

1077
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,810
- This is it. - Welcome.

1078
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,150
Where is my clone?

1079
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,609
Have no idea

1080
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,409
There must be someone left
before I can become a god.

1081
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,580
Aren't you afraid?

1082
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:27,410
If God really exists, aren't you
afraid that you will be punished?

1083
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,999
Have you been to church recently?

1084
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Dad

1085
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:35,049
Because I know I won't be forgiven

1086
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,550
That’s why I want to be God.

1087
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,230
How clever! Hiding it here!

1088
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,979
Director Zhao, long time no see.

1089
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,149
Who are you

1090
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:55,779
Why are you playing
dumb? You clearly know it.

1091
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,070
I have no idea

1092
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,530
Don't be too harsh. The president
asked us to invite him formally.

1093
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:49,830
Numbness Numbness

1094
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,290
-=Really? Where are you?;;;;=-

1095
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,360
What's going on?

1096
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,740
Did you open the door?

1097
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:23,200
Didn't we come here together?

1098
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,740
Why don't you untie this? Untie it for me.

1099
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,290
Hello Park Joo-chan Park Joo-chan

1100
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,159
This bastard

1101
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,249
Auntie Auntie

1102
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,210
Don't mess with me Don't mess with me

1103
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,590
-=Huang Qidong, save me!!=-

1104
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,430
-=Huang Qidong, save me!!
We are all kidnapped!=-

1105
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,680
-=Uncle, where are you?
Send me your address now=-

1106
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,829
The eyes are definitely not allowed

1107
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,500
My eyes are really not good.

1108
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,210
Absolutely not my eyes, if you want
to take it, take my reproductive organs

1109
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,340
He's really good at pretending to be sick.

1110
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,339
Corneal transplant should be done soon.

1111
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:25,469
Yes

1112
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:28,469
Eyes not working

1113
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,630
How nice it would be if the
rest of us did it together

1114
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:33,269
- I'm still missing one person.
- I'm a rich man.

1115
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,139
- I can give you a lot of money
- Just to be on the safe side

1116
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,439
- It's better to have more time.
- I'll give you a lot of money.

1117
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,980
How much is enough, you bastards?

1118
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,439
Can you give him anesthesia?

1119
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,070
Xu Yaoshan was so noisy
that he even fell into a coma

1120
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:49,620
But it must be painful.

1121
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,629
No what

1122
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,670
Nothing works I have to go

1123
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,510
No, no, absolutely not this time. You...

1124
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,100
Do you think I don't
know what you're doing?

1125
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:17,729
Since when did you know

1126
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:21,309
Parents smell their children's farts

1127
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,190
You can all tell what's on this kid's mind.

1128
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:26,850
You've been in the hospital for three
years and you haven't made any friends.

1129
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,240
After I got better, I
finally made some friends.

1130
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,800
The same is true of the friends you make.

1131
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,140
Hanging out with bad boys

1132
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:42,340
Even if I buy you new shoes every time

1133
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:45,220
When I came back, my shoes were
all broken and became garbage.

1134
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,129
My daughter, I'm sorry, my daughter

1135
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,800
So I study Taekwondo hard.

1136
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,196
All for the sake of not getting beaten.
All for the sake of not getting beaten.

1137
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,599
Because bad boys bullied you

1138
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,690
- That's why you want to protect yourself.
- Dad

1139
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:03,980
-But what if I get hurt again? -Actually

1140
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,460
My friends were caught by the bad boys

1141
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,739
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

1142
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,199
We are like a family

1143
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,410
So I have to rescue them.

1144
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:15,450
Really not

1145
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,539
You're standing right
behind me, you bastards

1146
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,419
It's the group of people
in black suits, right?

1147
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,000
Age is just a number

1148
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,959
Do you want to change the song?

1149
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,549
I still get excited when I hear this song.

1150
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:32,009
I also listened to this song
when I went on stage in Barcelona

1151
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,049
I won the championship

1152
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,509
What's your dad's nickname?

1153
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,309
-Taekwondo Injustice -Taekwondo Injustice

1154
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,890
A fatal spinning kick full of justice

1155
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,240
What's wrong

1156
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:53,449
What's wrong? Wake up.

1157
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,030
Why are you here? Where is this place?

1158
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:57,950
It seems we have been kidnapped.

1159
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,870
Let's go out first.

1160
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,629
Where is the toilet?

1161
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,129
No, not there.

1162
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:11,130
No

1163
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,349
How are you

1164
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:19,310
This is so interesting. It's amazing.

1165
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:22,520
You have never seen WIFI
with your naked eyes, right?

1166
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,730
Is it because only one eye was removed?

1167
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,819
Focus is good and bad

1168
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:32,780
I'm sorry, it's all his fault for
waking up suddenly and rushing over

1169
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:35,239
His cornea was transplanted
into only one of my eyes.

1170
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,529
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

1171
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,280
He must have seen this.

1172
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,850
Can you still do this kind of thing?

1173
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,120
Severe damage during removal

1174
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,080
Modern medicine cannot restore

1175
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:00,599
Who?

1176
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,600
It's me

1177
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,340
Battery Man

1178
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,979
Uncle, please help me heal

1179
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,600
Can't you treat it?

1180
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,189
The battery is dead

1181
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:11,150
Can't you recover by drinking water?

1182
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,689
Drink some water and help me heal.

1183
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:14,650
Didn’t I bring you water last time?

1184
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:19,370
Uncle, help me, I'm so scared

1185
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,499
How did he survive?

1186
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,330
They were able to remove
my two organs twice.

1187
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,800
-=Sai God Descends Great Revival=-

Now, as he said, according
to the Lord's promise

1191
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:52,319
Returned with a new body that never dies

1192
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,899
Save us from the fire of hell

1193
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,069
To punish the unbelievers,
He descended into us.

1194
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:58,489
Welcome to the King of Kings, God of Gods

1195

1198
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,970
What's going on?

1199
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:24,430
Who is this

Eternal immortality

1202
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:48,119
I promised that when we meet again

1203
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,919
I will stand before
you in my youthful body.

1204
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,879
Those who believe in me and follow me

1205
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,500

01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,530
I smashed the boulder
we promised on that day

1209
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,089
Focus on you

1210
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,879
Those who believe in me and follow me

1211
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,340
Will be my people

1212
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,400
Wait a moment

Sai Theism

1224
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,700
Why are there so many entrances?

1225
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,960
Are there any artists coming?

1226
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,870
Scare me

1227
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:55,700
I was scared to death

1228
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,670
I told you not to run.

You are Wanshu

1233
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,720
Brother, who are you?

1234
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,820
She's really good looking.

1235

1237
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:53,620
I got into a lot of
fights when I was a kid.

1238
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,250
Nice to meet you

1239
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,920
Damn

1240
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,500
It hurts, okay?

1241
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,050
How do you educate your children?

1242
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,150
- I'm sorry...

1243
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,050
But you're talking to me like this now?

1244
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:42,070
You are a bad boy.

1245
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,100
Always say you, you, your to adults

1246
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,749
You bastard, don't you
have a father at home?

1247
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,970
Of course not at home.

1248
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,719
My father was born in 1905

1249
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,250
Brother, did you capture my friends?

1250
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:57,650
My daughter actually did it.

1251
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:59,769
- My daughter?
- She has been correcting herself recently.

1252
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:00,890
Anyway, a little bit of that

1253
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,850
alright

1254
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:07,220
Okay, now that everyone has introduced their family
situations, it's time to get down to business.

1255
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:08,850
Wanshu

1256
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:11,399
Let me use your heart.

1257
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,850
Is this guy crazy?

1258
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,120
Hey, you guy

1259
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,720
NINE GIRL

1260
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,120
- Are you okay? - Yeah

1261
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:34,200
I was planning to pick you up.

1262
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,249
- You're just in time. But how did you get here?
- Ouch.

1263
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,170
This should be your father, right?

1264
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,696
- Hello. - Taekwondo. Taekwondo.

1265
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,070
It's the final farewell.

1266
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,619
- I have to say hello.

1267
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:45,300
I am a fresh girl

1268
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,219
This is the Jar Man

1269
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:48,020
- Stop it. - Hey

1270
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:51,350
- You are so lucky to have such an amazing daughter.
- Yes.

1271
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,320
You must be at ease.

1272
01:32:52,321 --> 01:32:56,200
No, this child is still young and
weak. I am very worried about her.

1273
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,360
What about you, Jar Girl?
Do you have any children?

1274
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,720
I am a fresh girl

1275
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:01,270
Cans... good

1276
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,169
Kim Sunnyeo, let me say something too

1277
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:04,820
Who are you

1278
01:33:04,821 --> 01:33:07,919
I am the Eternal Life,
Wing Chun, Sai Shen, Coming

1279
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,920
Uncle

1280
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,440
I think that brother is a
bad guy because he has tattoos

1281
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:15,270
But why is that person the
elder brother and I am the uncle?

1282
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:16,470
He is handsome.

1283
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,270
Uncle, you are the type who needs care.

1284
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,420
The adults are talking. Do you
want to keep interrupting them rudely?

1285
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:28,820
That

1286
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:31,720
Where is the startup and Mr. Xu Yaoshan?

1287
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,420
Eaten by me

1288
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:37,970
- Brat. - Don't.

1289
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,020
Wait a moment

1290
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:41,670
Hello Hello Hello

1291
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,120
Not dead?

1292
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,770
What to do

1293
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:11,170
I...

1294
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,550
Hey, hurry up, he's coming. He's coming.

1295
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:15,570
Park Ji-sung

1296
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,150
Lung transplantation

1297
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,989
Oh, your profession...

1298
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:21,100
Drool Launch

1299
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,950
He shouldn't be dead.

1300
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:32,020
But what did you just say?

1301
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,620
Usually you have to show your special
moves before you use them. This is polite.

1302
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,650
The saliva is so dirty
that I can't stand it

1303
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:44,170
What did you just say you were doing?

1304
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:48,070
What he is saying

1305
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,050
Oh my god

1306
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:01,170
What?

1307
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,070
Wait a moment

1308
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,470
emission

1309
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Let me see

1310
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,820
Our Kim Sunnyeo is here

1311
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,400
There is a way.

1312
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:47,399
If our Kim Sunnyeo stood by me, we wouldn't
have to go through so much trouble.

1313
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,500
Help me once.

1314
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,399
It's a piece of cake to
transfer their abilities to me.

1315
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,999
Don't come over here. Go away.

1316
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,150
Transfer it to me. If you run out of
ability, I will help you fill it up.

1317
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,499
No need to bleed. How neat!

1318
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Otherwise

1319
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,570
Should I buy you a Yakult company?

1320
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,000
Give me back my eyeballs

1321
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:18,400
Song Haolin is really annoying

1322
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,219
Eternal Life Wing Chun Sai Shen Descends

1323
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:52,249
Become a true sacrifice
and live forever in my body

1324
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:53,650
Why are you doing this?

1325
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,800
I have two unfulfilled wishes in my life.

1326
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:01,000
One is youth

1327
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,740
What's the other one? You have to ask
me for the lines before you can take it.

1328
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:11,846
- The other one is Yong...
- You will definitely say it is God, you don't even need to look at it

1329
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:13,770
The need for a visible God

1330
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:18,169
I became a god to save
mankind. You must be saying this.

1331
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:20,499
I think you've been to a cult school.

1332
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,349
Writing lines like this these
days will get you low marks.

1333
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:25,569
You really ruin people's mood.

1334
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:27,949
This guy is a famous
troll in the neighborhood.

1335
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:28,950
Father Sai

1336
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,850
Yes, Xu Yaoshan

1337
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,470
Is everything fake?

1338
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,800
Is everything you show fake?

1339
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,820
I abandoned my brothers and family

1340
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:41,700
All-night driving for your property

1341
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,000
Dedicated to your life

1342
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,900
Were we all deceived? Was it all in vain?

1343
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,300
Um

1344
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:52,269
So if you really want to see God

1345
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:54,850
Just give me your lowly bodies.

1346
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:00,170
Give me back my eyes, you bastard.

1347
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:05,420
Go away Go away

1348
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,600
What are you doing here?

1349
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,400
Mother

1350
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,600
Scare me

1351
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,819
You should dye your hair.

1352
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,820
Don't do it

1353
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,900
Give him all our wealth.

1354
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,450
Oh my god, what should I do?

1355
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,060
What's going on?

1356
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,140
-=Do not approach, please
watch with your eyes=-

1357
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:44,369
New God Father New God Father

1358
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:45,790
This can't be done

1359
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:46,790
What?

1360
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:50,100
If we open them all at
this time, we will all die.

1361
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,640
Wait a minute, stop it, get out of the way

1362
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:17,890
Let me breathe

1363
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:30,290
Are you going to kill everyone up there?

1364
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,519
Are you going to kill everyone
who believes in you and follows you?

1365
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,380
The believers just need to be reunited

1366
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:38,500
My image is the god of death

1367
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,160
This is caused by you

1368
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:09,200
-=Barcelona Taekwondo=-

1369
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:13,579
Eternal Life New God

1370
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:17,340
Will become a part of
me, an eternal existence

1371
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:21,530
Jin Shannyu, give it to me now

1372
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:26,640
Otherwise you will all die.

1373
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:31,919
Wake up and open your eyes

1374
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,260
Wake up, Jiang Wanshu, hello

1375
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:46,570
Go to hell, asshole.

1376
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,479
Brat

1377
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,370
Go over there. Don't come over here.

1378
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,330
-NINE GIRL -Hey Wanshu

1379
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:36,179
We will witness the coming of the new god

1380
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,810
Pray now

1381
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:43,760
Uncle, how do I turn that off?

1382
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:46,459
I don't know either

1383
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,150
How could you not know

1384
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,309
You have to use something like an
intradermal needle to disperse it.

1385
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:53,060
But I'm not a technician

1386
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,050
sorry

1387
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,050
Give me the tattoos

1388
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,420
What are you going to do?

1389
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:04,870
I don't know. I have to try.

1390
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,949
Hey, if you succeed, admit
that you are the same age as me

1391
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,560
If you succeed, I'll be your brother.

1392
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:23,670
What are you doing?

1393
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:46,350
- What? - The power is out.

1394
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:15,830
It's all done, just give me back my tattoo

1395
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:17,640
I am your brother

1396
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:23,410
Hey, stop tying me up, hold my hand

1397
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,230
- Wait a minute. - Give it to me first.

1398
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,530
Caught

1399
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,419
Why do you want to win me?

1400
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,679
People like you have to take
it out when I tell you to.

1401
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,510
If you are told to die, you must die.

1402
01:49:56,511 --> 01:49:57,549
Enough is enough

1403
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:59,799
NINE GIRL Let go, let go

1404
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,540
Can't let go

1405

dad

1406
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:17,099
My child

1407
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,089
How come it's so dirty?

1408
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:22,529
Did you fall down? Did anyone hit you?

1409
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:25,189
Who hit my weak daughter?

1410
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:31,240
Daddy is sorry for not
coming here earlier. I'm sorry.

1411
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,390
Is my daughter okay? It's Dad
who's sorry for you. I'm sorry.

1412
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,030
Ouch, Dad, I'm sorry.

1413
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,990
A brat

1414
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:23,800
Medicine

1415
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,500
Do you want to be a leader?

1416
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:39,180
I want to be a nurse

1417
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,810
Damn

1418
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,940
It hurts

1419
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,750
Oh, I'm going to drive. Wait
a minute. I'm going to drive.

1420
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,650
Ouch

1421
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,330
what to do

1422
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:48,040
Ah, what should I do? The lactic
acid bacteria must have gone bad.

1423
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,640
I want to deliver it at night.

1424
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:55,170
I also ordered a lot of Vietnamese
spring rolls to lose weight

1425
01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:58,360
The parking lot is this way.

1426

Blues Man

1427
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:03,259
Bluetooth male

1428
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,410
That is to say

1429
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:07,340
We don't have anything to do.

1430
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,240
Listen to a song while you wait

1431
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:12,170
Which song to play?

1432
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,589
Never mind. I'll let it go.

1433
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:14,590
Play that song

1434
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:16,090
Don't want to hear that

1435
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:17,650
Do you know what it is?

1436
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,160
That's right

1437
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:20,820
Battery Man Um

1438
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:24,569
Could you help me with this for a while?

1439
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:27,089
As soon as I see a convenience store, I
will drink some water to help you heal.

1440
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:29,890
No car keys.

1441
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:32,930
That one is here.

1442
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:36,740
Let's come up with a name
before the car arrives.

1443
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:38,450
Didn't we give it a name last time?

1444
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:42,030
We have a fake name but no group name.

1445
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:46,410
When watching a foreign movie, Super
Power Assemble, I would first name it

1446
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,930
Sister, please get up.

1447
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:49,789
Is it English or Korean?

1448
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,169
Sister, you decide.

1449
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:53,489
I'm actually good at naming.

1450
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:55,050
No, I'll name it.

1451
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:58,510
Battery man, you've worked
hard. Please charge your battery.

1452
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:04,550
I always feel that it would be
better to have a friendly feeling

1453
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:06,260
Just like saying hello

1454
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:08,939
Now I just thought of a suitable name

1455
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:11,020
Yeah, there are five of us.

1456
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,139
- Five people greet each other in English.
- Yes

1457
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:15,380
I know that

1458
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:16,780
I know what it is

1459
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,350
Uncle, please do this

1460
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:21,130
ah

1461
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:26,630
-=Hi-FIVE=-
