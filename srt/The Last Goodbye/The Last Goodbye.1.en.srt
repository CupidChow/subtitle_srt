1
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,321
07:02 in the evening,

2
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,782
you're with Joe D' Mango at Magic 89.9.

3
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,409
It's Friday Madness.

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,786
Welcome to the program.
This is Dear Joe Radio.

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,122
We'll play
the hits of the '80s for you

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,876
all the way 'til 9 p.m. tonight,
but if you're on the road right now,

7
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,171
just take it easy.
It's slippery and wet, it's raining…

8
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,630
Keep safe and drive…

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,090
Dear Joe,

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,675
I'm Heart.

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,346
I always wonder what the letter senders
feel when they send love letters.

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,015
I had never been in love.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,601
I had other priorities.

14
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,063
My dad and my studies.

15
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,732
Not until my last year in high school.

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,734
It was unexpected but…

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,821
It was one of the happiest times
I've ever experienced.

18
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,202
Joe,
this is just the beginning of my story,

19
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,579
the story of my heart.

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,967
Growing up,

21
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,346
I've learned to translate
my name in different languages.

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,057
But when my mom passed away,

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,353
I couldn't find the right translation
to express the pain

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,271
that I felt in my heart.

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,697
Mama,

26
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,370
I promise I'll be strong for you.

27
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,124
For you and Papa.

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,256
I'll do anything to make you proud.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,643
Moving on was hard for us.

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,688
Especially for Papa.

31
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,533
Papa.

32
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
It's already late.

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,250
I thought we'll have dinner together.

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,046
Sorry.

35
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,051
I came from the inauguration

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,430
of the firing range in San Felipe.

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,433
But you're drunk.

38
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,394
How did you manage to drive?

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,942
Your papa is amazing.

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,402
Right?

41
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,987
I only had a few bottles.

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,196
Don't worry.

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,742
Oh!

44
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,827
I remember something…

45
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,789
Don't get upset because
I have a surprise for you.

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,918
I had this bought in the US.

47
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,796
iPod 2nd Generation.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,507
You're the only one in Daet
who has this yet.

49
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,594
Just get it here.

50
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,056
I'll head upstairs.

51
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,913
Days passed,

52
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,790
every moment felt so long

53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,252
but like what I promised mama,

54
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,170
I have to be strong.

55
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,838
I need to be happy.

56
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,632
Joe,

57
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,550
although it's hard,

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:25,306
I try to find joy every day.

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,600
Elsa.

60
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,768
Fiona.

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,937
Did you find the other book?

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,106
-Right. We'll look for it.
-Not yet.

63
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,649
-Come with me.
-I don't want.

64
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,651
No, wait. I'll do it.

65
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,028
I have other books to find anyway.

66
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,447
-Can you look for these too?
-Yes.

67
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,657
Shakespeare's Macbeth,

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,284
Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet,

69
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn,

70
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,246
F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby,

71
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,497
and Homer's The Odyssey.

72
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,375
Okay.

73
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,463
The floor is now open for the nominations
for your class president.

74
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,381
Ma'am!

75
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,716
Yes, Precious Marie.

76
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,262
I respectfully nominate Beauty
D. Kagandahan as our class president.

77
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,263
Period.

78
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,306
No erase.

79
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,265
Locked.

80
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,350
Key swallowed.

81
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,269
-Any other nominations?
-Ma'am!

82
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,147
Fernando Po III.

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,357
Madam Maria Luningning Matimtiman.

84
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,650
Full name, huh?

85
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,236
It's Fiona.

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,572
Wow, the nerve!

87
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,532
Who are you going to nominate?

88
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,118
I respectfully

89
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,288
and wholeheartedly

90
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,914
nominate Ms. Heart Fajardo.

91
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,999
Yes!

92
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,126
There's no better candidate.

93
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,379
Beauty and brains.

94
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,922
Okay, let's vote!

95
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,009
Who are in favor with
Beauty D. Kagandahan?

96
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,553
Hey!

97
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,931
The ugly ones are voting her!

98
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,891
Twenty!

99
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,934
Those who voted for her are ugly!

100
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,103
How about Heart Fajardo?

101
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,857
Hey, raise your hands!

102
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,818
Twenty as well.

103
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,823
Besides academics,

104
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,951
I kept myself busy
with other school activities

105
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,998
because I know
it will make my parents proud.

106
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,222
In fairness to you Heart,

107
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,766
you're both brainy and pretty.

108
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,894
OMG! It's Prince.

109
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,687
Fiona, stop your delusions.

110
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,940
I look even better than them.

111
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,777
Seriously?

112
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,237
You're overacting.

113
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,949
You don't know how I feel.

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,328
It's because you're gay.

115
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,291
Wait until you find out
who the real gay is.

116
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,918
You might go crazy.

117
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,880
Friends, cut it out!

118
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,634
Elsa, there's nothing wrong
about being gay.

119
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,344
They're very gentle.

120
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,943
When happiness became
so hard to find,

121
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,362
someone found me,

122
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,781
someone saw me

123
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,284
in a dark moment…

124
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,743
of my life.

125
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,037
Your eyes.

126
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,877
Your eyes!

127
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,546
Why?

128
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,089
What's wrong with my eyes?

129
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,716
You've been staring at my face.

130
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,844
Sorry.

131
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,598
I'm Xavier!

132
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,068
Heart.

133
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,134
Wow, the pig is so handsome!

134
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,469
Bing the goat!

135
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,803
You, piggy!

136
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,057
Come here!

137
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,311
You're gonna regret this.
Come here!

138
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,605
Let's wrestle!

139
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,569
Hey, Xavier and Gelo!

140
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,404
What's wrong with you?

141
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,615
I'm already exhausted from work

142
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,117
and now I come home to this.

143
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,663
I even bought you clothes.

144
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,122
-Wow!
-Here.

145
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,791
Where's my kiss?

146
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,334
My kiss?

147
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,252
Wow!

148
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,878
You're so stubborn!

149
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,797
Check these out.

150
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,423
You know,

151
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,843
just because you're guys

152
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,305
doesn't mean you can't
pick up after yourself

153
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,100
or keep things neat at home.

154
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,561
You can't just play around.

155
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,146
Sorry, Mama.

156
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,441
-I'm telling you…
-Bing started it.

157
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,818
He's so annoying!

158
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,072
Stop calling him Bing.

159
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,283
Your brother is not a goat.

160
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,867
Oh dear! Okay, Bing…

161
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,245
I mean, Gelo.

162
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,955
My son, I love you.

163
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,875
Serve this goat ceviche now.
That will be our dinner.

164
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,794
-Okay, mama.
-Go away now.

165
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,589
Try this one. Open it.

166
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,090
See if it fits.

167
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
This one's for Bing.

168
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,762
Xavier, listen up.

169
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,599
You know I'm always busy at work.

170
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,185
I'm sorry I'm not always around.

171
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,937
It's okay, mama.

172
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,566
Don't stress yourself too much.

173
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,109
You know what?

174
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,863
If only Gelo's dad visits him often,

175
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,449
I would be more at peace.

176
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,618
But…

177
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,663
you're both away from your fathers.

178
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:30,254
That's why I can't wait for your
petition for Australia to get approved,

179
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,590
so I won't stress over you anymore.

180
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,843
You know, mama.

181
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,430
I know you've already moved on
from dad a long time ago.

182
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,514
But me?

183
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,061
I know you don't want me
to go anywhere.

184
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,604
Of course!

185
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
Also…

186
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,235
I feel like there isn't really a petition.

187
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,072
I also can't leave you and Bing.

188
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,449
You're calling him Bing!

189
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,992
I mean, Gelo. Gelo!

190
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,744
I love you, mama.

191
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,537
I love you, too, my son.

192
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,374
Try this one.

193
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,636
Yuck!

194
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,055
You're so lame.

195
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,682
You really believe in that, huh?

196
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,685
Even if that shows you're a match,

197
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,980
if you don't pursue her,
it won't lead to anything.

198
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,900
-Give me that!
-Hey!

199
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,194
-Wait!
-Fajardo!

200
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,200
Who threw that?

201
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,962
You're really getting on my nerves!

202
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,588
We'll have an activity.

203
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,173
Group yourselves into ten.

204
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,467
-Fab girls unite!
-Fab girls unite!

205
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,136
Pretty girls, come here!

206
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,100
Come here!

207
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,480
Pipoy, Xavier, you may also
look for your groupmates now.

208
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,401
Be the one to write
on Manila paper.

209
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,697
Let me join your group.

210
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,699
Are you serious…

211
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,992
Pipoy?

212
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,536
Join our group?
You think you belong here?

213
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,662
Yes!

214
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,123
We're eight in the group.
We have enough now.

215
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,916
What the…

216
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,217
Can I join you, guys?

217
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,345
Sorry, there's no room for you.

218
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,858
Are you complete?

219
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,902
With your size, aren't you complete?

220
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,196
So… you're basically a group.

221
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,788
We still need one member.

222
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,629
Welcome to our team, Xavier.

223
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,592
I thought you were already full?

224
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,136
Yes, we're so full of you!

225
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,471
Go away.

226
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,308
Come here.

227
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,936
We don't have a choice.
Give him two chairs.

228
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,897
We'll go ahead.

229
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,149
We'll try to catch the last full show.

230
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,485
Too bad you didn't want to join.

231
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,195
We have to hurry. Let's go!

232
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,696
Bye!

233
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,114
Enjoy!

234
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,574
Heart.

235
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,243
Heart!

236
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,788
Thank you for earlier.

237
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,794
There's a nearby eatery.

238
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,379
I want to treat you

239
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,340
for saving me earlier.

240
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,220
We just needed an extra teammate.

241
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,263
That was it.

242
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,264
Okay?

243
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,101
So please,
don't act like we're too close.

244
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,228
Too close?

245
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
How about this?

246
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,857
No.

247
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,318
This?

248
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,530
Still no.

249
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,991
Don't come near me, okay?

250
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,247
Okay, I'll distance myself.

251
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,124
I won't get too close to you.

252
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
Still close but not very close.

253
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,304
Since Xavier and I met,

254
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,264
I feel like…

255
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,933
the pain I carry
has become a little easy to bear.

256
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,312
I didn't realize…

257
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,606
he was already making me smile.

258
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,524
-Go!
-You can do it!

259
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,076
Water boy.

260
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,078
Water boy!

261
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,613
I was a mess earlier.

262
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,158
A grand slam in messing up.

263
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,409
So embarrassing.

264
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,956
Is that why you're hiding because…

265
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,832
you're embarrassed?

266
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,712
It's too hot here.

267
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,548
What?

268
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,427
I said it's hot here.

269
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,137
Come outside.

270
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,305
Quickly!

271
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,476
No, I'm good.

272
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm used to looking like a mascot.

273
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,315
I'll be best friends with Jollibee.

274
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,157
Are you sure?
It's your chance to get close to me.

275
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,209
Oh, I haven't thanked you yet.

276
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,379
What for?

277
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,260
Grab these ones too, okay?

278
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,386
Okay.

279
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,637
Thank you, Heart!

280
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,286
Twenty as well.

281
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,955
Ma'am, my vote is for Heart!

282
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,916
Our class president is

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,460
Heart Fajardo.

284
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,328
For those moments when
I thought I didn't need help.

285
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,915
Anyway.

286
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,218
So…

287
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
friends?

288
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,180
Really?

289
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,140
Are you sure?

290
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,892
You don't want it?

291
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,393
I do.

292
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,603
Friends.

293
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,917
Oh, you!

294
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,211
Ouch!

295
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,380
We're friends now!

296
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,465
Xavier.

297
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,969
Were you looking for me?

298
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,680
Stop assuming, okay?

299
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,851
No.

300
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,563
Just wondering why I haven't run
into my new friend today.

301
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,653
Don't miss me too much.

302
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:43,575
I was gone for a bit and you're
already looking for me?

303
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,577
I might get used to that.

304
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,246
Wow!

305
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,538
You're so slim, huh?

306
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,626
Wow!

307
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,127
You're too harsh.

308
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,213
I'm just kidding.

309
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,635
Here's our handout from Miss Luningning.

310
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,805
Study that for our reporting.

311
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,016
I'll go ahead.

312
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,017
Alright.

313
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,150
Are you into photography?

314
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,787
This is me.

315
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,296
You were the-

316
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,047
that chubby kid who tripped.

317
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,775
You mom is looking for you

318
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,069
waiting for the vinegar
she asked you to buy.

319
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,201
You were the kid
who needed vinegar.

320
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,182
I never had a chance…

321
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,893
to see you after that.

322
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,813
After my parents separated,

323
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,607
I moved out with my mom.

324
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,443
Then my dad flew to Australia.

325
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,738
That's why I only visit our old village
once in a while.

326
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,698
I didn't have the chance to look for you.

327
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,493
I was just visiting my aunt then.

328
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,913
But you know,

329
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,668
I saw you when we were freshmen
but we weren't in the same class.

330
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,338
And so?

331
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,715
You didn't even approach me?

332
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,512
So many were interested in you,
I couldn't make my move.

333
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,596
Also,

334
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,807
I'm too shy.

335
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,351
Why?

336
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,312
You're like a celebrity.

337
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,605
Everyone knows you.

338
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,274
But even though

339
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,277
I couldn't go near you,

340
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,614
I'm still your number one fan
mesmerized by your beauty.

341
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,870
You're also slightly cute.

342
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,626
Just slight?

343
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,046
Well, some say I'm good-looking.

344
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,423
Who? Your parents?

345
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
No.

346
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,427
Papa Jesus.

347
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,415
Hey!

348
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,792
Handsome!

349
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,960
Papa J!

350
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,965
Aren't you going to
introduce me to her?

351
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,884
Of course, I will, Papa J.

352
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,760
Just finding the right timing.

353
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:31,970
Heart,

354
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,681
I want you to meet the one and only…

355
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,391
Papa Jesus!

356
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,102
Nice meeting you, sir.

357
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,479
So, you're Papa Jesus!

358
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,481
I thought---

359
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,941
The Lord.

360
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,446
Jesus is my real name.

361
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,866
Xavier's just a little mischievous.

362
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,910
But you, you…

363
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,578
you may call me…

364
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,080
Papa J.

365
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,877
Yeah!

366
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,223
After filling out the form,
we will conduct a short interview

367
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,183
for the preliminary screening.

368
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,977
Those shortlisted
will show us their talent

369
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,397
and that will determine
who will be the 7 contestants

370
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,734
to compete at the 7th edition
of Mr. Awesome.

371
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:32,989
And guys, you have to remember
what qualities our judges are looking for.

372
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,158
You gotta have…

373
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,744
charisma.

374
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,711
You must have…

375
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,048
an oozing personality,

376
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,758
appeal,

377
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,760
and charm.

378
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,429
There he is.

379
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,265
Don't block my view!

380
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,444
Hi, girl friends!

381
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,239
Am I late for the audition?

382
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,490
No.

383
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,543
Wait. Where are you going?
The audition hasn't started yet.

384
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,046
Prince already finished it.

385
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,843
-Are you sure?
-Bye!

386
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,304
One, two, three, down!

387
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,596
You also!

388
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,598
Boys, give me more energy!

389
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,018
Is this Mr. Awesome or Mr. Lousy?

390
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,645
Boys are so irritating!
Even the ones in front!

391
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,939
We've got a lot of work to do.

392
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
Just relax.

393
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,151
-Relax!
-Let me handle this.

394
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,111
Just relax.

395
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,529
Come on, bro.

396
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,282
Loosen up.

397
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,702
I wish I were a contestant too,

398
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,872
so Prince would also massage me.

399
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,292
Isn't it awkward for him
to massage another guy?

400
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,462
Maybe he just wants to be a masseur.

401
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,922
Maybe you're crazy.

402
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,467
Guys, where are the props?

403
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,885
Heart, they're here!

404
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,387
Xavier, where are the lights?

405
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,513
Here!

406
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,600
Xavier, is the sound system ready?

407
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,852
It's ready!

408
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,771
Xavier, where are the snacks?

409
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,818
That's too much.

410
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,404
We relied on Xavier for everything.

411
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,199
-He's the one who volunteered.
-True.

412
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,825
And you took advantage?

413
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,416
You must be tired.

414
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,712
I can see how much effort you've put
into organizing Mr. Awesome.

415
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,547
Thank you.

416
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,300
You also worked a lot.

417
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,386
It's okay.

418
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,846
Because when I'm with you,

419
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,932
I feel awesome too.

420
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,186
Heart, we have a problem.

421
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,979
Jerold backed out.

422
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,898
What are we going to do?

423
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,775
We were set for 7 contestants.

424
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,693
That will ruin our program.

425
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:32,043
Welcome to this year's search
for Mr. Awesome!

426
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,462
Let's give a round of applause

427
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,715
to our seven awesome candidates.

428
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,761
I'm Jay Cañete.

429
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
Girls, I wish I were a basketball…

430
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,890
Why?

431
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,642
So I could score to your hearts.

432
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,104
Do you know what sets
you apart from Rizal?

433
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,397
What?

434
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,025
Rizal is stamped on the peso,
while you're stamped in my heart.

435
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,237
Are you the sun?

436
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
Why?

437
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,074
Because your smiles are blinding me.

438
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,327
Are you poop?

439
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,746
Why?

440
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,165
'Cause I'm 'falling' for you.

441
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,221
Surprised, huh?

442
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,098
Me too.

443
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,933
I'm Xavier Sales

444
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,269
and I believe in the saying,

445
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,231
"If I'm not meant for her,
then that's her loss."

446
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,657
Are you ready for our next segment?

447
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,659
Because this is…

448
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,288
Mr. Awesome's talent portion!

449
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,586
So tired of waiting
I can't keep still…

450
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,633
In the night…

451
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,385
I'll recite poetry, it'll be long.

452
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,804
I'll sit,

453
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,805
and that's it.

454
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,264
Mom.

455
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,350
I brought your favorite noodles.

456
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,726
Mom?

457
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,064
Mom!

458
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,234
My mom!

459
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:54,018
Why is it you I always seek?

460
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,729
Hey, that's enough,
get off the stage now.

461
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,820
Oh, you're on a diet?

462
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,196
That's not you!

463
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,324
Shut up!

464
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,410
Don't talk when your mouth is full.

465
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,953
Hold on.

466
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,915
Xavier, why do you seem so down?

467
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,336
Also, just quit dieting.

468
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,713
That's only for today.

469
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,466
You won't be able to commit to it.

470
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,555
Go, eat.

471
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,311
Mama, he's dieting because

472
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,229
I'm sure his crush dumped him.

473
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,983
Gelo, where did you learn that?

474
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,568
You're just a kid,

475
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,488
and you already know about being dumped.

476
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,823
Is that true? You got dumped?

477
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,116
No, it's not true.

478
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,410
Don't believe this goat.

479
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,332
But you are courting someone, right?

480
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,584
Piggy has a girl!

481
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,710
Hey, Bing!

482
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,464
Heart is not an ordinary girl.

483
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,633
Oh, her name is Heart.

484
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,554
-Might have a chance maybe?
-You're asking that too soon.

485
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,891
I'm too shy to even court her.

486
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,060
Here's the thing…

487
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,979
she's so beautiful.

488
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,523
She's so perfect. She has it all.

489
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,235
My son, it's not about looks.

490
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,198
Xavier, it is how you treat a girl.

491
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,451
You must make her feel special.

492
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:21,249
Your consistency to be with her
especially during her times of need.

493
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,085
That's how you earn charm points.

494
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,439
-You're so lucky.
-I'm not sure if I like him.

495
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,109
Is it the guy from the other section,
their top 1 like Heart?

496
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,819
Hey!

497
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,112
Hey, Heart!

498
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,406
What's up?
Why do you look spaced out?

499
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,490
He's right.

500
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,700
It's been a while.

501
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,077
Nothing.

502
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,079
I'm just worried about papa.

503
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,171
I'm the one who got a text.

504
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,630
Not you, Heart.

505
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,508
Look! It's from 2366.

506
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,386
Kapamilya Meteor Garden updates.
Do you want it?

507
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,637
I want it.

508
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,722
Send it to me.

509
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,182
I'll forward it.

510
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,062
It's mine, Heart.

511
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,482
It's Ramon, my suitor from
3rd year section Ipil-Ipil.

512
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,192
You want me to set you up?

513
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,444
He's kind.

514
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,113
She doesn't want it.

515
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,199
Wait, I'm noticing something.

516
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,784
Do you miss him?

517
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,994
Who are you talking about?

518
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,455
Missing who?

519
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,999
You're being in denial.

520
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,959
It's about the mystery guy.

521
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,711
Oh, he's right.

522
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,171
I agree with him.

523
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,423
What?

524
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,508
Hey, Heart…

525
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,009
hear me out.

526
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,179
From one beautiful girl to another,

527
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,224
if you get overtaken in the honor roll,

528
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,434
you're in trouble with me.

529
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,436
Is she your scholar?

530
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,539
Xavier!

531
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,167
Xavier, wait!

532
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,422
I've been texting you
but you're not replying.

533
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,092
Sorry, my phone is out of credit.

534
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,261
What?

535
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,596
I have no load!

536
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
Are you shouting at me?

537
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,561
Why aren't you answering my calls?

538
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,648
My phone's dead.

539
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,692
I borrow a charger
since mine's broken.

540
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,943
What?

541
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,445
My phone has an empty battery!

542
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,201
Get out so we can talk clearly.

543
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,750
You're full of excuses.

544
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,130
You didn't even say goodbye
the other day.

545
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,884
What I hate the most is when
you just leave without saying bye.

546
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,512
What?

547
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,181
Are you out of excuses?

548
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,895
Sorry.

549
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,262
Wow!

550
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,931
It's beautiful here.

551
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,854
Yes, so beautiful.

552
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,533
Good thing you managed
to get here at Mount Panit.

553
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,077
It's hard.

554
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,954
I struggled so much.

555
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,915
That's just how it its.

556
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,920
What we work hard for
becomes even more beautiful.

557
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,931
Xavier, I'm sorry.

558
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,103
Sorry about what happened
at Mr. Awesome.

559
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,148
I didn't expect things
would turn out that way.

560
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,569
No, it's okay.

561
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,155
What matters is that

562
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,368
you pulled off the event
beautifully and successfully.

563
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,455
It was really awesome after all.

564
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,382
Do you come here often?

565
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,805
Yes.

566
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,270
We used to picnic here with mom
and dad when I was a kid.

567
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,441
And my last memory of us

568
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,818
as a complete family…

569
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,447
it was here.

570
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,117
I'll admit,

571
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:54,040
sometimes I wish we could
go back to how things were.

572
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,047
I know my mom has moved on,
so has my dad.

573
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,424
They both have their own lives.

574
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,181
But sometimes,
I still can't help but feel sad.

575
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,100
Especially since…

576
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,729
we were happy back then.

577
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,738
At least, you're true to yourself.

578
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:33,871
Me, I try to create this image
that I'm always happy,

579
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,874
that I'm always strong,

580
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,503
because it's what my dad wants.

581
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,763
But you know, most of the time,

582
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
I feel alone.

583
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,687
No one understands me.

584
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,859
Well, no one understands me because

585
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,154
I don't show my true self.

586
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:16,414
But I saw the real you
a long time ago. Right?

587
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,544
You're so beautiful in the picture.

588
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,298
Perhaps I captured it
when you were still happy.

589
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,763
I've seen you at your lowest too.

590
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,446
You were there?

591
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,913
I wished

592
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,916
I could go near you

593
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,962
so I could comfort you.

594
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,552
I know how it feels to lose someone.

595
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,143
When I'm lonely,

596
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:25,774
my camera is my only companion.

597
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:35,201
And a photo of my beautiful crush.

598
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,337
Heart, I'm sorry…

599
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,590
I avoided you.

600
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,426
But I promise

601
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,803
never again.

602
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,766
I don't care even if I block your view.

603
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,988
For the first time in my life,

604
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,242
I felt someone understands me.

605
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,452
That I'm not alone.

606
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:23,165
That I have someone by my side
through all the heaviness I feel.

607
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,750
I felt so relieved.

608
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,503
Who is your first crush?

609
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,963
Are you serious?

610
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,757
-Do I really have to answer this?
-Yeah, Fiona?

611
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,384
Are you serious?

612
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,303
Long quizzes don't bother you,
but this does?

613
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,221
So true.

614
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,682
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

615
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:26,520
Heart, I think you got smaller.

616
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,815
Huh? Why?

617
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:34,153
Before, you were just on my mind.
Now, you're in my heart.

618
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,494
Heart.

619
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,205
My house is there.

620
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,668
Do you want to have snacks
before I bring you home?

621
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,713
Don't bother. It's fine.

622
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,299
Please?

623
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,677
I'm sure my mom prepared a snack.

624
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:04,933
My mom cooks the best
stir-fry noodles in town.

625
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,241
Mama, Xavier is here…

626
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,743
with his crush!

627
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,827
-Hey!
-Huh?

628
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,663
Wait a sec!

629
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,418
Mama, this is Heart.

630
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,754
My crush.

631
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,592
Noodles?

632
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,520
Heart, we've already finished
answering our exams, right?

633
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,064
Yes. Why?

634
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:56,360
Can you finally answer me now?

635
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,454
Time to eat!

636
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,788
I'm hungry.

637
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,295
Nothing's left?

638
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,246
-Baby girl?
-Hmm?

639
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,832
Do you know how to count?

640
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:16,917
Why?

641
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,211
Let's see.

642
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,171
What comes after

643
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,881
"I love you one"?

644
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,133
I love you two?

645
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,680
Don't even try to shout!

646
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,450
Heart,

647
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,161
our prom is already next week.

648
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,164
Did Prince ask you to be his date?

649
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,126
No.

650
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,504
My dad also won't allow me
to have a prom date.

651
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,924
You really think
he will ask me to prom?

652
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,593
I don't think so.

653
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,261
Happy now?

654
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,263
You think Prince will ask you?

655
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,807
Wake up, sis! You're being delusional.

656
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,601
You're such a villain!

657
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,978
Fine, I'm the villain.

658
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,148
But I bet your 'Princess' wants to
date someone else.

659
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,108
I mean, Prince.

660
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,069
I smell something strange about him.

661
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,488
With all that smelling,

662
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,657
you seem like a dog now.

663
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,451
And what do you mean?

664
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,202
He smells really good.

665
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,705
Yes.

666
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,749
He smells like cherry,

667
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,501
sometimes strawberry.

668
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,797
Smells like my baby.

669
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,595
Prince, are you going to propose?

670
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,555
Yes!

671
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,765
I will!

672
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,724
No.

673
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,726
I just tied my shoes.

674
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,520
I'll go now.

675
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,147
Bye, girlfriends!

676
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,109
Bye, Princess!
I mean, Prince. Sorry!

677
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,486
Baby girl!

678
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,199
It's done!

679
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,285
Baby girl?

680
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,376
Take care of your heart, okay?

681
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,880
You must only give it
to someone deserving.

682
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,636
Come on, baby girl!

683
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,430
-Papa J!
-Yes?

684
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,684
How can I convince Heart's dad?

685
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,894
Have you seen the fence behind us?

686
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,606
How did you know there's a fence there?

687
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,982
How will I not know?

688
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,234
I constructed it.

689
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,735
Are you kidding me?

690
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,989
Do you know the "fence technique"?

691
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,701
-Fence technique?
-Yes.

692
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,704
Yes!

693
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:03,250
Fence, fence, fence…

694
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,838
I'll guard her like a fence,
so no one can touch my baby

695
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,564
Papa might get mad when he sees you.

696
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,733
Just relax.

697
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,944
I really want to talk to him.

698
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,074
Can I come in with you?

699
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,702
No.

700
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,293
Papa, he's Xavier, my classmate.

701
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,632
Sir, I've got a suggestion
for the prom.

702
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,094
I'm not open to suggestions.

703
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,806
Just trying, sir.

704
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,976
What is it?
You're taking my daughter to prom?

705
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,895
Of course not.

706
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,442
Even if Heart insists, I won't agree.

707
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:23,121
Sir, I'm just concerned with her
since we're good friends.

708
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,292
Too many guys are eyeing Heart.

709
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,836
Maybe she needs a bodyguard at prom.

710
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,637
Well, you're a big guy.

711
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,848
It seems you can easily
guard my daughter.

712
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:42,891
Yes, sir!

713
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,228
I'll be her big fence.

714
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:50,440
And no one will ever
get over this fence.

715
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,359
I'll make sure of it.

716
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,242
I don't think you'd fall in love
with a fence, right?

717
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,415
Heart.

718
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,332
Hi, Heart!

719
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,585
-You look stunning!
-Thank you.

720
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,587
Have you been here for a while?

721
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:23,366
If this is the last song I'll sing

722
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,079
I want you to know that

723
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:33,418
You've become a part of my life

724
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:38,256
And if there's something
I need to say

725
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,427
I want to say you've brought

726
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,766
Color to my world

727
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:55,523
I cried with you

728
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,404
Because of you

729
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:06,201
I have hope

730
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:17,212
This song is for you

731
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:21,299
And if my voice runs out

732
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,594
I won't regret it

733
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,014
Because what you've heard

734
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,893
From my lips is true

735
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,438
Thank you

736
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,233
Thank you!

737
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,889
-Xavier, where are you?
-Papa J!

738
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,767
-Sorry, Papa J!
-Xavier, where are you?

739
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,976
Hold onto me.

740
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,356
You're too excited.

741
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,857
I'm sorry.

742
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:52,700
From the first time I saw you

743
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,788
I was captivated by your beauty

744
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:01,209
I've been eagerly waiting
to be with you

745
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:03,837
Hey!

746
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,800
Papa J, they're here.

747
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,218
Hey!

748
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,345
What is this nonsense?

749
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,264
I'm serious about this, sir.

750
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,226
Sir Mario, this is Papa Jesus.

751
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,271
You even brought someone
named Jesus, huh?

752
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,983
Hey, that won't work on me.

753
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,445
I've already been there
and done that.

754
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,240
-Let's back out now.
-Wait.

755
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,242
Sir Mario…

756
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,957
I just want to ask
for your permission.

757
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,879
Can I court your daughter?

758
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,882
Go home now!

759
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,049
Sir.

760
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,759
I promise

761
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,471
I'll take care of her.

762
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,056
You can count on me.

763
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,767
I'll help you take care of Heart.

764
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,895
I said go home!

765
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:02,979
Now!

766
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,439
Get inside.

767
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,483
Get inside now.

768
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,617
I'll think about it,

769
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,535
I'll think about it.

770
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,796
Heart.

771
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,716
Bye!

772
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,344
Papa!

773
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,358
Have you seen Xavier?

774
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,075
It's Xavier! Let's go!

775
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,580
Xavier, you're such a great singer!

776
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,167
You're so handsome,
I think I'm in love!

777
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,127
Baby girl!

778
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,839
Forget Heart!

779
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,884
Baby girl.

780
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,345
Baby girl!

781
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,304
Baby girl?

782
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,722
Leave me alone.

783
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,516
Just be with your fans.

784
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,643
They're just teasing me.

785
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,193
You can court them if you want.

786
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,736
Baby girl!

787
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,202
I'll just tell dad
to take back his permission.

788
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,787
What?!

789
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,456
Really?!

790
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,004
Ouch!

791
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,841
And now I pronounce you,
husband and wife.

792
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,561
One, two, three…

793
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,397
Prince!

794
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,863
You cheaters!

795
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,534
That was the happiest day of my life.

796
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,663
With the person who makes me the happiest.

797
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,248
It's Xavier.

798
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,001
I don't know, but maybe,

799
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,378
that's what they call…

800
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,380
"first love."

801
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,765
What happened?

802
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,933
I don't know.

803
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,687
You might have run out of gas.

804
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,855
It has gas.

805
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,989
My phone's dead.

806
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,407
Try yours.

807
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,951
Call Dad.

808
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,663
I've got no credit.

809
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,665
Again?

810
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,519
Can it be fixed?

811
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,063
I'm not sure.

812
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,233
Xavier.

813
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,152
The sun is setting.

814
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,696
You promised my dad.

815
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,475
What took you so long?

816
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,311
Sir Mario, I'm sorry.

817
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,855
We arrived late because
my car broke down.

818
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,608
You got me worried.

819
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,945
You should've had your car
repaired before leaving.

820
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,741
Papa, he did everything
to get it fixed immediately.

821
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,870
He walked too far to find
a mechanic.

822
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:57,250
You should've called me
so I could've come right away.

823
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,586
My phone died.

824
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,922
He has no load.

825
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,176
Hey, you!

826
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,136
We made a deal, right?

827
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,723
You gave your word to me.

828
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,895
You're just starting
to court my daughter

829
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:21,107
and you're already showing
that kind of behavior?

830
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,485
How can I trust you?

831
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,320
Sir, I'm sorry.

832
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,780
I'm really sorry.

833
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,992
I hope you can give me
another chance.

834
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,373
Give me your phone.

835
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,624
You are grounded.

836
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,419
You cannot to talk to him.

837
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,587
What?

838
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,798
Papa, that's so unfair.

839
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,177
It wasn't Xavier's fault
that his car broke down.

840
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,682
You're always like that
when you're drunk.

841
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,101
You don't listen.

842
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,147
Get inside now.

843
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,231
You're grounded!

844
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,566
Inside!

845
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,234
Sir, sorry!

846
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,319
I'm really sorry!

847
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,278
Go home now!

848
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,487
Just go home!

849
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,273
Hello, Xavier?

850
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,316
Heart?

851
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,694
Xavier, I'm sorry.

852
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,282
Papa was drunk, so it's hard
to explain things to him.

853
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,994
He has the right to be mad.

854
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,666
He was just worried about you.

855
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,167
I'm also at fault.

856
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,004
I promised to bring you home early.

857
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:08,923
Papa?

858
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,049
Heart?

859
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,092
Heart?!

860
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,138
Papa?

861
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,139
Papa!

862
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,686
Are you nearby?

863
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,605
We're ready!

864
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,068
Stretcher!

865
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,133
Just stay here.

866
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,843
We'll take care of him.

867
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,529
Doc, what happened with dad?

868
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,072
It's alcohol poisoning.

869
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,741
He had too much intake.

870
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,410
He drank quicker than
his body could do it.

871
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,995
We pumped out his stomach

872
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,498
and gave him IV fluids
to treat dehydration.

873
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,668
But alcohol poisoning is dangerous.

874
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,171
He might have hypothermia,

875
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,173
irregular or stopped heartbeat.

876
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:36,385
And the loss of consciousness
could lead to death.

877
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,095
But he's stable for now.

878
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,431
Thank you, Doc.

879
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,558
I'll go ahead.

880
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,813
Just breathe.

881
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,899
Stay calm.

882
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,028
Don't worry, I'll look after your dad.

883
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,654
Me and my mama.

884
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,407
We'll make sure he's taken care of.

885
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,766
Hello, sir!

886
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,393
How are you feeling now?

887
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:30,147
I'm Xavier's mom.

888
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,526
He told me he's friends
with your daughter, Heart.

889
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,823
Mama, is he already allowed to eat?

890
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,910
We have to monitor him
for the next 48 hours.

891
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,704
You can only eat in small portions,

892
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,832
but solid food is still not allowed.

893
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,584
Alright. I'll just buy him soup.

894
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,421
That child of mine is really sweet.

895
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,799
I'll head out for rounds now.

896
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,467
I'll leave you first.

897
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,553
Love you, Mama!

898
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,026
You know, sir…

899
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,991
Heart is lucky to have you

900
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,412
because you're always there for her.

901
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,296
My father is no longer here.

902
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,509
He's in Australia.

903
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,817
I'm always waiting for his call.

904
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,696
No particular reason.

905
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,701
I just want to share
random things with him.

906
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:12,791
When I pass difficult exams,

907
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,462
I really want to share it with him.

908
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,553
The prom.

909
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:32,061
I wanted to tell him
how happy I was that night.

910
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,610
Maybe if he were just here,

911
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,990
it would feel so good
to share stories with him.

912
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,334
I'm sorry.

913
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,213
I might be getting overly dramatic.

914
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,760
I just miss him so much.

915
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:10,474
You know,

916
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,227
perhaps

917
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:20,234
Heart also feels the same way toward me.

918
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,446
Sir.

919
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,619
Heart's only been waiting
for you to come back.

920
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,265
Heart.

921
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:53,976
I'm sorry.

922
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,812
He insisted to come here.

923
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,732
He wanted to see you.

924
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,238
Papa.

925
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,740
Why did you get up?

926
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,366
You're still weak.

927
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:13,454
Thank you.

928
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,543
I'm sorry, Heart.

929
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,795
I just want to be with you.

930
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,505
Papa.

931
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,863
Hello?

932
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,907
Give me that!

933
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,201
Hello?

934
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,497
He's playing with-

935
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,166
Why are you playing with
my passport, Bing?

936
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,667
I don't know…

937
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:01,835
This kid!

938
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,463
There you go,
your dad's call got cut off.

939
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,799
Your brother is so hard-headed.

940
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,050
What?

941
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,593
-Wait.
-It's gone.

942
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,012
Why were you talking?

943
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,555
Here's the thing.

944
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,099
He couldn't contact you.

945
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,934
He has a very important news.

946
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,685
Here's what will happen.

947
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,522
He'll come here for your graduation.

948
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:24,274
Then…

949
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,821
he'll bring you with him to Australia.

950
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,491
I thought that Australia thing was a joke.

951
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,745
We haven't talked about it
in a long time.

952
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,998
Here it is.

953
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,793
It's finally happening.

954
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,379
Shocking, right?

955
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,006
But your brother…

956
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,510
I caught him about to cut
your passport.

957
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:56,849
I'm sure he doesn't want you to leave.

958
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,435
Even though he's stubborn,

959
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,520
he will surely miss you.

960
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:08,944
Mama,

961
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,030
I don't have to leave.

962
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,451
What a waste if you miss this opportunity.

963
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,036
If only I can provide everything to you,

964
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,247
I won't allow you to leave.

965
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:39,808
Xavier, don't leave.

966
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,769
Don't leave us.

967
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:47,566
I promise, I won't call you piggy anymore.

968
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,324
You know, Papa J…

969
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,035
when I first learned

970
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,206
that dad plans to bring me
to Australia to study,

971
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,751
I was so excited.

972
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,754
Come to think of it,

973
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:12,966
I could have a part-time job
while studying there.

974
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,719
I'll be able to earn faster.

975
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,598
I'll be able to help Mama.

976
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:23,852
I really want her to retire.

977
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,856
I also have a promise to you.

978
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,359
I'll get your eyes treated.

979
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,697
It warms my heart…

980
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,744
that you're thinking about me too.

981
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,788
But…

982
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:47,167
like what I always tell you.

983
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:53,215
The way you value me

984
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,761
is enough for me.

985
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:03,767
You treat me like a father,

986
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,772
someone you can talk to

987
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,233
and listen to.

988
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,612
I'm already content with that.

989
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,956
Thank you, Papa J.

990
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,876
You really are…

991
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,547
like a father to me.

992
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:38,760
I can open up to you more
than I can with papa.

993
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,644
I really have to go to Australia.

994
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,815
We talked about it a long time ago.

995
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,737
Xavier?

996
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,325
You're leaving?

997
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,536
You didn't tell me?

998
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,926
Why did he even pursue me

999
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,721
and befriend me?

1000
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:28,018
He even courted me
but he'll just leave.

1001
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,812
The question is…

1002
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,983
how much do you want him?

1003
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,196
But the more important question is…

1004
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,782
is there anything you can do?

1005
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,482
Gelo.

1006
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,656
Stop crying.

1007
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:30,330
After I leave,

1008
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,917
take care of Mama.

1009
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,463
Don't be mad.

1010
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:35,479
They say it's cold in Australia in March.

1011
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,066
I won't be there with you
but when you're wearing that

1012
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,944
it'll be as if I'm hugging you.

1013
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,852
Why are you doing this to me?

1014
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:18,814
Why are you mad?

1015
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,650
It's too small.

1016
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,035
-What?
-Look at Justin's big brother.

1017
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,495
That's his brother?

1018
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,122
Hey, have you seen Xavier?

1019
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:19,124
Hasn't he arrived?

1020
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,917
Maybe he's stuck at catering?

1021
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,752
You know, it's graduation.

1022
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,629
He'll be here soon.

1023
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,884
I see someone handsome.

1024
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:32,220
There he is.

1025
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,931
Paranoid.

1026
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:35,849
Yes.

1027
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:46,693
Mama.

1028
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,279
Where are you now?

1029
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:51,573
I've been waiting for you and Papa.

1030
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,366
They're asking us to line up.

1031
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,660
I thought your dad is already there.

1032
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,748
The ER is swamped with patients.

1033
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,709
Some children are in critical condition.

1034
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,712
I will try to catch up.

1035
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,881
Call your dad.

1036
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,895
Our class valedictorian,

1037
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,564
Fajardo, Heart E.

1038
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,617
Go, baby girl!

1039
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,702
That's my best friend!

1040
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,164
Heart is also the recipient
of the following:

1041
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,416
Best in English,

1042
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,921
Best in Filipino…

1043
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,674
Go, baby girl!

1044
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,929
Best in Science…

1045
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,725
She grabbed every award!

1046
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:05,689
And the Presidential Award
for Leadership.

1047
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,320
Hello, Papa?

1048
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,615
The ceremony has started.

1049
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:19,411
Mama won't make it.

1050
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,413
We're still here in Singapore.

1051
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,206
Our flight got delayed.

1052
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,624
They had a sudden issue.

1053
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:28,253
They haven't given an update yet
on our next flight to Manila.

1054
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,966
So, you won't make it
to my graduation?

1055
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:41,766
Papa, I'm the only one
without a parent here.

1056
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,768
I'm sorry, Xavier.

1057
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,104
I'll call your mother.

1058
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,939
I'll insist that she attend.

1059
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:54,029
No, it's okay.

1060
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,575
You don't have to call her.

1061
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:01,202
She is needed more at the hospital.

1062
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,955
Bye for now, Papa.

1063
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:23,850
Let's now proceed
with the distribution of diplomas.

1064
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:26,436
Starting with Fourth Year-Mayon.

1065
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,272
Lopez, Prince N.

1066
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:42,577
Po, Fernando III C.

1067
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:48,416
Quirino, Albert F.

1068
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:59,552
Sales, Xavier T.

1069
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,237
Congratulations!

1070
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,405
Congrats.

1071
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,287
Congrats!

1072
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,292
Sir, thank you!

1073
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,461
Shhh, not too close.

1074
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,754
Let's take a photo.

1075
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,099
Move a little.

1076
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,143
Look at the camera.

1077
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,970
Thank you.

1078
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:28,933
Cheers.

1079
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:30,894
Cheers!

1080
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,945
After our college graduation,

1081
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,324
let's also celebrate here.

1082
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,494
Will you return?

1083
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,789
Of course, I will.

1084
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,672
Soon, I'll be the one riding that plane.

1085
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,716
Stop joking around.

1086
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:04,052
How will you know if I'm here?

1087
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,597
Of course I will feel it.

1088
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,351
You'll know when you love the person.

1089
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,270
You might say it's cheesy, huh?

1090
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,983
But "love",

1091
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,655
you don't see it,

1092
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,658
but you feel it.

1093
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:35,667
Heart.

1094
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,296
I have two promises for you.

1095
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,842
Even though I'll be far,

1096
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,805
the distance won't matter.

1097
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:51,182
Always remember…

1098
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,477
I'll still love you.

1099
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,488
Really?

1100
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,325
What's your second promise?

1101
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,871
Whatever happens,

1102
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,833
I'll come back for you…

1103
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:26,217
because I love you so much.

1104
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,889
The person I always want to be with…

1105
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,935
is only you.

1106
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:44,986
Even though I didn't want
to say goodbye to Xavier,

1107
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:48,990
his hugs and promises reassure me
that he'll come back,

1108
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,743
that there are no goodbyes,

1109
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,746
that we'll see each other again.

1110
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:03,087
7:02 in the evening,

1111
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,715
you're with Joe D' Mango on Magic 89.9.

1112
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:07,008
It's Friday Madness.

1113
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:09,635
Welcome to the program Dear Joe Radio.

1114
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,929
We're going to play 80's hits for you

1115
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,931
all the way 'til 9 p.m. tonight…

1116
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,767
What if we don't go home?

1117
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,312
Let's just stay like this.

1118
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,814
Happy.

1119
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:32,909
What if the next time we meet

1120
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,411
we won't be like this anymore?

1121
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:40,458
Not happy.

1122
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:45,046
What if things change between us?

1123
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,427
Even if everything changes,

1124
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:55,431
our love for each other will never change,

1125
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,685
especially my love for you.

1126
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,566
Xavier.

1127
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,367
I've been waiting for you
to wake up for days.

1128
01:30:58,369 --> 01:30:59,620
Really?

1129
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,126
What happened to your flight?

1130
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,006
Don't think about it.

1131
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,134
You know,

1132
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,096
I won't leave without saying goodbye.

1133
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:20,224
I know you don't want that.

1134
01:31:27,356 --> 01:31:29,775
But you'll still leave me.

1135
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,695
Not anymore.

1136
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,533
Get well soon, okay?

1137
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,913
Come on, give me a smile.

1138
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:49,962
There.

1139
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:53,090
I'll carry your smile with me
on my flight.

1140
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:57,887
When will we see each other again?

1141
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:04,602
Just…

1142
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,940
close your eyes…

1143
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:11,859
whenever you want to see me.

1144
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,491
Really?

1145
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,034
Yes.

1146
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,202
Papa?

1147
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,304
Where's Xavier?

1148
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:33,733
Heart.

1149
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,705
He's gone.

1150
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,502
What?

1151
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:56,630
Where is he?

1152
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,760
He said he's not leaving anymore.

1153
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:04,638
When was his flight?

1154
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:14,732
Heart.

1155
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,569
Xavier, didn't make it.

1156
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:22,865
And you, your eyes got affected.

1157
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:25,701
You could've gone blind

1158
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:29,914
but Xavier gave his eyes for you.

1159
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:45,304
No.

1160
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,264
No, Papa.

1161
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:50,726
That's not what he told me.

1162
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:54,605
He said he will just be here.

1163
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:58,275
He said he will stay, Papa.

1164
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:01,195
I hope so.

1165
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,825
I hope my son is still here.

1166
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:17,211
I'm glad…

1167
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,258
he was able to give you his eyes.

1168
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,271
His memory lives on.

1169
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,523
Be strong.

1170
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,869
I'm sorry, Papa J.

1171
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,123
I didn't visit you right away.

1172
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:44,048
I didn't want to remember the things
that remind me of Xavier.

1173
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:49,929
He loves you…

1174
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:52,848
so it's harder.

1175
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,896
It hurts.

1176
01:37:00,397 --> 01:37:02,191
But you know,

1177
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:06,695
even if you close your eyes

1178
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:09,573
because you don't want to see

1179
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:16,413
anything that will remind him of you…

1180
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,128
the heart cannot avoid it.

1181
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:25,631
Even if you cover it,

1182
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,718
your heart will not go blind.

1183
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:35,391
It will always feel.

1184
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:41,230
Your love will remain.

1185
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:47,403
Like Xavier's love for you.

1186
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:51,740
It will never change.

1187
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,869
But he's gone, Papa J.

1188
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,664
No.

1189
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,208
No, my child.

1190
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,921
As long as the wind blows,

1191
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,425
he'll be in our midst.

1192
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,052
And in my heart,

1193
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,722
in my heart,

1194
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,225
I know…

1195
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:23,314
I know he's happy

1196
01:38:24,773 --> 01:38:26,483
because

1197
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:30,779
you'll continue to live

1198
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,994
looking at a bright future

1199
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:41,373
with his memory.

1200
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,493
Miss.

1201
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,495
Miss?

1202
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:23,874
I'm sorry, sir.

1203
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:27,795
It's okay.

1204
01:39:27,878 --> 01:39:30,214
We all go through something.

1205
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,385
That's the thing…

1206
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:41,684
why do some people
just come and leave?

1207
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:44,937
Is that how it is?

1208
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,648
They'll be here for a while

1209
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,525
then just leave?

1210
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:00,160
You know, sometimes in
the blink of an eye

1211
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,913
there are people who disappear
from our lives,

1212
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:05,290
people we love.

1213
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:11,922
And even if we want to
bring back the hands of time,

1214
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:13,507
we can't bring them back.

1215
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,426
Even if we want to, we cannot.

1216
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,011
We can never bring back the past.

1217
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,723
As they say, when we love,

1218
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,641
even if we love someone,

1219
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:23,767
even if we fail,

1220
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,520
even if we lose that love,

1221
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,816
what matters is not how long we have loved

1222
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:33,652
what matters is that we have loved at all.

1223
01:40:36,488 --> 01:40:37,573
Heart,

1224
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:40,033
don't be sad.

1225
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,745
God is still writing your story.

1226
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:49,752
Grief is the price we have to pay
for love.

1227
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:52,296
But no matter how painful it is,

1228
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:54,339
no matter how hard it is,

1229
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:56,675
pain will always be the foundation

1230
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,261
on which beautiful things are built.

1231
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,972
Even if the people we cherish

1232
01:41:02,055 --> 01:41:04,308
remind us of what we have lost

1233
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:06,435
and brings us pain,

1234
01:41:06,518 --> 01:41:08,312
we will become stronger

1235
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:10,814
for having experienced them

1236
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:13,358
and their love will always remain alive

1237
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:15,486
in the echoes of our hearts.

1238
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,946
In our brokenness,

1239
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,617
God is going to make
something beautiful in our lives.

1240
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:23,452
And when He does,

1241
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:25,913
it will not be our last goodbye,

1242
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,122
but the start…

1243
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,333
of a beautiful forever.
