 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,510
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,700
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,640
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,570
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,480
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,550
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,120
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,660
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,810
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,840
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,820
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,900
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,690
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,990
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,860
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,240
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,310
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,380
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,450
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,410
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,660
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,090
   

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,960
     

27
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,910
How could it disappear from my cellphone?

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,640
Did your hand slip and accidentally delete it?

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,330
 Probably not. 

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,020
 Did you click the wrong button? 

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,170
Erxi, I always felt that you were a very good girl

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,740
and a good friend.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,120
Who wants to be friends with you?

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,620
Why are those two together?

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,540
 ♫ I spent another Valentine's Day ♫ 

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,920
 ♫ Alone in silence ♫ 

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,740
 ♫ I don't want contact out of sympathy ♫ 

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,680
 ♫ Being free in loneliness ♫ 

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,880
 ♫ Feigning strength with a fragile heart ♫ 

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,960
 ♫ I want to meet someone with a sincere heart ♫ 

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,320
 ♫ I want to hear a word of love that I can believe. 
I want to know ♫ 

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,660
 ♫ I am no longer an empty shell and let myself ♫ 

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,580
 ♫ be cherished and indulged ♫ 

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:03,110


45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,350
 Here are the resumes for the applicants. Please have a look. 

46
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,060
 Thanks. 

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,680
Organize these documents and get them ready before noon.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,130
Erxi, print three copies of the files on the hard drive

49
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,310
and bind them according to their order.

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,680
And these, too.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,010
Once they are reviewed by the departments, bring them back for me to sign.

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,180
Zhao Erxi, Manager Zhen wants to see you in his office.

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,930
He's waiting for you now. Go now.

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,690
What is going on?

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,900
Counterattack?

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,120
Come in.

57
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,910
Manager Zhen.

58
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,780
Close the door.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
I merely want to ask you a few questions. Don't be nervous.

60
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,410
Take a seat.

61
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,180
Sit.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,390
You are not Luwei Weiwei, right?

63
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,850
I'm not.

64
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,680
Why did you say you were during the interview?

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,220
Because the interviewer asked if I had any gaming experience.

66
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,630
I didn't have any.

67
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,170
Hence, I borrowed my roommate's username.

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,190
Did the company hire me because I said that I was Luwei Weiwei?

69
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,210
You could say that.

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,790
So, she's your roommate?

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,070
So, she's not from Beijing Institute of Technology.

72
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,390
She's your schoolmate from Tsinghua University?

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,200
What's her name then?

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,230
Manager Zhen, if there are no further questions related to work,

75
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,320
I will leave now.

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,160
Don't leave.

77
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,310
She's from Tsinghua University. She lied to me that she was from Beijing Institute of Technology.

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,300
Why do girls from Tsinghua University have such bad tempers?

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,430
Now I have time and can do it myself.

80
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,210
About this, I should do this myself.

81
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,050
I will organize these files myself.

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,530
 Zhao Erxi, you are such a joke. 

83
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,250
 So actually everything you have, 

84
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,550
 including my heroic role in the game, 

85
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,220
 this cushy job, 

86
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,050
 are all thanks to Bei Weiwei. 

87
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,450
   

88
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,450
These are some suggestions I have regarding the new family system. There are also some ideas and thoughts.

89
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,500
Take your time to look over them.

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,480
I'm taking off early today.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,460
Be careful on your way home.

92
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,760
Okay.

93
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,420
What are you doing?

94
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,310
I'm moving back to the school's dormitory.

95
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,740
I know a post-graduate with a vacant bed in her dormitory that I can use.

96
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,350
Don't be rash. Let's talk things over.

97
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,080
Why did you tell Cao Guang that I was Huantian Xidi?

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,660
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

99
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,070
It's not that. Cao Guang mistook that I was two-timing.

100
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,920
When I went to reason with him about it, I found out what had happened.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,410
I never told him that you were Huantian Xidi,

102
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,670
but... he may have guessed it himself.

103
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,980
Sorry, I wrongly accused you.

104
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,060
I should have known you are not that kind of person.

105
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,820
Then... are we good now?

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,530
Weiwei, you are prettier,

107
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,590
smarter and more popular than I.

108
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,900
I have always been aware of this.

109
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,720
I have never thought about competing with you about anything.

110
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,390
But why is it that everything I have

111
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,280
must depend on your name to get them?

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,430
About my job, the treatment I enjoy,

113
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,810
and the person whom I liked,

114
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,650
because they all mistook me for you;  all landed in my lap.

115
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,680
Weiwei, if you were me, what would you have done?

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm not blaming you,

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,130
but I really don't know how to face you.

118
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,710
Here's the money I owe you, and I am giving it back to you.

119
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm moving back to the school dormitory.

120
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,310
You said that you don't blame me.

121
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,690
Aren't you blaming me by doing this?

122
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,250
You said... everything is because of me.

123
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,290
Fine. You don't need to leave.

124
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,070
I will leave instead.

125
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,410
 This is for you. This cake is what I bought as my way of apology. 

126
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,210
 Erxi, Your Majesty, please accept this with grace. 

127
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,340
 It's your favorite cake! 

128
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,550
 Get out! 

129
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,820
 Weiwei, you are prettier, 

130
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,880
 smarter and more popular than I. 

131
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,180
 I have always been aware of this. 

132
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,930
 I have never thought about competing with you about anything. 

133
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,710
 But why is it that everything I have 

134
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,510
 must depend on your name to get them? 

135
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,750
 About my job, the treatment I enjoy, 

136
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,120
 and the person whom I liked, 

137
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,990
 because they all mistook me for you; all landed in my lap. 

138
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,870
 Weiwei, if you were me, what would you have done? 

139
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,780
 I'm not blaming you, 

140
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,340
 but I really don't know how to face you. 

141
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't you still have work to do today?

142
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,860
Coming here so late, would I be bothering you?

143
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,160
You don't need to be this cautious around me.

144
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,150
I will get uncomfortable.

145
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,090
Then go ahead with your work,

146
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,170
I want to stay by myself for a while.

147
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,590
Okay.

148
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,950
What are you working on?

149
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,160
A tool that, based on the characteristics of human eyesight,

150
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,740
can automatically compress the secondary graphics

151
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,060
and simplify the display model.

152
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,880
Are you feeling better?

153
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,650
Erxi doesn't want to live with me anymore.

154
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,920
So I moved out.

155
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,190
I said that

156
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,360
if someone needs to move, then that has to be me.

157
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
A smart girl knows where to go.

158
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,710
Get up. Let's have something to eat.

159
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,450
Xiao Nai,

160
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
will we get into an argument in the future?

161
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,440
We won't.

162
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,310
Why not?

163
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,410
Because even without an argument,

164
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,950
we can solve all problems.

165
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,410
Then... whatever I do,

166
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,470
will you not get mad?

167
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,450
I won't get mad.

168
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,290
Will we always be good?

169
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,080
We will.

170
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:01,510
But... before I also thought that

171
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,860
Erxi and I would always be good.

172
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,010
Weiwei,

173
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,910
she is a tiny part of your life,

174
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,090
but I'm your everything.

175
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,560
In the future, you are not allowed to cry because of anyone else.

176
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,450
I haven't even made you cry yet.

177
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,220
Who said you haven't?

178
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,800
You didn't show up on that day of the final.

179
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,910
And I cried.

180
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,480
Were you really sad at that time?

181
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

182
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,930
I haven't had dinner yet.

183
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,500
Come to help me.

184
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,940
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

185
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,600
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

186
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,230
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

187
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,730
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

188
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,300
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

189
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,920
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

190
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,270
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I'm willing to ♫ 

191
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,870
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

192
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,390
I probably have to borrow some money from you again.

193
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,570
I don't have enough money for a hotel.

194
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,660
You can live here.

195
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,410
It's late now. Just stay here for the time being.

196
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,570
Tomorrow, I'll move to my parents' house.

197
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,470
No need, no need.

198
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,600
Do you mean that I don't need to move to my parents' house? Sure. That's fine, too.

199
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,620
I don't want to trouble you like this.

200
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,050
Actually, if you stay here,

201
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm worried.

202
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,890
I won't do anything to you.

203
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,670
No, I don't mind that. It's just

204
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,410
that I lack skills in some areas.  You will find out about them this way.

205
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,350
What kind of skills?

206
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,790
Cooking.

207
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,130
I only know how to boil noodles.

208
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,540
So, there are things you can't do, too.

209
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,970
I thought you knew how to do everything.

210
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,710
It must be because I lowered your IQ.

211
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,110
That's why you made the wrong judgment call.

212
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,740
Eat quickly, and wash the dishes when you are done.

213
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,200
I remember this is your talent.

214
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,390
As ordered.

215
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,970
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

216
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,410
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

217
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,160
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

218
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,770
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

219
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:18,430
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

220
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,920
Use these for your pajamas.

221
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,390
Okay.

222
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,500
Take your bath. The spare toothbrush is in the cabinet.

223
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,010
As for the rest of the necessities, you can use mine first.

224
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,260
It fits you.

225
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,210
I'm going to take a bath. Go to sleep first. I will sleep on the sofa.

226
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,270
Get a new blanket for me from the closet.

227
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,330
Oh, I will sleep on the sofa.

228
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,570
I'm shorter than you.

229
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,690
My sofa is too small.

230
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,330
It can't fit two people.

231
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,150
Errr... please go and take your bath.

232
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,900
Good night.

233
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,330
This is the Master's bed.

234
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
 Master's pillow? 

235
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,760
 Don't tell me he only has one pillow at home! 

236
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,970
Don't you need a pillow?

237
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,850
Your pillow is too high.

238
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,770
I'm not used to it.

239
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,920
I'll turn off the lights.

240
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,730
Let me do it. I'll do it.

241
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,770
Where is the switch?

242
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,610
 ♫ At the moment when you suddenly stared at me ♫ 

243
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,840
 ♫ At the moment when words became unnecessary ♫ 

244
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,710
 ♫ At the moment when hearts gradually got closer ♫ 

245
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,390
 ♫ At this time, outside happened to grow dark ♫ 

246
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,600
 ♫ At this moment when I almost can't bear it anymore ♫ 

247
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,730
 ♫ At the moment when others appeared to be non-existent ♫ 

248
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,660
 ♫ At the moment when love quietly arrived ♫

 ♫ Words aren't needed, and romance seems so boundless ♫ 

251
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,700
 ♫ A night of limitless possibilities ♫ 

252
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,290
Rest early.

253
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,530
 ♫ Let candles replace all the lights ♫ 

254
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,090
 ♫ Let music replace the sound of speech ♫ 

255
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,360
 ♫ Right now quiet wins over sound ♫ 

256
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,950
 ♫ If you ask me to speak ♫ 

257
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,660
 ♫ I can only say one thing ♫ 

258
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,720
 ♫ Let me become your possibilities ♫ 

259
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,320
 ♫ Let "Yes" replace all the "No" ♫ 

260
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,960
 ♫ Let courage replace all the alcohols ♫ 

261
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,120
 ♫ I furrow my brows yet I'm in your heart ♫ 

262
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,300
 ♫ If you ask me to choose, I can only love one person ♫ 

263
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,530
 ♫ Let me become your possibilities ♫ 

264
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,370
 ♫ At the moment when you suddenly stared at me ♫

 ♫ and romance seems so boundless. A night of limitless possibilities ♫ 

274
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,670
Are you awake?

275
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,950
Get freshened up first. We are going jogging later.

276
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,300
What? But I don't have any clothes for jogging?

277
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,880
I have them.

278
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,330
Do you jog every morning?

279
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,750
When I was in school, every morning,

280
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,270
I would jog at the track field.

281
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,550
There are many people at school. Why didn't I see you there before?

282
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,780
I guess I got up earlier than you.

283
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,310
Actually, I saw you there.

284
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,250
My legs are not as long as yours. Slow down.

285
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,430
Eh?

286
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,490
- Professor Li. 
- Here to jog again?

287
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,940
This is...?

288
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,160
She's my girlfriend, Weiwei.

289
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,990
This is Professor Li Cheng from the Economics Department.

290
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,530
- Hello, Professor Li. 
- Hello.

291
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,670
We will go ahead then.

292
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,390
Bye-bye.

293
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,670
This kid...

294
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:51,080


295
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,810
Stinky Brat, when are you going to start dating and get married?

296
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,390
You're almost 30 (years old).

297
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,190
Look at Xiao Nai, only 22 years old

298
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,880
and he already brought his girlfriend home.

299
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,200
Do you want to eat breakfast outside or at home?

300
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,830
Outside!

301
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,120
I mean the difference between your appearance

302
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,940
and the noodles you cooked is really big. They taste rather ordinary.

303
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,770
So already starting to dislike me?

304
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,700
How did I?  This is called honesty.

305
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,520
I know a good place. I'll take you there.

306
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,300
Let's go! What's wrong?

307
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,770
Third Brother,  you're back.

308
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,530
This K.O. is harassing me as soon as he came back.

309
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,140
How is he harassing you?

310
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,390
Senior, how is he harassing you?

311
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,550
Tell us everything. Don't leave out any details.

312
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,690
We will definitely get justice for you.

313
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,610
He insisted that I play that game and team up with him.

314
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,500
How can he be like this? He is going overboard.

315
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,530
That's right. He said that someone made fun of him before.

316
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,330
He must have payback.

317
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,920
The people in the game keeps on changing.

318
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,860
Where will he go to get his payback?

319
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,250
What K.O. said is somewhat true.

320
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,320
It's you, Senior Hao, who betrayed his feelings.

321
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,800
You have to be responsible.

322
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,120
Third Brother, you should help me, too.

323
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,140
This is great. Originally, I was even worried

324
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,260
about keeping K.O. beyond one year.

325
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,320
I don't need to worry now.

326
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,260
Third Brother, you are too heartless.

327
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,670
You are sending me out as the sacrificial lamb.

328
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,410
I'll give you a bonus.

329
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,300
I'll only sell my body for ¥1,000. 
 (T/N: about US$150) 

330
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,840
Yes!

331
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,480
Move aside.

332
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,100
K.O., we will team up later. I will treat you to a nice dinner later.

333
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,240
Brother Mei, your sense of chastity is rather fragile.

334
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,630
Go back to work.

335
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,060
Few men nowadays

336
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,090
protect their chastity like me.

337
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,830
In my view, the price Brother Xiao pays is way too high.

338
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,430
How is Brother Mei worth ¥1,000?

339
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,750
He's probably worth half the price with a little gift.

340
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,770
Let me tell you. If K.O. is successful in getting Hao Mei,

341
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,070
let's change his title to Mr. Beauty.

342
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,470
Mr. Beauty, I want to have a nice dinner, too.

343
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,000
If you can't afford it, you can just give me wedding cakes.

344
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,440
Go away!

345
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,640
We will have a meeting for the Programming Department later.

346
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,890
Junior Sister Weiwei.

347
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,160
What are you doing?

348
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,460
This skirt is the same one you wore yesterday.

349
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,200
Is it because yesterday...

350
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,820
Senior, this is all because...

351
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,450
I'm broke.

352
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,760
So how is it, Master of Programming?

353
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,740
Are these action sequences smoother now?

354
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,490
Can you notice any problem with your perverted eyes?

355
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,260
Optimization has no end.

356
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,450
As a human, you need to have goals.

357
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,370
Are you sure you want me to point out everything?

358
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,240
I beg you on my knees to forget what I just said.

359
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,610
Just pretend I never said anything.

360
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,310
Before, in order to save time and make progress,

361
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,940
there were times the reload window would pop up when we changed the scenes.

362
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,380
We resolved this issue after revisions.

363
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,750
Good.  Let's try the River God's flooding mission again.

364
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,140
Simulate the scenario where many people show up to help in the disaster.

365
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,380
Currently, we've improved the transition time between scenes by 30%.

366
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,500
Previously, there were distortions of the artwork from the graphics team in the game.

367
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,360
The resolution was lowered.  After optimization,

368
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,420
our engine has achieved the perfect results we anticipated.

369
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,190
But when I began the River God flooding mission,

370
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,990
the use of RAM reached 900MB.

371
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,620
This is very normal.

372
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,540
The River God's flooding mission is the most complicated scene in our demo.

373
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,000
There are more than a million pixels.

374
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,820
The content is also very rich. Then we have returned to the original question.

375
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,310
It could become too demanding for the player's hardware.

376
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,860
Third Brother, haven't you been working on this optimization?  How is progress?

377
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,570
The main issue is still the graphics resources take up too much RAM,

378
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,430
because the model is too complex.

379
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,360
However, to simulate the real-time illumination of the enter screen,

380
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,090
we can only use large amounts of space to exchange for time.

381
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,170
I predict that I can finish creating the tool by September 15,

382
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,290
then we can use the tool for automatic model simplification

383
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,780
and graphics compression.

384
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,780
Other than this task,

385
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,530
we have basically resolved the issues from our internal Alpha test.

386
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,040
We still have one more month for our final demo.

387
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,770
We have a lot of free time now. From now on,

388
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,600
you don't need to do overtime on weekends.

389
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,180
However, to fast-track our progress before,

390
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,070
some of our codes are not compliant with the standard.

391
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,340
Its availability is not ideal.

392
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,230
We still have lots of time. You should rework them.

393
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,650
Meeting dismissed!

394
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,300
Let me tell you. Han Yan checked the entire Beijing Institute of Technology.

395
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,170
He couldn't find anything that remotely resembles Luwei Weiwei.

396
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,200
I knew it.  Someone with her looks,

397
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,390
where could she go? How is it possible that nobody knows her?

398
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,520
Am I right or what? She was just pretending to be a college student.

399
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,340
I could detect with one look her "professional" flair.

400
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,280
So it turns out that she was really lying.

401
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,660
Why would Luwei Weiwei do that?

402
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,230
Even if she's not in college, we wouldn't discriminate against her. Right?

403
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,530
Why don't you understand this?

404
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,730
Her real identity must be really embarrassing.

405
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,310
Zhenshui, don't just drink yourself.

406
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,860
I think you should have a drink with Yaoyao.

407
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,780
This is what we call "meeting the right person after bidding farewell to the wrong one."

408
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,460
I am not even in the same world as she is.

409
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,250
Why do you keep on comparing her with me?

410
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,870
Shaoxiang, what's wrong with you?

411
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,260
Waiter, check please!

412
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,210
Okay, please just a moment.

413
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,900
Zhenshui, didn't you see that Yaoyao hasn't finished eating?

414
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,190
I'm paying for the check. You can have your meal.

415
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,070
This meal will also be the last time I treat you.

416
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,880
Do as you wish.

417
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,710
Shaoxiang, what are you saying?

418
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,900
Here it is. Thank you.

419
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,950
Take this one as the going away meal.

420
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,360
Yaoyao, let's break up.

421
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,760
What?

422
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,470
Wait, why?

423
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,610
Why do we have to break up? Weren't we were just fine yesterday?

424
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,470
It must be that tramp, Luwei Weiwei. I knew it.

425
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,410
The way she looks. It would be strange if she didn't seduce men.

426
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,010
Enough!

427
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,400
You keep on gossiping about others day and night.

428
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,340
Don't you get bored by that?  Even if you are not, I am.

429
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,630
That's it.

430
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,700
What do you mean?  Make it clear.

431
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,980
- Shaoxiang! 
 - Yaoyao!

432
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,630
It's all your fault. You just gossip every day.

433
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,850
Now, Zhenshui is mad.

434
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,200
Stupid Zhenshui!  Just wait for the day you regret.

435
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,500
Yaoyao, don't be sad.

436
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,970
There is plenty of fish out there. You are so pretty.

437
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,400
You don't have to worry about getting someone handsome and rich.

438
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,210
However, there are still very few with qualifications as good as Zhenshui.

439
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,600
Manager Zhen.

440
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,500
I want the address of that intern Zhao Erxi.

441
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,200
But we didn't ask for her address when she started her job.

442
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Then think of a way. I want to know it as soon as possible.

443
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Oh right, don't tell her that I asked for it.

444
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,030
Okay, I understood.

445
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,980
Erxi, please fill out this form.

446
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,260
What is this?

447
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,870
Every year after the completion of the internship, we often send to our interns

448
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,170
something like a commemorative booklet.

449
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,700
Why mail it instead of giving it directly?

450
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,310
Please wait.

451
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,300
You worked hard.

452
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,000
Okay, then I will get others to fill it out, too.

453
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,120
   

454
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,190
Bao Gui Gardens? I happen to pass by there.

455
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,400
- No problem. 
 - Then I'll work on this.

456
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,680
Hello, Xiao Ling, I'll just change my location to talk to you.

457
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,110
Hello, Xiao Ling, you can talk now.

458
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,140
What's up with you and Erxi?

459
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,170
 Si Si said that when she called Erxi last night, 

460
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,710
 she found Erxi acting weird. Then she asked her to pass the phone to you. 

461
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,000
After hemming and hawing for a while,

462
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,310
in the end, she said you moved out.

463
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,010
What is this about you moving out?

464
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,510
Are you living with Master?

465
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,820
 No way! This fast? 

466
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,860
I also don't know how to explain.

467
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,050
Erxi and I both need some time to cool down.

468
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,390
What? Don't scare me!

469
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,460
Is it that serious?

470
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,330
Weiwei, you have always been rational.  It's not like you don't know Erxi.

471
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,230
You know how crazy she can be.

472
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,380
 Don't take her behavior personally. 

473
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,020
But I also feel wronged sometimes.

474
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,330
 Huh? What did you feel? 

475
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,800
Nothing. Let's talk again when school starts.

476
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,670
All right! You two must not take this too far, okay?

477
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,400
The way you are now makes me worry about the Feng Shui of my place.
 (Note: Feng Shui is a type of Chinese geomancy) 

478
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,930
Your house has great Feng Shui.

479
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,360
There are many good looking guys at the pool downstairs every day.

480
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,090
 I took a look. The window looks out into the garden. 

481
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,570
 And there is a swimming pool with a cute guy swimming. 

482
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,920
 Hello? Weiwei, what's wrong? 

483
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,810
Nothing. Then I'll hang up first.

484
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,860
Hello?

485
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:28,040


486
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,790
Yang Yang -  "Just One Smile Is Very Alluring"

487
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,040
♫  Rain drips on my jacket  ♫

488
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,840
♫  Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes  ♫

489
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,380
♫  The signal you gave me, a smile  ♫

♫  Came at just the right time  ♫

491
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,390
♫  As I pass by you, the tips of your hair  ♫

492
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,080
♫  Are like grass blown by the spring wind  ♫

493
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,460
♫  Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to  ♫

494

497
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,750
♫  I want to give you a hug  ♫

498
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,630
♫  And make the whole world know  ♫

499
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,150
♫  Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me  ♫

500
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,570
♫  No one else can feel your sweetest smile  ♫

501
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,300
♫  I don’t need to look for anyone else  ♫

502
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,870
♫  Because I’ve already found (you)  ♫

503
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,510
♫  Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us  ♫

504
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,940
♫  Only we know how beautiful our love is  ♫
