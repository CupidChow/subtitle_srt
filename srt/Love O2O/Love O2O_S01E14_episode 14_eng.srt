 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,460
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,610
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,590
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,710
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,630
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,470
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,570
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,130
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,730
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,770
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,810
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,930
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,860
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,970
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,940
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,250
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,180
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,260
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,350
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,430
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,250
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,230
   

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,130
   

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,580
Weiwei, we're back.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,970
- Why do you guys look so tired?
- You have no idea.

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,750
It's close to the finals.

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,740
The library is so crowded,

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,620
people have to fight over the seats.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,600
After studying all day,

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,120
my back and elbows are hurting me.

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,860
It's so nice you get to study in the dorm.

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,960
No need to fight for the seats or to get crushed in the crowd.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,370
You all went to the library, so I had the dorm all to myself.

36
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,820
If it weren't for the fact that the bed had such an attraction to me, I'd never go there.

37
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,850
How did your studying go?

38
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,910
I pretty much finished as I planned.

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,970
It was pretty efficient.

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:25,030
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

41
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,280
Why isn't she here yet?

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,000
  I'm back! 

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,010
 Third Sister-in-Law, you're finally here. 

44
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,360
  We waited so long, even the flowers wilted. 

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,240
 Sorry to keep you waiting. I'll give you your Majestic Beasts. 

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,530
Yes!

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,250
 Third Sister-in-Law, why is my pet male? 

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,520
  Sorry, I didn't notice the detail. 

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,570
 Life is dull, even my pet is male. 

50
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,190
 I can't match Third Brother.  He's now even at a wine party in Shanghai. 

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,750
  With the fine wine in his glass and surrounded by beauties... 

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,200
 Third Sister-in-Law, don't get mad. 

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,820
 We'll educate him for you when he returns. 

54
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,090
  I'm not mad, I'm very pleased. 

55
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,300
 Yugong didn't use the wrong idioms this time. 

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,190
What? I didn't use any idioms, okay?

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,820
  I can't ask too much of you. 

58
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,620
 If it has four words, I count that as an idiom. 

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,910
  The thing about idioms 

60
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,860
  has something to do with my childhood trauma. 

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,120
What's the difference between your trauma and perversion?

62
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,010
  You've all heard of the idiom about Yugong moving the mountain, right? It's about an old man 

63
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,130
  who leads his whole family to dig away at the mountain, one day at a time. 

64
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,590
  I happen to know it. No need to explain. 

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,820
 Great, I'm glad you know it. My name is Yu Banshan, right? 

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,480
 So, I've always said "Yugong Banshan" instead. 
 (Note:  Banshan also means moving mountain in Mandarin) 

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,880
 Because of this idiom, I was punished numerous times by my language teacher. 

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,880
  How is your trauma more bland than my releasing harmful gas? 

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,020
I've known you for so long. I only now realize, you've had brain damage since you were young.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,330
  I'm nice. I won't say anything. 

71
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,830
  Third Sister-in-Law, do you really have that much trust in Third Brother? 

72
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,150
  Shanghai is a world full of temptations. 

73
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,260
 The wine party is filled of big risks. 

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,820
  Isn't he there for the Feng Teng deal? 

75
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,460
 Third Sister-in-Law, do you know about that, too? 

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,230
  We had breakfast in the morning. 

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,800
Darn it!

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,560
  He even told you about that. 

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
Let me. Let me. Let me.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,170
 Third Sister-in-Law, you don't know the whole story. 

81
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,910
  The deal for collaboration is one thing, but why did he need to go to the wine party suddenly? 

82
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,800
 There's got to be a badger game! 

83
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,000
 If we get the project, Third Brother will have the money to get married. 

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,070
 Does it cost that much to get married? 

85
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,200
 He wants to marry the beauty queen of the department. "The beauty queen of the department," okay? 

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,170
  What can you do? Master has no ambition. He doesn't want to marry a rich girl. 

87
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,640
  It wasn't me! 

88
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,810
Si Si, the nuts you bought this time are so good!

89
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,030
I'll buy some online, too.

90
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,300
Just eat, if you want. Drop the pretense.

91
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,910
When did you not mooch off our snacks before?

92
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,270
You know me so well. Then, I'll dig in.

93
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,620
Weiwei, check out the school forum now!

94
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,850
- What is it? 
 - Hurry! Hurry, look!

95
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,880
What nonsense is this?

96
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,060
  Explosive news! The famous gifted writer of our school takes on the gossip beauty! 

97
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,780
 Exciting! I happened to visit the gifted writer's Weibo 

98
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,290
 and discovered a new post! I was simply browsing, 

99
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,110
 but I became more and more excited as I read. 

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,620
 So, I decided to share with you all. 

101
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,320
Who's this Aixiang Nai'er?

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,290
She is saying that Master only likes Weiwei for her figure.

103
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,550
Her tone is so narcissistic, too. It is so gross.

104
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,420
Don't you know her?

105
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,760
Aixiang Nai'er, a gifted writer and campus celebrity.

106
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,610
She likes to write about coffee, music, perfume, ...etc.

107
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,550
She's got a column in a fashion magazine, too.

108
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,640
What "gifted" writer? This is a personal attack.

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,460
Then, who is this Ms. C?

110
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,580
Who else? Didn't you read the comments?

111
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,110
It has got to be Meng Yiran.

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,250
If Zhi Yi's server engine can achieve global illumination,

113
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,720
our game's visual effects will improve exponentially.

114
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,910
I'm not well-versed in the technical stuff.

115
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,810
President Xiao, can you put it in layman's terms?

116
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,010
As we walk through this banquet hall, it is well lit with lights,

117
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,760
and President Feng also comes across glistening.

118
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,270
However, the light on President Feng doesn't only come from the chandelier as the source,

119
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,060
but also the reflections of the light bouncing off of numerous objects.

120
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,280
Our engine can track lights to the maximum extent possible,

121
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,450
to simulate a realistic lighting environment.

122
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,720
President Feng, CEO Zhao of Era Technology is looking for you.

123
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,790
- Then, we should head over. 
 - Okay.

124
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,160
President Xiao, when do you leave Shanghai?

125
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,250
My flight is tomorrow afternoon.

126
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,420
If you're free in the morning, come by my office and have a cup of tea.

127
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,930
No technical talk.

128
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,700
I'd love to.

129
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,310
  Yiran, remember. Be yourself and keep smiling. 

130
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,100
Then please excuse me.

131
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,810
This Aixiang Nai'er is likely to be Meng Yiran's friend.

132
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,750
A woman like her probably thinks that all men in the world should flock to, admire, and love her.

133
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,620
If they don't, then they're shallow and don't appreciate inner beauty.

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,870
- We'll post Weiwei's report card to shame her!
- Right!

135
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,750
No need for that! I'm not the one making a fool out of myself!

136
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,110
Weiwei, are you angry?

137
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,640
She praised me for my looks and talent. Why should I be angry?

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,300
How did she praise you? She is calling you brainless, okay?

139
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,520
A nice figure is a gift!

140
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,140
What's more is, intelligence is something

141
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,850
you can only recognize if you're on the same level.

142
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,370
Weiwei, that's harsh.

143
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,230
That's nothing! According to Yugong,

144
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,010
that doesn't even come close to what Master can do.

145
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,810
Weiwei, do you really have a 34C?

146
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,520
 Let me out! 

147
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,500
Don't even think about it!

148
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,540
- No way! 
  - Let me! 

149
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,750
Who's that in the white dress? She seems into me.

150
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,530
I'll go talk to her and perhaps take her out for some fun?

151
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,820
Don't do that again. Your last incident hasn't been settled yet.

152
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,280
Don't get into trouble again.

153
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,650
It's Feng Teng's wine party. Typically, only invited folks are here.

154
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,850
 - Don't make trouble.
- You are thinking too much. 

155
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,320
 I think she came just to pick up a sugar daddy. 

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
 She is no business woman. 

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,990
 Moreover, she's here alone. Who else can she be? 

158
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,850
She's coming toward me.

159
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,430
Miss Meng... your uncle,

160
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,990
CEO Zhen of Zhen Yi Technology is looking for you.

161
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,500
 Believe in yourself! Your beauty is enough to make Xiao Nai take the initiative to talk to you. 

162
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,750
Xiang Xiang was right.  I've succeeded.

163
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,910
So, she is the niece of CEO Zhen of Zhen Yi Technology.

164
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,920
See. I told you to show some restraint.

165
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,720
 Your wife is bullying me again. 

166
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,490
It seems that you're having so much fun playing with Yugong and the others while I'm gone.

167
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,950
No, I didn't! I have been so focused on studying.

168
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,010
I just logged on for a few minutes to give them their Majestic Beasts.

169
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,250
Then, why do I keep getting texts complaining about you?

170
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,840
Complaining?  Shouldn't they be commendations?

171
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,500
I only gave them their graduation gifts.

172
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,610
The next time I go online, I'll beat them up.

173
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,510
Weiwei.

174
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,800
I meant PK.

175
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,670
Don't hang out with them too much in the future. You will be led astray.

176
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,410
If you want to beat someone up, you don't need to do it yourself.

177
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,960
Let them beat each other up.

178
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,860
To be honest, aren't you the one who led me astray?

179
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm happy that I can be your role model.

180
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,890
Well... I'm short on time.

181
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,270
I have to seize this moment to study.

182
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,330
Take care of yourself while you're outside. Be safe!

183
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,430
Okay.

184
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,000
 Bye-bye. 

185
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,530
Big problem!

186
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,150
- What's going on?
- Hurry and check this out.

187
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,520
Is there something new again?

188
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,060
Can we get someone to hack the forum?

189
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,080
Weiwei, your thoughts are so powerful.

190
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,110
Aixiang Nai'er's Weibo has been hacked!
 (Note: Weibo is a blogging / messaging website) 

191
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,390
It must have been the boys in our department who did it. How good of them.

192
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,510
They are some good friends.
     

193
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,810
Well done! This is how Computer Science Department resolves problems.

194
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,860
Weiwei, don't worry!

195
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,460
No one will remember this after a few days.

196
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,690
Weiwei, did your Master do this?

197
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,790
Definitely not. He would never do something so direct.

198
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,090
Next time, please don't use this tone of adoring admiration.

199
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Oh right, Weiwei! How did your Master react to this?

200
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,850
I... didn't say.

201
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,460
You talked with him on the phone for so long and you didn't tell him about it?

202
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,170
I forgot once I picked up the phone.

203
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,270
Also, Master is very busy.

204
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,440
No need to tell him for such a small problem.

205
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,520
If it's not Master, then who did it? I would love them to death.

206
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,800
- Master is very busy!
- Very busy!

207
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,490
My hands are sore.

208
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,160
Master, we're here.

209
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
Does it suit your muscles, Master?

210
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,010
Lighter, lighter, lighter.

211
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,850
- I'm thirsty. 
 - Got it! Got it!

212
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,540
I'm thirsty.

213
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,150
Here!

214
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,070
Does it feel good, Master?

215
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,710
It's all right.

216
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,520
Once Third Brother comes back, I'm going to make him buy me a huge meal.

217
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,900
Since Third Brother wasn't here, I had to step up.

218
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,620
How dare she bully a girl from our Computer Science Department?

219
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,340
You're right.  She dared to say our Third Sister-in-Law was brainless.

220
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,250
She has even more scholarships than me.

221
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,330
I say, let's not tell Third Brother about this.  I figure he's pretty busy in Shanghai.

222
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,370
Besides, we've already taken care of it.

223
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,900
Also, with the speed at which the news gets updated at our school,

224
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,280
at most in two days, this incident will fade away.

225
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:59,020
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

226
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,680
Weiwei, you're back!

227
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,520
Is there new gossip on the forum again?

228
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,860
No, no! It's just

229
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,310
that Xiao Nai called and mentioned that he is back.

230
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,770
Weiwei, when I was talking with him over the phone,

231
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,370
I accidentally said the words that I buried

232
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,040
deeply in my heart.

233
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,120
What did you say?

234
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,770
I said, "Why is he still not inviting us over for a meal?"

235
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,580
- You are too shameless!
 - Yeah!

236
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,310
What would you do if I was even more shameless than that?

237
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,500
Just say it.

238
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,730
I said... "There's no time like the present. In any case, we don't have exams tomorrow.

239
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,190
Let's just do it today."

240
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,310
Aren't you worried to get another stomachache?

241
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,680
- Little greedy cat!
- Ah, stop!

242
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,900
It's definitely express delivery. Yesterday, I nabbed the prime-time VIP sale. Its arrival time is perfect!

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,690
- Hello, is there Tian Si Si here?
- Yes, that's me.

244
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,780
This is your delivery.

245
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,080
Okay. Thank you.

246
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,850
- How much was it?
- ¥260.

247
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,850
This here is a special sale of brand name merchandise. In the store, it would cost so much money.

248
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,490
Online, it's 70% off.

249
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,470
It's a good deal, right? However, it's not the one from last time.

250
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,110
Yet, I think this one is even more pretty and of higher quality.

251
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,550
Not bad, not bad!

252
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,930
The design is more stylish and conservative.

253
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,960
A maiden from a respectable family would like it.

254
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,730
Am I right?

255
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,100
This dress cannot be...

256
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,130
You're right! It's a present for you.

257
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,200
We're not freeloaders.

258
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Master is inviting us for a meal. We cannot sit there and do nothing.

259
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,220
So, we are giving you a dress as a present.

260
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,280
Last time, when Xiao Ling's Da Zhong treated us to a meal, we also gifted them couple pajamas.

261
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,700
Can you not mention that anymore?

262
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,090
It's the end of the term. Even landowners don't have any rice left.

263
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,610
This is money saved up from us eating only pickles.

264
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,720
So, you must wear it today.

265
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,550
Weiwei,

266
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,570
I was just about to call you. I just ran into a traffic jam.

267
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,970
I will be a bit late to school.

268
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,380
Are you still in the car?

269
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,240
What time did your plane land?

270
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,980
At 3:30 p.m.

271
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,170
For tonight, how about we—

272
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,700
Weiwei, you should remind me about something like this sooner.

273
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,620
CEO Xiao, in the contract here, regarding the copyright agreement of the game is...

274
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,450
- Let me take a look.
- Okay.

275
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,730
All right, let's talk after. I'll hang up first.

276
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,350
Bye-bye.

277
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,990
 Is Master blaming me for not telling him sooner 

278
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,960
 about inviting my roommates for a meal? 

279
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,460
Bring me the dress!

280
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,900
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

281
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,550
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

282
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,100
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

283
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,690
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

284
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,220
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

285
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,830
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

286
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,170
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

287
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,010
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

288
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,630
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

289
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,050
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

290
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,600
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

291
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,330
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

292
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,810
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

293
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,330
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

294
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,110
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

295
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,620
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

296
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,350
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

297
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,610
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

298
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,260
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

299
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,070
Do you have a restaurant you want to go?

300
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,260
We sit in Master's car again. Master's car is indeed different.

301
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,310
How is it different?

302
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,140
This car runs so fast and steady when it gets going. Obviously, it's different.

303
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,770
Of course, it is. This is a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

304
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,430
It has the "select-terrain automatic road-condition" settings. Of course, it's steady.

305
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,270
Huh? What settings? It sounds very high-tech.

306
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,310
Go to learn about it yourself.

307
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,340
Erxi, you are buttering up Master so much. Could you have any other ulterior motive?

308
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,450
You...!

309
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,810
I have  (a suggestion) ! A French restaurant.

310
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,000
- What kind of place is that? 
 - It's a new restaurant with its grand opening today.

311
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,310
No, I don't want to go! Also, didn't you guys always hate western cuisine and only want Chinese food?

312
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,070
- Come on.  Let's go! Let's go! 
 - She's right! She's right!

313
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,170
- Weiwei, we should switch our taste from time to time, shouldn't we?
- But–

314
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,490
Weiwei, let's go with what the guests prefer.

315
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,870
That's right! That's right! The host should go with the guest's preference.

316
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,450
Isn't that right? Is that what I understood?

317
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,670
You're smart! Where is that place?

318
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,970
It's at 658 Zhongshan South Street.

319
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,390
This is for you. "Chanel No. 5."

320
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,900
Thank you.

321
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,250
 She seems not to know about the thing I posted on the forum. 

322
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,820
 Anyways, my Weibo got hacked and the post was deleted. 

323
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,340
 No one would be so thoughtless to bring this up with her. 

324
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,430
 Let's pretend it didn't happen. It really was a miscalculation. 

325
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,050
 Who was so gossipy to share what I posted on Weibo? 

326
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,660
So, how did it go?

327
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,950
Xiang Xiang, you really are too amazing.

328
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,090
Everything you said was all true.

329
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,520
I only needed to be myself and kept smiling.

330
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,370
Then, Xiao Nai took the initiative to talk to me.

331
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,130
You guys get off here first. I will join you after I park.

332
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,430
Let's go together.

333
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,030
Weiwei, we need at least someone to take care of our guests.

334
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,780
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Let's go!

335
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,520
Faster!

336
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,990
It's really here!

337
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,680
We didn't waste our money.

338
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,000
Weiwei, take a look of the person sitting near the column.

339
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,480
Why are they here, too?

340
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,060
Could they be coming here to eat?

341
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,810
Could the girl beside Meng Yiran be Aixiang Nai'er?

342
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,510
Most likely it's her, with that sarcastic look on her face.

343
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,910
How did you know they would be eating here?

344
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,600
Actually, I'm not that sure. I was just browsing her Weibo before it got hacked.

345
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,670
I noticed that she said this restaurant's going to open today, so I thought she might come here

346
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,950
and give it a try.

347
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,540
What are you guys up to?

348
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,460
Hey! We don't even need to do anything and already won, okay?

349
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,380
 I don't like this at all, 

350
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,140
 as if we used Master as the tool for our counterattack. 

351
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,610
 Furthermore, It's under the circumstance that he doesn't know anything about. 

352
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,090
Weiwei, don't tell me you want to flee before the battle.

353
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,360
What fleeing before the battle?

354
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,420
When did I say I want to have a battle?

355
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,260
We clearly came here to have lunch. With what you did,

356
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,300
this simple meal has become so complicated.

357
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,800
Never mind. Let's pretend they don't exist.

358
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,270
Anyways, it's only having a meal at the same restaurant.

359
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,890
Later, you should eat more and talk less. Understood?

360
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,020
But you cannot eat too much, either.

361
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,520
Senior, look at your Weiwei!

362
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,100
No one treats their guests this way.

363
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,850
Senior, we don't dare order anything after what Weiwei said.

364
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,620
It's not a problem. Weiwei doesn't control my wallet for the time being.

365
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,170
Then we will have to take this opportunity to eat more.

366
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,300
Once Weiwei controls your wallet, then we won't be able to even eat pickled vegetables.

367
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,040
Let's go!

368
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,300
Let's take it slow. Things always run their course in time.

369
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,090
Who told you to use such a wrong method before?

370
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,060
 I wonder how Master feels about this. 

371
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,660
 He came here right after he got off the plane. 

372
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,400
 He must think this is just a casual meal. 

373
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,950
 He wouldn't think that we had other motives. 

374
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,580
Let's not go inside.

375
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,450
 Right? Why do we have to go inside? Just to keep our pride? 

376
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,480
 Why do we have to eat there in order to attack others? 

377
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,270
 Shouldn't we be taking this precious time to have a nice meal 

378
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,070
 with my friends and him quietly? 

379
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,040
I don't like it here. Let's change to another restaurant.

380
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,920
Okay, I'll get my car.

381
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,760
Thank you!

382
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,610
If you feel apologetic, you can come along with me.

383
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Go and come back fast. We need someone to play as the host here.

384
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,810
You won't fault me for this, right?

385
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,100
We won't. If you don't like it, then let's not eat here.

386
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,610
You also didn't blame us for plotting this.

387
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,160
Anyways, we already showed our faces to them. We're satisfied.

388
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,460
Weiwei, you actually don't need to mind them.

389
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,530
It's not about minding or not.

390
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,720
If this is a restaurant that serves Boiled Fish with Hot Chili Sauce and I planned to come here for a meal,

391
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,150
even if there were ten Aixiang Nai'ers inside, I would still go in and eat.

392
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,130
However, this is a French restaurant.

393
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,250
You don't like it and neither do I.

394
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,130
Why should we force ourselves to eat something we don't like because of others?

395
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,490
It's totally not worth it. We might even get indigestion. And what's most important is

396
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,930
that we even have to offer up Master's handsome looks.  It's such a bad deal.

397
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,600
All right, I understand. You just want to eat Boiled Fish with Hot Chili Sauce.

398
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,460
Basically, it's like that. You got it!

399
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,930
But if we leave like this, it's like giving up half the way.

400
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,670
Let's not go overboard. Resolution from a distance is much better than an in-personal brawl.

401
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,730
Also, Xiao Ling,

402
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,450
the best way to deal with a hidden enemy is

403
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,370
to remove its chance to get into the arena.

404
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,710
I feel that from the things you just told me earlier,

405
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,560
our strategy is still effective.

406
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,750
Clearly, Xiao Nai paid more attention to you than before.

407
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,940
Actually...

408
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,190
What?

409
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,820
From what I know, Xiao Nai did not really date anyone before.

410
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,560
So, it's a blessing not to be his first girlfriend.

411
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,880
Men need to have some experience before they realize what really suits them.

412
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,450
Is that it?

413
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,350
Of course. How many couples have you seen get married to their first love?

414
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,060
It's Na Na again.

415
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,150
 Yiran, don't believe Aixiang Nai'er. 

416
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,540
 She harbors an ill-intention. She's just using you to garner more attention. 

417
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,530
 You've been used by her. 

418
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,100
Here's the menu.

419
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,810
I have to eat Boiled Fish with Hot Chili Sauce to the point where it costs as much as the French cuisine.

420
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,620
May I ask what everyone would like to have?

421
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,410
Our Boiled Fish with Hot Chili Sauce is freshly cooked with live fish. The flavor is particularly tasty.

422
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,500
What kind of fish do you have?

423
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,340
We have blackfish today. This is our special recommendation for today.

424
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,280
All right, then give me a 4-kilogram blackfish.

425
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,440
Sorry, Miss, we don't have such a big fish.

426
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,990
Will two of 1.5 to 2 kilograms work for you?

427
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,100
1.5 kg or 2 kilograms?

428
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,910
Erxi, can you come with me to the washroom?

429
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,840
You are not in primary school anymore, yet you still need someone to go to the washroom with you.

430
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,780
Erxi, you are representing my image. Do you understand?

431
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,790
Do you want Master to feel that I am a glutton?

432
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,530
But it's something that I ordered.

433
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,320
Master will only think I am a glutton.

434
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,500
Birds of a feather flock together. Do you understand that?

435
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,090
What do we do if he sees the truth through you?

436
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,040
To avoid him noticing the issue of our eating capacity, we cannot expose ourselves like that.

437
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,440
Then how about 3.75 kilograms?

438
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,030
3.6 kilograms. I won't go any lower.

439
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,890
2 kilograms? 2.5 kilograms?

440
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,070
3 kilograms? It cannot be more than that really!

441
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,110
He hasn't married you yet and you are acting this way.

442
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,290
After you guys get married, we would only be eating porridge.

443
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,610
Who's getting married?

444
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,820
Please wait for a moment.

445
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,430
Did you already order?

446
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,350
How many kilograms?!

447
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,350
So careless!

448
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,800
I meant that we don't need to order too much fish.

449
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,660
At most, 3 kilograms. Our stomachs are small.

450
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,160
We can't eat more than that.

451
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,930
However, we already ordered 4 kilograms.

452
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,620
Then what do we do? If we can't finish it all, it will be such a waste.

453
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,290
Master... also ordered us a spicy and numbing crayfish. For 2.5 kilograms.

454
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,070
That much?

455
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,500
Don't worry. I only ordered that after learning about your appetite.

456
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,130
How did you learn about it?

457
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,380
We told him about our last meal together, where you ate an entire plate of chicken wings alone.

458
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,500
Recently, while taking tests, energy consumption has been a little high.

459
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,890
I trust in your ability.

460
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,750
 Who wants that kind of trust? 

461
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,770
 4 kilograms of fish and 2.5 kilograms of crayfish... are you feeding pigs? 

462
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,800
It's here. The drinks are here.

463
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,820
Let's have a drink.

464
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,270
Today, Master is driving. So, he can't drink alcohol.

465
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,540
Master's driving, so he can't drink?

466
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,300
Well, you're not driving. One of you two has to drink.

467
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,360
Cheers!

468
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,490
- Okay.
- Let's cheers!
- Here.

469
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,360
Weiwei, you're drinking too slowly.

470
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,140
Come on. Come on.

471
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,200
I can't drink anymore. Thank you.

472
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,410
These crayfish really are too delicious.

473
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,370
Exactly!

474
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,490
Weiwei.

475
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,180
Why did you stop the car?

476
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,240
Nothing in particular.

477
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,250
It's just... I feel that it's rare to see you the way you are now.

478
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,510
Therefore, I stopped to look a little longer.

479
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,910
Why didn't you go to the French restaurant?

480
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,150
A few days ago, someone made a post on the school forum,

481
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,450
talking about how I only have my looks.

482
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,790
Continue.

483
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,190
That's pretty much it.

484
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,640
Today, they... were eating at that restaurant.

485
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,430
Erxi knew about it beforehand,

486
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,430
so... that's why we went there.

487
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,570
Their names?

488
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Aixiang Nai'er.

489
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,330
And the others?

490
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,640
The others... we aren't sure about.

491
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,000
 Should I say Meng Yiran? 

492
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,020
 After all, it's just a guess. 

493
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,410
 In the event, if it wasn't her, I would have made a false accusation. 

494
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,660
 "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." 

495
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,830
Never mind. Go online and see for yourself.

496
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,970
However, don't make any comments. Just let it be.

497
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,440
I think I haven't been harmed in any way.

498
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,300
Also, Aixiang Nai'er already looks bad already.

499
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,080
Just let it be?

500
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,510
I might not be so tolerant.

501
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,560
Are you really angry?

502
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,600
It really doesn't matter to me.

503
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,450
At first, it did bother me,

504
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,080
but later, I tried to use those words

505
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,450
as motivation to improve.

506
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,740
However, now, these meaningless things

507
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,160
aren't even good enough to be my motivation.

508
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,290
My current motivation...  is you. 

509
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,720
 ♫ At the moment when you suddenly stared at me ♫ 

510
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,840
 ♫ At the moment when words became unnecessary ♫ 

511
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,800
Let's not stay here too much longer. Let's hurry up and go home.

512
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,440
 ♫ At this time, outside happened to grow dark ♫ 

513
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,400
 ♫ At this moment when I almost can't bear it anymore ♫ 

514
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,660
You don't have to drive me to the doorstep.

515
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,140
It's fine for me to walk over myself.

516
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,920
I'll park the car downstairs at my place, then I'll walk you over.

517
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,700
 ♫ At the moment when love quietly arrived ♫ 

518
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,460
 ♫ At this time, outside happened to grow dark ♫ 

519
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,070
 ♫ Words aren't needed, and romance seems so boundless ♫ 

520
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,080
 ♫ A night of limitless possibilities ♫ 

521
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:42,150
 ♫ Let candles replace all the lights, let music replace the sound of speech ♫ 

522
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,130
 We've walked around so many times. 

523
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,550
 If we walk a few more, I'll probably digest all the boiled fish with hot chili sauce. 

524
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,560
After exams, let's have a meal with my roommates.

525
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,340
Huh?

526
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,210
 ♫ Let me become your possibilities ♫ 

527
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,300
You don't want to?

528
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,040
That's not it.

529
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:09,070
It's just...  I've always felt that my situation with Master 

530
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,780
 is in the phase of preparing for a relationship. 

531
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,780
 However, after what my roommates did, suddenly it feels as if our status has been decided. 

532
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,050
 It feels so unreal. 

533
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,490
 Furthermore, he's Xiao Nai. 

534
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,230
It just... feels a little unreal.

535
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:33,060
 ♫ Your possibilities ♫ 

536
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,220
Originally, I didn't want to move so quickly.

537
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,450
Does it feel real now?

538
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,600
Legend has it that a guy ran into Xiao Nai in the dorm.

539
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,760
He rushed up, grabbed Xiao Nai and asked,

540
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,740
 "How do you feel about the situation on the forum?" 

541
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,400
 Better to have it than otherwise. 

542
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,620
Now, this is the question.

543
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,180
What did he mean by that statement?

544
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,380
These six words don't mean much when you first hear them.

545
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,510
However, if you think about it carefully,

546
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:23,420
it's both venomous and acidic, particularly to a female.

547
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,370
The more you think about it, the more venomous it is.

548
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,840
That is to say, about Aixiang Nai'er and Lady Meng C,

549
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,760
what do they not have?

550
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,050
As someone who has studied Marxism,

551
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,670
you need to learn to look past appearance, and into the essence of things.

552
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:42,220
The reason why this Aixiang Nai'er attacked our Weiwei, in the end,

553
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,170
is because she doesn't have any herself, right?

554
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,420
Could this be the truth?

555
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,210
It must be!

556
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,670
Weiwei, how would Master know if you have any?

557
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,100
Could it be you guys have hugged?

558
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,630
Stop! I can't bear tickling! Stop! My mask is falling off!

559
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,070
Enough!

560
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,730
I won't concern myself with your figure anymore. But since we're on the topic,

561
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,520
you have to tell us if you've hugged or not.

562
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,380
I thought about it...

563
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,540
After all, I'll leave you in suspense.

564
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,770
They've definitely hugged already.

565
