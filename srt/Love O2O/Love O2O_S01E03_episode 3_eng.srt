 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,620
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,580
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,630
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,750
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,550
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,480
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,470
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,170
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,730
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,740
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,830
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,010
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,020
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,960
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,230
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,250
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,270
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,400
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,490
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,210
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,050
   

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,950
   

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,180
We're settling a personal dispute. You passerby should continue to pass by.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,330
What kind of personal dispute would require this kind of torture? This is just a game.

28
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,540
Those who don't want to die... should disappear immediately!

29
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,370
I'm back. I'll deal with this.

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,440
Hey! You're too much!

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,820
Exactly. Is number one on this server that great?

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,180
Your way of speaking to women is so disgraceful.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,390
It's just a game. Why are you getting angry?

34
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,240
If so, is that okay for you to just spew insults in a game?

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,640
If so, is that okay for high-level players to bully those low-level ones in the game?

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,290
According to the martial art protocol, let's PK duel then.

37
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,760
You three against us two. If you win, you can take him away with you.

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,500
We won't ever bother him again.

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,550
You can get some rest. I'll take care of this.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
I'll watch.

41
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,990
Can he really beat the three of us alone?

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,500
But I heard he's really good. He's the top master.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,550
- Would he even fight girls?
- No way, right?

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,340
What situation is this? What PK duel? It can't be right, my dear sisters?

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,290
I have already taken a shower, and you're still not done stabbing?

46
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,280
Shixue, it's me.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,090
Mianmian, why are you here?

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,880
I came to help you.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,070
No need. We really have a grudge between us. It's good to settle it.

50
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,090
Besides, beautiful women are for doting. How could I let you fight for me?

51
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,040
Shixue, you...

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,830
What a waste for us to be the good guys! Mianmian, let's leave.

53
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,410
Big Sister, just continue the stabbing.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,700
I still have 200 health points. I'll go to do my laundry now, you should be done after that, right?

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,350
You have a foul mouth, but you're pretty well-meaning.

56
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,880
Never mind. We won't waste money on internet and electricity bills anymore.

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,670
I'll move on to gathering herbs.

58
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,960
- Let's go.
- Okay.

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,100
Wait. Wait. You need to first release me from this Swing Set Chain. Hey!

60
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,230
How did you know Modao Shixue was doing a chain quest?

61
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,270
In the afternoon, I logged on once.

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,620
Then, I saw he was shouting in world chat, trying to collect a large number of majestic beast skill manuscripts.

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,640
Therefore, I knew that Modao Shixue was doing a chain quest.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Why does collecting majestic beast skill manuscripts mean he is doing a chain quest?

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,610
There are several quests that require you to collect majestic beast skill manuscripts.

66
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,770
However, the NPC that's giving out the quest is different. 
 (Note: NPC = non-player character) 

67
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,690
The quest for collecting majestic beast skill manuscripts is the 236th step.

68
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,370
The NPC for that quest is Wunan Dai.

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,890
I waited at the NPC for a while. He appeared quickly.

70
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,870
You even remember which step it is.

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,280
Furthermore, you even remember the NPC for each step.

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,410
Your memory is quite good, isn't it?

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,380
Oh, that's right. You said you saw Modao Shixue in the afternoon.

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,680
Why didn't you deal with him right away?

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,070
At that time, he had completed step 205.

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,230
It's better to wait until he got to the 299th step, the final step.

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,200
Wouldn't he find it more memorable when he fails on the last step?

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,680
You're right. You win, Master.

79
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,910
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

80
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,870
Thank you, Naihe.

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,950
You're welcome.

82
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,370
This was my business to begin with.

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,480
Not because of this.

84
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,650
This afternoon, because of certain things, I was originally pretty unhappy.

85
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,240
However, I didn't want my roommates to worry, so I didn't dare show it.

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,790
Now, however, I suddenly feel very happy.

87
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,620
Because of me?

88
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,450
Yes, because of you.

89
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,970
That's good, then.

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,460
Yaoyao, look over there. It's even prettier.

91
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,220
Yaoyao, Yaoyao! That ugly Luwei Weiwei bullied us again.

92
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,030
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

93
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,620
Didn't I tell you to avoid her if you see her and not to bicker with her?

94
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,820
We're going to be joining their Jade Seas Guild soon.

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,030
We can't be on such bad terms.

96
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,510
We saw her bully someone and couldn't tolerate it.

97
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,500
You...

98
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,540
I have a suggestion. A video contest was posted on the official website.

99
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,180
What if we shoot a video to annoy the heck out of them?

100
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,850
Yes.

101
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,980
What video contest?

102
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,390
Using the in-game recording function to record a segment of the love story in "A Chinese Ghost Story."

103
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,890
The theme is our story, and it will be the same as a short movie.

104
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,490
There's no limit on the length. All the players will cast a vote.

105
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,710
I heard the prizes are very generous. The winner also gets a seven-colored couple's outfit.

106
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,530
That's right. We'll just record a video to help Zhenshui and Yaoyao win, to really irritate Luwei Weiwei.

107
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,460
I don't think it's necessary. There's no need to get the entire server to know about this.

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,620
Even though the seven-colored outfit is really pretty,

109
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,080
but if Zhenshui doesn't agree, we'll forget about it.

110
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,120
Yaoyao, you really are magnanimous. The prize can't be as good as what you can buy.

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,130
- Let's go to check out what other pretty outfits there are.
- Okay.

112
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm going to log off first. I have plans to eat with my cousin. I'll be back later.

113
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,080
- Sure. Then I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,590
I've fixed your laptop. Why don't you double-check it?

115
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,960
Hey, Yiran. Where are you going?

116
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,030
To the bathroom next door.

117
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,540
Thank you, Senior Brother. Um, I have something to ask you.

118
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,920
Go ahead.

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,460
Did Xiao Nai know about this computer repair today?

120
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,700
He knew.

121
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,070
Then, did he know it was Yiran's laptop?

122
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,560
He knew.

123
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,500
In that case, why didn't he come?

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,460
How would I know?

125
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,440
I'm leaving since the laptop's all fixed. Bye-bye.

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,790
Hey, Senior Brother! Don't be mad. Here, have some water.

127
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,320
Don't be mad. I'm just worried about Yiran.

128
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,280
Thank you, Senior Brother, for taking the time today to fix her laptop.

129
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,860
Next time, I'll treat you to a meal.

130
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,960
It's all right.

131
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,140
Thanks for the drink.

132
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,410
- Yiran.
- Leave me alone.

133
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,310
Thanks to your lousy idea, for sure, he's found out about it now.

134
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm so embarrassed.

135
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,430
In the end, my mom was right. Girls shouldn't be so forward.

136
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,550
We should be more reserved.

137
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,810
Yiran, don't be sad.

138
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,720
Just now, I asked Senior Brother Yu.

139
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,760
Xiao Nai just had something come up last minute and couldn't come.

140
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,850
In fact, he also regrets for not coming.

141
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,960
Next time. Next time, we'll find another opportunity, okay?

142
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,100
Really?

143
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,960
I promise.

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,990
Hello, Cousin.

145
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,850
 Little cousin, do you want to have that meal we agreed on today? 

146
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,050
Not today. I'm in a bad mood.

147
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,870
Yiran,

148
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,430
why don't you go? Just use it to get some relief.

149
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,810
And then, you may be able to ask him for some insight.

150
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,710
Fine. Today, I want to eat a feast.

151
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,560
Sure, no problem. When you're with me, you get to eat meat.

152
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,340
Then... 6:30 this evening. When you decide on the place, just let me know.

153
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,140
Okay, then, see you later.

154
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,320
Brother Shaoxiang, I've had many friends recommend me this restaurant.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
I've wanted to come long ago.

156
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you, Brother Shaoxiang.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
You're welcome.

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,350
- Here.
- Thank you.

159
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,020
What's wrong? I'm treating you to a meal, but you're still so dispirited and downcast.

160
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,820
It's nothing.

161
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,340
Just talk to Brother Shaoxiang about it.

162
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,830
You have a secret. Let me guess...

163
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,260
Is there a boy you like? Tell me about him.

164
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,750
Yiran, just tell Brother Shaoxiang.

165
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,140
Perhaps he can give you some suggestions.

166
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,460
You tell me then.

167
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,820
Actually, Yiran is interested in a guy from the Computer Science Department of our school.

168
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,840
Then she asked him to come to fix her computer,

169
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,720
but he was busy and didn't come.

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,820
Does he not like me at all?

171
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,530
That's why he didn't come.

172
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,340
My little cousin, please have some more confidence in yourself. Okay?

173
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,090
Based on your looks, personality and family background,

174
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,060
as long as you like him, which man would refuse you?

175
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,230
He's different from the others!

176
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,700
He's a genius. He's different from normal people.

177
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,550
He usually doesn't like to talk and chit-chat with others.

178
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,420
So arrogant! What's his name?

179
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,670
- Xiao Nai.
- Xiao Nai?

180
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,360
Why does that sound so familiar?

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,120
I remember now.

182
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,650
He's the one in charge of Zhi Yi Technology.

183
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,780
Cousin, do you know Xiao Nai?

184
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,360
Recently, my dad has been looking to purchase a company. It's that company.

185
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,280
- Uncle is going to purchase Xiao Nai's company?
- Yes.

186
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,170
Recently, we've been in constant contact with them.

187
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,410
My father plans to expand to online games and has chosen Zhi Yi Technology.

188
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,010
Since it's a team of college students, its price is cheap.

189
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,890
Then... how is the talk going?

190
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,340
There's definitely no problem. For this kind of college teams,

191
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,940
it's fortunate for someone to be interested in acquiring them. How could they refuse?

192
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,330
Then, is Xiao Nai going to Uncle's company?

193
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,470
You don't even need to ask. Of course, everyone will be part of the purchase.

194
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,200
Yiran, you can go to intern at your uncle's company.

195
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,070
If the acquisition is a success, you will be able to work together with Xiao Nai.

196
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,330
That's right! Why didn't I think of that?

197
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,760
Cousin, help me ask Uncle

198
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,440
to arrange an intern position at his company for me.

199
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,090
Why did you suddenly think of going to intern?

200
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,760
Well, I've got nothing to do otherwise, anyway.

201
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,770
Have a talk with Uncle.  It can be any job.

202
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,370
I can do whatever is needed.

203
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,740
That's not it!

204
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,100
You need to arrange to become an assistant for the Gaming Development Department.

205
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,250
That's right! Gaming Development Department.

206
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,780
It's because of that Xiao Nai, right?

207
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,700
I really am a little curious about what kind of superstar this Xiao Nai is?

208
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,380
He could create such a favorable impression from my incredibly picky cousin.

209
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,260
Hey, Cousin!

210
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,270
- Just help me talk to Uncle about it!
- All right, all right already.

211
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,450
I am getting dizzy from your shaking.

212
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,800
Fine. I'll mention it to my dad for you,

213
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,840
but don't fault me if it doesn't work out.

214
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,600
It will definitely succeed when my cousin takes on the task.

215
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,870
I think this Hua Dun is pretty good. They'll offer a lot of money and they won't interfere with the running of the business.

216
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,990
We already have a very good research and development team,

217
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,580
but we are still rather inadequate in the distribution and marketing channels.

218
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,130
They all have the capital.

219
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,520
Choosing the one with the capital plus distribution and marketing resources can be even more suitable.

220
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,000
Then, what about Feng Teng or NetEase? I think these two companies are pretty good as well.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,190
The key point is that they've extended an olive branch to us.

222
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,950
See. Isn't Zhen Yi Technologies pretty good? Didn't they set up a meeting with you?

223
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,750
Yes. Their head office is in the capital city. I've arranged to meet them the day after tomorrow.

224
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,220
Then, next week, I'll go to Feng Teng's headquarters in Shanghai.

225
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,550
Are we done discussing official business? Let me share some gossip.

226
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,310
This morning, I went to fix Meng Yiran's computer. She noticed that Third Brother didn't come.

227
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,450
It was appalling. She didn't even bother to acknowledge me.

228
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,510
Old Yu, you should have already expected this outcome.

229
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:14,520
Brother Mei, it's so hard.  You are the only one who's nice to us after all.

230
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,900
Hey! Who said you could shake me?

231
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,210
We're done with official business. I'm leaving first.

232
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,580
Are you not staying in the dorms again?

233
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,070
The day you finish washing all the socks that have piled up will be the day I come back.

234
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,900
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

235
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,520
I don't care. During your summer vacation, you must come to the capital city to visit me.

236
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,990
Extra, extra! Three Squirrels' pecans and macadamia nuts. Is there anyone who wants to order with me?

237
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,530
I want two packs of macadamia nuts.

238
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,090
Okay!

239
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,210
We got a notice for the interview!

240
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,170
- Erxi, why are you so flustered? 
- What interview?

241
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,530
Zhen Yi Technology is hiring summer interns.

242
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,990
I've helped submit everyone's resumes, then we were called for an interview later.

243
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,750
- They replied this quickly?
- I'll call you back later.

244
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,070
Big companies are better after all. They do things so efficiently.

245
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,610
In addition, everyone from our dorm passed! They have good taste.

246
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,390
The interview time is the day after tomorrow, Thursday. We also happen to not have any class.

247
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,360
The interview location is the conference room at Zhen Yi Technology.

248
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,530
Then, shouldn't we dress a little more like office ladies, right?

249
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,970
Stop joking! We are students. Clearly, we should dress like

250
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,020
energetic students. Furthermore, they're hiring interns for their Gaming Development Department.

251
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,160
We should dress like... techie geeks!

252
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,000
-   Okay. About this issue, we'll just deal with it like that today.
- Good day. 

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,790
- Agreed? 
- Okay.

254
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,390
Good.

255
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,360
Uncle.

256
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,660
Yiran! How is it that you're here?

257
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,100
What's wrong? Are you not welcoming me, Uncle?

258
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,260
- Welcome, welcome! Don't you have class today?
- No.

259
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,840
Dad, Yiran is now very sensible. At school, she studies incredibly hard.

260
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,140
In addition, she keeps asking me to help her find a place to intern.

261
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,920
I thought that our company is looking for interns currently. So, I brought her over.

262
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,490
Uncle, why don't you let me intern at your company?

263
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,880
This way, I can be at the company every day to massage your shoulders.

264
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,820
You can come here to intern, but I'm afraid it will interfere with your studies.

265
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,990
If so, your parents will definitely come here to settle the score.

266
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,970
Uncle, rest assured.

267
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,460
I guarantee that my study and internship won't affect each other.

268
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,820
I've watched you grow up,

269
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,300
and always treated you as my own daughter.

270
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,800
When have you ever had a wish that I didn't fulfill?

271
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,850
Thank you, Uncle.

272
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,260
Let's do it this way, then. First, be my assistant for a while.

273
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,750
In a while, I'll take you to familiarize yourself with the company.

274
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,270
Sounds good. I'll rely on your arrangements.

275
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,470
CEO Zhen,

276
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,760
Zhi Yi Technology's CEO Xiao has arrived.

277
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,450
Please invite him up.

278
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,540
Also, ask Director Li of the Gaming Investment Department to come.

279
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,960
Very well.

280
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,670
Son, show your cousin around to learn about the company.

281
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,830
Oh, okay.

282
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,700
Uncle, I'm not going.

283
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,290
I want to start interning right now.

284
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,170
I'm going to be discussing some business soon.

285
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,070
I won't be in the way here.

286
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,710
I'll bring tea and pour water on the side.

287
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,670
Is that all right? Uncle...

288
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,370
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,900
Then, I'm going to get ready.

290
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,830
- Okay.
- Then, I'll stay here, too.

291
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,860
I would like to see... H-Hey!

292
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,440
- What are you doing?
- Cousin, don't come in later.

293
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,940
It will be strange if there are so many people there. I'll be fine by myself.

294
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,640
I'm begging you. Just take a walk outside.

295
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,220
Afterwards, I'll treat you to a meal.

296
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,110
- Then, you've promised. Okay?
- Yes.

297
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh, that's right. Am I pretty today?

298
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,420
You're pretty.

299
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,450
Can I use those cups there?

300
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,660
Sure. Use them as you wish.

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,600
Gentlemen, this way, please.

302
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
Director Li is here.

303
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,090
- CEO Xiao, hello. We meet again.
- Hello.

304
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,890
- Director Li, nice to meet you. 
- Hello, this way, please.

305
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,840
This way please, gentlemen.

306
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,240
- CEO Zhen.
 - Oh, they are here.

307
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,840
- CEO Xiao, so young!
 - Nice to meet you.

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,730
Such an accomplished young man. Please have a seat.

309
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,200
After you.

310
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,210
Yiran.

311
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,730
After listening to the briefing from our Gaming Investment Department,

312
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,360
I am very interested about your project.

313
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,800
Yes, our CEO Zhen thinks quite highly of it.  He arranged to meet with you at the earliest opportunity.

314
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,340
- Thank you, CEO Zhen.
- Have some tea first.

315
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,250
 Next person is Li Xiaofeng. 

316
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm done. Thank you.

317
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,590
Please wait, I'll be done soon.

318
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,310
- Thank you.
- Please wait a little.

319
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,410
Why are there so many people?

320
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,650
It's a big company. Everyone wants to apply for the position.

321
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,750
Stinking Xiao Ling and Si Si! They really wouldn't sit together with me.

322
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,240
They must be worried that  I'd steal their limelight.

323
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,340
Erxi, self-confidence is good, but it should be based on real evidence. Right?

324
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,300
Even you are lecturing me!

325
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,620
Wait for me. I'm going to do a little scouting.

326
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,480
- Can you give me two glasses of water?
- Yes.

327
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,130
Thank you.

328
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,890
Thank you.

329
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,270
Next person.

330
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,830
Hello. Can I ask you what was asked during the interview?

331
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,050
Just things like whether you've ever played games, and your user ID.

332
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,220
- That kind of thing.
- Is that so...
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,540
How did it go?

334
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Nothing special about other things. Because we're going to be interviewed by the Gaming Development Department, so they will ask questions...

335
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,980
That is... whether we have ever played games,

336
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,230
and our game ID. What should we do, Weiwei?

337
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,500
Besides you, none of us have played games.

338
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,460
Get Xiao Ling and Si Si to come over.

339
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,160
Okay.

340
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,590
Our company wasn't in the gaming industry originally.

341
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,090
Later, because my son was really into playing games

342
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,610
and he was spending a lot of money on them,

343
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,170
I then saw the potential from that.

344
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,730
So, I gave it a try.

345
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,530
I didn't expect our attempt became a top-selling game.

346
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,060
Our company logically changed our business model as a result.

347
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,290
I guess I managed to catch the latest tide.

348
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,290
RX is certainly an excellent game.

349
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,140
It really was a historic decision.

350
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,430
CEO Zhen truly has the foresight to take advantage of the latest trend.

351
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,070
If you want to succeed, the most important factor is a good product.

352
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,380
And we have been working hard to come up with new ideas to find new talents.

353
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,490
Director Li has recommended to me your invention.

354
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,210
As soon as I heard it, I knew it had the potential to succeed.

355
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:56,360
We're all in the technology business and don't know how to beat around the bush. I'll just state this bluntly.

356
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,490
We plan to invest three million yuan in capital

357
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,610
to buy the copyright of your game.

358
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,590
We hope that you can also come to our company to jointly finish this product.

359
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,830
We will compensate you with a high salary separately.

360
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,490
This...

361
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,270
Actually, our company also has a similar concept project in the development stage.

362
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,980
However, if CEO Xiao is willing to come to lead this project effort,

363
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,380
we will truly welcome it as this will further reassure its success.

364
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,720
We will carefully consider this generous offer from CEO Zhen and Director Yi.

365
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,970
We are truly sincere.

366
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,150
Our company really needs an infusion of fresh talents like you.

367
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,960
That's right. Currently, people like CEO Zhen

368
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,500
who recognizes and invests in young talent from the college campus are hard to find.

369
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,580
CEO Xiao, you definitely shouldn't miss this opportunity.

370
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,700
Of course.

371
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,220
Good, then. I'll wait for your reply.

372
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,830
CEO Xiao, I heard that you're a student at Tsinghua University.

373
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,140
- That's right.
- Oh!

374
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,020
What a coincidence! My niece is also a student at Tsinghua University.

375
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,110
I heard that she also enjoys some popularity at school. Do you two know each other?

376
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,990
I'm sorry. I haven't seen this student in a long time.

377
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,680
Then CEO Xiao must have spent all your energy on your study and business.

378
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,560
It doesn't matter. You're all young folks. You will quickly become familiar with each other.

379
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,500
Should the opportunity present itself.

380
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,710
CEO Zhen, Director Li, we won't disturb you any further.

381
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,610
All right. I also have a meeting soon.

382
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,220
Xiao Wang, please see these gentlemen out.

383
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,200
Yes. This way, please.

384
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:40,980
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

385
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,890
No need to see us further.

386
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,750
Okay. Then, I won't see you out.

387
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,450
I'll be going first.

388
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,120
Do they really take us for half-wits?

389
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,050
They tried to buy out our rights with these kinds of terms.  Are they kidding?

390
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,730
They really think we're stupid.

391
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,290
And you were there deliberating. What were you deliberating? What were you considering?

392
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,770
I lied to them.

393
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,210
You lied to them!

394
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,950
You lied to them.

395
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,900
What was there to lie about? It's fine to just decline directly.

396
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,750
This guy named Li something... did he mean that

397
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,120
whether we cooperate or not, he can still directly use our ideas? I didn't misunderstand, right?

398
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,310
You didn't.

399
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,250
Isn't he trying to bully us into accepting the terms? What should we do?

400
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,500
If they want to use extreme measures,

401
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,120
so can we. Don't worry.

402
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,300
The sinister and cunning side of you just emerged.

403
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,070
Now, I'm actually worried about them.

404
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,640
I can't really accept your praise.

405
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,020
However, we still have to speed up our progress.

406
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,080
Xiao Nai, wait a moment.

407
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,350
Miss Meng, did CEO Zhen have something else to say?

408
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,860
It's not CEO Zhen. It's me.

409
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,470
You two chat. I'm going to the washroom.

410
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,920
Xiao Nai... Schoolmate Xiao Nai,

411
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,570
my uncle's thinking is sometimes old-fashioned.

412
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,640
If he said something wrong,

413
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,900
please, by all means, do not get angry.

414
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,440
Miss Meng, your concern is unwarranted.  It's just business.

415
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,820
Perhaps... I can help you convince Uncle

416
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,170
to get better terms for you.

417
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,170
No need. Also, from your standpoint,

418
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,410
doing so may not be appropriate.

419
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,750
However, I'm very grateful. I'll take my leave first.

420
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,930
I'll wait for you on the first floor.

421
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,490
In the end, the person you liked was this one,

422
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,310
a pauper but with such an arrogant attitude.

423
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,090
Your parents wouldn't agree.

424
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,200
I don't care. As long as I like him, my mom and dad will agree for sure.

425
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,820
Furthermore, he's very good. The more he's like this, the more I like him.

426
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,020
Cousin, help me persuade Uncle

427
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,720
to work together with Xiao Nai.

428
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,900
Little cousin... no, can I call you my senior cousin?

429
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,450
I'm begging you. It's my dad's company. I can't make any decisions.

430
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,160
Then, I'll think of ways to convince Uncle myself.

431
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,550
- Did you memorize it?
 - I got it. I got it.

432
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,870
If they ask what game we play, we answer "A Chinese Ghost Story,"

433
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,960
the server is "Stormy Capital" and my ID is Luwei Yipian.

434
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,230
My ID is Yipian Luwei.

435
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,120
Mine is Luwei Luwei.

436
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,150
Weiwei, why do all your IDs have "Luwei" in them?

437
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,840
In any case, they're all my alternate accounts. Just use them to pass the interview.

438
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,350
Just say... we're all in the same dorm.

439
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,110
It's normal for the account IDs to be similar.

440
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,180
Later, if you need it, I'll give you... special training.

441
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,290
Enough. We know.

442
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,250
Even if we've never eaten pork, we've seen pigs walk.

443
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,620
Who are you calling a pig?

444
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,470
I was wrong. I was wrong. Spare me, Master Pig.

445
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,220
 Next person is Zhao Erxi! 

446
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,160
Here!

447
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,990
Weiwei, why don't you come with me?

448
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,510
Have some confidence. Let's go.

449
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,070
Let's go.

450
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,240
Bye-bye.

451
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,770
Do your best!

452
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,650
Hello, my name is Zhao Erxi.

453
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,510
- Please wait over there.
- Okay.

454
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,200
Let's go.

455
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,380
Sit.

456
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,420
Sir, a call for you.

457
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,350
- Don't worry.
- Who is it? Oh, CEO Fang.

458
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,030
I have time. Come to my office to discuss it.

459
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,630
Until then.

460
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,210
 - Next person. 
- What are you doing?

461
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,760
Cousin, why don't we go to listen in on their interviews?

462
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
What's interesting about that?

463
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,150
I want to listen.

464
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,120
Besides, you must know yourself and your enemy well to win each battle.

465
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,510
At least, I can show Uncle that hiring me was a wise choice.

466
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,750
Anyway, it's nothing to listen in for a short while.

467
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,710
Just a short while. It won't be long.

468
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,850
I swear.

469
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,180
All right then, just a little while.

470
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,890
Okay, that's fine.

471
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,650
Thank you.

472
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,100
- Hello, Manager.
- Don't mind me. Please continue.

473
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,150
Next person.

474
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,030
Nice to meet you.

475
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,300
 - Please have a seat. 
- Okay.

476
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,680
You are... Zhao Erxi, right?

477
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,290
Yes.

478
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,280
We already know about your background in general.

479
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,540
Now, let's discuss why you want to join our company as an intern.

480
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,850
Because...

481
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,660
Because I want to develop my skills while contributing to society,

482
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,840
as I apply the knowledge I learned on design and development.

483
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,070
Your company has your origin in manufacturing cellphones,

484
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,860
and within a few short years, successfully transformed your business model.

485
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,750
This demonstrates that your company has creativity and ambition.

486
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,960
Therefore, I would like to join you.

487
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,100
Do you have other questions?

488
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,690
Just now, you mentioned the gaming industry.

489
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,940
Then, are you interested in game research and development?

490
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,930
- I'm interested!
- Good.

491
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,610
Can you present to us your experience with games,

492
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,680
and the game you are currently playing?

493
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,390
Ghost Story! Recently, I've been playing "A Chinese Ghost Story."

494
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,840
My character is a Red-Clothed Female Blade Master, called Luwei...

495
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,940
Luwei Weiwei!

496
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,050
Luwei Weiwei?

497
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,340
Y-Yes, why?

498
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,570
Which server are you in?

499
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,590
Stormy Capital.

500
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,610
Do you know me?

501
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
 No way, right? 

502
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,590
 My story is about to fall apart. 

503
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,130
 Could he possibly be Weiwei's online friend from the game? 

504
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,830
 Shoot! How could I forget as soon as I got nervous 

505
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,480
  the account name Weiwei gave me? 

506
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,270
 Or even making up a random one would be fine. 

507
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,900
 Now, I'm so dead. 

508
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,570
Cousin, what's wrong?

509
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,580
 Good day, Manager. 

510
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,080
 Okay. That's enough. Please wait for our notification. 

511
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,650
Thank you.

512
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,260
Next person.

513
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,470
Erxi.

514
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,330
- What?
- How did it go?

515
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,530
It was pretty successful. I just made a little mistake.

516
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,800
A tiny, tiny one.

517
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,510
Why do I somehow have an ominous premonition?

518
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,570
That is, I forgot the ID of the alternate account you told me.

519
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,820
As soon as I felt anxious, I told them your main account, Luwei Weiwei.

520
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,740
And here I wondered what a big deal it was. I'll just answer with the alternate account.

521
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,610
Thank you, Master Weiwei!

522
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,110
Oh, that's right. Just now, I met a strange person.

523
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,820
He was with Meng Yiran.

524
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,510
However, he looked so handsome.

525
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,540
But when he heard Luwei Weiwei, his reaction was rather angry.

526
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,520
Could he be your enemy in the game?

527
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,230
I don't know. Don't care.

528
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,770
It's fine as long as you weren't exposed.

529
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,940
Hey, it's my turn. Wait a bit, okay?

530
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,450
Okay.

531
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,070
Third Brother, their company is rather big.

532
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,660
I almost got lost.

533
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,550
- It's your turn? Good luck!
- I also had to wait in line for the men's bathroom.  This proves that

534
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,200
their male to female ratio...

535
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,790
doesn't seem very promising.

536
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,250
- Let's go. 
- Wait a minute.

537
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,690
Just now, what did the school beauty queen say to you?

538
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,950
Did she confess directly?

539
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,360
If you used your imagination on game design,

540
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,780
I'd be much happier.

541
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,440
Stop pretending. She's so obvious about her feelings for you.

542
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,770
Did you agree?

543
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,580
Wow! We sure are lucky.

544
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,830
First, it was the school beauty queen. Now, it's the department beauty queen.

545
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,930
- Department beauty queen?
- Yeah. Look at the one with the ponytail.

546
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,750
Her name's Bei Weiwei. Last year in our school's beauty contest,

547
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,350
she really raised the profile of our Computer Science Department.

548
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,280
She proved without any doubt that there are beauties in the Computer Science Department.

549
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,300
Unfortunately, the result didn't turn out as well as we'd hoped.

550
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,420
But it was an honorable defeat. If she can't be the school beauty queen, being the department beauty queen isn't bad either.

551
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,830
Brother, what are you smiling about?

552
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,070
Bei Weiwei. The name is quite similar.

553
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,490
I should've bought a lottery ticket today.

554
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,530
In my remaining years, I got to see two beauties in one day.

555
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,990
I also got to hear a girl's name come from your mouth.

556
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,600
My life is complete!

557
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,630
The Department Beauty Queen is quite fine. Excess is a deficiency.

558
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,150
What do you mean by "quite fine?"

559
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,270
Now, we just wait for the notification. For those like us with real competency,

560
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,250
I believe there shouldn't be any trouble.

561
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,030
If the interviewers don't know you are rooming with us,

562
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,610
I think the chances of passing will be even higher.

563
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,100
Xiao Ling, come here. I promise I won't kill you.

564
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,840
- You're running?
 - Stop messing around. How old are you guys?

565
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,610
What time is it?

566
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,510
I almost forgot! I need to tutor today.

567
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,850
Then, I won't be returning to the dorm.

568
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,110
When are you going to come back?

569
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,950
The situation is a bit complicated today.

570
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,570
Perhaps, around eight to nine? Don't wait for me for dinner, bye!

571
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,740
- Bye! 
- Bye!

572
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,310
- You're still running.
- Stop messing around.

573
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,430
Hey!

574
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,680
Cao Guang!

575
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
I didn't expect you to really show up.

576
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,220
I asked you to come. Of course, I have to keep my word.

577
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,480
Let's go. I'll bring you inside.

578
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,980
Could it be that no one's home?

579
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,440
- Hi.
 - You're here.

580
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,560
What... are you doing?

581
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,660
 Sister Weiwei, you're here! 

582
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,340
Yes!

583
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,010
Is Auntie not home? Is it just you?

584
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,200
She went out.

585
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,250
You are the foreign language tutor Sister Weiwei mentioned?

586
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,210
Yes.

587
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,450
You don't look like much.

588
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,630
You wouldn't take a kid's words to heart, right?

589
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,350
I am not that ill-mannered.

590
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,090
Sister Weiwei, look at this level.

591
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,670
The designer is really mean.

592
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,550
Wait a minute. Let me introduce you guys.

593
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,460
This is Cao Guang, our scholar from the Foreign Language Academy.

594
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,340
Weren't you looking for a tutor? You could try him out.

595
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,930
This is Xiao Yang, the student I'm tutoring.

596
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,670
Hello, little kid.

597
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,500
You're the little kid.

598
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,340
Did you not hear Sister Weiwei call me Xiao Yang?

599
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,870
I am already 12 years old. That's like two-thirds of an adult.

600
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,950
Sister Weiwei, let's not bother with him.

601
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,740
Let's look at how to beat this level.

602
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,760
I have to check your homework first.

603
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,850
How did you do with the questions I left for you last time?

604
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,940
Reporting! They were a piece of cake.

605
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,620
I only spent one day and finished them all.

606
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,600
Are you that good?

607
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,580
If you don't believe me, you can check.

608
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,990
Let me check for a moment.

609
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,260
Sister Weiwei, I'm a bit thirsty and want cola.

610
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,740
Cola isn't healthy. I'll check to see whether there's any juice.

611
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,900
Thank you, Sister.

612
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,310
Wait for me here.

613
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,550
Let this brother keep you company.

614
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,160
Me?

615
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,570
Has Bei Weiwei been your tutor for a long time?

616
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,570
Yeah. Sister Weiwei is really smart.

617
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,760
That's why she can tutor me.

618
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,110
You don't look so smart.

619
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,280
Just forget it.

620
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,410
Then the way she knocked was something you guys came up with?

621
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Do you understand Morse code?

622
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,820
Of course, I know about Morse code, but the meaning...

623
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,390
But you don't understand its meaning, right?

624
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,170
Yes.

625
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,910
That's understandable. This simple language that can, however, communicate in place of all languages

626
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,480
isn't something an average person can understand.

627
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,460
You mean... she was communicating with you a while ago?

628
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,730
It's a secret code.

629
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,550
Because I'm home alone sometimes,

630
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,110
Sister Weiwei taught me Morse code.

631
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:22,050
She told me not to open the door for anyone unless I hear the secret code.

632
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,540
That's quite interesting.

633
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,610
Then, what did that code mean just now?

634
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,520
I am not telling you.

635
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,470
This is a secret between me and Sister Weiwei.

636
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,370
Okay. Secret...

637
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,670
- Here. Have some juice.
- Hey, Sister Weiwei,

638
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,620
this brother said he's too busy and can't tutor me.

639
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,190
- Since when did I− 
 -Moreover, I don't like to learn foreign languages, either.

640
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,680
Xiao Yang, if you want to become a great programmer,

641
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,110
you must learn English well.

642
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,460
Then, can't Sister Weiwei teach me?

643
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,760
My English isn't professional enough.

644
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,580
But if you don't like him,

645
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,660
we can change one.

646
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,350
Okay!

647
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,820
Little buddy, I'll come to see you again when I have time.

648
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,980
Do your homework well. This time, I made it harder.

649
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,960
See you next time.

650
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,810
Sister Weiwei.

651
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,360
What's up?

652
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,350
Is he... your boyfriend?

653
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,950
What is your little head thinking every day?

654
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,120
- He is my classmate from the same school. 
 - It's good that he's not.

655
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,780
I tested him for you just now. He isn't very good.

656
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,900
I know now. If he wants to court me, I'll definitely reject him.

657
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,840
That's it.

658
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,290
But... I feel you have reached the age to start dating.

659
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,540
I picked someone for you. Tell me what you think.

660
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,590
   

661
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,930
How is he? How is he? Can he get the perfect score?

662
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,640
Moreover, he's at the same school as you.

663
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,040
You have pretty good taste.

664
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,390
But... he is the Master at our school. We can only watch from a distance.

665
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,110
Sister, you are also pretty good.

666
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,990
I believe that you can do it! Good luck!

667
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,300
Oh right, Sister.

668
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,320
The next time you come, let me study your book of gaming tips.

669
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,900
Okay. Then, do your homework well.

670
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm leaving now.

671
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,950
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

672
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,710
In another ten minutes, Xiao Yang's mom will be back. Let's have a look before we leave.

673
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,530
His mom? Why?

674
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,520
To take a look at his mom's car, right?

675
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,060
Otherwise, what if you say that I photoshopped the photo?

676
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,310
There's no need.

677
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,640
I've already deleted the post.

678
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,040
Also, I have to apologize.

679
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,970
Sorry, Bei Weiwei. I've misunderstood you.

680
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:37,980
