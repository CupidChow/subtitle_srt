00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,500
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,570
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,610
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,690
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,730
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,580
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,460
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,430
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,150
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,710
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,740
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,830
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,030
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,010
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,170
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,920
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,350
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,250
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,230
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,490
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,510
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,120
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,070
   

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,940
   

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:42,970


27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,820
You are too amazing. You killed them without spilling a drop of blood.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,910
I am not worthy of your praise. Let's go.

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,900
Let's tackle the last quest for the "Legend of the Condor Heroes."

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,660
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,870
Did you say that you got to the last quest level in Condor Heroes?

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,540
That's right.

33
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,360
Are you talking about the one that's really, really insane?

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,430
The one no couples could complete on this server since the beginning of its operation?

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,800
- It seems to be.
- Wow.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,910
Such an insane quest can probably only be completed by someone insane like Naihe.

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,410
You guys definitely can't complete it.

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,540
Of course, we can't! We're not insane.

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,590
It has nothing to do with whether you're insane. First of all,

40
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,950
- you would need a female companion.
- This...

41
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,940
- Let's go.
- Sure.

42
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,870
Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei,

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,200
what a couple made in heaven! Your love and courage

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,770
allowed you to overcome the challenges one after another so that you could come here.

45
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,400
First, I want to bid you congratulations.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,570
Next, you will face the last challenge in the "Legend of the Condor Heroes":

47
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,560
The Lovelorn Maneuver. The most difficult one of all ultimate challenges.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you have confidence in becoming the first couple

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,510
on this server to accomplish this?

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
   

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,220
 Congratulations. You have arrived at the last challenge of the "Legend of the Condor Heroes." 

52
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,340
 Your partner must find you within 16 hours. 

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,470
 If he can't find you within that time, you will fail the mission. 

54
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,410
 16 hours? How difficult is this mission? 

55
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,320
 Also, they wouldn't prevent us from logging off. Right? 

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,010
 I'll check the forum for info. 

57
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,390
 I just fell from a high place. Can I be at the bottom of a cliff? 

58
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,360
 For Master to find me, does this mean he'll have to jump off a cliff? 

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,970
 Of course, this place 

60
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,030
 doesn't even appear on the map. 

61
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,700
 Weiwei. 

62
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,690
 Master! We can still chat? 

63
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,380
 Yeah. Just now, I received the mission. I have to find you within 16 hours. 

64
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,760
 Tell me about the surroundings around you now. 

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,330
I...

66
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,920
The surroundings around me

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
are very dark, very dark, very dark...

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,680
 Can't you see anything at all? 

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,380
 Nothing! 

70
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,810
 What about sounds? 

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,330
There seem to be sounds of running water.

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,550
 Okay, I understand. 

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,620
I can't just wait and do nothing.

74
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
Since we can still chat,

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,590
why don't I find more information to tell Master?

76
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,310
 Could she be somewhere nearby? 

77
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,610
 Master! 

78
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,380
 What is it? 

79
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,470
 This is too unusual. I just went to the official website to look up this mission. 

80
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,070
 Never mind that there are no strategy tips for players, 

81
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,620
 but there's only a single sentence on the official website to describe this challenge. 

82
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,280
 What is it? 

83
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,820
 You can only complete this challenge through a couple's telepathy. 

84
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,970
 What kind of nonsense is this? 

85
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,500
 It's so dark that I wonder if it's just a black monitor screen. 

86
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,050
 I might as well get some work done on my exam paper. 

87
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,950
The delightful dice is adorned with red beans.

88
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,060
Is it aware of the longing since the ancient times?

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,930
I have already been waiting here for 30 years.

90
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,050
You are the first person to arrive at this precipice.

91
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,280
Thirty years ago, my junior fellow apprentice suddenly disappeared.

92
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,000
I followed his trail to this point

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,460
but my path has been obstructed by the state of play in this Go game.

94
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,230
The clues should be found on this chessboard,

95
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,570
but I am not an expert at the strategy of playing Go.

96
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,590
Young hero, could you help me solve this?

97
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,350
So this is how it is supposed to be.

98
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,550
Young hero,

99
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,120
in case you cross this natural moat and run into my junior,

100
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,420
please give him this jade pendant.

101
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,190
Even after you cross this natural moat, there is still a Lovelorn Maneuver formation.

102
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,820
I heard it's tremendously difficult.

103
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,300
Young hero, you must exercise extreme care.

104
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,850
I have here a secret manuscript to help you pass the challenge.

105
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,210
Please have a look, young hero.

106
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,050
Young hero, this way please.

107
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,320
 All the love you find 

108
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,990
 is fleeting and rarely lasting. 

109
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,060
 Love breeds anxiety, and love engenders fear. 

110
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,870
 Avoid love, and thus be without anxiety and fear. 

111
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,490
 I've waited here for 30 years. 

112
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,900
 I never thought someone would really show up. 

113
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,450
 However, to rescue your beloved partner, 

114
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,220
 you must get past this stage of mine. 

115
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,600
 Are you truly willing, to rescue your beloved partner, 

116
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
 to sacrifice everything? 

117
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,600
  
  

118
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,770
While I haven't attacked yet, it's not too late to turn back.

119
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,760
What's that on your waist?

120
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,560
It turns out he already came to look for me.

121
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,750
Senior, I misunderstood you.

122
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,960
 Young hero, your partner is just at the bottom of the valley. 

123
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
 Let the Paired Lovebirds take you there. 

124
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,880
 These two phoenixes have kept me company for 30 years. 

125
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,750
 Now, I will grant them to you. 

126
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,270
 May those in love be united as a couple at the end. 

127
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,890
 Your husband, Yixiao Naihe, has passed the final stage, 

128
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,860
 "The Trial of the Lovelorn Maneuver." 

129
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,650
 Congratulations on completing the Condor Couple's Quest. 

130
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,310
 Master's way of appearing is way too brilliant, isn't it? 

131
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,990
 Like an angel descending, except he's just missing a pair of wings. 

132
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,550
You found me.

133
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,850
You've waited a long, my wife.

134
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,250
 Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei have completed the final Couple's Quest, 

135
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,660
 "The Condor Couple." They will receive ten million experience points, 

136
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,150
 the title of "First Immortal Couple," 

137
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,460
 and the first pair of two-person flying mounts in "A Chinese Ghost Story," 

138
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,420
 Paired Lovebirds. 

139
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,970
 Wow, a two-person flying mount? 

140
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,670
 A Ghost Story is releasing a two-person flying mount? 

141
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,260
 This can't be the only pair, right? 

142
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,750
 Is Ghost Story going to make available the system for a two-person flying mount? 

143
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,390
 They definitely are! How could there be only one pair? 

144
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,620
 Doesn't the game want to make money? 

145
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,910
So these are the Paired Lovebirds?

146
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,050
However, it seems to be a little fat. Can it really fly?

147
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,440
Come. Let's have a look around.

148
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,600
 I'm finding out that whenever people think Luwei Weiwei is at her most miserable, 

149
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,160
 she turns it into a moment of glory and envy in no time. 

150
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,920
 That's true. Last time, when she and Zhenshui Wuxiang dissolved their marriage, I thought that she was dumped. 

151
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,050
 But as a result, in the blink of an eye, she formed a couple with Yixiao Naihe. 

152
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,450
 So formidable. 

153
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,860
 Could it be that Zhenshui Wuxiang was actually the one who was dumped? 

154
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,020
How did you find me?

155
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,420
There were actually some tips.

156
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,750
Could the Lovelorn Maneuver be the long-rumored Cosmic Elemental Maneuver?

157
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,840
It wasn't as mythical as that. Before I entered, there was an NPC who explained to me how to proceed.
 (Note:  NPC means Non-Player Character) 

158
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,250
About 1,000 - 2,000 words worth of tips were shown for approximately 10 seconds.

159
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,250
Did you actually memorize all those tips within 10 seconds?

160
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,430
That's too inhuman of you, isn't it? Even if you can take in ten lines at a glance, it still isn't possible.

161
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,930
I took a screenshot.

162
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,820
Of course. You can take a screenshot.

163
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,080
Only an idiot would try to memorize them.

164
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,490
I'm an idiot. My brain actually isn't working anymore.

165
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,500
However, it's still pretty impressive for you to take a screenshot within that short amount of time.

166
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,150
Did you leave your guild?

167
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, I left a few days ago.

168
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,520
 Luwei Weiwei, your team stole the kill (kill-steal) of Xiaoyu Qingqing's boss.
(MMORPG T/N: kill-stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for a kill, when another player has put more effort into the kill.) 

169
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,530
 However you look at it, we are all part of the same guild.  There's no excuse for what you did. 

170
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,520
 Shouldn't you give me an explanation? 

171
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,930
 When did Xiaoyu Qingqing become part of our guild? 

172
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,980
 Because of Zhenshui and Xiaoyu Yaoyao, the guild leader accepted the Xiaoyu clan as part of the guild. 

173
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,250
 But this Xiaoyu Qingqing is especially despicable. 

174
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,200
 She's always acting coquettishly and is like a spoiled child towards the males in the guild. 

175
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,650
 She even clung onto the guild leader a while ago. 

176
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,410
 I've already seen those two alone together several times. 

177
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,010
 They even rode on the same horse together. 

178
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,920
 Guild Leader Zhan, why don't you ask Xiaoyu Qingqing what really happened? 

179
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,530
 It would be best if she gave me an explanation. 

180
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,280
 Luwei, what do you mean by that? I know that you are biased against Xiaoyu Qingqing. 

181
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,210
 However, I hope that you can deal with this situation objectively. 

182
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,950
 - How am I not dealing with this situation objectively?
- Hey! You–  

183
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,910
 Xiaoyu Qingqing, please come here for a moment 

184
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,850
 and explain clearly what happened to Guild Leader Zhan. 

185
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,150
 Xiaoyu Qingqing, come out quickly. 

186
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,870
 Xiaoyu Qingqing, if you're not willing to speak, I'll ask on the Global Chat. 

187
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,170
 At that time, there were many teams present. I believe that someone will be willing to 

188
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,530
 explain the situation at that time. 

189
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,560
 I just went out. What's happening? 

190
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,060
 Why are you pretending like you don't know? Isn't it all there in the chat history? 

191
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,260
 This issue? I was just talking about stealing a boss. 

192
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,670
 I didn't get it and said that you stole the boss away. 

193
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,560
 Did I say anything wrong? 

194
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,770
 I didn't realize that Tianxia would misunderstand and run to ask you about it. 

195
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,850
 Based on what you just said,  Guild Leader Zhan deliberately misinterpreted your words to slander me. 

196
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,260
 Guild Leader Zhan, then you should give me an explanation. 

197
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,750
 It's really uncomfortable to be wrongly accused by someone. 

198
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,360
 Xiaoyu Qingqing is trying to take you down through someone else's knife. 

199
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,250
 Then isn't this knife that she wants to use too dull? 

200
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,590
 I got it wrong. It's for the best that it was only a misunderstanding. 

201
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,330
 The unity of the guild is of the utmost importance. 

202
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,680
 But there's one issue that you should pay attention to, Luwei Weiwei. 

203
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,940
 What is it? Please tell me. 

204
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,970
 During Zhenshui and Yaoyao's marriage ceremony, 

205
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,740
 those potions that you were selling at the Vermilion Sparrow Bridge 

206
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,400
 were made using the ingredients of the guild, right? 

207
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,660
 Logically speaking, they shouldn't be for sale by individuals. 

208
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,320
 But since it happened only this once, it's no big deal. Just be aware of this next time and don't do it again. 

209
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,790
 Guild Leader Zhan still remembers something that happened so long ago. 

210
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,140
 If I remember correctly, these so-called "herbs of the guild" in the guild warehouse 

211
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,020
 were actually gathered by me. I used herbs that I gathered to make potions for sale, 

212
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,120
 yet, Guild Leader Zhan, you have objections? 

213
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,030
 That's not it. Luwei, using it like that– 

214
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,220
 Enough, enough. We're all in the same guild. 

215
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,060
 Peace brings about fortune. 

216
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
 - We're all the same guild.
- That's right. 

217
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
 Forget it. Forget it. 

218
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,570
 Xiaoyu Qingqing, as for what really happened, 

219
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,630
 we both know what really took place. 

220
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,650
 Either you apologize to me now, 

221
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,060
 or, in the future, don't let me see you kill a boss. 

222
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,360
 Or else, I'll turn your accusation today into a reality. 

223
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,620
 Luwei Weiwei! 

224
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,810
 Your excessive bullying is intolerable! 

225
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,310
 Would anyone make a mountain out of a mole hill like you? 

226
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,710
 From your high-level, are you looking down on us? We already said it was a misunderstanding. 

227
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,260
 Do you have to bully others when you get the chance? 

228
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,470
 Tianxia, I didn't do it on purpose. Why is she so mean? 

229
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,060
 This is no longer the Jade Seas Guild I'm familiar with. 

230
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,250
 Weiwei, don't be impulsive. 

231
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,080
 Things that need to be said have all been said. 

232
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,420
 Friends, if we meet again outside, 

233
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,300
 we'll still be friends. 

234
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,630
 Luwei Weiwei is leaving this guild. 

235
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,150
 - What?
- What's going on? 

236
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,350
 All things must eventually end. 

237
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,170
 Luwei Weiwei is withdrawn from Jade Seas Guild. 

238
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,350
 - This is way over the line!
- Why is she doing this? 

239
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,510
 - Right?
- That's right. 

240
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,330
It's fine this way. In the future, we'll be together.

241
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,540
Yup! Then we'll journey this world together

242
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,370
as a rogue couple.

243
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,130
Rogue couple?

244
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,470
I remember we had an official wedding ceremony.

245
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,380
You really have no sense of humor.

246
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,850
Social status is very important.

247
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,530
 Fine. Master really does have a sense of humor. 

248
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,770
 It's just a little lame. 

249
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,760
 Even though it's a view that I've become used to seeing, 

250
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,890
 and even when I see it every day, 

251
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,370
 the feeling can still be different. 

252
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,600
 Just like right now. 

253
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,240
 The name has been changed? 

254
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,160
Hey, Weiwei. This mask from Mask Family isn't bad.

255
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,900
Weiwei.

256
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,910
I heard you.

257
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,990
You wouldn't be in the game

258
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,590
doing that?  Right?

259
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,990
Don't worry. I've already finished the test papers and completed the revisions of the thesis.

260
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,370
- This won't interfere with exams.
- Who's worrying about your exams?

261
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,190
Who's worrying about your test papers?

262
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,260
I'm just worrying that you'll get taken by someone.

263
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,210
Bei Weiwei, don't you feel that the way you look now

264
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,060
resembles someone who's really in love?

265
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,340
- Just enjoy your mask.
- That's what I am doing.

266
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,120
Xiao Yu.

267
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Director Li. My apologies.

268
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,720
The traffic around our capital city is really awful.

269
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,050
I took a taxi and the driver took extra care in helping me.

270
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,750
It's nothing. I also just arrived. Come. Have a seat.

271
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,040
- What do you want to drink?
- Anything is fine.
- Okay.

272
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,810
Waiter.

273
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,150
Xiao Yu, did you come by taxi today?

274
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,610
Yes, that's why I was delayed a little on the way.

275
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,640
Hey, someone as talented as you shouldn't be living like this.

276
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,650
The core technical staff of our company

277
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,560
are all provided with a company car and housing subsidy.

278
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,950
Really? Is their compensation that attractive?

279
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,320
They're talents.  We have to treat them well.

280
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,910
Take the technical staff member who came to our company the year before last as an example.

281
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,860
He even bought a house this year.

282
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,350
He even bought a house?

283
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:22,460
You also know that the salary and benefits of our company are the best in the industry.

284
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,460
Xiao Yu, let us get straight to the point today.

285
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,400
I won't beat around the bush with you.

286
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Ever since we met last time,

287
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,740
our company has our eyes on you in particular.

288
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,230
What do you think? Do you have any interest in joining our company?

289
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,320
Director Li, this is a really tempting offer,

290
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,550
but I am really attached to this product I am working on.

291
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,080
Why don't we do this? Let's wait until our game is brought to the market,

292
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,880
and then I will come over. It still sounds reasonable that way.

293
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,200
Xiao Yu, you are just too rigid.

294
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,920
Why won't you collaborate with us and develop this product together?

295
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,330
We especially like this idea of yours.

296
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,930
As long as we execute it well,

297
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,670
it will definitely set a new legendary record of one hundred million in monthly sales.

298
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,430
However, this is CEO Xiao's product.

299
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,020
I actually feel that the majority of it

300
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,860
is the result of your hard labor.

301
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,120
Director Li, CEO Xiao and I are classmates living in the same dorm.

302
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,780
That's right. Just because you are classmates,

303
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,590
should you be content to remain as the second fiddle?

304
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,930
Moreover, in my opinion, your abilities are just as good as his.

305
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,810
Young people should give themselves an additional option

306
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,930
and another possibility. Don't you agree?

307
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,380
In addition, as a team of only college students,

308
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,540
you have absolutely no experience and connections.

309
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,620
I don't need to say this and you understand this in your heart as well.

310
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,170
How many challenges will you all face in the future?

311
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,200
The possibility of success is very small.

312
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,290
However, if you team up with us, you will create a miracle.

313
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,270
   

314
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,020
This is only the monthly salary. After a project succeeds, there is also a commission.

315
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,350
I hope that you can feel

316
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,530
that I have come with the utmost sincerity representing our company.

317
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,360
What? He says that he still needs some time to consider the offer?

318
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,490
Time is money! We can't wait for him.

319
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,060
Let's do this. After a couple of days, look him up again,

320
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,510
and raise the signing bonus

321
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,220
to 30%.

322
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,730
That's right. We absolutely have to bring him over.

323
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,820
Once he comes over, just like pulling a radish out of the ground with dirt,

324
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,850
his whole team will also come over. Do you understand?

325
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,230
Yiran.

326
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,020
Remember to knock next time you come in.

327
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,100
Uncle, do you really want to poach Yu Banshan and the others?

328
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,550
Let me tell you. You must keep this a secret. What you just heard

329
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,920
must not be repeated outside.  You have to know your boundary in your job.

330
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,290
Then, Xiao Nai...!

331
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,930
Uncle, isn't what you're doing too unethical?

332
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,010
Unethical?

333
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,980
So you think this is unethical?

334
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,710
You're still young.

335
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,840
You simply can't understand the logic in business.

336
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,020
Those college students think that they can succeed just because of a good idea.

337
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,510
Have a look out there. Cases of failure are all over the place.

338
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,920
How many actually succeeded?

339
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,260
It's not uncommon for the young folks to lose their way.

340
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,490
At this time, they need us as their seniors to advise them

341
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,930
so that they won't waste their time and money.

342
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,750
Uncle, then if you're luring Yu Banshan and the others to come over,

343
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,200
what will happen to Xiao Nai?

344
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,500
I will first bring over all the members of his team,

345
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,090
and then give him some better terms.

346
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,480
Will Xiao Nai still be able to refuse coming over?

347
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,430
Do you still not believe in your uncle's ability?

348
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,610
Just stop foolishly worrying about this. Right now, the most important thing for you is

349
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,100
to learn  well. Do you understand?

350
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,160
Say... why has Yugong been gone for so long?  Could he have become interested?

351
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,840
Na Na.

352
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,350
So, you just went to the male dorm

353
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,890
because you want to tell XIao Nai about all this?

354
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,050
I even saw him,

355
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,170
but I still hesitated, unsure if I should tell him or not.

356
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,160
It's good you didn't.

357
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,660
Yiran, this definitely is your sixth sense helping you. Hey,

358
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,680
have you lost your mind?

359
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,310
This situation, irregardless if the poaching is successful or not,

360
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,030
in any case, your uncle has already played the bad guy.

361
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,050
If unsuccessful, we'll think of another plan.

362
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,270
If successful,

363
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,490
then you can work together with Xiao Nai, right? Therefore, I feel

364
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,790
you should stay on CEO Zhen's side.

365
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,850
But I still feel...

366
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,150
- How did Xiao Nai and Bei Weiwei–
- Okay, okay.

367
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,490
I already investigated this situation for you.

368
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,890
Those two just happened to sit together by coincidence.

369
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,880
Furthermore, Xiao Nai completely ignored Bei Weiwei.

370
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,470
My showing you this is to tell you

371
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,590
you have to create your own opportunity!

372
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,130
Opportunities won't fall on your lap when you just sit there without doing anything.

373
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,870
Speaking of Bei Weiwei, as a Computer Science student,

374
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,040
she went to an archaeology lecture in order to accost Xiao Nai. Isn't she trying hard or not?

375
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,810
Whereas you just sit here, and are not proactive at all.

376
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,660
Do you believe Xiao Nai will fall out of the sky to come to you?

377
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,290
In any case, I feel that you have such a good opportunity, yet you want to stop it.

378
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,180
Tell me. Have you lost your mind?

379
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,610
Yiran, just don't oppose your uncle any longer.

380
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,900
As for you, just quietly

381
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,320
stand behind CEO Zhen and support him.  That will be  enough.

382
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,020
In any case, you'll be the good guy at the end no matter what. Okay?

383
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,660
I feel that with my acting, I practically could be the best actor in the film industry.

384
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,530
My acting depicted a college student's struggle between ideals and money

385
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,840
so intricately and brilliantly.

386
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,470
"Director Li, your terms are truly attractive to me.

387
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,450
However, I am just too attached to our product."

388
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,820
"Xiao Yu,

389
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,330
this here... is just the monthly salary.

390
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,400
After the product succeeds, there will also be a commission.

391
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,390
I hope you can understand.

392
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,390
I, as the representative of our company,

393
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,370
have come with sincerity."

394
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,690
With my acting skill, if I don't work as a programmer, I can surely have a career in show business!

395
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,640
Say, they are really ruthless.

396
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,730
They went so far as to get Old Yu to take the source code with him.

397
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,060
This way, they can, within a short period of time,

398
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,210
develop a game that's an exact replica of ours.

399
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,680
If they get to the market first, our work will be a complete waste.

400
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,110
Third Brother, what's the next step?

401
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,310
You told me not to refuse and stall first.

402
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,240
Could it be that you want me to go to their company as a spy? Pow!

403
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,430
Big Brother, with your IQ, if you were to spy...

404
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,300
Don't make me laugh, okay?

405
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,160
In my opinion, it's more possible for them to send a spy over to us.

406
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,660
Third Brother, what are you really thinking?

407
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm thinking... it's very likely they'll try to take away all our options

408
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,830
and obstruct us from obtaining financing from other companies.

409
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,520
Hey, what's this?

410
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,510
The live picture of the renovated office of our company. The designer just sent it over.

411
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,820
The delivery should be pretty soon for our use.

412
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,760
Time surely flies.

413
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,780
We'll finally have our own base of operations!

414
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,070
I don't have any other requests, but we must hire an

415
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,050
extremely beautiful receptionist. A girl.

416
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay?

417
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,010
It's probably not possible.

418
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,710
Why?

419
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,180
I recruited an expert programmer. His name is Ah Shuang.

420
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,480
On another day, I'll introduce him to you guys.

421
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,980
But you...

422
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,080
Third Brother! Hey, Third Brother!

423
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,150
Is there any relation to finding an expert programmer to having a girl as the receptionist?

424
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,420
He has a phobia of women.

425
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,220
He what? What's this now?

426
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,950
Brother Mei, my condolences.

427
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,970
I think just now, I unexpectedly heard these words, "phobia of women."

428
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,830
It seems that  our company will once again become a Buddhist monastery.

429
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,630
Oh, Heavens!

430
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,670
In this world, how can a man with such a strange problem exist?

431
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,660
Okay, okay. Calm down, calm down.

432
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,220
In this world, there are men who don't like stinky socks.

433
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,080
What's so strange about a man who doesn't like beautiful women?

434
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,930
Third Brother, you said they may obstruct our financing. What do you mean?

435
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,420
Besides poaching the team, they definitely have a backup plan.

436
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,020
In the gaming circle, they have more connections than we do.  It's easy for them to spread rumors.

437
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,420
Brother Mei, this society is full of danger.

438
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,570
I don't want to graduate.

439
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,290
Be good.  Be good. Don't fear. You have to believe

440
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,090
that Third Brother will be, compared to them,

441
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,290
- more evil!
- Hey,

442
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,960
had we known earlier, we wouldn't have agreed to the meeting.  Then we wouldn't have this trouble.

443
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,770
When in possession of treasure,  you will inevitably attract some hungry wolves. It can't be avoided.

444
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,560
Yes, that's right.

445
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Unless, we hide and take care of it ourselves.

446
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,570
- But our goal isn't just this one game.
- Yeah.

447
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,700
At first, I didn't directly refuse Zhen Yi because I wanted to stall for time.

448
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,830
I never wanted to team up with this company from the start.

449
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,100
Going to negotiate was only to test their bottom line.

450
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,420
Test?

451
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,160
News of Feng Teng Technologies looking for outside teams

452
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,920
to develop a new "Chinese Ghost Story" has already been leaked.

453
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,260
Zhen Yi is very ambitious in this area,

454
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,360
and maybe our greatest competitor.

455
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,840
Then when you went to discuss the mobile game, that was also a ruse?

456
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,050
Understanding your opponent's behavior is very necessary.

457
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,530
Brother Hou, Brother Mei, listen to me.

458
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,790
If we just mindlessly follow Third Brother, there will be no problems.

459
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,110
However, Third Brother, were you really not concerned that we would be lured away?

460
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,950
If they could lure you guys away, they could definitely get me as well.

461
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,670
Listening to what you're saying... I'm quite touched.

462
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,090
Anyone interested in a PK? Whoever wins, gets first pick of offices.

463
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,470
I knew feeling touched was definitely an illusion!

464
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,480
These are math problems for seniors in high school, yet you got all of them right?

465
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
A wish, a wish.

466
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,360
Before I grant your wish, you already knew that

467
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,420
you had already trapped me. Right?

468
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,100
Talk. What wish?

469
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,990
Sister Weiwei, I saw that you brought your computer today.

470
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,530
That's right. Before I came, I was in the library working on homework.

471
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,280
So, I want to watch Sister playing games.

472
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,820
No way. According to our agreement,

473
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,410
today isn't your time to play games.

474
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,260
This is an important principle. You can't violate it.

475
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,740
Choose a different wish.

476
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,700
Then... Then I'll move next week's gaming time to today.

477
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,490
Just this once.

478
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,930
Wow, Red Clothed Lady Blade Master?

479
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,740
Sister Weiwei, you're so cool!

480
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
Someone's calling you.

481
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,500
 "Yixiao Naihe: Weiwei, come kill a boss." 

482
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,570
Who is this Yixiao Naihe?

483
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,180
He's my friend in the game.

484
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,080
How exciting!

485
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,300
However, there are a couple of players called Xiaoyu something already fighting the boss.

486
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,320
Xiao Yang, you're really lucky to see this.

487
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,910
You get to see the first time I'll kill-steal a boss from someone else in the game.
 (MMORPG T/N: kill-stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for a kill, when another player has put more effort into the kill.) 

488
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,110
Kill-stealing other's bosses... isn't this bad?
 (T/N: Kill-stealing is considered a dishonorable practice.) 

489
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,570
Of course it's bad, so don't copy me.

490
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,050
However, this Xiaoyu Qingqing framed me a few days ago,

491
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,220
accusing me of kill-stealing a boss from them.

492
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,290
She was exposed but wouldn't admit it no matter what. So tell me what I should do.

493
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,300
Kill-steal their boss a hundred times! Sister Weiwei, I support you. Hey!

494
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,790
Hey, look. They've all run away.

495
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,490
Wow! Hey, the boss has fallen. Quickly open the reward chest.

496
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,090
Open it and see what's in it.

497
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,520
Rare Element Diamond?

498
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,930
Is it really awesome?

499
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,170
The system even produced an announcement. Tell me. Is that awesome, or not?

500
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,210
Wow... Sister Weiwei, your game is really so much fun.

501
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,870
Can you let me play for a while?

502
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,750
Did you have this idea from the beginning?

503
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,990
Okay, just a little while. I'll tell my friend.

504
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,150
He'll lead you to play.

505
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,540
I'll do this. You can work on other things.

506
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,230
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

507
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,010
 Too amazing. Sister Weiwei, 

508
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,620
this Yixiao Naihe is too amazing at PK.

509
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,200
I can't beat him.

510
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,850
Tell him to go easy on you. Say you're a little kid.

511
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,090
I don't want to. I'm a real man,

512
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,930
so I must PK with honor and fairness.

513
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,490
Sister Weiwei, a lot of people are cursing at you!

514
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,090
They say you stole a boss.

515
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,400
That Xiaoyu Qingqing who framed you last time is pretending to be hurt on the world chat.

516
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,000
She's saying that you bullied a delicate maiden like them.

517
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,820
Wow!  They also want you to give back the diamond.

518
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,560
 Sister, hurry and come to take a look! 

519
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,690
I'll come in a moment.

520
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,040
Let me see.

521
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,070
Hey, Sister, look at this quickly. This player is saying that Xiaoyu Qingqing was the one stealing the boss.

522
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,560
What you did was called intervening when seeing an injustice.

523
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,970
Xiaoyu Qingqing isn't owning up!

524
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,190
Hey, Sister, quickly look. This player

525
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,120
posted a video.

526
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,150
Now, it's good. The Xiaoyu clan no longer dare to speak.

527
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,920
Even in the world chat, no one dares to spew nonsense.

528
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,820
Tone it down a bit.

529
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,540
This Xiaoyu Qingqing tries so hard to act hurt.

530
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,860
Who doesn't know how to act hurt? Watch.

531
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,170
 All this time, I haven't said anything. 

532
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,210
 I thought the innocent would remain innocent, and the impure would be shown as impure. 

533
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,460
 However, after experiencing so many people's condemnation, I suddenly feel so discouraged. 

534
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,700
How is it? Grieved enough?

535
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,470
 Not bad, not bad. Innocent flower skill acquired. 

536
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,080
 Top offer to acquire the diamond permanently. 

537
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,650
Third Brother is also talking in the world chat!

538
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,460
 - Let's take a group photo!
- Expert, give me an autograph, okay? 

539
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,100
 Hey, Yixiao, are you also collecting the diamond to raise your weapon level? 

540
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,030
 Not interested. 

541
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,440
 Then why are you collecting it? 

542
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,560
 To give to my wife to play with. 

543
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,750
 Third-Sister-in-Law, aren't you happy? 

544
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,700
 I bet Xiaoyu Qingqing must be annoyed to death. 

545
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,530
 I'm happy. By the way, that Juishi Buchifan is your alternate account, right?
(Note: means "Just not eating a meal") 

546
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,280
 Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental, just as we go to steal, 

547
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,660
 that alternate account happened to record the encounter? 

548
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,150
 It belongs to Yugong and the others. 

549
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,470
 The three of us created alternate accounts to steal bosses, 

550
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,270
 specifically to steal Xiaoyu Qingqing's. 

551
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,070
 We stole three before she finally couldn't bear it and killed us. 

552
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,220
 Hurry up and compliment us. 

553
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,510
 Sinister, so sinister. 

554
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,320
 It was Third Brother who instructed us. 

555
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,420
 We've been wronged... 

556
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,670
 Master is so amazing! 

557
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,870
 This difference in treatment! 

558
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,450
 I really have to bow down to you. 

559
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:22,960


560
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,660
