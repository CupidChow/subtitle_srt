 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,600
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,600
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,600
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,700
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,300
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,100
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,300
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,400
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,100
   

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,000
   

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,700
Why are there so many servers?

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,600
Did the sun rise in the west? Are you starting to play online games?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
I need to try them one at a time.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
It's very tiring to locate the server.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,400
Here, have a bottle of Eastbroc Super Drink.  
 (Energy drink as Red Bull) 

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Thanks.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,700
Could Bei Weiwei be playing this game, too?

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,800
And you don't know which server is hers.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
That's right, but I know her ID.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,700
Buddy, you are too much. Take your time to find it by yourself.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,900
Just which server could it be?

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,050


38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,800
 We agreed to upload the video at this time. 

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
It's up.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,100
   

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
 Oh no, they are mountain bandits. 

42
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
 Bandit, what are you trying to do? 

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
 I cleared this path. I planted this tree. 

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
 If you wish to pass, leave the man behind! 

45
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,800
 I can't do that. 

46
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,500
You dislike me so much...

47
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,300
You are free to leave. I am letting you go.

48
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,000
   

49
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,100
 You have a promising future. Why did you waste your life in the wildness of this mountain? 

50
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
 How could this be? 

51
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,000
 When I recorded this,  the ending was that after the female bandit died, 

52
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,400
 the zither musician carried her body and jumped off the Dusk Glow Peak. 

53
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,300
 Master edited it to be so melodramatic. 

54
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,200
 If it gets out that I cried upon watching this, 

55
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
 wouldn't it be so embarrassing? 

56
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,000
 I finished watching it. It was very good. 

57
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,520
 Did you change the ending? 

58
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,800
 Yes, I did. Or else, the duration would not be long enough. 

59
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
 Duration? What duration? 

60
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,600
 I remember that there is no limit on the duration for the competition. 

61
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,100
 It's stated in the competition rule book that if the duration of the video is longer than half an hour, 

62
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
 the reward including the experience points will be doubled for the winner. 

63
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,000
 Since we have done this, we should take everything we can. 

64
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,900
 He's indeed the Master. He even combed through these kinds of details. 

65
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,000
 However, are you so certain that we will win? 

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,600
 No, it's not right. This is not the key point. 

67
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,000
 The key point is that, based on the Master's statement, 

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,700
 the ending that almost made me cry 

69
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,100
 was only added by him to reach the time threshold. 

70
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,800
 Then... how did you come up with this ending? 

71
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
 It's much better than the original. 

72
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
 The original ending was fine. 

73
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
 It's just not easy to slot in segments of flashbacks. 

74
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It would be too obvious. 

75
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
 Then about the ending now, 

76
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,700
 was just to make it easier to lengthen the video to reach the time threshold? 

77
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,800
 More or less. 

78
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,100
 So, not only did the Master fill in the time, 

79
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,600
 he also slotted many flashbacks for the edit. 

80
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,000
 The ending originated from stalling the time and taking the easy way out. 

81
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,500
 About the emotional impact? Or about death to keep us apart? 

82
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
 They're just like the fleeting clouds in the sky.
 (Note:  not what he cared about)  

83
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 I was too naive for being so moved by it before. 

84
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,400
 Let's post this in the forum then. Should you do it, or I? 

85
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,700
 You do it. I'm too lazy to register. 

86
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,030
 Fine,  I will do it now. 

87
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
 I just posted it and there are so many comments already. 

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 Did you read them? Many cried after watching it. 

89
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
 The beginning and the ending are so tragic. They all say that the writer is really awful. 

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,500
 I became your scapegoat. The video listed me as the writer. 

91
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
 I didn't read them. Tell me when the results are out. 

92
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,700
 Okay.  After I read them, I will brief you everyday. 

93
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,720
 Why must the zither musician kill the female bandit? 

94
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,700
 I'm very sure you came up with that plot. 

95
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
 But I only did it as a twist for effect. 

96
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,400
 If he were you, would you kill the female bandit? 

97
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,210
 He wasn't me. 

98
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
 Huh? 

99
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,800
 He's not me. I wouldn't go to that extreme. 

100
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
 I'm leaving. There's no one in the library now. 

101
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,400
 There's probably still someone around. 

102
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,400
 It's true. How did you know? 

103
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,400
 It was just a guess. Be careful on your way home. 

104
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

105
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,300
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

106
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,800
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

107
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,400
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

108
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
I finished reading this. Bye.
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

109
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Bye.
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

110
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,100
 ♫ Romance is fermenting.  For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

111
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,800
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

112
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

113
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

114
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,400
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

115
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:11,000
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

116
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Why are you still in Clan Pu Village?

117
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Didn't I help upgrade you to level 30?

118
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Because I have the highest level at Clan Pu village,

119
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't bear to leave.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,400
It's so dangerous out there.

121
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,800
Look at this place. I rule supreme among this green mountain and emerald water.

122
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Looking around, everyone is a clumsy newbie here.

123
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,500
I want to enjoy the feeling of superiority in skill and reputation a while longer.

124
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Such an ace like you wouldn't understand how such a fake ace like me would feel.

125
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Scared me to death.

126
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Enough, enough. Go back to your things.

127
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,500
I just discovered the joy of this game, and don't need your help for the time being.

128
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm going to wash my face.

129
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,000
 Help me! Help me! 

130
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,400
Weiwei! Save me!

131
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,400
Weiwei, help me.

132
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
What's wrong?

133
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,200
This is not urgent. I'm about to die!

134
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
How could there be such a crisis in Clan Pu Village?

135
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Your level is so high. Who would dare to challenge you?

136
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
It wasn't me. I saw someone being bullied and I drew out my sword to help,

137
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,800
but I encountered a minion monster of particularly high agility.

138
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
I can't move fast enough to keep up with him.

139
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,900
Let's go!

140
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,620
Please sit, my Heroine Weiwei.

141
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Drink this and teach them a lesson.

142
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

143
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
It's done. You can continue.

144
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
I won't express my gratitude so casually for this big favor.

145
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,900
- Serve me milk tomorrow. 
- No problem.

146
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,020
Heroine, please wait up.

147
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,240
Thank you for saving me, Heroine.

148
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
As we wander in this world, the higher our ability; the more is our responsibility.

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
This is what I should do. See you again.

150
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
Wait.

151
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you calling me?

152
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Well... this is my first game.

153
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,000
You also saw it.  I am really helpless when I run into these low-level monsters.

154
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
You are so amazing. Would you take me under your wing?

155
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,800
 This idiot just praised me for being amazing. 

156
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
 If he follows me around, it will be pretty good if he offers me praises. 

157
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,400
 It's rare to find someone even more pitiful than myself. 

158
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,070
Okay, then. I will take you until you can defeat the monsters on your own.

159
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

160
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 Did I say that I would take in a disciple? 

161
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
 I haven't even left Clan Pu Village and already got a disciple. 

162
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,500
 I gained something. 

163
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay, then. Disciple, please rise.

164
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
As I used the technique of Wing Flapping Roc,

165
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I took out that minion monster in no time.

166
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,900
My disciple knelt down and said

167
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,500
"Master, take me in as your disciple!"

168
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,200
I didn't imagine that within such a short time in the game,

169
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,800
I could spread my influence and reputation.

170
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,500
I am awesome, aren't I?

171
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,900
I only feel like having a mental breakdown now!

172
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,000
Si Si.

173
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,200
I am awesome, aren't I?

174
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Bang!

175
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,800
You are too ruthless.

176
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,600
Are you done swiping my phone?

177
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,700
Looking at the cellphone while walking is bad for your eyes.

178
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,300
Also, when are you getting a new cellphone?

179
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,000
I will get one after my summer job. I don't have enough money right now.

180
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,100
What are you swiping?

181
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,100
A friend and I created a video.

182
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,600
We are gathering votes in the forum now.

183
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Look. We are ahead by a lot now.

184
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,500
We will definitely get the first place. Here.

185
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,200
Let's go.

186
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,840
 Weiwei, where are you? I need to find you about something. 

187
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,800
 The usual. Escorting a wagon of goods. What's up? 

188
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,400
 Then, I'll see you at Hangzhou Security Escort Agency where you've completed the task. 

189
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Ni Ni, what's the matter? 

190
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
 Weiwei, I have a question to ask you. 

191
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,600
 What is it? 

192
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 If someone were to give you a big sum of money, 

193
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,500
 would you be willing to withdraw from the video competition? 

194
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,760
 Zhenshui Wuxiang? 

195
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,500
 Weiwei, you guessed right. 

196
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,200
 There's no need to guess. Isn't it very obvious? 

197
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,800
 If I withdraw from the competition, who will benefit directly from this? 

198
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,400
 The winner will get the Rainbow garment. 

199
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,000
 Xiaoyu Yaoyao seems to like that garment very much. 

200
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 That's why Zhenshui Wuxiang requested that I ask you without telling her. 

201
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
 Because of the last battle, he felt awkward to ask you directly. 

202
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
 Weiwei, you didn't get mad, did you? 

203
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
 I didn't. I just find it laughable. 

204
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,800
 If he plans to spend hundreds of thousands to ask me to withdraw, 

205
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
 advise him not to make a fool of himself. 

206
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
 Hundreds of thousands?  

207
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
 How could Zhenshui possibly spend that much money? 

208
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 From his tone, the most will be a few thousands.  At the highest, it may be some tens of thousands. 

209
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 Weiwei, are you really that rich? 

210
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 I really couldn't tell. 

211
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,100
 I kept a low profile. 

212
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
 Forget it, then. 

213
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
 Weiwei, you are not angry, right? 

214
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
 Frankly, I didn't want to help him ask. 

215
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,000
 But I think he really loves Enchantress Xiao Yu, 

216
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
 so it made me soft on this. 

217
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,500
 Do you know that they've met and become a couple in real life? 

218
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,000
 They live in the capital city. Weiwei, you live there as well, right? 

219
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,200
 That's right. The server is called Stormy Capital. 

220
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
 There are many players from here. 

221
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,000
 Speaking of which... Master, Yugong and the rest should be studying here as well, right? 

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,500
 I'm in Tianjin. Otherwise, I would come to look you guys up for fun. 

223
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,000
 By the way, Zhenshui is really very handsome. 

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I have the photo of them together. Weiwei, do you want to take a look? 

225
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,100
 Not interested. 

226
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,600
 By the way, Weiwei. Haven't you met Yixiao Naihe? 

227
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,900
 Is he handsome or not? 

228
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
 I haven't. 

229
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
 Okay, I'm not chatting with you anymore. 

230
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,500
 I have an appointment at 5:00 p.m. to kill some boss monsters. 

231
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,730
You, Yugong and the others all live in the capital city, right?

232
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,260
Yes.

233
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,370
I'm going to fight some monsters.

234
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,850
I say you're too shameless,

235
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,930
hiding behind Sister-in-Law, leeching experience.

236
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,310
After leeching off my wife so much,

237
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,560
I slowly got used to it.

238
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,680
You guys who don't have a wife to protect them... won't understand.

239
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,410
Attack him!

240
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,830
Sister-in-Law, we'll forget about you not appreciating our kindness, but you even step on us.

241
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,510
I'll die with a grudge!

242
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,700
Naturally, the couple is of the same mindset.

243
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,120
We shouldn't interfere with family affairs.

244
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,510
I didn't see you guys there.

245
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,680
Why were you all lying on the ground?

246
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,980
So pretentious! I don't believe you didn't see how Third Brother was just mistreating us.

247
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,100
This is called... selective blindness.

248
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,520
As expected, it's tough to serve as the lady boss of the homeowner association.

249
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,530
The result of the video contest has been announced.

250
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,090
 The winners of the video contest are now revealed. 

251
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,140
The submitted video by Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe for the contest,

252
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,940
 "Lady Bandit's Abduction of  Her Lover" proudly took the crown. 

253
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,210
Naihe, we really won.

254
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,940
I saw it.

255
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,230
The reputation is justified by the work. Post-production seems to be done by Yixiao Naihe.

256
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,850
 All aspects are so perfect. Isn't this too amazing? 

257
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,590
This way of distributing the awards is too amazing, isn't it?

258
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,150
Exactly. Are they not concerned about crushing Naihe to death?

259
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,930
Wow! Sister-in-Law, Hurry and put it on.  Try it out.

260
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,970
And you should try it on as well.

261
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,810
Change the color and have a look. It has seven colors.

262
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,050
That's right. Quickly, try it.

263
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,400
Only has six colors?

264
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,740
It seems to be missing one color, isn't it?

265
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,870
Green. The green one!

266
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,560
 Green? Master's constant head ornament has been a white head-wrap. 

267
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
 The head ornament of the Seven-Colored Garment   turns out to be green. 

268
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,020
 Did they design it like this on purpose? 

269
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,100
This Third Brother has an issue.

270
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,070
He doesn't dare to wear the same couple's outfit as Third Sister-in-Law.

271
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,580
Could it be...

272
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,500
We've already been a couple for a while.

273
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,170
We don't care about these superficial gestures.

274
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,050
You guys chat. I'm going to take a stroll.

275
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,170
 We've already been a couple for a while. 

276
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,710
 We don't care about these superficial gestures. 

277
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,070
 There is gossip but you can't talk about it. 

278
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,660
 Luwei Weiwei, you're not fun at all. 

279
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,760
 It seems... huh? 

280
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,860
 Haven't you met Yixiao Naihe? Is he handsome, or not? 

281
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,820
 If Master says we should exchange photos, 

282
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,930
 would I be willing? 

283
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,930
 It seems... I'd be willing. 

284
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,270
 But what if he says we should meet up? 

285
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,940
 It seems... I'd also be willing to meet. 

286
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,410
 According to Master's personality, 

287
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,920
 he wouldn't bring up such a request, so never mind a meeting. 

288
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,570
 However, if we don't meet, 

289
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,330
 in the future when I stop playing online games, will we simply forget about each other?

What are you doing, Sister Mei? I could hear your sentimental singing from a distance away.

297
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,750
What smell is this?

298
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,530
My god, what is that? A poison gas bomb?

299
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,430
It's stinging my eyes. I can't even open my eyes anymore.

300
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,020
If you can act so well, why didn't you go to Beijing Film Academy?

301
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,960
There are a lot of girls there as well.

302
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm telling you, the next time you call me by that nickname, I'll send over a pair of Yu Banshan's socks.

303
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,840
No need, no need. I still want to live for a few more days.

304
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,390
What's got into you?  Why are you washing your socks?

305
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,820
Don't you know? Third Brother...

306
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,160

- Dear lord...
- ♪  Cleaning up their rooms   ♪

311
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,540
Xiao Nai, how did you manage to do this?

312
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,130
It has nothing to do with me.

313
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,650
They just put special attention on hygiene and decided to tidy up a bit.

314
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,810
I suddenly feel that I should clean up a bit. I'm leaving.

315
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,910
Sister Mei, lend me your laundry detergent. I haven't used that stuff in 800 years.

316
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,280
- I'm leaving. 
- Do you need rags?

317
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,540
No need. Thank you!

318
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,350
As I see it, our dorm room has reached the standard of a five-star hotel.

319
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,950
We will no longer be afraid when girls come over.

320
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,780
Third Brother, you'll regret this.

321
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,550
Before, you could count on Yu Banshan's socks to keep away the girls.

322
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,220
Now, they've become so pure. Giving off this tempting aroma,

323
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,870
the girls will no longer be afraid. They'll fill up our entire dorm soon.

324
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,610
- Hang them up.
- Okay.

325
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Old Yu! Why didn't we learn our lesson?

326
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,370
Why did we decide to play the game with Third Brother?

327
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,440
That year,

328
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,930
we first came to Tsinghua University.

329
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,420
Young and ignorant.

330
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,660
 I haven't asked you yet. How old are you guys? 

331
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,360
 As for me, I started elementary school a year late. I'm 20 years old. I should be the oldest. 

332
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,150
 - I'm nineteen.
- I'm also nineteen. 

333
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,320
 You're also nineteen? Then I'm definitely older than you. I was born in January. 

334
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,370
 Okay. I put equal weight on beauty and love, a Libra. 

335
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,810
 Then it appears that you're the youngest. 

336
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,800
 I'm the oldest, so I'll set the order. 

337
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,040
 I'm Big Brother, you're Second Brother, you're Third Brother, 

338
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,000
 and you're Fourth Brother. Fourth Brother! Forget it. 

339
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,770
 Fourth Brother doesn't sound right. We'll call you Little Brother, then.
(Note: Four sounds similar to death.) 

340
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,250
 I feel there's no sense in going by age. 

341
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,530
 We're men. 

342
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,760
 We should let our ability do the talking. 

343
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,520
 You've lost again. 

344
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,020
 Okay. Little Brother, you've become the Big Brother now. 

345
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,250
 No need to concede so much. I'm fine being Third Brother. 

346
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,430
 Are you that generous? 

347
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,180
 Big Brother is the default leader. You'll need to do things. 

348
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,660
We were still too young. Why did we compete with him on ability?

349
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,130
He uses provocation every time. Impulsiveness is an original sin!

350
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,940
- Original sin!
- Original sin!

351
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,600
Hang on! I have a phone call.

352
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,930
Unknown phone call.

353
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,330
Yes, hello?

354
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,590
 Hello. May I ask if this is Mr. Yu Banshan? 

355
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,150
Yes. Who might you be?

356
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,990
 May I ask if it's convenient to speak right now? 

357
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,240
A girl!

358
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,950
Quick, quick.

359
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,980
Hello, Miss. It's convenient.

360
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,610
Who might you be?

361
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,720
  It's like this. I'm Director Li's secretary, Xiao Li, from the Game Development Department at Zhen Yi Technology. 

362
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,950
 You came to our company before. Do you still remember? 

363
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,970
I remember.

364
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,510
 Last time, after meeting, our Director Li constantly talked about you. 

365
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,980
 He has high regard for you in particular and wants to know if you are free in the next few days. 

366
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,550
 Director Li would like to arrange a meal with you alone. 

367
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,610
Alone?

368
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,700
I'll call you back in a bit, okay? I'm a little busy.

369
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
Goodbye.

370
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,550
- Who was it?
- Houzi, help me charge my phone.

371
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,150
Third Brother, you still remember Director Li from Zhen Yi, right?

372
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,500
Did he ask to see you?

373
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,860
Darn! Are you a demon?

374
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,680
Did he only ask you alone?

375
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,900
That's right. His secretary just called me

376
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,000
and insisted on seeing me alone. He didn't want me to tell you.

377
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,340
Her voice

378
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
almost melted me.

379
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,250
She's even buttering me up. What's going on?

380
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,040
Old Yu, they are using the ploy to buy you off with a woman.

381
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,590
Idiot.

382
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,240
Am I the type who can be bought off with a woman?

383
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,660
It would at least take several.

384
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,380
- Damn, you beast! 
- Stop it!

385
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,940
What are they trying to do?

386
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,660
Are they trying to poach?

387
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,130
Their company has a history of doing this.

388
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,240
The year before they released a mobile card game. Do you remember?

389
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,860
I do. The monthly sales were over $100 million. It was a legend in the industry.

390
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,360
That's right.

391
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,540
That game was developed by a small company.

392
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,680
Zhen Yi Technology failed to acquire that company and poached its entire team.

393
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,240
They created a similar game and launched it in advance.

394
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,160
They may be trying the same trick again.

395
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,560
Poached the entire team?

396
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,300
Wouldn't that small company be doomed?

397
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,530
Darn. This is so ruthless.

398
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,960
Third Brother, if they try to seduce me, you must protect me.

399
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,220
Don't go if you are afraid.

400
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,430
I'm telling you. We must remember the trust in our brotherhood.

401
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:25,540
We must not be seduced by things like money, women, houses or cars.

402
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,720
Am I right?  When push comes to shove,

403
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,250
I will go.

404
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,850
Forget you!

405
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,500
I... I will go. I'm the ace in programming.

406
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,410
Banshan, if you recommend that I go,

407
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,060
I will give you thirty percent.

408
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,310
By the way, Banshan, did you leave your phone number with them?

409
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,930
I didn't.

410
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,540
That's right. I didn't leave my number with them. Where did they get it from?

411
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,870
They went through great troubles to find your phone number.

412
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,590
It seems this is not a simple matter. They came prepared.

413
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,040
Third Brother, I didn't turn them down on the spot.

414
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,630
If they want to poach me, I will reject them directly.

415
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,540
Why would you reject it? Isn't this a good opportunity?

416
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,120
Wh−What good opportunity is this?

417
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,310
Whenever Third Brother puts on that mysterious smile, it means that someone will definitely get it on the chin.

418
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,960
This is so cold and scary.

419
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,680
I'm scared, too. How are you going to handle this?

420
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Have meals first.

421
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,490
I'll listen to you. Wait for me. My phone has only been charging for two minutes.

422
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,670
Big Brother, five minutes of charging can go up to two hours for your phone.

423
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,950
There won't be any problems. Go to eat first.

424
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,460
Wait. I need to change my clothes.

425
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,530
It's just a meal. Why do you need to change?

426
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,160
You don't know crap.

427
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,420
Wherever Third Brother goes, girls swarm around.  I have to present myself in the best possible light to greet their inspection.

428
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,920
- I'm going to change, too.  
- Me, too.

429
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,770
Let's go now.

430
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,020
The feeling of having Third Brother back here is really great.

431
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,030
- He's the focus. 
- All of a sudden, I find myself particularly cool.

432
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,780
We need to look cool.

433
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,300
 Wow! So good looking! 

434
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,930
 Let's go to see him now. 

435
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,410
Where's Third Brother?

436
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,230
Did he abandon us to get in line first?

437
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,830
Master? He's actually here in the cafeteria!

438
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,500
Did you see him?

439
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,520
I got to queue up in the same line with Master in my lifetime.

440
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,040
My luck is just unbelievable here!

441
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,030
You are in the line next to him.

442
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,670
I have decided.

443
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,780
What did you decide?

444
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,300
Let's eat whatever he orders for lunch.

445
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,090
What a great decision!

446
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,310
But it's not easy to realize this decision.

447
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,440
He's behind us. We will definitely be faster than him.

448
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,720
We might as well pray that he will sit at the same table with us.

449
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,990
Don't even dream about this.

450
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,670
And also, it will burn off too much of our luck.

451
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,580
I am worried that we don't have the constitution to withstand the burden.

452
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,340
Next.

453
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,540
What do you want to eat?

454
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,160
 These three. 

455
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,930
His line is moving very fast. Your wish will come true soon.

456
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,460
The woman ( who's working behind the counter ) is so slow in getting rice. I am so moved that I want to cry.

457
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,630
What do you want?

458
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,570
- Sweet and sour pork ribs. 
- Sweet and sour pork ribs.

459
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,650
There's only one serving left. Both of you...

460
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,180
No need. I will have an order of the salted chicken.

461
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,460
I don't want this, either. This is fine.

462
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,140
I want the sweet and sour pork ribs. Give me all then.

463
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,680
Thank you, buddy.

464
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,740
Hey, I bought more food.

465
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,900
Brothers, why did they have a guy serving the food today?

466
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,840
But it's good to have this guy. Look.

467
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,170
My serving is especially big. As for this dish of stir-fried three kinds,

468
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,790
there is a higher amount of meat in particular.

469
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm bewildered. Why isn't there any meat in mine?

470
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,830
Not even a single piece.

471
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,640
That's right. I don't have any either.

472
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,270
What do you know? This is called a personal attribute.

473
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,630
You are not at my level.

474
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,620
He must have thought that you have a baby face.

475
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,610
And also, you appear to be under-developed. That's why he gave you more.

476
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,890
Who are you calling under-developed?  If you dare, we can have a go after we return later.

477
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,110
Stop it. Your conversation is so "decent" that I can't bear to listen anymore.

478
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,430
Talking about this, we have never been here.

479
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,140
It's quite a distance away from our dormitory.

480
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,720
Third Brother, what's going on? Why are we eating here today?

481
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,350
I just thought of it.

482
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,330
I think the food here is great. In any case, I love this dining hall.

483
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,600
Let's eat here in the future.

484
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,000
 Why didn't you listen to me and sit closer to the Master? 

485
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,250
 We agreed to get the same food as his but didn't get it, either. 

486
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,070
Fortunately, I have the same drink as his.

487
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,590
Why do I keep feeling rather guilty?

488
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,560
Guilty about what?

489
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,490
 I keep feeling that since I lied to Cao Guang 

490
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,930
 about getting a boyfriend like the Master, 

491
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,840
 I keep running into him more and more. 

492
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,900
 One indeed shouldn't do any bad deeds. I feel so guilty. 

493
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,930
Hurry and tell me. What are you guilty about?

494
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,070
Just eat your food.

495
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,660
Let's study after this. Later, the couple PK contest begins registration tonight.

496
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,600
I need to rush back. Eat up.

497
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,020
I'm going to the restroom. You guys eat.

498
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,040
Eat.

499
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,140
Stop looking.

500
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,710
 It starts next Friday and lasts for a month. 

501
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,690
 If we get into the final, 

502
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,060
 after the competition, I still have a week to focus on reviewing my study of English. 

503
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,150
 There's no problem with my time. Is yours okay? 

504
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,080
 It's fine. Notify me one day in advance when we have a match. 

505
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,970
 Fine. I will be your activity calendar. 

506
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,440
Third Brother, the contest for the Couple's PK is starting soon.

507
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,430
This is a contest for all the servers.  There will be a lot of highly skilled players.  Let's train together.  Practice with us first.

508
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,060
That's right. You can regard us as your opponents.

509
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,310
We can play a simulated PK match.

510
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,430
Our opponents are couples.

511
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,820
Which one will be the man and which will be the woman?

512
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,850
- Of course, I'm the man. 
- Of course, I'm the man.

513
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,880
- I'm heavier than you. 
- I'm taller than you.

514
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,990
I'm better looking than you.

515
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm more attractive than you.

516
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,740
You won't back down unless I beat you up, right?

517
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,280
- Who's going to get beat up?
- Huh?!

518
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,950


519
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,010
Yang Yang -  "Just One Smile Is Very Alluring"
