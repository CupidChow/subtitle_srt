 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,570
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,460
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,650
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,670
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,550
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,410
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,550
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,800
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,720
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,670
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,850
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,180
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,970
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,140
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,960
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,360
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,190
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,270
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,390
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,400
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,700
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,010
   

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,930
    

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:49,030


27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,060
Are there still train tickets to Wuhan for tomorrow and the day after?

28
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,790
I don't think so. There are no tickets for the next five days.

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,730
What about a plane ticket for the day after tomorrow?

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,440
No need.

31
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,800
Even if I stay for a few more days, I still have to leave, right?

32
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,490
And also, I already told my dad that I'd be home this afternoon.

33
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,310
Never mind.

34
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,350
- Call me as soon as you get home.
- Okay

35
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,180
Remember to take your medicine.

36
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,750
Also, buy a new phone soon.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll get it once I get home.

38
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,230
  Time for entering the platform of the station is over. 

39
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,690
 Visitors sending off your family and friends should stop here. 

40
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,880
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,890
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

42
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,120
Then, you should go back. Okay?

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,800
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

44
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,270
Remember to take care of the cactus.

45
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,850
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

46
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,280
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,020
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,660
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,080
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

50
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,450
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

51
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,490
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

52
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,170
Put it next to your office computer.

53
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,100
It's best if you can see it every single day.

54
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,610
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

55
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,270
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

56
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,680
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,150
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

58
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,680
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,350
Have a safe journey.

60
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,700
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

61
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,290
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

62
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:23,790
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

63
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,860
Hello...

64
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,450
Yes, I'll be there right away.

65
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,350
Okay. See you later.

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,710
 Senior Xiao? What a  coincidence! 

67
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,960
 It isn't a coincidence. I have been waiting for you. 

68
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,120
Weiwei! Weiwei!

69
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,270
Dad!

70
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,290
You're back!

71
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,970
Didn't I tell you not to come to pick me up?

72
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,850
It's so crowded and not a weekend.

73
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,070
I don't have a cellphone. What if you couldn't find me?

74
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,200
How would it be hard to find you? My daughter is so pretty.

75
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,410
You will be where everyone is staring.

76
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,990
What? After you've spoiled me with unabashed flattery for twenty years,

77
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,950
it's a miracle that I'm still so modest.

78
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,220
What unabashed flattery? I'm only telling the truth! Come on.

79
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,130
Give me the suitcase. Let's go

80
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,480
Let's go.

81
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,770
Girl, I got some new wheels.

82
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,740
- Really? 
 - Of course, it's true! I'll show you!

83
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,090
Let's go.

84
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,400
What do you think?

85
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,380
It's really cute!

86
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,920
- It suits me really well, right?
 - Yes, it does.

87
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,060
I will take you for a ride then.

88
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,510
Okay!

89
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,810
Did you two go and rob someone?  You're all covered in dirt.

90
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,760
Hurry and wipe yourself clean.

91
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,870
Get yourself cleaned up before the meal!

92
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,610
Okay.

93
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,550
Weiwei, you can't get good food at the school cafeteria.

94
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,650
I took half a day off today to make you a table full of dishes.

95
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,760
Eat up!

96
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,570
For sure! Mom, thank you  so much.

97
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,800
Dad, thank you for picking me up as well.

98
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,350
Here, here!  Let's eat.

99
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,140
Thanks, Mom. You should eat more.

100
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,120
Right, right. Eat while it's hot.

101
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,280
Have some pure juice to get some vitamins.

102
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,990
You always drink soda at school. It's not healthy.

103
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,530
Yes, drinking juice every day is good for you. I love drinking juice.

104
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,840
Dad, have some, too.

105
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,140
Sure.

106
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,870
Dad, one reason I asked you not to pick me up was that I was worried Mom would cook.

107
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,710
Where does she get that confidence?

108
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,990
She thinks the meal she cooks is better than what's in the cafeteria.

109
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,410
Don't worry. It is just today.

110
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,110
Tomorrow, your dad will reclaim the kitchen.

111
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,150
Your mom's cooking skills are only good enough to wash the vegetables.

112
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,510
Dad, you're a true man. I support you.

113
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,430
What are you two badmouthing me about?

114
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,040
Nothing. I was only asking Dad to buy me a new phone.

115
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,890
That's right. We're only talking about the phone.

116
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,880
Look. Weiwei's cellphone was lost for a semester. We should have bought one sooner.

117
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,650
Don't you think so?

118
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Didn't you say that after you sent off our Junior Sister you had to meet someone?  Did you meet in the flower market?

119
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,410
You are such a refreshing green thumb with a cactus.  Will its flower bloom?

120
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,220
Third Brother, where did you buy that cactus?  Buy one for me, too.  I want to protect against radiation, too.

121
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,520
I didn't buy it.

122
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,750
You didn't buy it?  Then where did it come from?

123
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,240
If I tell you, the damage will be a little high.

124
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,650
It'd be better for you not to know.  No truth, and no damage.

125
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,270
I already sense a fierce attack.

126
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,150
It's like a thousand arrows piercing my heart!

127
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,960
A blow to my heart.

128
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,230
The damage is even greater without the truth.

129
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,080
My imagination alone will burn off all my health points!

130
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,090
Since everyone's brain is working in overdrive, let's have a planning meeting in half an hour.

131
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,490
- Another meeting!
- Another meeting!
- Another meeting!

132
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,590
Weiwei, today, they added a night shift at the factory.

133
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,050
Tonight, your dad and I might be late getting home.

134
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,310
Just be good and stay home, okay?

135
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,140
Don't keep playing on your computer. Do you hear me? It's not good for your eyes.

136
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,910
Be good.

137
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,900
Be careful on the way.

138
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,620
Bye-bye.

139
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,820
It's me.

140
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,490
Miss Bei, you've already been home for two hours.

141
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,320
Did you just remember to call me now?

142
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,310
Mr. Xiao, my parents just left home a minute ago.

143
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,450
No, half a minute ago.

144
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,180
And I am calling, okay?

145
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,750
Oh, it seems

146
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,430
Miss Bei's parents don't allow Miss Bei to date at this time.

147
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,910
You're really smart.  Also, Miss Bei's mom is a huge gossip.

148
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,550
If she knew about it, she would tell everyone.

149
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,770
Then Miss Bei would be surrounded by onlookers, a spectacle too horrible to endure.

150
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,730
When the new school year starts, you would see a thin and haggard Miss Bei.

151
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm looking forward to it.

152
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,510
You're looking forward to my thin and haggard appearance?

153
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,320
Haggard is just an attribute.  I'm looking forward to the subject with that attribute.

154
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,400
You know how to talk.

155
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,270
What are you doing?

156
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,410
My cellphone's battery is low.  I'm going to charge it.

157
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,470
I'm about to have a meeting. I'm editing the proposal.

158
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,150
I won't disturb you then.

159
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,860
Work hard and earn money for our little tigers.

160
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,450
We need a fair amount of money to raise them.

161
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,300
 Mom! Why are you back? 

162
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,770
Who are you talking with on the phone? You're smiling like a dummy.

163
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,660
Xiao Yang, study hard during the summer recess. Okay?

164
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,880
 Remember to finish the homework I've assigned to you. 

165
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,890
Call me if you can't do the exercise.

166
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,200
That's it for now. I'll call you next time.

167
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,050
Sister, remember to buy a cellphone.

168
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm worried that I can't find you if I can't handle the exercise.

169
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,240
Okay. Bye.

170
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,020
Mom, why did you suddenly come back?

171
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,620
I came back to get something.

172
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,850
Oh, right. Who's Xiao Yang?

173
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,720
A student I'm tutoring at school.

174
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,900
How could I have forgotten?

175
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,890
The chief of our factory wants to hire you to be his child's tutor.

176
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,490
I have something to do for the summer recess. I can't work as a tutor.

177
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,230
What could a college student do during the summer recess?

178
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,770
Something like raising tigers.

179
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,530
What did you say?

180
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,970
I meant I have to rest well to be as vicious as a tiger.

181
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,770
I'll repay society with better grades next year.

182
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,690
Enough, stop blabbering. That's set, okay?

183
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,300
Weiwei, didn't you want to buy a new phone?

184
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,520
Work and earn money yourself to buy it. I'm leaving.

185
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,130
No, Mom. Don't I have the scholarship?

186
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,140
Can't I use that to buy the phone?

187
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,940
My dad agreed to it.

188
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,140
Your dad's words don't count. I'm confiscating the money from that scholarship.

189
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,060
If you want a phone, earn it yourself.

190
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,900
If I had known, I shouldn't have given away the scholarship money.

191
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,890
What should I tell Master now?

192
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,020
  
  

193
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,500
  
  

194
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,610
Where is the meeting?

195
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,250
Meeting room.

196
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,130
The meeting is in the meeting room!

197
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,050
Last week in Shanghai,  we basically finalized the agreement with Feng Teng to jointly manage

198
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,430
our mobile game, "Wandering Journey in Jianghu."

199
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,560
Today, we have verified the final draft of the contract.

200
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,740
We can sign it right away.

201
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,730
Your treat! Your treat! Your treat!

202
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,440
Your treat! Your treat! Your treat!

203
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,410
Let's have dinner tonight.

204
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,590
Next, we'll contract a third party for quality testing.

205
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,640
If there are bugs that require revision,

206
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,610
Ah Shuang, you will follow up.

207
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,790
Okay. No problem.

208
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,630
We didn't spend too much effort on the website for the mobile game.

209
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,470
We need to perfect it now.

210
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,840
- Yugong,  take care of it with some others. 
 - Okay.

211
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,270
If everything goes well, the mobile game will be released online in October.

212
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,880
When that time comes, we'll only need to work with Feng Teng for some promotional activities.

213
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,090
So, I hope that everyone can dedicate more of your energy

214
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,180
into the development of our server/client game, "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

215
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,730
Feng Teng is very interested in the preliminary planning of our server/client game.

216
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,630
However,  no one will easily buy into anything based on something on paper only.

217
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,700
So, I hope to present a more convincing game demo.

218
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,870
Today, I received the official letter from Feng Teng Technologies. The demo presentation

219
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,710
will be set for September 20th.

220
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,590
And competing with us concurrently,

221
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,970
there is still Zhen Yi Technology.

222
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,780
Can I go to kill myself?

223
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,630
This... This is less than three months.

224
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,870
The engine on our side should be fine. There should be no problem if we work quickly.

225
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,670
You're the one who should be fine.

226
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,540
This equals creating a small game for us.

227
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,770
It would be okay if we could deliver a mediocre result, but would it be possible with Third Brother?  If you can, you take the task.

228
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,060
I am not as good as you.

229
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,810
Third Brother, Third Brother.

230
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,280
No, President Xiao,

231
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,950
I'm begging you to hire people!

232
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,460
Along with Ah Shuang, representing our Programming Team, I am begging you on my knees.

233
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,370
Wouldn't I have to do programming as well?  As for programmers, it's better not to have any than just hire some with poor skills.

234
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,360
There are so many tasks, when can we finish them?

235
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,340
I still want to go on dates!

236
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,040
The good news is that I'll be spending very little time on dating.

237
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Therefore, I have even more time to write code.

238
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,810
Go away. I have not been consoled at all.

239
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,320
What Hao Mei said was right. It's a demo,

240
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,230
but it's like a game of a smaller scale.

241
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,170
In the past, our vision was too expansive.

242
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,370
Now, we have to first pick some of the best ideas to develop some features.

243
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,130
For example, retaining the Newbie Village, a core city,

244
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,560
some outdoors settings, and some specialty quests;

245
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,070
as well as what can best illustrate the unique capability of our game,

246
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,540
the multi-player Hebo Flooding Quest.

247
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,000
Planning Team, let's discuss it in a bit.

248
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
- Okay.
- Um...

249
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,220
I have a question. In the beginning, we didn't have "A New Chinese Ghost Story" as our goal;

250
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,420
therefore, our art style more closely resembles traditional Chinese art and it's more in line with our mobile game.

251
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,660
However, it's not very similar to "A New Chinese Ghost Story." So, should we now adjust our style based on our changes?

252
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,620
No need. Keep it as is.

253
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,040
Then, could it impact our chance to get "A New Chinese Ghost Story"?

254
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,860
As long as we have enough innovation, this won't be a problem.

255
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,070
They don't want something that stays status quo.

256
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,760
Otherwise, how can it attract players?

257
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,530
Okay. In fact, I don't want to change either.

258
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,640
We have taken on this tough assignment now. Everyone, let's work hard.

259
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,110
- Let's work hard!
- Let's work hard!

260
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,370
This one is wrong. Let me explain a bit. This here,

261
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,670
we have to first connect diagonal lines, then draw a reference line here.

262
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,360
We can then arrive at this equation,

263
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,760
then you apply the equation to obtain the answer.

264
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,550
Do you understand?

265
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,590
No worries. I'll change the way I explain it.

266
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,600
I get it, I get it! You are amazing!

267
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,300
Then today, we'll end here. Next time, I'll come by again. Okay?

268
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,190
Okay. Sister Weiwei, bye-bye.

269
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,500
- Have you finished eating?
- Yup.

270
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,630
Why?

271
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,460
Then, I'll go to wash the dishes!

272
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,850
Mom, I've finished cleaning up!

273
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,870
Look at her all day, always in a frenzy.

274
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,410
When... did you come online?

275
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,210
It is raining in Wuhan today, so I came back late.

276
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,730
I just arrived. Has your cold gotten a little better?

277
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,550
It's raining where you are. You didn't get rained on, right?

278
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,460
After taking the cold medicine you gave me, I'm feeling a lot better.

279
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,830
I even have the energy to work as a home tutor.

280
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,540
Also, I wasn't rained on.

281
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,310
Hurry and take the medicine.

282
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,750
Do you feel better now?

283
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,600
Yup.

284
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,840
Oh, that's right. Today, I was mocked by Erxi.

285
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,860
How?

286
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,150
She mocked me about the fact that we met already,

287
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,850
yet we're still chatting online in the game during the summer recess.

288
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,500
Who should we blame for this?

289
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,550
Blame me. Blame me.

290
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,320
That's not right. Blame my mom.

291
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,780
She confiscated my scholarship money.

292
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,790
I don't dare blame your mom.

293
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,120
Bullying the nice folks but afraid of the evil.

294
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,800
I feel... chatting in the game is pretty nice.

295
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,590
There are mountains, water, and scenery.

296
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,600
 And you. 

297
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,860
Then, as usual.

298
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,450
You can do your game programming while leaving the game on.

299
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,040
I'll take you and the tigers to level up.

300
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,110
You click auto-follow.

301
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,180
Okay.

302
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,920
 Then I'm going. 

303
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,880
My mom's here.

304
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,480
You ate so little for dinner. Did you get enough?

305
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,950
Yes, I did.

306
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,370
Have a Yakult. I don't want you to be hungry.

307
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,370
Thanks, Mom.

308
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,490
Say, as a girl, why do you have to study Computer Science out of everything else?

309
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,580
I hear people say that if you stare at a computer too much, your face will turn into a square.

310
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,130
Besides, the radiation isn't good for your skin.

311
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,360
It's really bad for your health sleeping late and staying hungry every day.

312
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,290
That's right. Hey, Mom. Say, since you're this concerned about me, how about not making me wash dishes in the future?

313
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,150
Detergent is also bad for the hands.

314
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,760
Then you wash vegetables.

315
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll just continue to wash the dishes.

316
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,700
That's more like it.

317
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,730
Hey, Mom, in the future, you should watch less TV.

318
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,770
A TV is also square.

319
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,700
Hello? I'm back.

320
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,850
My mom left.

321
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,280
Then, I'll take the tigers and go.

322
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,730
What are you doing?

323
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,610
Researching dish washers.

324
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,180
Dish washers?

325
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,430
I also don't like washing dishes.

326
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,090
You eavesdropped on us talking!

327
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,620
I don't mind listening in the open.

328
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,320
If the seeds of revolution are exposed too early,

329
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,390
they will be taken out.

330
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,790
- Weiwei...
- Hm?

331
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,200
...sprouting needs photosynthesis.

332
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,430
Those that never see light are bean sprouts.

333
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,840
Master, you definitely didn't turn on your air conditioning, right?

334
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,820
Your joke is so cold.
 (Note: Cold jokes = lame jokes) 

335
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,780
It definitely has its own temperature-lowering system.

336
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,910
 - Then I'm going. 
- Okay.

337
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,020
In order to find food for you guys,

338
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,650
I ran around the entire world map.

339
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,720
Why did your dad ignore you guys?

340
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,620
I, alone, am taking you guys to fight and level up.  I am acting as your mom as well as your dad.

341
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,890
But he is earning money for your nutrition.

342
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,310
So you guys, don't get mad at him.

343
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,010
Recently, Master has truly been very busy.

344
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,720
It would be good if I could help in some way.

345
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,230
Before sleeping, I'll read a programming book for a while.

346
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,280
Finished eating again?

347
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,070
I have to buy more food for you again.

348
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,070
You two tigers' appetite is just too voracious.

349
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,020
That's right!

350
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,910
Have you eaten?

351
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,900
I forgot. However, now I'm a little hungry.

352
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,970
Is there no one at your house?

353
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,430
There isn't. They left to go to work.

354
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,280
Do you have any spare change?

355
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,870
Hm?

356
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,040
It's nothing.

357
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,040
There's someone knocking on the door. I'm going to have a look.

358
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,100
Did you order the take-out?

359
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,820
That's right. The beef rice at this place is really delicious.

360
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,870
But... why did you leave for so long?

361
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,860
I didn't have any change. I went to borrow from the dean of a different department.

362
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,150
Dean?

363
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,100
 Weiwei, I'm coming in. 

364
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,030
Mom, you finished watching the TV drama?

365
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,530
Did the male and female leads get together?

366
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,220
How could it be so easy for the male and female leads in the TV drama?

367
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,650
Wouldn't they have to have a few misunderstandings and be separated a few times before getting together?

368
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,490
Otherwise, what will the TV station air?

369
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,540
It's already past 11 o'clock. Going to bed?

370
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,250
I know. Then I'm going to bed.

371
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,570
 Mom, you should go to bed early, too.  Okay? 

372
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,580
 ♫ At the moment when you suddenly stared at me ♫ 

373
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,760
 ♫ At the moment when words became unnecessary ♫ 

374
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,690
 ♫ At the moment when hearts gradually got closer ♫ 

375
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,400
 ♫ At this time, outside happened to grow dark ♫ 

376
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,550
 ♫ At this moment when I almost can't bear it anymore ♫ 

377
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,690
 ♫ At the moment when others appeared to be non-existent ♫ 

378
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,510
 ♫ At the moment when love quietly arrived ♫ 

379
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,330
 ♫ At this time, outside happened to grow dark ♫ 

380
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:48,970
 ♫ Words aren't needed, and romance seems so boundless ♫ 

381
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,830
 ♫ A night of limitless possibilities ♫ 

382
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,880
 ♫ Let candles replace all the lights, let music replace the sound of speech ♫ 

383
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,070
 ♫ Right now quiet wins over sound ♫ 

384
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,260
 ♫ If you ask me to speak, I can only say one thing ♫ 

385
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,430
 ♫ Let me become your possibilities ♫ 

386
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,660
 ♫ Let "Yes" replace all the "Nos," let courage replace all the alcohol ♫ 

387
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,840
 ♫ I furrow my brows yet I'm in your heart ♫ 

388
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,120
 ♫ If you ask me to speak, I can only say one thing ♫ 

389
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:41,200
 ♫ Let me become your possibilities ♫ 

390
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,900
Mr. Beauty, did you become stupid after taking your afternoon nap?

391
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:14,320
That's not it. Recently, I keep feeling that something's wrong with my computer.

392
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,070
However, after checking the system logs, there's no trace of anything.

393
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,070
Right now, even my desktop background has changed.

394
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,700
Really?

395
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,170
Eh, what was your previous background?

396
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,370
What else could it be? The picture of my goddess.

397
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,330
Darn. Your computer's been hacked.

398
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,240
But this hacker is pretty amusing; changing a beautiful woman into a temple.

399
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,360
He's trying to clear your head of desire.

400
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,690
The biggest problem is that

401
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,770
I can't change the background back. Nothing I do works.

402
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,000
Nothing you do works?

403
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,460
Let Third Brother come and have a look.

404
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,930
It couldn't have been done by someone from Zhen Yi, right?

405
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,800
It's not Zhen Yi. This guy's skill level is very high.

406
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,880
If it wasn't for the change of desktop background, Hao Mei definitely wouldn't have been able to discover it.

407
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,050
If it was someone from Zhen Yi, they wouldn't have done something like this to alert their target.

408
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,460
Then, what was the goal of changing the screen

409
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,170
and letting you discover it on purpose? Is he taunting you?

410
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,220
How should I know? What should we do now?

411
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,380
We can't let him come and go as he pleases.

412
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,730
The most important thing is... how do I restore the picture of my goddess?

413
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,690
It seems he is interested in you. He should visit again.

414
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,460
In your computer, I've left a monitoring backdoor.

415
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,860
As soon as he shows up, I'll know.

416
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,650
-  Sauteed cabbage with vinegar and spicy diced chicken.
- Okay. Hey, 

417
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,230
here, please have a seat.

418
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,020
- And let's get a fish head.
- Okay.

419
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,670
- I also want these.
- Okay. Good.

420
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,030
Please wait for just a moment. It'll come soon.

421
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,030
Why are you still playing on the computer? Get to work!

422
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,840
Quickly. Table number three. Sauteed cabbage with vinegar,

423
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,690
fish with pickled vegetables, and a spicy diced chicken. Hurry.

424
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,630
Quickly, quickly. I'm covering your room and board, but you only know how to play on the computer all day!

425
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,960
 Boss, can I get the bill? 

426
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Yes, coming!

427
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,940
 Welcome. Forgive me for not coming out to greet you. 

428
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,310
 Who are you? You're not him. 

429
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,770
 Who is "him?" 

430
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,440
 Stop pretending. 

431
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,610
 You are very familiar with us. 

432
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,130
 I don't have ill intentions. 

433
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,890
What's the situation? That fellow came again, right?

434
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,400
Chat with him some more. Stall him.

435
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,410
 Heck, with no ill intention! You're acting as if my computer is your backyard. 

436
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,170
 Why did you change my background? 

437
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,520
 Are you hacking my goddess? 

438
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,690
Brother Mei, pay attention to the main topic.

439
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,070
 Even if you really are here to hack my goddess, 

440
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,330
 you don't have to hack the computer of her fan. Right? 

441
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,910
 Is there such a serious grudge between the hacker and the fan? 

442
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,010
 It's not because of this. 

443
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,160
 Then why? 

444
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,860
 Do you know me? 

445
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,760
Did you find it?

446
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,840
He's in the vicinity of the school.

447
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,030
   

448
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,630
I  had just asked if he knew me, but he left.

449
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,830
Could it have been done by someone who knows us?

450
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,980
I couldn't see what he looked like.

451
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:50,110


452
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,020

00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,090
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

468
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,590
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

469
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,210
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

470
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,570
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

471
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,110
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

472
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:09,380
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

473
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,620
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

474
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,280
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

475
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,730
 ♫ Romance is fermenting ♫ 
 ♫ For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

476
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,500
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

477
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,060
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

478
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,480
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

479
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,940
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

480
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,790
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

481
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,360
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

482
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,770
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

483
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,500
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

484
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,130
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

485
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,740
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

486
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,030
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

487
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,720
