00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,510
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,470
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,620
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,550
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,760
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,550
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,530
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,470
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,660
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,730
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,780
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,810
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,480
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,950
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,170
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,020
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,190
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,120
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,300
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,370
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,470
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,250
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,180
   

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,070
   

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,510
 Wei Guang, you are finally online.  

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,460
 I will wait for you at the same old place in Jinling City. 
 Come here now. 

28
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,020
Cao Guang, you are finally here. I've been waiting for you for a long time.

29
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,900
Why are you looking for me?

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,770
Nothing serious. I just want to give you a surprise.

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,980
What is it?

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,380
This is a gift for you.

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,180
Take a look.

34
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,690
It's finally my turn to do something for you.

35
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you moved to tears now?

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,050
There are words on the other side, too.

37
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,410
You can call it Weiguang Sword, or Huanxi Sword.

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,820
Or you could call it Huanxi Weiguang Sword.

39
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,530
I trained so hard to forge it myself.

40
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,860
Besides, I was really lucky and got this equipment in one try.

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,770
I'm giving this to you.

42
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,570
It really is a good sword.  Can I try it out?

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,610
Sure. I'll PK with you for three rounds to try it out.

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,260
It is indeed an excellent sword.

45
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,900
I like it.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,540
Wei Guang,  when you say you like it,

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,140
all the hard work I put into it was worth it.

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,030
It was really worth it.

49
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,730
- Try again. 
-  Again.

50
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,630
Are you all right?

51
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,640
Huantian Xidi,

52
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,120
I have a gift for you, too.

53
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,410
What I am giving you is called the Severing Ties Sword.

54
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,870
Bei Weiwei, I, Cao Guang, have had enough of playing this hypocritical game with you!

55
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,250
When I was PKing with the Xiaoyu clan,

56
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,760
it was as if Master possessed me. I was particularly assertive with all this swag.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,010
Reflecting on it now, it feels good.

58
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,420
It sounds like you managed to demonstrate one-tenth of my power.

59
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,490
That much?

60
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,520
Hower, when I return to tell Erxi about this,

61
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,740
will she be angry?

62
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,300
No, no.  My Erxi is really easy-going.

63
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,610
Stop the car.

64
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,370
I've decided.  I'm going to buy her a cake to dote on her.

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,450
Welcome.

66
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,590
That expensive?

67
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,060
Lend it to me.  I'll pay you back when I get my paycheck from my internship.

68
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,480
Why did you give me this much?

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,790
The rest is for you to use to dote on me.

70
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,210
Let me have this chocolate cake.

71
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,180
And this, too. Pack it for me as well.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Take care.

73
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,390
Here.  To dote on you.

74
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,510
I don't like cakes.

75
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,770
Aren't you too hard to please?

76
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,750
Moreover, it's too small.

77
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,950
Complaining that the cake is too small?  You don't understand this.

78
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,070
You gave me ¥1,000. If I buy a large cake, I could only buy it a few times.

79
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,570
However, if I buy a small cake, I can buy it many, many times.

80
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,530
Which one do you want?

81
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,410
I want all of them.

82
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,900
So greedy.

83
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,480
Let's go.

84
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,060
Isn't she back yet?

85
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,450
Erxi.

86
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,470
What's wrong with you?

87
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,570
What happened?

88
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,930
Come on. Get up first.

89
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,220
I got it. I'll make you some brown sugar water.

90
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,530
Erxi, there's something

91
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,050
I would like to apologize for.

92
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,040
The people who bullied you in your company last time

93
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,230
are players from the game "A Chinese Ghost Story."

94
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,330
They thought you were me.

95
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,900
Hence, sorry, Erxi.

96
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,600
Because of me, you got all these troubles.

97
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,060
They thought I was you?

98
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,960
It's possible that at your interview last time,

99
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
you said that you were Luwei Weiwei.

100
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
However, don't worry, I have already taken revenge for you.

101
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,130
Also, I didn't tell them that you were my roommate,

102
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,720
in case they make more trouble for you.

103
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,370
This is for you.

104
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,320
This cake is what I bought as my way of apology.

105
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,270
Erxi, Your Majesty, please accept this with grace.

106
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,700
 What I am giving you is called the Severing Ties Sword. 

107
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,460
 Bei Weiwei, I, Cao Guang, have had enough of acting this hypocritical play of yours. 

108
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,340
It's your favorite cake!

109
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,240
Get out!

110
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,010
- Erxi.
- I told you to get out.

111
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,640
Yiran, why do you look so melancholy?

112
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,580
Are you in a bad mood?

113
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,480
What's wrong? Tell me.

114
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,850
What worries could I have?

115
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,210
I was just thinking that

116
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,300
perhaps I should find some new goals in my life now.

117
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,270
Are you talking about love or career?

118
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,020
Are you done with eating?

119
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,030
I'm almost done. This spaghetti is really tasty.

120
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm going to finish it all.

121
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,450
I'm going to get the check first.

122
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,680
Waitress, check, please.

123
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Okay. Do you have a membership card? You can get a discount.

124
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,630
I have one.

125
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,390
I don't need it. Just get the check.

126
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,460
Let me collect the points, okay?

127
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,610
In the photo album, there's a photo I took with my membership card.

128
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,420
What's wrong with you?

129
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,510
You only need to tell me the membership card number to collect points.

130
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,040
 Who said I was rejected? I just think I was taken in by her. 

131
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,460
  I feel humiliated. 

132
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,670
 I thought I was smart, 

133
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,650
 but I didn't see Bei Weiwei as so fickle. 

134
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,760
 Let bygones be bygones. With your qualifications, 

135
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,930
 there are so many pretty and sincere girls out there 

136
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,190
 for you to choose from. 

137
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,820
 Who cares about the kind of nerdy girl in the Computer Science with a high IQ but low EQ, right? 

138
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,580
 She acted so well. 

139
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,810
 How could she have a low EQ? 

140
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,230
 In the game, she was so attached to you. 

141
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,420
 Outside the game, she grabbed on to Xiao Nai so tightly. 

142
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,290
 Why isn't the Oscar for Best Actress 

143
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,650
 given to her? 

144
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,180
May I ask what the card number is?

145
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,240
I will just pay directly.

146
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,780
The total is ¥339.
 (Note: Approx. $50 USD) 

147
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,800
Just a moment.

148
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,220
A moment ago, I nearly choked to death when I was eating.

149
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,370
Are you hiding anything from me?

150
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,230
What would I hide from you?

151
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,330
Then how do you explain the video in your cell phone?

152
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,490
- Yiran, listen to my explanation. 
- There's nothing to explain.

153
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,180
What a shame for me to treat you as my good friend and tell you everything!

154
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,110
And you? Such an important matter and you hid it from me.

155
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,120
It's not like that.

156
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,290
I wanted to tell you then but I was afraid you wouldn't be happy.

157
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,880
Also, you don't live at the dorms, so I didn't have an opportunity to tell you.

158
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,310
And afterward? Why didn't you bring it up afterward?

159
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,500
Afterward... didn't you give up later?

160
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,850
I didn't have the courage to bring it up again.

161
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,900
It's such an important matter. How could you not bring it up?

162
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,530
For such a good person like Xiao Nai,

163
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,550
yet he is being tricked by a two-timer like Bei Weiwei.

164
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,310
How could you not tell me?

165
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,740
I wanted to post this online

166
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,620
to expose Bei Weiwei's true face.

167
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,550
But...

168
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,850
Why don't we post it online now?

169
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,860
Even if it's the summer recess, there are still many people who pay attention to Master.

170
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,570
I'll post it online right now and expose Bei Weiwei's true face.

171
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,520
Don't do that.

172
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,860
Wouldn't Xiao Nai be embarrassed if you do it this way?

173
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,820
I don't want to harm him.

174
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,490
Then do you want to keep him in the dark like this forever?

175
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,520
This won't do either.

176
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,570
Send me the video. I'll show it directly to Xiao Nai.

177
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,270
Okay, I will send the video to you.

178
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,550
I didn't expect Bei Weiwei to be this kind of a person.

179
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,750
My accommodation was completely meaningless.

180
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,850
Furthermore, someone like her is not worthy of Xiao Nai

181
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,880
and doesn't deserve my conceding.

182
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,780
Yiran, when do you plan to find him?

183
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,210
I can't wait for a single minute.

184
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,460
Hello.

185
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,660
Hello, is this Xiao Nai?

186
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,150
Yes. You are...

187
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,040
Hello, Senior. I'm Meng Yiran.

188
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,450
Hello, what's the matter?

189
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,380
I have something to tell you.

190
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,220
It concerns Bei Weiwei.

191
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,020
I think it's better that I tell you.

192
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,740
 Why don't we meet at a cafe? 

193
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,580
I'm not interested.

194
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,720
Hello. Hello?

195
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:38,960


196
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,760
Xiao Nai!

197
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,810
- Uncle Li.
- Have your parents returned?

198
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,670
Not yet. This time, the difficulty of the job is a little higher.

199
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,870
They may stay for a few months more.

200
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,090
Hey, are you still living out of the house right now?

201
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,920
Yup. However, it's not far.

202
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,120
Uncle Li, I'll be going first.

203
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,190
Fine. Take care.

204
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,480
Senior Xiao Nai.

205
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,920
I heard you were jogging around the garden here.

206
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,510
Hence, I came here to check. I didn't expect you to really be here.

207
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,150
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving first.

208
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,640
Senior, wait.

209
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,800
Why did you hang up on me yesterday?

210
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,100
When it's about my girlfriend,

211
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,600
I don't want to learn it from a third party.

212
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,780
Then, are you not interested in this as well?

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,680
 I just think I was taken in by her.  I feel humiliated. 

214
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,420
 I thought I was smart, 

215
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,760
 - but I didn't see Bei Weiwei as so fickle. 
 - Let bygones be bygones. 

216
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,190
When my roommate saw this video,

217
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,970
she wanted to post it online on the school forum. I eventually stopped her,

218
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,630
because I feel that a girl,

219
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,730
no matter what she did in the past,

220
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,880
but if this kind of video

221
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,990
becomes public,

222
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,060
it will cause her serious harm.

223
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,250
However, I don't want you to be deceived.

224
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,530
 We are already a couple in the game. 

225
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,040
 But in real life, she is with Xiao Nai now. 

226
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
 Doesn't our relationship count in the game? 

227
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,400
 So can she play other's feelings in the game? 

228
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,420
Oh no.

229
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,450
It seems that Erxi is mad for real,

230
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,710
but she shouldn't go this far with her personality.

231
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,140
Hello.

232
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,290
I'm downstairs. I feel like having breakfast.

233
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,770
Okay.

234
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,790
There's an emergency so early.

235
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,080
Yeah. Deleting some garbage files.

236
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,390
 Where is the video? Could it have been deleted by Yiran? 

237
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,110
Yesterday, was your roommate angry?

238
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,030
You noticed.

239
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,340
Zhao Erxi... usually she won't be angry because of these kinds of things.

240
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,820
Could it be that the Xiaoyu clan did something even more awful?

241
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,460
It seems that I went too easy on them yesterday.

242
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,820
Weiwei, I have been thinking about whether I should tell you about this.

243
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,700
What is it?

244
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,990
Look at this.

245
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,800
What is this?

246
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,430
 We are already a couple in the game. 

247
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,950
 But in real life, she is with Xiao Nai now. 

248
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,590
 Doesn't our relationship count in the game? 

249
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,310
 So can she play other's feelings in the game? 

250
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,900
This is not true.

251
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,120
I don't know why he said that.

252
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,560
He definitely confessed to me but I rejected him.

253
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,880
There's no way I could stay with him in the game for so long.

254
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,080
How could he just make stuff up? What rubbish!

255
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,910
He's way over the line.

256
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,560
Delete it.

257
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,640
What?

258
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
Meng Yiran came to find me with this video this morning.

259
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,910
She said her roommate accidentally took the video.

260
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,120
I deleted the video in her cell phone,

261
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,210
and made a copy in my own phone.

262
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,760
This should be the last copy.

263
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,010
Meng Yiran?

264
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,470
Why did she...

265
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,200
Weiwei, maybe telling you these things

266
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,770
will add to your worries,

267
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,970
but I think that you would rather

268
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,510
solve this yourself.

269
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,210
 Logically, you should have been the one to deal with this matter, 

270
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,160
 but there were too many people paying attention to this. 

271
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,090
 I thought it would be best to settle it quickly. 

272
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,360
Xiao Nai,

273
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,020
I suddenly thought of a person.

274
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,930
Who?

275
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,820
His name is... Yixiao Naihe.

276
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,030
Do you know him?

277
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,790
I found... that you resemble him very much.

278
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,340
Is that so?

279
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,990
I'm not familiar with him. When can I meet him?

280
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,260
You can right now.

281
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,190
Send me a copy of the video.

282
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,940
I'm going to ask Cao Guang to get the full story.

283
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,700
He keeps slandering me time and again. Enough of this.

284
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,580
Time and again?

285
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,270
Yeah. I'm tutoring Xiaoyang, right?

286
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:48,620
He took a photo of me when Xiaoyang's mother drove me back to school.

287
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,050
He implied that I had an unspoken relationship with the car owner.

288
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Fortunately, he blurred the photo and no one could tell that it was me.

289
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,630
Or else, I wouldn't be able to clear my name no matter what I did.

290
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,280
Now, he's slandering me to be a two-timer.

291
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,900
I really don't know how I offended him.

292
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,960
Do you want me to go with you?

293
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,800
No need.

294
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,310
No need. Your output is too powerful. I can handle this alone.

295
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,320
Once Erxi is not angry anymore,

296
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,290
I will get Cao Guang's number from her.

297
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,230
I'll prepare a sack and a wooden stick in advance.

298
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,880
If you're going to beat someone, you'd better bring me along.

299
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
Do you want to help me?

300
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,220
You are mistaken. At most, I will just function as a lookout for you.

301
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,290
If you can't beat him, I will help you then.

302
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,170
Right, I need to go to Xiaoyang's house this afternoon.

303
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,550
Let's go.

304
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,190
He just came back from his trip during the summer recess.

305
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,590
He wants me to go over and get his gifts. I almost forgot about this.

306
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,610
Okay. I'll drive you there.

307
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,250
You're a good little kitty.

308
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,230
Just when I start to become fond of you, I have to leave you now.

309
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,730
When your rightful owner is back,

310
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,650
I won't be back to take care of you again.

311
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,080
Will you miss me?

312
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,700
Or forget about me?

313
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,960
You are here. I came back early.

314
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,670
I didn't expect you to be so responsible

315
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,990
and would be here for Coffee every day. Thanks.

316
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,370
Now that you are back, I will stop coming here. Bye-bye.

317
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,080
Wait. Why are you in such a rush?

318
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,900
Wait here.

319
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,430
Don't be too touched. Just regard this as a small gesture to thank you.

320
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,700
How is it? Good enough for a little glutton like you?

321
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,660
Who says I like eating chocolates?

322
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,960
Give it to whoever you want.

323
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,420
I don't care!

324
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,850
Coffee, what is wrong with Erxi?

325
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,990
She even refused the chocolates.

326
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,930
Did she swallow explosives? She was full of temper.

327
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,240
If she doesn't want it, I will give it to someone else.

328
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,680
Wait here for a while.

329
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,630
Stop there!

330
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,040
What else do you want to say?

331
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,170
Why are you here?

332
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,120
I am Xiaoyang's tutor for foreign language.

333
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,230
You are Xiaoyang's tutor? Why don't I know about that?

334
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,160
Since my initial visit, I worked hard to become Xiaoyang's tutor.

335
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,480
I told him not to tell you so that I could surprise you.

336
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,950
Bei Weiwei, you must be feeling very happy now.

337
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,790
I tried all kinds of ways to win your affections

338
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,190
but you treated me like a fool.

339
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,390
What nonsense are you spouting?

340
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,210
Why would I be happy?

341
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,950
You should explain first. What's with the video?

342
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,900
What video?

343
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,110
 We are already a couple in the game. 

344
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,670
 But in real life, she is with Xiao Nai now. 

345
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,240
 Doesn't our relationship count in the game? 

346
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,750
 So can she play other's feelings in the game? 

347
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,270
Who filmed this?

348
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,130
That isn't important.

349
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,950
I just want to know when we became a couple in a game.

350
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,870
I didn't even know you were playing "A Chinese Ghost Story."

351
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,500
Keep on pretending,

352
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,230
Huantian Xidi.

353
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,500
What did you say?

354
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,320
Are you taken aback that I knew your username in the game?

355
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,370
Did you think my username in the game was Huantian Xidi?

356
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,330
Are you Weiguang?

357
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,630
You are finally done with your denial.

358
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,150
You got it wrong.

359
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,420
I'm not Huantian Xidi.

360
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,830
You are not? Who are you then?

361
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,890
No, who's Huantian Xidi then?

362
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,260
I won't tell you,

363
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,100
but I would like to know

364
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,980
what you did in the game last night.

365
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,440
Did she give you a sword as a gift in the game?

366
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,030
What about you? What did you do?

367
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,960
Fine. You don't need to answer me.

368
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,570
I think I know.

369
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,410
Cao Guang.

370
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,580
I have a question for you.

371
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,060
Speak.

372
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,600
If I were Huantian Xidi,

373
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,230
and Huantian Xidi were Bei Weiwei,

374
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,670
why did you, after everyone in school already knew about me and Xiao Nai,

375
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,670
still pretend not to know in the game

376
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,140
and stay with Huantian Xidi?

377
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,150
You said that you liked me in the past,

378
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,360
but you kept slandering me

379
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,890
and questioning me. Is this what you meant by liking?

380
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,490
I'm telling you in all seriousness, Cao Guang.

381
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,110
I don't like you at all.

382
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,050
In the past, I didn't, and I won't either in the future.

383
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,210
Please stay far away from me and my friends from now on.

384
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,710
I don't want to repeatedly

385
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,350
waste my time saving your world view.

386
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,610
If you're not Huantian Xidi,

387
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,470
how do you know my username is Weiguang?

388
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,570
How do you know she gave me a sword?

389
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,210
I won't tell you how I know

390
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,940
and I won't you tell you who Huantian Xidi is.

391
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,040
People like you are so quick to impose your assumptions on others.

392
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,200
I can't spend even one minute with you!

393
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,530
 I clearly asked someone to help me find your username in the game. 

394
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,770
 Why is it not? 

395
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,340
 If it's not you... who could it be? 

396
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,890
Not possible.

397
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,960
Definitely not possible.

398
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,500
What is it?

399
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,870
I just met Cao Guang downstairs at Xiaoyang's house.

400
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,770
In the game... He took Erxi for me.

401
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:36,360
So he thought that in the game, you were with him?

402
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,990
Yes.

403
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,460
I don't know how he made that mistake.

404
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,180
Erxi really likes Weiguang in the game.

405
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,290
She is definitely aware

406
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,560
that Cao Guang mistook her for me.

407
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,530
That's why she was so angry.

408
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,120
It had nothing to do with the Xiaoyu clan.

409
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,360
I was completely off the mark.

410
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,760
What should I do now?

411
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,420
I called her the entire morning, and she won't answer.

412
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,430
She will finally understand.

413
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,170
This has nothing to do with you.

414
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,490
I hope so.

415
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,000
Erxi, are you in?

416
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,850
I would like to talk to you.

417
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,050
Then take your time to calm down.

418
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,240
I will look for you tomorrow.

419
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,260
Hello, who are you?

420
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm Xiao Nai.

421
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,730
Xiao Nai? How do you know my number?

422
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,810
I have my ways.

423
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,420
Are you here to brag about how great you are?

424
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm here to solve your problem.

425
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Tonight at 10:00 p.m. See you at the school basketball court.

426
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,050
- You are late.
- It's pretty good that I even showed up.

427
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,800
If you still don't know what is going on,

428
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,240
perhaps you are not worthy of the title of Foreign Language  Scholar.

429
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,040
What is Bei Weiwei's username?

430
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,290
You don't need to know,

431
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,400
but it's definitely not the one you think.

432
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,030
Then, who exactly is Huantian Xidi?

433
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,990
I'm not here to give you answers today.

434
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,840
Meng Yiran's roommate filmed that video.

435
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,790
I hope you will resolve this as soon as possible.

436
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,460
In the future, I don't want to hear anymore negative rumors about Weiwei.

437
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,360
Also, as a man,

438
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,770
don't harm the friendship between two girls

439
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,180
to pay for your foolishness.

440
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,570
After seeing my video, did you never doubt Bei Weiwei?

441
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,570
You could trust her that much?

442
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,590
Why wouldn't I trust my girl?

443
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,010
 Cao Guang. 

444
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,630
 If I were Huantian Xidi 

445
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,480
 and Huantian Xidi were Bei Beiwei, 

446
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,710
 why did you, after everyone in school already knew about me and Xiao Nai, 

447
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,120
 still pretend not to know in the game and stay with Huantian Xidi? 

448
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,240
 You said that you liked me in the past, 

449
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,440
 but you kept slandering me and questioning me. 

450
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,020
 Is this what you meant by liking? 

451
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,900
 I'm telling you in all seriousness, Cao Guang. 

452
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,450
 I don't like you at all. 

453
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,160
 In the past, I didn't, and I won't either in the future. 

454
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,500
 Please stay far away from me and my friends from now on. 

455
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,970
 I don't ever want to see you again. 

456
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,670
 I don't want to repeatedly waste my time saving your world view. 

457
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,160
 This is a gift for you. 

458
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,750
 It's finally my turn to do something for you. 

459
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,370
 Are you moved to tears now? 

460
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,290
 You can call it Weiguang Sword or Huanxi Sword. 

461
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,130
 Or you could call it Huanxi Weiguang Sword. 

462
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,750
 I trained so hard to forge it myself. 

463
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,790
 Besides, I was really lucky and got this equipment in one try. 

464
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,780
Zhao Erxi.

465
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,670
How did you know I was here?

466
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,890
Didn't you brag about interning at Zhi Yi Technology

467
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,040
and getting ¥150 a day?

468
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,660
Why are you here? I'm not going to feed your cat anymore.

469
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm not here to ask you to feed my cat.

470
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,990
I'm here to apologize to you.

471
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,820
Apologize?

472
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,230
What is there to apologize?

473
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,840
Zhao Erxi!

474
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,730
I just realized you are Huantian Xidi.

475
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,130
I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry.

476
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,170
How did you know?

477
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,970
Yesterday, Bei Weiwei...

478
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,540
Enough, since you already know your mistake,

479
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,060
from now on, if you like Weiwei, go after her yourself. Stop asking me to help.

480
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,660
I'm neither her servant nor your matchmaker.

481
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,860
Stop showing up in front of me again.

482
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,560
No, Erxi, I'm really sorry. I'm sincerely here to apologize.

483
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,780
I got everything wrong and hurt you at the end.

484
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,630
 ♫ I spent yet another Valentine's Day alone in silence ♫ 

485
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,700
Cao Guang, I just want to ask you a question.
 ♫  I don't want contacts out of sympathy ♫ 

486
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,630
Did Weiguang in the game

487
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,160
ever like Huantian Xidi a little bit?

488
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,980
 ♫ Feigning strength with a fragile heart ♫ 

489
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,540
I... I always thought that you were Weiwei.
  ♫ I want to meet someone with a sincere heart ♫ 

490
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,450
 ♫ I want to hear a word of love that I can believe. I 
want to forget ♫ 

491
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,440
How could it disappear from my cellphone?

492
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,150
Did your hand slip and accidentally delete it?

493
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,940
 Probably not. 

494
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,670
 Did you click the wrong button? 

495
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,200


496
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,680
Erxi, I always feel you are a very good girl

497
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,910
and a good friend.

498
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,670
Who wants to be friends with you?!

499
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:53,880


500
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,250
 Yang Yang "Just One Smile Is Very Alluring" 

501
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,740
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

502
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,400
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

503
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,880
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

504
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,550
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

505
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,040
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

506
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,710
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

507
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,090
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

508
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,780
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

509
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,370
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

510
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,030
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

511
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,390
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

512
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,210
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

513
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,730
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

514
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,200
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

515
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,900
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

516
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,490
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

517
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,070
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

518
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,470
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

519
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,030
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫
