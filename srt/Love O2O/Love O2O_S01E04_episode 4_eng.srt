 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,600
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,630
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,500
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,600
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,000
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,800
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,600
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,300
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,200
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,100
   

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,000
   

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,800
In another ten minutes, Xiao Yang's mom will be back. Let's have a look before we leave.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,300
His mom?  Why?

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
To take a look at his mom's car, right?

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Otherwise, what if you say I photoshopped the photo?

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
There's no need.

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,700
I've already deleted the post.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,200
Also, I have to apologize.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,900
Sorry, Bei Weiwei. I've misunderstood you.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,900
Okay. I accept.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,600
Just that and we're okay then?

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,100
What else should we do?

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,400
You're not what I thought you'd be like.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
When judging a person, you shouldn't rely only on your suppositions.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,400
Oh, by the way,  what's wrong with Xiao Yang's legs?

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,600
- A car accident.
- A car accident?

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Because of that accident, Xiao Yang lost his father.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,700
Since then, he lost his ability to stand up.

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,200
He seems rather cheerful.  I didn't realize...

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,400
But isn't it a bit inappropriate to teach him to play games? He's still so young.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,200
You're wrong.  I didn't teach him to play games. He taught me.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
He taught you?

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,930
In the past, I was also a little prejudiced against games.

49
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,200
I thought playing them would make him lose his sense of purpose.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Later,  when Xiao Yang's mom found me,

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
she hoped I could get Xiao Yang to drop his habit of playing games.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,300
I thought if you want to change someone's way of thinking,

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,000
I had to know what it was like to play games first.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,400
So, I tried it for myself.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,600
I didn't expect that I changed my own view of gaming.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,200
So, you also fell in love with gaming?

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Actually, the game is also a universe by itself.  There is no good or bad about it.

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,600
It's just that everyone has his own way of approaching it.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Maybe in this world, there are many other people like Xiao Yang.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,900
They can't walk outside,

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,250
but through games, they can see a lot more scenery from different places, and meet more people.

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,200
From this perspective,

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
games have a lot of purposes. Do they not?

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The only area where I've changed Xiao Yang is probably just

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,000
that I guided him to focus his interest in game development.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
Xiao Yang changed me, too.

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,400
At least, my present goal is

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
to become a game designer.

69
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:05,070


70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Where are Xiao Ling and Si Si? Is it just you alone in the dorm?

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Of course, Xiao Ling went to see Da Zhong.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,400
That child, Si Si, has been going out often recently.

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Am I seeing this for real? You're playing "A Chinese Ghost Story."

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
That's right. I have to quickly study it

75
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,000
due to the lie I told during the last interview.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
You didn't get exposed, so why are you worrying about?

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
What if I get chosen?

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,900
By the time I join the company, if I'm completely clueless, the truth will definitely come out.

79
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm just afraid to damage your Luwei Weiwei's reputation.

80
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,600
Okay, then wait a bit, I'll lead you.

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,700
I don't want to! I don't want to be on the same server as you.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,600
In that old server, everyone is a veteran player with powerful skills. How can a newbie like me catch up?

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Therefore, I brilliantly selected a new server.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The new server is called "Godly Sister."

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It especially matches my personality.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,600
And everybody are all newbies, making it easier to communicate.  I wouldn't lose at the starting line.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
Fine, then. In any case, you've decided to storm the new server single-handedly.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
- If there are problems, look for me then.
- Yup.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,900
   

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,700
Why is there so little news about the Couple PK Competition?

91
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't even know when it will officially start.

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,900
What? Storyline video competition?

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,100
Zhenshui Wuxiang?

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,100
Don't be scared. I'm here.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
It's great that you came.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,600
We wonder what love is in this world.  It can make people give up their life for it.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,480
Don't speak nonsense. Let's return to Jinling city now.

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,400
You must get well soon.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,700
My heart is also hurt, my tears have also run dry.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,400
Why don't you care about me?

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,100
   
(Note: Wordplay on Luwei with the meaning "dumb and rustic")

102
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,900
"Dumb and Rustic Weiwei?"

103
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,850
  

104
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,800
Stop right there! How could you pick her?

105
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,200
You really don't know how broken-hearted I am. I won't listen!

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,900
You can't go. This time, I'm absolutely not letting you go.

107
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,700
The world has created too many obstacles for you and me.

108
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,900
And you're leaving me like this?

109
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,200
In the end, what did I do wrong?

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I just wanted to find a pure love.

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Both of you, remember this. I will never let you go!

112
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,700
In the end, what did I do wrong?

113
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,300
Are you okay?

114
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Let's go.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
"Dumb and Rustic Weiwei?"

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,900
Luwei Weiwei?
( Her proper user ID )

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is this supposed to be funny?

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 Making fun of other people through implication, is it fun? 

119
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,300
 I never thought you were this kind of person. 

120
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,800
What's wrong?

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,800
It's nothing. In lawless places, evil abounds.

122
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,300
I'm going to sleep.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
- What is it?
 - That is, Third Brother... 

124
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,800
 There's a situation. Quickly, go to the forum and have a look. 

125
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,100
Zhenshui Wuxiang made a video that was

126
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
making fun of our Third Sister-in-Law. It's aggravating to death.

127
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,000
Now, Yugong is also there scolding people.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Okay, I'll be there soon.

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
What?

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Yugong, Houzi, quickly gather the socks and throw them in the bathroom.

131
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,900
- Third Brother is coming back.
- Sure.

132
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Third Brother is coming back!

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,700
Ah, hurry, hurry!

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Wow, who's socks are these? They're so stinky!

135
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,100
Hao Mei, they're yours. Right?

136
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
This isn't mine. This is Yu Banshan's sock!

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,700
- What's mine?
- It's yours, Yu Banshan!

138
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,100
Since when did I have socks? Who's pair of underwear is this?

139
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,200
- Is it yours?
- N-No!

140
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,100
It's not mine. it's not mine! Let's go!

141
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,800
- How is it mine?
- It definitely is Hao Mei's!

142
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,780
This Zhenshui Wuxiang is too narcissistic.  He continues to claim that our Third Sister-in-Law is stalking him.

143
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,600
He doesn't even consider his own looks. Can he even compete with our Third Brother?

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Is that narcissistic? It's "incredibly" narcissistic!

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I heard that this fellow is some sort of heir from a rich family.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
His looks are okay.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,600
Third Brother simply doesn't post his picture. As soon as he posts it,

148
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,400
who would believe that Third Sister-in-Law is stalking Zhenshui?

149
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,900
I saw someone from our server talking about Third Sister-in-Law in the post.

150
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,000
He said that she was dumped by Zhenshui Wuxiang.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
That irritated me so much.

152
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
I've already yelled at him 300 times. Now, he's afraid to speak.

153
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Why does it need to be this bothersome?

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,500
Third Brother, go to the forum and report this post.

155
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,400
No need. Keep the post.

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
We'll resolve it in a civilized way.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
Civilized? How civilized?

158
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,160
Tomorrow, we'll wait for him to come online.

159
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,600
 Actually, the game is also a universe by itself.  There is no good or bad about it. 

160
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
 It's just that everyone has his own way of approaching it. 

161
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,190
 Maybe in this world, there are many other people like Xiao Yang. 

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,400
 They can't walk outside, 

163
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,800
 but through games, they can see a lot more scenery from different places, 

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,400
 meet more people. From this perspective, 

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
 games have a lot of purposes. Do they not? 

166
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,660
Bei Weiwei!

167
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,610
Cao Guang, are you jogging here, too?

168
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,220
I just saw you swipe the card four different times.

169
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,960
You won't expose me again, will you?

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,790
I just help fellow classmates check in once in a while.

171
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,070
Would I be that petty?

172
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,360
Based on your track record, that's not very believable.

173
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,400
However, thank you, anyway. I'll get back to my jogging.

174
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,910
Wait!

175
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,490
Maybe I can treat you to a meal?

176
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,970
No, thank you. I already made a plan to eat with my roommates.

177
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,620
When are you free? I'll treat you to breakfast.

178
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,940
I want to apologize for what happened before. I don't think a simple apology is enough.

179
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,320
It's really not necessary. It's fine that we cleared things up.

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,610
Just don't do anything like that anymore.

181
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,600
If I go back in time, I would still do it again.

182
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
- What? 
 - No.

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,550
W-What I meant was that... it was good to have that happen last time.

184
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,300
No... I meant I'm glad to meet you.

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,030
I wanted to ask you one more thing.

186
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,940
Do you have a boyfriend?

187
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,440
No, I don't. And I don't plan to get one, either.

188
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,640
I'll get back to my jog. Bye-bye!

189
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,230
Bye-bye!

190
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,910
 Today, we will analyze film genres in Hollywood. 

191
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,650
 Let's use the "Titanic" as an example. 

192
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,800
 I trust everyone here has seen this film. 

193
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,700
 20th Century Fox 

194
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,640
 and Paramount jointly funded 

195
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,430
 and made this film in 1994. 

196
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,410
 This film 

197
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,980
 has two very clear characteristics of film genres. 

198
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,800
 They are romance and catastrophe. 

199
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
This is the seat I saved. You should move over.

200
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,320
I got here first.

201
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,260
Cao Guang?

202
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,680
You know me. Even so, I won't concede this to you.

203
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,340
I came here early in the morning to save the seat. I only went to have breakfast.

204
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,200
You see. My book is still here!

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,130
Before you really make me mad, you'd better move down!

206
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,470
I'm warning you. When I get angry, even I'm scared of myself!

207
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,850
Just let me go in, okay?

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,040
Classmate, are you playing on a slide?

209
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,580
Can't you see this chair is broken?

210
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,690
Really, I forgot to check my horoscope before leaving.

211
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,130
What lousy luck to run into such a jerk!

212
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,420
It's your own fault for arriving late, yet you're still whining?

213
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,410
Shut up!

214
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,700
Classmate, about this type of English you are speaking,

215
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,640
even I, a student in the Foreign Language Department, can't understand. A dialect?

216
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,830
I want you to shut up.

217
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,480
Finally, it's not sliding down anymore. Comfy!

218
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,930
What are you looking at? Is your conscience bothering you?

219
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,830
You got bored with playing on the slide, so now, you're playing on the horizontal bar.

220
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,530
Correct. I am playing on the horizontal bar. I'll just play on it to show you.

221
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,540
- Are you sick?
- Do you have medicine?

222
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,360
What's going on?

223
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,680
Should we continue to analyze the movie,

224
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,250
or should we have all your classmates enjoy your wonderful performance?

225
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,920
- You're back.
- Yes.

226
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,380
What happened? Did you fall down?

227
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,770
- Weiwei, you have to find justice for me. 
- What's wrong?

228
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,800
Today, I ran into the annoying guy, Cao Guang.

229
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,240
Not only did he embarrass me, but he also made me sit on a single bar for the entire class.

230
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,100
Walking my way back, I lived through the highest rate of turning people's head in my life.

231
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,240
Then, you didn't suffer this injury in vain.

232
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,560
Congratulations on becoming famous.

233
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,170
How is it? Serious? Do you need to go to the medical office to have a look?

234
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,290
No need. The next time I see that annoying guy,

235
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,570
I definitely won't spare him−ah!

236
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,180
It seems that it's not serious. Lie down for a while.

237
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,850
- Let me know if you still feel uncomfortable later.
- Okay.

238
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,850
 Zhenshui... he doesn't even dare respond to messages now? 

239
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,520
 Luwei Weiwei, why are you here? 

240
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,420
 Isn't Yixiao Naihe having a duel with Zhenshui Wuxiang right now? Aren't you going to watch? 

241
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,440
 Duel? 

242
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,800
 No way. Do you not know? Come. Come. Let's go together. 

243
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,450
 Why is only Yixiao Naihe here? Why hasn't Zhenshui Wuxiang come yet? 

244
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,310
 Couldn't it be that he's too scared to come? 

245
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,120
 I think for this fight today, Yixiao Naihe has an unfair advantage. 

246
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,510
 They're both players. What's with this unfair advantage? 

247
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,800
 I say, Zhenshui Wuxiang is a wallet warrior. 
(Note:  A player who pays money to win the game.) 

248
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,120
 Besides, Zhenshui Wuxiang did such a vulgar deed. He was asking for it. 

249
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,230
I'm so excited! I actually get to watch Yixiao Naihe PK (duel) against someone.

250
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,770
- We can watch a god at work.
- Get the video recording ready!

251
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,880
 My computer isn't good enough. After you've recorded it, send it to me. 

252
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
 No problem. 

253
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,490
- Third Sister-in-Law, you've finally come online.
- Hello.

254
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,090
What happened? Master is suddenly going to PK with Zhenshui Wuxiang?

255
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,620
Do you not know about the video?

256
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,590
Master... Is it because of the video?

257
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,060
Of course. In this kind of situation,

258
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,960
if he didn't beat Zhenshui Wuxiang up to the point that even his dad doesn't recognize him,

259
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,130
how can Naihe continue to show his face in the game?

260
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,480
That's right. At the very least, he has to shave off two levels.

261
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Shave off two levels? But PK doesn't reduce your levels.

262
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,970
PK doesn't reduce your levels, but duel challenges will.

263
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,810
Did you not see the letter of challenge that Naihe sent?

264
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,280
I just got online.

265
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,450
The letter of challenge was sent yesterday.

266
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,430
Every five minutes, the system announces Zhenshui Wuxiang's status.

267
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,530
Zhenshui Wuxiang is clearly online, but doesn't dare face the challenge.

268
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,020
Zhenshui Wuxiang won't take up the challenge.

269
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,990
Even though he and Master both have top-tier equipment,

270
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,390
coming to duel is a guaranteed failure. His level is so high.

271
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,100
If he loses one level, he needs to train for a long time to get it back,

272
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,580
even more so for two levels.

273
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,030
It doesn't matter whether he agrees to it or not. Naihe's letter of challenge is for two rounds.

274
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,920
As long as Zhenshui Wuxiang wins one round, he is considered the winner.

275
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,110
He will let go of the incident about the video.

276
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,360
In addition, during the fight, Naihe will voluntarily be equipped with two fewer magical items.

277
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,180
Tell me. If he doesn't even agree to this, is Zhenshui Wuxiang still considered a man?

278
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,980
Losing is better than not coming.

279
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,790
Sinister. Truly sinister.

280
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,860
 Zhenshui Wuxiang and Xiaoyu's tribe have arrived. 

281
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,540
Now, we finally have a show.

282
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,220
  They're here. They're here. 

283
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,450
 Xiaoyu's tribe is here. 

284
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,270
It's been a long time since it's been this exciting. Yugong, do you want to make a bet with me?

285
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,780
What is there to bet with? Do you think Naihe will lose?

286
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,870
How shallow. I'll bet with you on

287
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,800
how many minutes it will take Naihe to take care of him.

288
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,710
Naihe became invisible.

289
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,060
 Ah, an expert really is indeed different. 

290
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,150
Oh no, oh no! Caught by Naihe's Swing Set Chain. He's doomed for sure.

291
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,510
Why can't he escape?

292
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,550
Wind Gathering Cloud? Naihe's group attack skill!

293
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,640
It's over this quickly. So, Zhenshui skills were this shabby.

294
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,980
Dull, boring, without the slightest suspense.

295
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,700
 He is such a bully! 

296
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,110
Who doesn't know that Yixiao Naihe can take on many people at once? By forcing Zhenshui to a duel

297
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,150
is like ganging up on him.   This is such an unfair fight!

298
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,250
Exactly! I'm extremely fed up!

299
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,310
Zhenshui, whether you lose or win, you'll always be my hero in my heart.

300
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,850
Yaoyao, don't worry about me. Stand offstage and watch with attention!

301
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,880
Yixiao Naihe, Zhenshui can't beat you,

302
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,120
but aren't you breaking your words?

303
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,240
How so?

304
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,560
You said you wouldn't wear two of your equipment!

305
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,130
Yaoyao!

306
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,170
In the first round, I didn't wear the ring.

307
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,420
- It turns out he didn't wear the ring!
- Wow, and he still obliterated Zhenshui in no time.

308
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,530
I really sympathize with this Zhenshui Wuxiang.

309
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,050
Too pitiful.

310
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,390
This loss of one level will probably require training for one month.

311
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,360
If he really drops two levels... My head hurts when I think of it.

312
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,650
It's completely boring. Such a one-sided crush.

313
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,580
I can't bear to continue watching.

314
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,160
This round, I'll fight you with only one hand.

315
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,030
There's no need. I will also wear less equipment.

316
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,770
Up to you.

317
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:44,270


318
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,420
 Good! Amazing! Strong! How amazing! 

319
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
 Wow, so strong. 

320
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,710
 He's too amazing! Just too amazing! 

321
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,510
Is this fun for you?

322
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,120
One must humiliate himself before others would do the same to him.

323
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,940
Okay. I admit my skill can't match up to yours. I will accept the loss when making the bet.

324
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,660
I'll delete the video. Yaoyao and I will re-shoot one.

325
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,060
I already lost the levels as compensation to you.

326
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,770
Let's consider our score settled.

327
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,310
- No need. Just delete the video. 
 - Let's go.

328
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,660
Naihe, I saw that Zhenshui Wuxiang also wore less equipment.

329
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,600
You probably thought of this before, right?

330
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
What's the point of thinking about him?

331
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,870
Master doesn't need to consider him at all.

332
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,660
- But you shaved off two of his levels.
- Yes.

333
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,670
I think he might even have thoughts of death then.

334
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,440
At the very least, he will have to train for two months.

335
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,160
And you didn't give yourself a margin of error. What if you lost a round?

336
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,710
For example, a sudden power outage, sudden internet disconnection,

337
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,070
then you would really let him get away with the video?

338
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,860
If I lose, I lose. After all, if I lose,

339
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,160
my spouse is still here.

340
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,220
What Naihe meant is that if he loses, he'll stop dealing with the issue,

341
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,750
but he never mentioned the Sister-in-Law.

342
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,090
Sister-in-Law's skills are far better than Naihe's.

343
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,420
Every time we fight monsters, Sister-in-Law always attacks first.

344
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,490
Naihe just leeches off his wife.

345
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,270
- You're so flattering.
- I went to the forum and took a peek.

346
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,870
That fellow already deleted the video. His speed is pretty fast.

347
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,650
This fellow... why is he so obedient?

348
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,350
Why do you sound so regretful to hear the news?

349
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,780
It's extremely regretful.

350
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,120
If he refuses to delete the video, then we will...

351
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,070
- Hack his computer.
- Clear his account.

352
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,370
And then, I'd chase after Xiaoyu Yaoyao.

353
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,890
You guys are too evil.

354
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,990
You flatter me. Compared to Naihe, it's just "one hair among nine oxen."
 (Note:  A drop in the bucket - too insignificant) 

355
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,880
"One hair among nine oxen?" You can use the idiom this way!

356
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,400
Don't mind these details.

357
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,380
Weiwei, let's go.

358
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,450
- Where? 
 - A place without them.

359
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,050
It's so beautiful.

360
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,240
Logically, you should have been the one to deal with this matter,

361
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,190
but there were too many people paying attention to this.

362
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,150
I thought it would be best to settle it quickly.

363
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,690
 Master... is he explaining himself to me? 

364
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,840
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

365
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,550
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

366
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,090

 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

411
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,750
Weiwei, are you free today?

412
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,830
Y-You really don't need to treat me to a meal.

413
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,500
Then you... wouldn't object to my walking with you, right?

414
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,830
Hello, who are you looking for?

415
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,140
Weiwei? Who are you?

416
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,420
Cao Guang? She's not here.

417
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,090
Nice.

418
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,600
Why are you so angry?

419
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,580
Weiwei, is this Cao Guang pursuing you?

420
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,220
It seems like it. What do I do?

421
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,440
What do you mean "What do I do?" Cold shoulder!
 (Note: Literally says "cold salad." It's a pun.) 

422
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,910
Weiwei, under no circumstance can you consider him.

423
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,250
From the last incident of the photo, you can tell that guy has an integrity problem.

424
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,170
You have to be that kind of a person in order to project that mindset onto others, right?

425
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,100
Moreover, he treated me so awfully last time in class.

426
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,640
Weiwei, he can't even get past me.

427
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,350
You must not bet your lifelong happiness on him.

428
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,600
Wait.  Why do I feel that you harbor a serious grudge against this Cao Guang?

429
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,090
In any case,  he just irritates me.

430
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,760
Even though in our school, he is second only to Xiao Nai in looks and talent,

431
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,560
still, I, Zhao Erxi, don't like him. I believe you, Bei Weiwei, won't like him either.

432
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,310
That's true. Indeed, I don't like him.

433
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,590
However, looking at it from a different perspective,

434
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,810
you don't even think much of Cao Guang.

435
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,950
You'll only marry Master Xiao Nai.

436
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,300
Erxi, can you stick to the point?

437
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,400
Anyway, I believe I've already made my position clear.

438
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,950
I don't like ambiguity,

439
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,290
or want to waste his time.

440
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,000
Weiwei, you're the best.

441
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,660
We share the same front against the enemy.

442
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,120
But what kind of person do you like?

443
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,960
Oh, my head really hurts!

444
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,870
As if I need you to worry about me.

445
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,780
Weiwei.  Weiwei!

446
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,250
- What is it?
- Weiwei, hurry and come out!  It's Master!

447
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,960
-  Master? 
- Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

448
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,820
- Where is he?
- Master Xiao Nai!

449
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,850
I've heard that lately Master is living on campus!  Apparently, it's true!

450
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,500
Huh?  What is that girl doing?

451
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,070
She wants to move in on my master!

452
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,480
Wow!  Even though I don't want anyone to approach the master of our department,

453
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,940
but Master really is too aloof and cold-hearted.

454
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,090
Even from far away, I can catch the scent of a broken heart.

455
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,000
Weiwei, why are you staring blankly?

456
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,400
I thought of something.

457
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
What did you think of?

458
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,410
A way to reject Cao Guang.  I have an idea.

459
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,880
What is it?

460
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,890
I'll borrow Master Xiao Nai's name.

461
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,010
Is no one sitting here, right?

462
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,060
N-No one.

463
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,540
The vinegar sautéed fish of the dining hall looks pretty good today.

464
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,580
Do you have some time later?

465
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,560
Yes.

466
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,060
There's something I want to tell you.

467
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,570
Okay.

468
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,500
Eat first.

469
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,040
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

470
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,540
Cao Guang, I know what you want.

471
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:09,420
But I really think we aren't right for each other.  I'm really sorry.

472
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,090
If you don't give it a try, how will you know we're not suited for each other?

473
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,240
I don't want to waste your time.

474
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,150
I don't think it's wasting my time.

475
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,320
No matter what, I have the right to pursue you.

476
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,390
Right until the day when you change your mind.

477
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,290
 I'm sorry for borrowing Senior Xiao Nai's reputation to use here. 

478
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,340
Actually, I already have someone I like.

479
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,190
Who is it?

480
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,480
Well... I've always wanted to find someone in the Computer Science Department.

481
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
So, we could better share a common language.

482
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,990
- So...
- Computer Science Department...

483
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,540
That's right.  Someone like Xiao Nai.

484
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,550
Hey, what's going on?

485
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,080
The talented scholar Cao is rejected by the beauty queen of the Computer Sciences Department?

486
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,500
It's none of your business.

487
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,550
As a member of the Journalism Club, I must say that

488
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,060
your taste in women is too poor.

489
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,210
You can be interested in anyone else, but why do you have to like a beauty queen who likes to ride in luxury cars?

490
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,990
Getting rejected is my personal business.  I don't need you to be running your mouth here.

491
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,270
Also, the incident about Bei Weiwei's photo was a misunderstanding.

492
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,980
I've already took it down from the internet.

493
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,060
So, you are seriously into her.

494
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,120
You were rejected, yet still stand up for her?

495
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,810
I'm not standing up for her. It's the truth.

496
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,020
I'm warning you.

497
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,810
This matter ends here.

498
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,350
Stop running your mouth about it.

499
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,170
Be careful that I might do something not so nice to you.

500
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,100
This Bei Weiwei definitely has an issue.

501
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,650
I don't believe that I can't find out what it is.

502
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,940
That's not right. I have to tell Yiran that Bei Weiwei also likes Xiao Nai.

503
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,840
Bring it here.

504
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,940
Ah, you have a girlfriend but don't even tell your brothers.

505
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,590
That's right! Treat us to a meal.

506
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,120
What are you talking about? She's not my girlfriend.

507
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,180
If she's not your girlfriend, where did you get this photo?

508
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,030
Huh? Isn't this Bei Weiwei from the Computer Science Department?

509
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,390
Are you fond of girls like her?

510
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,550
Enough. Stop messing around.

511
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,060
It can't be that she doesn't like you and rejected you, can it?

512
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,190
I just haven't succeeded yet.

513
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,370
Our most talented scholar Cao actually failed to woo a girl.

514
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,070
It's too unfathomable.

515
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,000
You've had a lot of girlfriends. Hurry and come up with some ideas.

516
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,260
Okay. Cao Guang, when it comes to wooing ladies:

517
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,220
first, you have to adapt to her interests.

518
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,290
Whatever she likes to do, you do it as well.

519
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,120
This way, you'll have common topics and common hobbies.

520
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,510
Afterwards, you'll understand.

521
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,530
Games...

522
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,860
So brilliant, Brother.

523
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,890
I'll cover your dinner tonight. What do you want to eat?

524
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,750
You said it! Let's have hot pot.

525
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,140
- Shall we go?
- Let's go!

526
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,510
What's wrong, Class Leader?

527
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,800
I heard you stay at the first dorm for women. Can you do me a favor?

528
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,640
Can you help me have a look of Bei Weiwei's game ID?

529
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,830
I will make sure that all your absences for this month be deleted.

530
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,110
Deal. Leave it to me.

531
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,960
Thank you.

532
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,570
Cao Guang, are you coming to play ball?

533
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,910
- I'm coming. Wait a moment.
- Okay.

534
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,770
 Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! 

535
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,160
- Nice shot!
- Nice!

536
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,210
I'm not playing anymore! This is pure torture. I want to be on Third Brother's team.

537
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,550
Hey, Mr. Sleeping Beauty, I didn't complain about you yet you're whining about me?

538
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,650
What did you say? Say it again and I will beat you to a pulp.

539
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,750
With the tiny body of yours?

540
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,580
- They've started a fight. 
- Fight, fight, fight!

541
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,160
Ignore them. Let's continue.

542
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,300
- Okay. 
- Guard them.

543
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,360
Guard them!

544
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,800
Isn't he the guy from the Computer Science Department?

545
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,210
Xiao Nai?

546
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,170
So, you're Xiao Nai.

547
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,080
I am.

548
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,870
Are you interested in a game?

549
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,810
It would be discourteous to decline.

550
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:15,900


551
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,500
