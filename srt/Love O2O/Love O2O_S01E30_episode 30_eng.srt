 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,550
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,540
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,480
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,730
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,480
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,420
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,430
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,090
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,620
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,670
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,710
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,880
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,820
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,950
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,040
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,250
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,080
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,230
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,260
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,360
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,350
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,160
   

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,870
   

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,700
He's great. He could even hold Erxi like this.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,340
He has a chance.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,560
Weiwei, come and take a look now.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,980
Should we rescue Erxi?

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,820
Are you stupid?

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,470
Can't you feel the lovey-dovey atmosphere between Erxi and Cao Guang?

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,070
Can't you feel the lovey-dovey atmosphere between Erxi and Cao Guang?

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,280
It's the classic scene for budding love in a romantic drama.

34
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,090


35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,540
This is my best friend.

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,790
Have you ever been in love?

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,710
Have I?

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,960
My apologies. I will teach her.

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,980
Will they really be okay?

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,530
Don't worry. They probably won't cause any damage to the campus property.

41
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm not worried about the campus property.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,240
Senior Brother Xiao Nai,

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,390
why do you have time to see us take graduation photos?

44
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,220
Weren't you in an interview?

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,240
You are very aware of my activities.

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,330
You even knew I had an interview.

47
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,950
I watched for about seven, eight or nine minutes.

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,140
In total, it's 26 minutes. So, you saw the key point, right?

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,140
When did I agree to be your fiancée?

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
What do you think?

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,720
Hello, are you Senior Brother Xiao Nai?

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,790
I'm your fan and a loyal player of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

53
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,420
May I have your autograph?

54
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,950
My autograph probably is not that significant but thank you for supporting our game.

55
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,500
Yes, I will continue to support it.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,900
Then... we won't interrupt your conversation.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,910
Senior, bye-bye.

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,600
Let's go,  fiancé. Take my luggage to Xiao Ling's house.

59
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,350
Weiwei, when did I agree to be your fiancé?

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,900
We have known each other for such a long time.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,360
It's probably okay to get your luggage.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,590
Let's go.

63
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,920
The four of us are still living together even after graduation.

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,610
We just change the dorm to Xiao Ling's house.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,900
It feels much like a graduation.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,960
Moreover, the workplace is so near.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,970
Da Zhong doesn't have any objections to you girls staying at Xiao Ling's home?

68
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,070
Why would he object?

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,200
Get in the car.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,750
 Da Zhong doesn't have any objections but I do. 

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,290
 Huh? 

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,170
My blanket and pillows

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,340
have been moved to Xiao Ling's place.

74
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,790
Use mine.

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,090
But you only have one pillow.

76
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,960
It's sufficient.

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,310
You will get back problems if you sleep too often on the sofa.

78
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,340
Who says I'm sleeping on the sofa?

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,900
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,080
You said that...
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

83
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,830
I know. I wouldn't.
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

84
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,310
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

85
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,730
 ♫  Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

86
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,470
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

87
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,300
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

88
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,700
When will you let me graduate? 
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫  

89
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,780
Graduate in what?
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

90
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,180
Haven't you asked me to study in the department of self-control for two years?
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

91
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,410
Department of self-control?
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

92
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,280
Yes, self-control.
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,050
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

94
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,550
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

95
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,100
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

96
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,380
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

97
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,010
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

98
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,950
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,700
Keep calm. Don't move.

100
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,090
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

101
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,650
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

102
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,080
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,860
Two days after graduation, let's go to Wuhan.
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

104
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,290
Two days after graduation, let's go to Wuhan.
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

105
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,920
Okay.
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

106
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,570
We will drive there.
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

107
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,720
Drive? Why?
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

108
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,730
Wuhan is so far away.
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

109
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,630
Moreover, I won't be going back to Wuhan to work.
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

110
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,260
Moreover, I won't be going back to Wuhan to work.
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

111
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,300
Also,
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

112
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,830
I don't have any luggage.
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

113
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,090
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,320
You grew up there.
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,750
Hence, you need to move your stuff here.
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

116
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,900
It's more convenient to drive.
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

117
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,250
So, you are driving there
 ♫ You are so important to me.  Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me♫ 

118
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,040
not to move stuff there,
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,650
but to move things back here?
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
That's right.
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

121
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,620
Weiwei,

122
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,990
I am determined to not return you to your parents.
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

123
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,340
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,850
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:23,750
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

126
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,810
Dear, they will be here soon.

127
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,760
Go and welcome them at the entrance.

128
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,220
What for? Isn't Weiwei bringing him here? They won't get lost.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,830
It's the first time for our son-in-law's visit.

130
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,020
What's with the attitude?

131
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,200
"Son-in-law" already?

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,770
Have I given my consent?

133
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,200
If I haven't, he's not my son-in-law.

134
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,650
I really don't understand that girl, Weiwei.

135
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,410
She just graduated and is already telling us she is getting married.

136
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,250
With her looks and qualifications, she can find anyone she wants.

137
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,150
Why is she in such a hurry to get married?

138
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,230
I'm so angry.

139
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,930
Hey, let me tell you.

140
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,970
Regarding our future son-in-law,

141
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,380
I have come up with a complete set of questions to interrogate him.

142
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,190
If he fails any one of them, they can't get married.

143
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,900
Hey, don't meddle with this and ruin my plan later.

144
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,260
You should just watch your ball game.

145
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,230
I'm not going to help you with your ridiculous plan.

146
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,640
I have already seen his photo.

147
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,700
- I'm very satisfied with him. 
- Photo?

148
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,800
You'd better not scare him away,

149
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,060
or you will live alone for the rest of your life.

150
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,000
If you are not going out to welcome them, I will.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,550
Hey! Hey!

152
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,470
What's the use of a handsome face when you check out your son-in-law?

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Can good looks feed a family?

154
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,430
You have long hair but are short on wisdom.

155
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,250
She has been like this since she was young.

156
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,100
I don't believe

157
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,610
he's better looking than me.

158
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,420
 Left turn. It's the one just ahead. 

159
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,210
My mom is here.

160
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,370
Aunt.

161
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,190
- Mom! 
- My darling daughter!

162
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,750
- Did you miss me? 
- Yes.

163
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,430
Was the journey, okay? Are you tired?

164
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,230
- I wasn't the one who was driving, anyway. 
- What are you saying?

165
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,500
Introduce him to your mother.

166
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,290
Mom, let me do the introduction. This is Xiao Nai.

167
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,760
Xiao Nai, this is my mother, Mrs. Chen Fang.

168
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,180
Hello, Aunt.

169
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,760
Hello.

170
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,270
Where's Dad?

171
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,550
He's at home. You must be tired from driving. Let's go.

172
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,930
Let's go home for dinner.

173
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,540
All right. Let me park the car.

174
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,160
It's enough for you to visit.  No need to bring gifts.

175
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,810
This is what I should do.

176
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,260
Let's go home.

177
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,850
Let's go.

178
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,050
- Are they heavy? Let me help you. 
- I'm okay.

179
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,910
Strength, endurance, IQ, EQ.

180
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,220
Come in.  Come in.

181
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,660
- Make yourself at home. Don't feel constrained.
- No need to take your shoes off.

182
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,710
 Dear, they are here. 

183
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,620
Dad! Dad!

184
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,310
Let me do the introduction. This is Xiao Nai.

185
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,490
Xiao Nai, this is my father.

186
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,340
Hello, Uncle.

187
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,490
Hello.

188
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,150
Dad, Xiao Nai has brought some good tea for you.

189
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,650
How can their tea be better than ours?

190
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,830
Fine. Since he has brought it, leave it over there.

191
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,190
He has brought lots of stuff. Also for Mom,

192
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,670
he bought caterpillar fungi and bird's nest.
 (Note:  these are well-known natural nutritional supplements according to Chinese medicine) 

193
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,100
Thank you.

194
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,060
You've bought such expensive gifts.

195
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,810
I don't even know how to use them.

196
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,120
I will write down the recipes for Aunt later.

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,680
All right, no rush. Let's eat first.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,350
Wash your hands and let's eat.

199
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,850
The bathroom is over there. Let's go.

200
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,420
Dear, how can you behave like this?

201
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,210
Look at you. Can you show some spine?

202
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,470
Have you never seen these things before?

203
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,860
I'm going to get the food.

204
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,140
Go now.

205
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,290
Here. It's clean.

206
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,800
His height is okay.

207
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,750
The crayfish is here.

208
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,620
That's right. It's the season for crayfish now.

209
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,250
Xiao Nai, the crayfish in Wuhan are prepared differently from other places.

210
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,120
Steaming can best keep its original flavor.

211
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,060
Try some now.

212
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,070
Dad, you should eat, too.

213
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,200
I'll give you a large crayfish. Eat now.

214
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,190
Let me tell you. The sauce made by my father

215
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,310
is particularly tasty.

216
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,340
It's so-so.

217
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,570
Xiao Nai, here, eat more.

218
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,960
Although I don't cook as well as Weiwei's father,

219
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,540
however, what I made is also authentic home-cooking in Wuhan.

220
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,790
Thank you, Auntie. It's very tasty.

221
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,740
Xiao Xiao, I heard from Weiwei that you are in gaming.

222
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,550
That's right.

223
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,400
Your job doesn't sound that reliable.

224
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,930
How is it not reliable?

225
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,660
Am I not in the same business as well?

226
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,360
It's different for you.

227
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,510
Eat your crayfish. I'm asking him.

228
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,050
In addition, since you got this job,

229
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,910
your future partner

230
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,300
should have relatively a more stable job. Right?

231
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,820
Games were the products our company first developed.

232
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,950
For the past two years, we have also been involved in other areas of software.

233
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,740
Isn't that even worse?

234
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,520
Shouldn't one keep his focus for his career?

235
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,890
Dabbling in different areas,

236
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,690
it doesn't seem very focused.

237
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,030
Dear, you even changed your job.

238
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,890
Why don't you say you are not focused either?

239
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,150
Me? How was  I not focused?

240
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,330
Is my job change same as his situation?

241
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,860
How could it be different? You have double standards.

242
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,510
You are just looking for a bone to pick with him.

243
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,240
Can't we talk properly?

244
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,680
How am I not talking properly?

245
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,350
You–

246
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,500
Uncle and Auntie have a really good relationship.

247
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,350
Congratulations on being able to see that in a minute.

248
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,680
Come. Let's eat.

249
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,260
You just eat and talk less.

250
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,750
Let's eat.

251
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,760
Let's eat now.

252
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,060
Thanks.

253
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,660
Xiao Nai.

254
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,860
I am really sorry.

255
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,010
I don't know what's wrong with Weiwei's father today. He's unusually difficult.

256
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,450
Originally, I planned to have you sleep with him. This...

257
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,780
I understand. Thank you, Auntie.

258
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,530
All right.  Rest early. Driving was hard on you.

259
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,640
Good job. Good night.

260
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,120
   

261
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,120
   

262
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,110
Young man, can you make it?

263
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,300
If you can, hurry up.

264
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,710
 Weiwei! Weiwei! 

265
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,580
Coming!

266
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,450
What's going on?

267
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,610
Your aunt just happened to deliver rice.

268
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,210
Did someone also happen to deliver drinks?

269
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,710
You're absolutely right.

270
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,130
It's so hot.

271
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,720
 Dear! 

272
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,410
Are you really accommodating my father?

273
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,470
Let's have sons in the future.

274
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,760
Where did that line of thought come from?

275
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,860
You haven't settled my father yet.

276
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,830
When Uncle made me run five kilometers just now,

277
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,030
I'd started to think.

278
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,770
If we have a daughter, I fear that, compared to Uncle,

279
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,440
I would think of even tougher ways to test the person trying to marry my daughter.

280
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,440
I have more or less thought about how to scare them.

281
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,970
However, if this is the case, I fear our daughter wouldn't be able to get married.

282
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,460
Let's have a son instead.

283
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,740
I can teach him how to handle someone's daughter.

284
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,130
I'm someone else's daughter, right?

285
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,310
Darn it!  I was discovered by my wife through my carelessness.

286
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,110
I'm not your wife yet. I'm going to see my father.

287
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,350
What is this?

288
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,900
Comrade Old Dad,

289
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,560
this is not a good idea.

290
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,150
What?

291
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,420
A sugar-coated bullet?

292
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,960
It's useless.

293
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,060
Let me tell you.  You are head-over-heels because of your relationship.

294
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,690
As for your mother, she is agreeable to everything because he is good-looking.

295
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,540
Someone in our family needs to stay clear headed.

296
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,520
That's me.

297
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,020
Yes, Dad.

298
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,610
I swear, this isn't a sugar-coated bullet.

299
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,150
It's an ordinary bullet.

300
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,920
But Dad, don't you think that your standards...

301
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
are rather strange?

302
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,470
What's so strange?

303
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,400
When one recruits students, they need to be well-rounded in all aspects of their growth.

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,080
Isn't that so?

305
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,110
I'm... I'm recruiting a son-in-law now.

306
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,290
Shouldn't the standards be higher?

307
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,800
However, Dad, you need to think about this.

308
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,200
If Xiao Nai's parents test me in this manner as well,

309
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,570
- would you be unhappy? 
- Of course...

310
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,440
That won't do!

311
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,960
This kid... I'm being serious.

312
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:59,020
Weiwei, I'm not trying to stop you.

313
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,380
After all, marriage is the most important

314
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,910
event of one's life.

315
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,250
I merely hope that you can give yourself more time to consider

316
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,610
what you want. Don't be so hasty

317
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,900
to make any decisions.

318
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,720
Xiao Nai...

319
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,860
has good qualities and is good at everything.

320
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,550
I can say that

321
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,940
he's more perfect than me during my time.

322
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,980
He's too perfect,

323
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,210
and that worries me.

324
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,210
What kind of logic is this?

325
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,770
Furthermore, he's not good at everything.

326
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,570
He can't cook.

327
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,950
He can't even cook?

328
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Okay, let me tell you.

329
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,690
Because of this, all his good points before have been wiped out.

330
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,880
He's no good.

331
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,020
Dad, why are you still like this?

332
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,410
If you marry him, you will need to buy the groceries and cook for him every day.

333
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,640
This won't do.

334
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,950
I missed the important part out of all my checks.

335
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,840
He can't cook. He definitely won't do.

336
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,300
I think I made the matter worse. You should go instead.

337
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,340
I'm going to have a chit-chat with Uncle.

338
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,320
Mom, do you think Dad will give Xiao Nai a hard time?

339
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,790
Everything's fine. They have only been there for ten minutes.

340
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,940
Okay, it's agreed then.

341
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,320
Weiwei, if you want to get married,

342
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,450
do it soon. As soon as possible.

343
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,050
Foolish child. Why are you still sitting there?

344
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,000
Go and talk to each other.

345
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's go.

346
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,810
What's going on?

347
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,570
What did you say to my father? In such a short time,

348
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,560
my father wants to marry me off immediately.

349
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,580
I talked to him about your childhood.

350
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,510
That's it?

351
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,480
Uncle seems to like children very much.

352
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,730
I mentioned the government's reformed policy which

353
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,420
allows having two children.

354
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,040
If they look like you,

355
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,360
they should be very adorable.

356
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,200
What does this have to do with us getting married?

357
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,870
Your father probably thinks it's not bad to have two grandchildren early.

358
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,420
These youngsters...

359
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,520
These youngsters

360
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
should get married as soon as possible!

361
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,830
 Get married early and have children! 

362
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,450
 - She's young and will recover fast. 
- You win.

363
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,850
I'm going to be a grandfather soon!

364
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,010
Do you mean I'm going to be a grandmother?

365
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,800
That's right. Someone is going to be a grandmother!

366
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,050
 Weiwei, come in for a while. 

367
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,750
Dad, I've taken care of it.

368
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,130
You can bring a betrothal gift now.

369
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,990
Are Uncle and Aunt arriving tomorrow?

370
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,000
That soon?

371
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,970
Miss Bei, you don't sound too happy.

372
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,440
Miss Bei thinks that life is very mysterious,

373
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm not ready at all.

374
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,070
In reality, my parents wanted me to go to Wuhan University.

375
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,040
Then I happened to think that I hadn't been to other cities yet.

376
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,110
I decided to come to Tsinghua University instead.

377
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,710
If else,

378
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,510
I probably wouldn't have met you.

379
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,340
What are you thinking about?

380
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,980
The theory of a parallel universe.

381
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,060
Why did your mind go there?

382
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,880
I was thinking.

383
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,540
If parallel universes really exist,

384
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,120
and in that universe, Bei Weiwei went to Wuhan University,

385
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,310
what could happen if Xiao Nai never got married?

386
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,200
I'd probably feel a lot of sympathy for him.

387
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,780
Then... will he not find someone else?

388
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,370
He's definitely very picky.

389
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,120
I'm guessing,

390
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,200
that Bei Weiwei is also very picky.

391
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,720
Moreover, life is so long,

392
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,970
they will meet one day.

393
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,680
Perhaps, after both of them are past their sixties,

394
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,820
they would meet each other as an old man and an old lady,

395
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,670
leading to an episode of romance at dusk.

396
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,620
Romance at dusk?

397
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,050
Since both are old and single,

398
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,530
they can make do by getting together.

399
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,210
Weiwei,

400
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,010
let's move up the wedding date.

401
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,020
Why?

402
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,350
Making up the time for the old lady and old man,

403
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,290
and make up for quality time.

404
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,180
  ♫ I really want to be able to ♫ 

405
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,350
  ♫  Grow old like this ♫ 

406
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,110
  ♫  It’d be best if it started from the next second ♫ 

407
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,710
  ♫  It’d be best if it started from the next second ♫ 

408
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,810
Cheers!

409
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,640
- Come on. Let's eat.
- You cooked a lot of food.

410
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,250
- Don't be shy.
- Yes, that's right.

411
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,410
Here, here.

412
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,230
Look.

413
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,350
- Have more.
- Have some more.

414
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,630
Wow!

415
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,080
It's so comfortable!

416
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,090
I really love this style!

417
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,160
Simplistic design.

418
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,570
When I get married, can you get your Master to help me design mine?

419
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,310
Me too! I like the style of your house, too.

420
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,330
I helped with the design, too. You can also ask me.

421
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,980
What you design are all awful.

422
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,010
You are all so shallow and only care about looks.  This is clearly the work Master and I created together,

423
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,680
but you insist on giving him all the credit.

424
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,060
Weiwei, take out your wedding gown.

425
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,290
We are here especially to see your wedding gown.

426
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,370
That's right.

427
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,440
Go to the bedroom if you want to see it. It's too heavy for me to carry.

428
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
- Too heavy?
- Too heavy?
- Too heavy?

429
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,850
Where's the bedroom?

430
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,630
A phoenix coronet?

431
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,500
This phoenix coronet is so beautiful.

432
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,680
I thought it would be the crown-type.  I don't like those.

433
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,930
That's also nice but just too heavy.

434
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,970
I wonder how much this costs.

435
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,950
I don't know. You'd have to ask Master. I think, something about more than a hundred thousand.

436
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,320
Oh my God! You're basically wearing a bathroom on your head.

437
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,240
Can't you say something nice?

438
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,500
Master said this won't lose its value. Thus, it's not considered as an expense.

439
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,080
That's right. How could Master's wedding be held so casually and disorganized?

440
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,620
Even if Weiwei really wears a bathroom on her head, it's not a big deal.

441
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,720
Even if it doesn't lose its value, it can't lay eggs, too. Is it worth it?

442
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,570
It's okay as long as Weiwei can lay eggs.

443
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,300
I do it through vivipation.  Do you understand vivipation?

444
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,410
I like this.

445
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,690
It's so pretty.

446
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,880
I don't understand. Why must we follow the Western tradition of wearing a white bridal gown,

447
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,220
when our traditional phoenix crown and ceremonial robe look wonderful?

448
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,480
That's right. When I was young, I envied those clothes in martial arts films.

449
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,150
I tied my bed sheet to my neck and pretended wearing the traditional outfit.

450
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,630
Weiwei, try it on and show us what it looks like.

451
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,160
I don't know how to wear this.

452
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,060
- Do you know how? Do you? 
- I don't.

453
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,530
Weiwei is getting married soon.

454
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,110
It's not that fast. I have already received the certificate.

455
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,140
   

456
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,270
Wow!

457
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,140
Look at this.

458
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,200
This is the best-looking marriage certificate in history.

459
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,030
I say, young girl.  Why are you in such a hurry?

460
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,830
- Are you pregnant? 
- Show me.

461
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,310
I'm afraid you may leave the country with a certain diplomat.

462
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,630
What if I can't receive my red envelop?
 (Note:  Red envelop is the traditional method for guests to send gift money at the wedding) 

463
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,670
Don't mention that jerk, Cao Guang!

464
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,280
I must be crazy to have applied to work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

465
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,620
I didn't mention Cao Guang, I just said a certain diplomat...

466
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,170
I'm going to bite you to death.

467
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,490
Enough. Stop fooling around.

468
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,790
As for you!

469
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,900
You don't need to walk us down. We can just take a taxi home.

470
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,120
I didn't plan to see you off.

471
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,360
- Aren't you going overboard?
-  So you came to visit. 

472
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,890
- Senior Brother. 
- Senior Brother.

473
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,810
We are leaving. We won't be disturbing you anymore.

474
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,850
Senior Brother, you will hold your wedding soon.

475
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,910
It's not a good idea to live together now.

476
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,030
Let Weiwei go to Xiao Ling's home and stay with us today.

477
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,300
Do I still need someone's approval to stay somewhere?

478
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,620
I'm afraid it's not possible today.

479
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,060
Didn't you say that you don't need any approval?

480
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,820
It's late. I will drive you home.

481
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,310
Okay, stop pretending. I will loan you Master so that you can have a look longer.

482
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,550
Your imagination got ahead of you. We won't be shy.

483
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,290
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

484
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,600
Why did you come back so soon?  The houses of those three–

485
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,670
Has the bridal gown been delivered?

486
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,730
It was delivered this afternoon.

487
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,490
I just took a bath.

488
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,670
I saw that the dress was a bit dirty and wanted to wash them.

489
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,950
But I don't know how to wear it.

490
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,190
I know how. I will help you.

491
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,470
This is the first piece.

 ♫ You are so important to me ♫

 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

539
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,550
 Weiwei, I'm taking you to a place. 

540
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,430
These computers will be moved out tomorrow.

541
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,470
Are they not doing business anymore?

542
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,380
Later, Zhi Yi Technology will be moving here.

543
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,830
I've already bought the deed of this place.

544
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,380
This is great.

545
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,060
It's best to have our own place.

546
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,780
The conference room will be right there.

547
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,940
This is the office area. There will be a pantry over there.

548
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,270
Back here... will become an open-air rec area.

549
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,800
When I first met you, you were sitting there.

550
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,740
So it was love at first sight for you, right?

551
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,460
I just realized you are a pervert.

552
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,110
Do you have an objection?

553
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,460
I don't but I think it's not specific enough.

554
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,220
At the very least, I'm a truly lecherous pervert.

555
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,330
So shameless!  Do you take pride in this?

556
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,910
As a pervert with a unique and specific taste,

557
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,830
not feeling the impulse is

558
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,270
even more shameful.

559
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,850
I'm going to check the back area.

560
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:08,890
 ♫ Coincidentally humming the same tune ♫ 

561
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:14,120
 ♫ I like watching you smile foolishly like this ♫ 

562
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,180
 ♫ I really want to be able to ♫ 

563
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,190
 ♫ Grow old like this ♫ 

564
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,500
 ♫ It’d be best if it started from the next second ♫ 

565
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,790
This can be Master's office.

566
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,890
Isn't that so, Master?

567
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,390
Hi. What are you doing?

568
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,860
I was thinking about your question just now.

569
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,240
Did I ask a question just now?

570
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:27,150
I was thinking if I had known about today,

571
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,550
I would have fallen in love with you at first sight.

572
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,820


573
