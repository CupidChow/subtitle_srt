 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,600
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,700
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,700
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,000
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,200
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,500
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,200
   

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,600
     

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Recently, we had reviewed many classic documentaries from around the world.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,300
Next, we'll put the knowledge to work,

28
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,600
by making a short documentary.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,700
The theme is our graduation season.

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm looking for a student

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,000
to volunteer to shoot this documentary.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Why did everyone lower their head as soon as I mentioned the word "volunteer"?

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Cao Guang! Move over.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Then move and let me in.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,200
  Why do I find this scene so familiar? 

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
-  We're making a documentary.... 
 - Hey...

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,900
Don't pretend you can't hear me!

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,400
Do you still want help with Weiwei?

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
Shut up!

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
S-Shut up? Why are you so mean?

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
You were the one who asked me for help, and now you want me to shut up.

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,800
You know you have no chance, so embarrassment has turned into anger.  How can you have so little class?

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
Why are you so–

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
What?

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,500
You over there. Stand up.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
He asked you to stand up!

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,100
It's you!

48
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,810
Both of you stand up!

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Even though this is an elective class,

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,600
as long as we are in a classroom, the leading man is the professor who passes down the knowledge.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
You have to work with the leading actor,

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,600
while you play your role well. Right?

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
You two seem to be fighting to be in the spotlight as the leading actors.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,200
Fine then. I'll let you two be the

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
leading actors in this class.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Professor, it's a misunderstanding.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
I only wanted to find a seat, and listen quietly to the lecture.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,400
You arrived twenty minutes late after the movie started.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Don't you think it's a shame?

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Aside from missing the beginning,

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,200
you distracted those who were already watching.

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
Attending class is the same as watching a film.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
After missing the beginning, you can't follow the plot later.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Don't be late again.

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
I won't, Professor.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Good then.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,600
You two are now in charge of filming the documentary

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,000
for the graduation gala.

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,900
   

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
   

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,300
   

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,300
   

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
We've got a lot of footage. Can we wrap it up?

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
No, we haven't done the interviews yet.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,300
If we don't go now, the cafeteria will run out of food.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
All you do is eat.

77
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:54,030


78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,500
That's not fair! There is no justice at all!

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,800
You said that you were afraid of messing up, so you only want brainless chores.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,700
There were many small tripods in the equipment room.

81
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,400
Why must you borrow this one?  So big and heavy.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Plus, is your dingy camera good enough for this big tripod?

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Professionally speaking, that's the most stable one.  Do you understand?

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
I won't do it.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,500
Rebelling to start the revolution?  You have guts.

86
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Then you do the shooting.

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm hungry. I can't carry it.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Girl, it's all your fault that I have to make this graduation documentary.

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Now I have this lousy teammate. Enough's enough!

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
What did you say?

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Nothing. It's crowded there. Let's do the interviews.

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Production Assistant, please hurry. Go over there to set up the tripod.

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Done.  Go and stand there. I'll adjust the focus.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,400
I'm a production assistant.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Not a model.  Not going there.

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Will you hurry up? The sun will set soon.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,100
We're not eating until we're done here.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Actually, I'm camera shy. Okay?

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Is that so? That makes sense.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,000
For the way you look, you should be camera shy.

101
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Enough. If you're camera shy,

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
turn your back to the camera.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,300
Focus on the bigger picture.

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,200
 Are you done or not?  So slow. 

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Done.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
What do you want to borrow?

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,400
A few programming books to study over the summer break.

108
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,400
 The summer recess will be here soon.  

109
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,800
 It's two months long. 

110
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,400
I picked these for you.

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,800
Will they be too difficult? Don't pick them based on your level.

112
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
Don't worry. I can tutor you over the internet.

113
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,700
My only regret in the past four years of college

114
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,000
is that I never dated.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If I could really do it over again,

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,400
I'd go to teaching college, where there are more girls.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
Thanks for doing the interview.

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
You are welcome.

119
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Zhao Erxi, get the tripod. Let's go!

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Weiwei, come here!

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Zhao Erxi, let's go!

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Wait a second. Let's interview them.

123
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Department beauty queen and school heartthrob, a couple made in Heaven.

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
If they appear in our video,

125
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,100
it'll be a huge hit at the graduation gala.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
Fortune favors me!

127
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't want to film the likes of them!

128
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't let your personal feelings affect the work.

129
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Who told me to focus on the bigger picture?

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Weiwei, can I interview you and Master?

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,400
You guys can talk about anything,

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,600
like graduation, work, ideals, anything you want.

133
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Of course, it's even better, if you talk about your romance.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Erxi, you know I'm not good at those things.

135
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,700
Weiwei, I depend on you to pass my elective class.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,500
Sure!

137
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,510
Production Assistant, set up the camera!

138
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Cao Guang, where is the record button?

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
I don't know.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Excuse me, just hold on for a second. Let me figure it out.

141
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
Weiwei, go ahead.

142
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Wait. We should let the Master speak.

143
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
You are his girlfriend.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Maybe you can share your feelings about your boyfriend leaving school.

145
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,400
Erxi, he will still be nearby even after graduation.

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
That's good.

147
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Displaying your affection is one way to commemorate graduation.

148
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm not done yet!

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
Weiwei, Master, see you later.

150
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,300
Cao Guang, wait up!

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
Ever since you were young?

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,100
No, only received a flyer once.

153
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,880
Waiter, give me an order of salt and pepper spare ribs,

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,430
an order of fish with pickled mustard greens, two bowls of rice... Oh!

155
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,060
I'll also have a Kung Pao chicken.

156
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,740
Couldn't you eat some vegetables?

157
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,360
You made me carry such heavy equipment for a whole day,

158
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,830
and you want me to eat less? Not happening.

159
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,250
Waiter, give me an order of beef and egg white soup. That's all. Thank you.

160
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,850
So boring.

161
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,750
I'm eating it. Also, we'll go dutch.

162
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,900
Nonsense! Would I be eating off you instead?

163
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,140
Waiter, add two bottles of wine!

164
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,920
Here. It's my treat.

165
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,210
Let's talk about it later.

166
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,940
 Shouldn't you talk to Master? 

167
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,810
It's Weiwei's part!  Let me see.

168
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,260
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm deleting this part. It was not well filmed.

169
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
If we keep it, we're wasting storage space. We can't use it later.

170
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,660
No way. Even if you don't use it, you can't delete it.

171
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,900
I filmed it so that I could keep it as a souvenir.

172
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,050
Not fighting anymore?

173
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,790
You can't only blame me for it. Why did you try to delete Weiwei's video?

174
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,430
Wow, it all got inside.

175
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,130
No way... What if it's broken, what do we do?

176
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,670
This camcorder is over  ¥10,000.
 (Note: Approx. $1,500 USD) 

177
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,010
You pay for it.

178
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,160
I don't have money. Why are you asking me to pay?

179
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,310
Who told you to fight over it?

180
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,560
But you were the one who ordered this beef and egg white soup. You have to also take responsibility.

181
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,310
We each pay half of it. Fair enough now?

182
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,680
But I still don't have money...

183
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,420
But I am...

184
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,890
It's only wet.

185
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,120
- After we put it up on the balcony in the sun tomorrow, it might turn out to be all fine. 
 - Don't open it!

186
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Yeah! I fixed the DV! 
 (DV:  Digital Video camcorder) 

187
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,270
What happened?

188
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,780
What happened, huh? To put it in simple terms, it's fried.

189
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,770
Zhao Erxi, you're doomed.

190
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:39,370


191
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,270
Yay, finally, our exam is over.  Time to relax!

192
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,600
In September when school opens, we'll have another batch of new hunks.

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Erxi, I've even set the stage for you. Why don't you coordinate with me a little?

194
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,920
- I don't want to talk.
- What's wrong with you?

195
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,460
I'm wondering how to pay back the money I owe.

196
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,700
Don't mind her. She's on her nutty streak again.

197
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,500
Dear students, let's have a quick class meeting.

198
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,240
Let's talk regarding internships during the summer recess.

199
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,550
That's right! During the summer recess, I can intern at Zhen Yi Technologies.

200
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,860
Erxi, were you accepted to intern at Zhen Yi? You're really amazing.

201
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,120
I heard interns there earn ¥100 a day.
 (Note: Approx. $15 USD - a pretty high wage for interns) 

202
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,030
¥100 a day?

203
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,470
Last time, I received notice that beginning August 1st, I'll intern there for a month.

204
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,100
That's 30 days. So it's ¥3000! 
 (Note: Approx ¥450 USD) 

205
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,630
Weiwei! I'm going to be so rich!

206
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,960
All right, all right, all right! Be quiet! Do you still want to listen to me?

207
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,590
Can I borrow your phone to send a message to Master?

208
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,800
Why didn't your Master buy you a phone?

209
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,630
As a boyfriend, he's too inattentive. He can't even think of such a thing.

210
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,410
Once you have a phone, you two can get on even better terms.

211
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,120
Master isn't the kind of person to do something like that after knowing you for a couple of days.

212
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,220
That would be awkward.

213
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,600
When did you come?

214
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,250
Just got here.

215
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,450
We had a meeting after our exam

216
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,330
regarding internships during the summer recess.

217
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,540
I told you about it with Xiao Ling's phone.

218
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,610
Let's go! They should be waiting for us.

219
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,680
Today, we're having a group dinner. Have you forgotten?

220
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,210
Then, is it still your treat?

221
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,900
Naturally.

222
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,470
 Stroll around and have a look! Why do they say Senior's blankets are good? 

223
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,730
 That's because, using this blanket, this Senior has never failed a class. 

224
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,250
 How did this happen? Failing classes became hard. 

225
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,830
Junior, take a look at your senior's blanket.

226
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,320
Why is this senior's blanket good? Because ever since this senior started using this blanket,

227
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,190
I've never failed a class. That's because it'll become hard to fail classes.

228
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,770
Recently, using senior's blankets has become very popular.

229
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,210
Mr. Beauty Senior, don't learn from other people's bad examples.

230
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,280
I disguised myself so well. How did you see through it?

231
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,420
Senior, your personality is so exceptional.

232
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,210
It can't be covered up by merely a hat and a face mask.

233
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,930
What you said is correct.

234
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,790
This senior is just too naive.

235
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,530
How rare! I have an encounter with someone who understands like you.

236
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,670
This blanket... it's free.

237
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,370
I'll gift it to you.

238
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,800
Hey, hey... Jealous?

239
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,640
You're thinking too much.

240
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,490
Why are you pretending? Then why did you block me?

241
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,950
You're suspected of false advertising.

242
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,310
First year. Marxist Theory. You failed it twice.

243
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,900
No– Why are you remembering these dark events?

244
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,950
Don't listen to his nonsense.

245
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,520
I understand. We'll quickly go over there.

246
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Mm.

247
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,370
Okay, Houzi is waiting for us at Tianxiangju.

248
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,420
Wait, wait.

249
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,020
What's the fun in going to Tianxiangju all the time?

250
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,670
In a bit, call Houzi and the others. Today,

251
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,850
I'll... take you to an

252
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,440
extremely high-class place.

253
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,050
Is this the place?

254
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,320
That's right. What kind of shop is this?

255
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,900
A mountain need not be high if an immortal lives there. Water need not be deep if occupied by a dragon.

256
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,450
A humble abode...

257
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,970
Forget it. Even if I say it, you guys wouldn't understand. What I mean is that the food here is delicious.

258
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,070
It's here.

259
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,060
My friend made it. It's the most delicious fish with pickled vegetables in the world.

260
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,440
Try it. If it's good, tell other people to come and eat.

261
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,970
My friends at the dorm and family members. Hey,

262
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,460
are you working here for the entire summer recess?

263
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,970
- Mm. 
- Mm.

264
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,310
Okay, I'll tell them to come and eat here often

265
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,450
to show support for you.

266
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,760
No need.

267
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,220
Huh?

268
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,390
I'm not the boss. I'll be very tired.

269
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,750
That's right...

270
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Next time, it would be fine for you to come alone.

271
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,670
Okay. I won't tell the common folks.

272
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,340
- It really isn't bad. 
- For once, Brother Mei's taste is reliable.

273
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,690
- Not bad, not bad.
- Wow,

274
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,860
are you guys pigs? Here– Even a little–

275
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,870
I saved you a little.

276
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,920
You see. Junior Weiwei is the nice one after all.

277
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,270
In an instant, I am feeling maternal love.

278
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,690
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

279
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,420
Third Brother has a girlfriend, so now he's got a sense of humanity.

280
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,790
Now he even knows to care about me.

281
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,170
Paternal love.

282
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,970
This place really isn't bad. It's delicious and cheap.

283
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,590
In the future, we have to come back often.

284
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,050
However, there's a problem. Third Brother got lucky today.

285
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,050
Originally, we wanted to empty his wallet.

286
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,300
It tastes good, and we'll come back often.

287
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,290
Are you telling them to empty my wallet a few more times?

288
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,750
I spoke too quickly. I wanted to say that, since it's so tasty, we need to come back often.

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,190
I'll thank you on behalf of the boss. Don't come too often. It will be so tiring for the chef!

290
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,890
That won't do. We keep our words.

291
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,010
To keep our words, let's take a drink!

292
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,840
Here, let's raise our glasses.

293
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,330
Come, come. Raise our glasses.

294
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,690
- Come, Junior Sister. 
- Let's raise our glasses together.

295
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,000
Cheers!

296
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,720
Here, Third Brother.

297
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,490
Here, help me add a bit.

298
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,950
- Hold this!
- Come, Brother Hou.

299
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,800
- Let's clink our glasses. 
- Come. Let's drink one.

300
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,920
Junior Weiwei, let me tell you,

301
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,760
for our Third Brother, it's his first time in a relationship.

302
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,370
He doesn't have any experience. You definitely have to lead him well.

303
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,880
Furthermore, for us in the Computer Science Department to find a good wife,

304
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,340
it's too difficult.

305
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,140
 Previously, your Third Brother already held my hand. 

306
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,060
 It didn't feel like the first time he'd been in a relationship. 

307
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,290
Third Sister-in-Law, what I am telling you now

308
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,190
is all true. True!

309
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,710
There really was someone who confessed to Third Brother through the phone.

310
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,220
She also said something about a dance party.

311
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,380
Who doesn't know what she's thinking?

312
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,150
Her name is something like Meng... something Meng...

313
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,830
Yesterday, she even phoned our Third Brother.

314
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,780
I can't go on. I'm drunk.

315
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,820
 You can't just gossip half way. 

316
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,500
She had something to explain to me.

317
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,300
 Could it be relating to Aixiang Nai'er? 

318
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,720
 Then why would she explain it to Master? 

319
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,030
And afterward?

320
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,900
There wasn't anything afterward.

321
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,000
Third Sister-in-Law, Third Brother is an assassin.

322
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,500
- Too ruthless. One phrase; they're dead.
- That's it.

323
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,840
How could you act this way to a woman?

324
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
For those of us in the Computer Sciences Department, getting a call from a girl

325
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,770
is really too difficult.

326
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,910
Third Brother's always like that.

327
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,980
- You're drunk.
- Are you kidding?

328
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,720
I was just pretending. Don't take it too seriously.

329
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,550
Besides, can this stuff make me drunk?  What a joke!

330
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,210
So... after all this talk,

331
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,800
what did Master... actually say?

332
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,300
Guess. Take a guess

333
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,820
what your Master actually said.

334
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,980
He said... "Who are you?"

335
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,840
 Yes. 

336
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,210
Isn't that the normal response?

337
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,380
Who picks up a stranger's call

338
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,140
and doesn't ask for who you are?

339
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,140
That... um... Ms. C...

340
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,710
- is our School Beauty Queen Meng. 
 - Right.

341
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,110
70-80%, about right.

342
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,770
Hey, Third Brother, that Ai-something Nai'er person, let's directly hack her computer.

343
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,950
Right now, it's the end of the semester.  There has to be a term paper there.

344
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,800
We can hack into her computer directly and ...

345
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,630
- As a person, you have to have class. 
 - What do you mean?

346
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,720
You're normally pretty smart.

347
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,050
Why is your IQ a little low?

348
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,480
- Third Brother is saying you have no class.
- Then we'll just forget about what happened on the forum?

349
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,140
It's not like you've only known Third Brother for a day or two.

350
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,310
What's Third Brother's usual style of handling things?

351
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,350
- How do you not know?
- How does he conduct himself?

352
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,150
He's often... inhuman.

353
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,400
They drank too much.

354
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,920
 Actually I thought that, too. 

355
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,740
Big Brother, why did you order so little food?

356
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,450
Big Brother, today is the first time for our Computer Science Department

357
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,150
to go out with a girl. You have to watch your image. Image, do you understand? Image.

358
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,200
Big Brother, but does Third Sister-in-Law count as a girl?

359
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,370
Third Sister-in-Law's image in the game is formidable.

360
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,540
Everyone all thought that she was a guy.

361
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,740
As a matter of fact, what is a girl?

362
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,110
A girl is a limited resource that we can pursue.

363
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,660
Third Sister-in-Law already has Third Brother.

364
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,690
Now she's in the third category of gender.

365
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,180
Forget about caring about your image!

366
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,600
You have a tiny bit of logic.

367
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,280
We're ordering more. Add on an order of duck blood and beef tripe soup,

368
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,030
an order of Fragrant Spicy Crab, and an order of Numbing Spicy Crayfish.

369
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,140
Also, we'll get an order of fish head with chopped chili peppers.

370
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,270
Remember, it has to be spicy. The spicier, the better.

371
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,720
Don't order spicy food. Third Brother usually doesn't eat spicy food.

372
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,600
He's treating us to a meal. We'll eat, and he can just watch.

373
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,320
Extra spicy, okay?

374
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,360
 Master can't eat spicy food? Impossible. 

375
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,620
 That day we went to eat boiled fish with hot chili sauce, he clearly ate with so much enthusiasm. 

376
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,480
  He didn't even frown.  

377
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,350
You...

378
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,610
Nope.

379
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Third Brother, are you not bored playing by yourself?

380
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Look at Third Sister-in-Law, she sat there drinking for quite a bit of time.

381
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,740
She's been conserving her energy. Let her play in your place.

382
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,930
That works.

383
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,630
I-I don't know how.

384
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,360
This is even my first time in a billiards hall.

385
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,980
I'll teach you.

386
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,070
- Bend down.
- Mm.

387
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,270
Look carefully.

388
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,410
It actually went in! I must have natural talent, right?

389
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,100
Not bad.

390
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,160
Skilled, definitely skilled.

391
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,800
She's got prospects.

392
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,970
Third Brother, when we go out next time,

393
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,130
let's bring Junior Weiwei.

394
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,050
There's no next time.

395
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,540
Why?

396
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,050
I plan to buy a pool table at home.

397
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,530
It's about time.

398
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,650
Weiwei still has a curfew. I'll take her back. You guys continue.

399
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,140
Bye-bye.

400
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,680
Bye-bye.

401
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,800
- How about it? Let's continue playing. 
- Let's go.

402
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:22,980


403
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,550
Go on up. I'll see you tomorrow.

404
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,450
Wait a minute.

405
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,780
You don't eat spicy food. That day when we ate boiled fish with hot chili sauce,

406
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,910
why didn't you tell me?

407
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,300
I remember that all the dishes were spicy that day.

408
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,230
even the boiled fish with hot chili sauce was the spiciest.

409
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,290
It's okay.

410
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,500
I can adjust to the person.

411
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,660
There's nothing wrong with not eating spicy food.

412
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,250
You don't have to accommodate me like this.

413
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,770
You don't need to help me so much.

414
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,540
All those things... like retrieving water,

415
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,360
helping me buy breakfast,

416
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,920
aren't at all suitable for you to do.

417
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,920
Weiwei,

418
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,110
it's my first time interacting with a girl,

419
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,880
I often don't know what to do.

420
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,810
At least for now, whatever someone else can do,

421
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,310
I want to also be able to do.

422
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,800
♫  Rain drips on my jacket  ♫

423
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,560
♫  Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes  ♫

424
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,080
♫  The signal you gave me, a smile  ♫

425
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,710
♫  Came at just the right time  ♫

426
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,100
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

427
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,350
♫  Are like grass blown by the spring wind  ♫

428
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,760
When you get back, log into the game.

429
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,850
I have something for you.

430
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,490
Okay.

431
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,690
Good night.

432
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,780
Good night.

433
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,710
Hurry and go back, okay?

434
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,830
♫  Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me  ♫

435
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,310
♫  No one else can feel your sweetest smile  ♫

436
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,850
♫  I want to be around you every minute and every second  ♫

437
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,530
♫  You are so important to me  ♫

438
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:40,650
♫  You are so important to me  ♫

439
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,740
  I finished it yesterday. 

440
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,910
  I wasn't originally in a rush to give it out,  

441
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,580
  but now, I really want to give it out.  

442
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,070
This is for you.

443
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,960
I said before that I would add to the dowry.

444
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,550
Actually, other than asking Feng Teng Technologies

445
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,520
for five Majestic Beasts before,

446
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,610
I also asked for two types of rare materials:

447
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,500
Tianshan White Jade and Nine Heavens Jade Fire.

448
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,660
Along with some materials I had, I made this.

449
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,230
Your original hairpin was already at the top of its class.

450
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,390
I just wanted to try to make something better.

451
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,090
I never thought that my luck turned out to be this good.

452
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,450
It's my luck.

453
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,870
Then, we'll say we're both lucky.

454
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,830
  What on earth am I saying?  

455
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,930
What does Fa Wei mean?

456
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,910
It means "Hairpin by Weiwei."
 (Note:  Fa Zan means hairpin) 

457
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,300
If you don't like it, you can change it. I don't have any poetic cells.

458
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,050
There's no need. I like it a lot.

459
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,960
To tie hair and be bound to Wei.

460
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,790
That is... I'm going offline first.

461
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm a little tired today and want to rest early.

462
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
You've worked hard, my wife.

463
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,340
 What does "Hair Wei" mean? 

464
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,680
 That is... it means "Hairpin by Weiwei." 

465
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,560
 If you don't like it, you can change it. 

466
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,380
 I don't have any poetic cells. 

467
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,170
 No need to change it. I really like it. 

468
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,740
 Banshan, your recent study of the idiom dictionary wasn't a waste. 

469
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,060
 Just kidding. Come on. 

470
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,620
Hey, Third Brother!

471
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,210
Such a lovely scene of standing before the flowers while under the moon.

472
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,600
Why did you get back earlier than us?

473
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,090
- Why don't we play some Dou Dizhu?
 (Note: A popular card game) 
- Third Brother,

474
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,160
did I hear incorrectly? Dou Dizhu?

475
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,570
It's nothing. I'm in a good mood. I want to express it a little.

476
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,880
Recently, my luck has been particularly good. You guys need to be careful, okay?

477
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
You're not allowed to go back on your words!

478
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,060
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Organize the stuff a little.

479
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,510
Look carefully. Three queens and two threes.

480
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,650
Four twos! One left.
 (Note: First one to play all their cards wins) 

481
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,350
No going back on your words.

482
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,730
- Beautiful!
- Beautiful!

483
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,550
Today Third Brother treated us to a meal,

484
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,550
but you're the one paying the bill.

485
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,250
Who says I'm paying the bill? The night's still long.

486
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,110
- I don't accept this! Let's go again!
- Let's go then!

487
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,920
I don't want to enter society with this crushing burden of debt.

488
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,110
Write it.

489
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,910
Really writing it?

490
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,380
Fine, I'll write it.

491
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,320
"Debt statement: debtor - Yu Banshan

492
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,630
owes Xiao Nai

493
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,490
800 meals. Willing

494
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,210
to pay with my labor during the summer recess, helping to..."

495
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,340
Oh, that's right, I don't have a summer recess.

496
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,660
"Willing to, during July and August,

497
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,310
help Xiao Nai buy his meal every day.

498
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,170
Yu... Ban... shan."

499
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,930
Take it. You're so lazy. It's just buying food.

500
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,070
That's right. In the future, we won't have a summer recess anymore.

501
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,560
Tsinghua University, farewell!

502
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,640
Tsinghua University, farewell!

503
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,550
Tsinghua University, farewell!

504
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,660
- My house is on campus.
- Pff!

505
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,900
Goodbye,

506
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,640
Tsinghua University.

507
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,920
Did you catch a cold?

508
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,240
Or is someone thinking about you, Weiwei?

509
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,360
I have a little bit of a cold.

510
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,700
How is this a cold?

511
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,530
Clearly, someone's thinking about you.

512
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,240
Having a boyfriend whose parents are professors really is nice.

513
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,660
He can even drive his car into the school.

514
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,910
Unlike us, who have to lug such a heavy

515
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,330
suitcase to the school entrance. It's so troublesome.

516
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,820
That's why he's the multi-purpose Master.

517
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,070
Hey, Weiwei, will he be angry that you're leaving school so early?

518
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,400
He shouldn't be.

519
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,460
Why don't you guys go back? See you next term!

520
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,650
- See you next term, okay?
- See you next term, okay?

521
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,120
- Bye-bye. 
- Yup, bye-bye.

522
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,380
- Be careful.
- Bye-bye.

523
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,510
Did you bring medicine?

524
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,450
Are you talking about cold medicine? I didn't bring any.

525
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,560
But there's no problem. It's a minor cold.

526
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,830
Take it.

527
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,810
This is for you.

528
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,720
A new dowry?

529
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,470
It's a cactus that I've been raising all this time. I can't care for it during the summer recess,

530
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,140
- so... please take care of it a bit.
- Oh.

531
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,290
Then when I see it, I'll miss its owner.

532
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,900
I didn't book the ticket so early on purpose.

533
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,270
When the school made the reservation in a group purchase,

534
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,460
I hadn't met you yet.

535
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,910
I'm going to go buy a platform ticket.
 (Note: In China, you need a ticket to see people off or pick people up from train platforms) 

536
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,200
No need. I'll be fine boarding the train myself.

537
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,910
The luggage is heavy. Please sit a while, my wife.

538
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:46,020


539
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,020
