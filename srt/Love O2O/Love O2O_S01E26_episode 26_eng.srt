 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,610
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,550
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,690
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,710
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,400
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,480
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,470
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,220
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,640
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,720
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,760
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,830
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,190
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,010
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,170
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,940
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,210
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,240
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,310
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,390
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,330
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,390
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,310
   

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,050
     

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,440
Third Brother, you have been to many places.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,840
Choose one and let's go with Brother Mei.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,030
Meet in the conference room in five minutes.

29
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,050
Are we having a meeting to decide the venue for seafood?

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,980
Kind of.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,890
Why are we having a meeting?

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,930
If you ask me, we should go to eat Little Turtle's scallops.

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,520
The service may be slow but the food is great.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,090
We can call to reserve and order. The food will be ready when we get there.

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,970
No, no, no. Their service is too slow.

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,210
It will take two to three years to serve the food. Why don't we go to Snail Seafood?

37
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,490
Whoever's picking up the tab can decide. Brother Mei!

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,780
I'm a Libra. You should know that I'm afraid of making decisions.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,430
Furthermore, it's already hard for me to treat you guys, so how can you still want me to make the decision?

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,450
Third Brother, you can make the choice. I'm fine with anything.

41
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,060
Let's talk about something else before we eat.

42
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,420
I just received an email notification from  Feng Teng.

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,260
The date for the demo

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,800
has been moved up to September 1st.

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,810
That's what is called a switch of subject.

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,860
We were talking about seafood.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,110
Why did they bring forward the date?

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,750
Isn't the date already fixed? Why did they change it so suddenly?

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,700
That's right. They are even bringing it forward by more than two weeks.

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,110
I've called Director Wang of Feng Teng. There were two reasons.

51
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,900
First, Director Ho, who was in charge of the original "A Chinese Ghost Story," decided abruptly

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,210
to have surgery in the U.S. on September 10th.

53
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,670
The preparation for the surgery and recuperation will require three months.

54
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,590
Before he leaves, he wants to participate in the decision for the development rights of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

55
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,640
Can you tell him to change the date to September 9th?

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
It's an auspicious date. He can fly to the States for the surgery immediately after that.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,530
What's the second reason?

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,310
The second is that Feng Teng's  highest decision maker, President Feng,

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,580
has been watching this project closely.

60
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,830
He will also be there for the presentation. He has a conference overseas from September 2nd to 9th.

61
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,630
Based on the original plan, there's no problem for him to attend the presentation in mid-September

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,140
but now the two events all happen around the same time;

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,070
therefore, the date has to be moved to September 1st.

64
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,870
Third Brother, at our previous meeting, you said that

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,180
you could only complete your optimization software on September 15th.

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,580
If we include the testing and revisions,

67
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,740
the quickest we can get it done is on September 16th. What should we do now?

68
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,630
Are we going to forgo on our optimization?

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,150
I think it's not much of a problem to forgo.

70
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,110
After all, with the display and playing options of our game,

71
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,040
we will be able to slay everyone else.

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,110
The current issue now is just with the usage of memory.

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,000
Moreover, it's not like we are not capable of doing it. It's just a matter of time.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,210
That's right. The inadequacy of development time is not our fault. We can explain it to them.

75
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,440
The decision maker won't care about the reasons. They will only look at the end product.

76
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,990
So I don't plan on forgoing optimization, but rather I'm going to deal both in parallel.

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,790
At the same time, we will make other adjustments to the extensive memory usage.

78
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,110
Other adjustments?

79
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,790
I just received the email. The timing is of the essence.

80
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,240
I suddenly had an inspiration.

81
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,210
You really have a special way of coming up with new inspirations.

82
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,810
"The Automatic Map Generation Project."

83
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,290
Reading this inspires me.

84
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,230
With the division of labor among our teams, we should be able to complete this in ten days.

85
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,150
Ah Shuang,  time is really tight.  We can only test as we make the modifications.

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,630
You'll be in charge of all the testing issues.

87
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,800
Ah Shuang?

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Okay.

89
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,410
Who is working with K.O.?

90
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,510
K.O. is working with me.  You and I will finish the optimization tool together.

91
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,370
I will be responsible for the weighted visualization reassessment algorithm

92
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,810
and pixel compression.  You optimize the model.

93
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,370
I can do it.

94
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,420
The normal mission has ended. The difficult mission is about to start.

95
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,740
I hope everyone's feeling good.

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,350
Does this mean I'm the only one still thinking about eating seafood?

97
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,800
Didn't you say that we'd talk about seafood at the meeting?

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,650
You are such a liar.

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,310
After everything I said, isn't it the key theme for this?

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,860
Shanghai. A celebration banquet.

101
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,580
 Yeah! 

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Brother Mei, you got away with another meal!

103
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,690
 - Okay, okay.
- Do your best. 

104
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,960
Hey, how did it go? Did you decide where we're going to eat seafood?

105
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,590
What seafood? There's a big problem.

106
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,550
What's wrong? Did a problem crop up with the game?

107
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,340
Feng Teng in Shanghai moved the demo forward more than half a month,

108
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,790
but this isn't the key point. The key point is that your husband,

109
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,750
our classmate Xiao Nai, has gone psycho.

110
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,780
What do you mean by "psycho?"

111
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,300
It means a workaholic.

112
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,400
Go back and help me bring some clothes over.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,850
I want both business and casual clothes. Also, toiletries.

114
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,340
So... you're going to live in the office?

115
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,090
That's right.

116
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,820
As you've wished, I'm going to start living in the office.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,970

135
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,210
Are you cosplaying as a gecko?

136
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,750
I'm sick at heart, Junior Weiwei.

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
What are you sick at heart about?

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,550
Look. Those two won't play with me.

139
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,750
Are they discriminating against my IQ?

140
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,790
No matter how you say it, I was the top student in the province. Okay?

141
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,910
You're thinking too much, Senior Mr. Beauty.

142
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,050
Don't you have a lot of things to do?

143
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,950
My work is too light. At most, it can be considered a  chore of manual labor.

144
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,160
Besides, working alone is boring. You can only get excited from two people working together.

145
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,670
Look. If our opinions differ, we can bicker about it.

146
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,370
The most important thing is...

147
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,730
Those two act like they are on top of the food chain.  Isn't it too irritating?

148
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,180
Why don't I feel that way? Instead, I feel that they're quite handsome.

149
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,390
You don't understand the world of men.

150
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,850
Why do I feel that you and I are in the same world?

151
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,430
Who's in the same world with you?  Never mind.

152
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,100
Junior Weiwei, it is my last time today

153
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,730
to talk to you as a human being.

154
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,520
Starting from tomorrow,

155
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,500
this senior will become a coding machine.

156
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,900
Tired, huh?

157
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,070
Thanks.

158
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,770
Everyone, listen. The timing is critical.

159
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,120
Huh?

160
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,890
   

161
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,220
 Everyone is so busy, 

162
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,930
 but I can't help in any way. 

163
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,690
Didn't we agree to pose as The Thinker? 
 (Note: famous work by the sculptor, Auguste Rodin) 

164
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,760
With the two of you posing like this,

165
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,330
how can anyone find any inspiration?

166
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,620
For these two male gods to stand in front of our library,

167
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,720
of course, there is a reason.

168
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,390
Keep watching.

169
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,240
I will shortly be able to connect with Aristotle's soul.

170
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,950
At that time, his wisdom will be communicated through this pair of hands and relayed to me.

171
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,420
At that point, who'd bother the inspiration for coding?

172
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,710
I would even be able to understand the meaning of humanity's existence!

173
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,970
In front of your master, where did you get that kind of confidence?

174
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,150
Your master has been giving you guidance all along.

175
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,570
As a person, one must not be too narcissistic or too arrogant.

176
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,060
When you're narcissistic, it is easy to make a mistake. When you're arrogant, it is easy to fail.

177
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,340
Master Plato, no, I mean Master Aristotle,

178
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,480
have you not heard

179
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,180
that the disciple surpasses the master?

180
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm not that fortunate as you and have the option of lying on the beach to enjoy the good life.

181
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,540
"The disciple surpasses the master?"

182
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,290
From what I know, you even got the key point wrong.

183
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,480
Hence, you should leave this difficult programming problem to your master.

184
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,870
You, go and cook a bowl of noodles for your master.

185
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,260
I refuse.

186
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,100
How dare you hit your master? Watch your attitude.

187
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,130
The both of you can continue fighting.

188
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,140
I have an inspiration.

189
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,620
He has an inspiration?

190
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,150
- Should we switch to a new pose? 
- Here.

191
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Time to eat.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,830
This is known as a hobby.

193
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,190
May I have five minutes of your time?

194
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,430
I need to talk to you about something.

195
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,840
Speak.

196
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,150
Although it's summer now, they can't just make do like this.

197
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,860
- Make do?
- Yes.

198
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,720
Look.  Those who are napping by putting down their face on their desk can easily get problems with their neck.

199
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,010
Also, those who sleep on the chair, either they fall off their chair,

200
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,420
or their blanket slides off. What if they catch a cold like this?

201
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,950
I know it's not a normal time right now.

202
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,280
People can't waste their time on commuting in the Capital City,

203
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,500
but it can't continue like this either.

204
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,350
Do you have any suggestion?

205
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,510
I think we can get some blankets and mats

206
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,900
for everyone to rest with.

207
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,440
After all, sleep is very important.

208
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,900
I was lacking in my planning.

209
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,380
You take responsibility for this then.

210
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,330
No problem. I can only do these small tasks anyway.

211
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,910
Your food delivery app is not bad.

212
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,680
It saved a lot of energy and time for everyone.

213
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,290
That's easy.

214
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,210
So... the money?

215
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,880
Why did you give me your wallet?

216
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,740
You take care of all of these.

217
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,350
Go now.

218
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,870
This is great. There's a bed to sleep on.

219
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,140
It's so soft.  I don't need to worry about my stiff butt anymore.

220
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,730
It's really different having a girl around.

221
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,480
In here, there's food, drink, and sleep.

222
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,640
There are even companions.

223
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,550
I don't even want to go back to my kennel anymore.

224
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,120
Third Sister-in-Law, you are like the Snail Girl in the legend.

225
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,840
Yugong, your mattress is in Master's office.

226
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
There's even a plan for this?

227
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,020
Of course. For you, Houzi, Ah Shuang and Ali,

228
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,930
your mattresses are in Master's office.

229
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,880
There are a few people and a lot of space.  It's the VIP treatment.

230
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,580
Junior Sister Weiwei,  you are amazing.

231
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,890
Based on my observation, she segregated based on who snores.

232
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm doing this for your own good.

233
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,760
It's discrimination!

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,500
You are very detailed and thoughtful of everything.

235
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,580
I will be able to sleep peacefully then.

236
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,640
Where's my bed?

237
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,830
Over there.

238
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Junior Sister, you actually gave him the worst spot.

239
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,190
I assigned your sleeping spots by drawing.

240
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,990
It's the same. I rarely sleep.

241
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,900
It's better for me to sleep there.

242
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,540
Thank you, Junior Sister.

243
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,190
No problem, no problem. I can't help you guys in any other ways.

244
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,680
My school starts on September 1st, I can battle with you guys until then.

245
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,120
If you need any help, just look for me.

246
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,770
 Okay. 

247
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,870
Junior Sister,

248
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,160
when the school term starts again, I think you can continue as our intern.

249
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,290
You can study and learn at the same time, and earn some pocket money, too.

250
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,610
I don't need a salary as long as there's food.

251
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,800
Then put your salary on my account.

252
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,810
Third Brother, you are ruthless.

253
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,020
Thank you.

254
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:42,910


255
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,180
- Cousin. 
- What's wrong?

256
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,480
Everyone in the company is saying that our Manager Zhen

257
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
suddenly becomes this industrious and hardworking businessman.

258
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,760
Hence, I came to take a look.

259
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,310
I didn't expect it to be true.

260
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,560
Cousin, what happened to you?

261
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,280
What do you mean?

262
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,900
It's normal for men to strive for their career.

263
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,820
Cousin, if you really think this way,

264
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,400
Uncle must be extremely happy.

265
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,290
Frankly, I'm working hard because I want to defeat Xiao Nai fair and square.

266
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,610
That's why I'm going all in.

267
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,080
However, I later realized that designing games is so much more interesting than I originally thought.

268
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,170
I guess I found something I like to do with a stroke of luck.

269
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,800
Defeat Xiao Nai?

270
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,450
What does this have to do with Xiao Nai?

271
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,760
You are in the same school as Xiao Nai, so you probably know his girlfriend.

272
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,510
Do you mean Bei Weiwei?

273
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,650
Bei Weiwei? Isn't her last name Lu?

274
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,440
If you are talking about Xiao Nai's girlfriend, then it is Bei Weiwei.

275
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,540
Do you know her?

276
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,820
 Great! I got tricked again. 

277
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,490
Cousin,

278
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,890
do you know Bei Weiwei?

279
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,220
Why did she say her last name was Lu?

280
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,870
Did she tell you herself that her last name was Lu?

281
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,760
I know a lot of women. She's not the only one.

282
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,650
You should also know that women are eccentric.

283
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,400
It's normal that they like to play games with men.

284
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay. I need to work now.

285
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,670
Feng Teng Technology is strange, too. Why did they suddenly bring forward the date by more than two weeks?

286
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,230
So busy.

287
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,310
 Why does my cousin want to defeat Xiao Nai? 

288
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,070
Did you say that Brother Shaoxiang knows Bei Weiwei?

289
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,450
And Bei Weiwei told Shaoxiang that her last name was Lu?

290
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,370
How dare she even try to get Brother Shaoxiang with her claws?

291
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,900
She's too shameless.

292
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,340
Did Brother Shaoxiang break up with his girlfriend because of her?

293
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,220
I don't know.

294
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,180
I think that is probably the case.

295
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,000
Bei Weiwei lied to Brother Shaoxiang that her family name was Lu.

296
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,140
She must be trying to hide her identity,

297
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,560
to hide from others that she's two-timing.

298
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,050
A girl who could even think of this method

299
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,550
is way too scheming.

300
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,820
On one hand, Bei Weiwei grabs onto Xiao Nai.

301
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,000
At the same time, she deceived Cao Guang in the game.

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,130
She's reaching for Brother Shaoxiang now.

303
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,620
She is just simply a super manipulative woman!

304
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,650
But didn't Cao Guang say that he mistook her for someone else?

305
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,670
Can you even believe this?

306
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,350
Isn't this too coincidental?

307
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,860
Cao Guang must have been fooled by Bei Weiwei

308
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,930
into deceiving us.

309
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,330
Initially, I believed Cao Guang,

310
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,160
but now, Cousin...

311
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,080
Forget it. I'm so confused now.

312
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,880
I can't be bothered with them. They can trick whoever they want.

313
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,890
Men are fools.

314
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,250
They were all toyed around by someone and even wrongly accused the innocent.

315
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,140
By the way, I know something else.

316
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,290
What?

317
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,640
A few days ago, at the entrance of the company,

318
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,300
I saw Cao Guang come to visit Zhao Erxi.

319
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,510
They were arguing there at the company entrance.

320
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,480
In the end, Zhao Erxi ran back to the office while crying.

321
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,350
For the past few days, when I saw Zhao Erxi in the office,

322
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,420
she seems to be a bit distracted.

323
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,250
Could it be...

324
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,010
Zhao Erxi likes Cao Guang

325
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,520
and Cao Guang likes Bei Weiwei?

326
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,060
Why is it so messy?

327
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,960
I must get to the bottom of this.

328
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,380
Cao Guang threatened us to keep quiet.

329
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,340
But if this comes out of Zhao Erxi's mouth,

330
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,490
he can't blame us, right?

331
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,760
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

332
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,420
I'm leaving.

333
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,790
Let's leave now.

334
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,300
Let's go.

335
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,130
Erxi, we are from the same school.

336
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,320
We've also been interning at the same company for so long.  We ought to get to know each other.

337
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,390
These are the macaroons Yiran gave me.  I'll give you a box.

338
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,740
Thanks, but I'm on a diet. I can't eat sweets.

339
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,760
Erxi, I heard you had an argument with Bei Weiwei because of Cao Guang.

340
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
How did you know?

341
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,980
Stop spouting nonsense. There's no such thing.

342
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,500
In this world, no secret can be kept forever.

343
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,920
Besides, the winner will flaunt her victory.

344
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,980
The winner will flaunt it?  What do you mean?

345
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,040
What do you think I mean?

346
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,400
Other than you, who else knows about this incident?

347
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,210
But don't be too sad.

348
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,160
You aren't the only one she treated this way.

349
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,100
Manager Zhen and his girlfriend

350
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,780
were getting along really well before,

351
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,020
but she got involved.

352
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,600
Frankly, she just can't leave any man alone.

353
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,010
Actually, before, I already had proof of Bei Weiwei's two-timing.

354
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,170
Cao Guang could be my witness.

355
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,520
Unfortunately, the evidence is gone.

356
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,660
That foolish Cao Guang was also deceived by her.

357
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,200
He said that it was a misunderstanding.

358
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,740
He wouldn't allow us to tell the truth about it.

359
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,820
Also, that Xiao Nai. He clearly saw the video and still didn't believe it.

360
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,940
I really don't know what kind of magic potion that Bei Weiwei gave them.

361
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,000
Cao Guang found you and you gave the video to Xiao Nai to see?

362
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,590
Yes.

363
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,520
Such malicious behavior, of course, has to be exposed.

364
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,900
Cao Guang came to find us because of Bei Weiwei.

365
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,710
He just wanted us to keep our mouths shut.

366
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,980
But he didn't mention you.

367
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,420
So you looked for me just to say this?

368
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,150
I didn't want to see you so ignorantly kept in the dark

369
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,390
and still regard her as your best friend.

370
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,290
Although the evidence is gone,

371
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,230
I thought I should still tell you about it.

372
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,130
It's late. I'm going back now.

373
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,920
Okay, Yiran and I will treat you to a meal next time.

374
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,540
 That foolish Cao Guang was also deceived by her. 

375
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,550
 He said that it was a misunderstanding. He wouldn't allow us to tell the truth about it. 

376
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,490
 Also, that Xiao Nai. He clearly saw the video and still didn't believe it. 

377
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,690
 Such malicious behavior, of course, has to be exposed. 

378
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,290
 Originally, there were so many unfounded conjectures and attacks 

379
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,730
 centered around Weiwei. 

380
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,180
 But she never complained about it at all. 

381
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,310
 She even helped me vent my anger. 

382
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,140
 Had it been me, I would have broken down. 

383
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,890
 Frankly, regarding Cao Guang, Weiwei didn't do anything wrong either. 

384
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,920
 I said I didn't blame her, 

385
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,040
 but in my heart, I still blamed her for everything. 

386
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,530
 Zhao Erxi, how could you still be angry at such a good friend and role model? 

387
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,920
 My brain must have short-circuited. 

388
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,800
 Erxi, I'm really sorry. 

389
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,560
 Just forgive me on account of Coffee. 

390
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,310
Hello, Zhao Erxi.

391
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,370
You finally returned my call.

392
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,400
Cao Guang, you keep apologizing to me,

393
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
but have you apologized to Weiwei?

394
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,810
 I always thought I was really being wronged. 

395
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,420
But just now, I suddenly realized,

396
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,220
I wasn't the only one who was wronged.

397
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,160
Because of us, Weiwei

398
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,850
was accused of cheating,

399
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,700
but she never complained while letting me take my anger out on her and your accusation.

400
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,880
 It's okay for others to talk behind her back. 

401
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,890
However, the most laughable thing is that I have always thought of myself as her good friend,

402
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,360
but I have never considered her feelings.

403
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,830
Cao Guang, you should apologize to Weiwei.

404
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,170
 She doesn't need my apology. 

405
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,470
 I dare not apologize to her, either. 

406
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,780
You really do like Weiwei.

407
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,750
Cao Guang, you must remember,

408
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,760
the person that I like

409
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,890
is Wei Guang who thought I was the one he liked.

410
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,750
It's not Cao Guang.

411
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,160
I have never liked you. Understand?

412
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,000
In the future, when we bump into each other at school,

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,160
just take it that we don't know each other.

414
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,630
Cao Guang, I forgive you.

415
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,610
Goodbye, Wei Guang.

416
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,350
 ♫ I want to meet someone with a sincere heart ♫ 

417
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:47,600
 ♫ I'd like to see my heart never stop fluttering. I'd like to know ♫ 

418
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,020
 ♫ I am no longer an empty shell and let myself ♫ 

419
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,860
 ♫ be cherished and indulged ♫ 

420
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,130
Brother Mei, take this one and redo it.

421
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,880
Bros, you all must be tired. Here, this will refresh you.

422
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,900
 Hello? Weiwei, are you busy right now? 

423
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,410
This is Xiao Nai. Weiwei is sleeping.

424
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,780
Huh? Sleeping?

425
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,550
With you?

426
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,650
No, no. What I meant is...

427
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,170
We're at the office. She got tired from working overtime and fell asleep.

428
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,020
She will return your call when she's awake.

429
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,700
Okay, don't wake her up.

430
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,690
She will be very happy with your call.

431
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,280
Erxi called me?!

432
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,590
How did she sound?

433
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,490
I just hear the feeling of crisis that my girlfriend will leave my house.

434
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,430
Bike keys.

435
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,850
In the drawer, get them yourself.

436
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,470
You can take half of the day off.

437
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,850
Thanks, Boss! Also, I already ordered dinner.

438
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,880
You guys won't be hungry. Thanks for your blanket!

439
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,070


440
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,830
It's a robbery!

441
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,380
Master Er, I only have one cake.

442
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,850
Can I pay my toll with this?

443
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,170
I guess it will have to work. It's too small though.

444
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,690
It's not enough for me to eat in one bite.

445
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,280
Does it taste good?

446
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,860
It's really good.

447
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:03,990
For the past few days, I really felt that I was rather foolish.

448
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,840
Weiwei, do you know that I am truly regretful now?

449
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,270
From my understanding of you, you are regretting

450
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,130
about the cake that you throw out a few days ago.

451
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,620
How are you able to guess that?

452
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,420
So annoying!

453
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,450
Weiwei, don't tell Xiao Ling and Si Si about this.

454
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,770
Or I won't be your friend anymore.

455
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,410
I lost face, too.  Do you know? I don't want to talk about it either.

456
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,220
That's more like it.

457
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,590
A dark part of my past.

458
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,060
If the campus beauty's sidekick hadn't come and made mischief,

459
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,960
I don't know when I would have understood what was happening.

460
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,690
You have to forgive me. I have never dated before,

461
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,770
so I can easily get tricked.

462
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,830
About this, no matter what, it's still because of me–

463
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,820
It has nothing to do with you.

464
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,540
It's all Cao Guang's fault for being so dumb.

465
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,520
Just now, before you got here,

466
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,560
I sat here by myself and thought for a long time.

467
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,850
I was thinking

468
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,930
I'm probably a bit envious of you.

469
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,760
It wasn't easy for me to like someone,

470
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,780
but that person likes you.

471
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,990
But it's okay. Everything is clear to me now.

472
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,770
I don't want anyone who doesn't like me back!

473
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,650
I'm going to turn to a new page.

474
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,870
I'm going to look for a handsome guy who doesn't judge people by their appearance.

475
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,250
"Someone who doesn't judge people by their appearance," but why are you looking for a handsome guy?

476
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,050
Can't you just encourage me?

477
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,800
I haven't even interrogated you yet.

478
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,730
Did you really move to Master's home?

479
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,360
Have a few things happened that should have happened?

480
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,590
What if you lose your virginity to him? It'll be all because of me!

481
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,920
Master is a gentleman, okay?

482
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,480
I don't believe it.

483
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,310
For a guy who can steal the department beauty in three minutes,

484
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,890
how much of a gentleman can he be?

485
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,510
Tell the truth.  Have you guys kissed or not?

486
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,110
Why are you so close to me?

487
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,070
Tell me.

488
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,250
In any case, after I moved in with him, we haven't.

489
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,510
So, in the past, you have.

490
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,210
Why haven't after you moved in with him?

491
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,600
Could it be Master is afraid of starting something accidentally?

492
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,230
Why did you take away my cake?

493
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,940
I think you can use your imagination to get stuffed.

494
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,770
You can't have it!

495
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,450
Ah!

496
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,750
Come here. Look at you.

497
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,850
Weiwei, when you weren't around,

498
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,110
I totally messed up Xiao Ling's place.

499
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,940
You have to hurry and move back. It isn't good for you to live in Master's house.

500
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,000
You're right. I'll go and tell him.

501
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,190
Eat your cake.

502
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,570
Here.

503
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,470
I don't want it. I'm ignoring you.

504
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,730
If we go along this line of thinking, with all the battles in fog,

505
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,720
all the models of low color saturation under the default settings

506
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,000
can use the primary vector analysis to reduce the number of vertices.

507
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,480
Their movement data can be simplified into a limited set.

508
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,690
In the end, we can merge these player models with the dynamic graphics

509
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,210
and display them at once.

510
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,440
This can reduce more than a thousand requests for drawing.

511
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,470
The efficiency of memory usage and display can both be enhanced.

512
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,630
It's not an issue to merge the models with the graphics,

513
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,070
but about the primary vector analysis...

514
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,480
Can you handle the advanced mathematics?

515
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,080
I taught myself.

516
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,290
Excellent. There definitely won't be any problems.

517
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,590
   

518
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm making a call.

519
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,080
Are you moving back?

520
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,470
Yes. I can't keep staying at your place.

521
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,540
What do you think my place is?

522
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,610
You can just come and go as you wish?

523
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,730
Move back when school starts.

524
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,150
Who's that? Who's going to move back when school starts?

525
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,000
You don't know this person.

526
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,550
So how?

527
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,650
Erxi, I suddenly thought of something.

528
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,860
Lately, Master hasn't been living in his apartment

529
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,970
but there are many valuable paintings in the house.

530
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,200
So, I have to keep an eye on them.

531
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,500
Just move those paintings to Xiao Ling's home.

532
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,500
What was Na Na's motive to tell you all those things?

533
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,300
Who knows what those crooked people were thinking about?

534
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,990
She certainly had ill intentions towards you.

535
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,290
I originally thought to just ignore them.

536
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,710
But it's annoying that they keep bothering me.

537
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,390
They even invited me to a meal.

538
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,210
Then I'll see what they have in mind.

539
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,720
Invited you to a meal?

540
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,140
Do you mean it?

541
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,420
Really. I got that when I asked her directly.

542
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,860
When she's here, let's console her.

543
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,970
Zhao Erxi will certainly give us the whole story.

544
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,960
Bei Weiwei, you just wait!

545
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,260
Welcome.

546
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,270
Erxi, over here!

547
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,050
Erxi, this is Yiran. You know her, right?

548
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,140
Yiran, this is Erxi.

549
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,450
- Hello.
- I know her. She's the school beauty.

550
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,200
Erxi, we have already ordered. See if there's anything you like.

551
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,830
Thanks.

552
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,460
Waitress.

553
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,640
Give me a French crepe,

554
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,360
a mango pomelo sago,

555
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,200
and two mango pancakes.

556
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,750
I'll also have one of the Cantonese egg noodles.

557
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,350
I didn't have lunch.

558
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,780
Did I order too much?

559
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,100
Not at all. We're all good friends. Don't be uncomfortable.

560
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,960
Okay then! Then, I'll also get a blueberry cake, a fruit platter.

561
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,000
And, do you have juice? Then, a glass of juice.

562
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
I'm done. Thank you.

563
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,750
Please wait.

564
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,200
Enjoy!

565
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,720
Why aren't you eating? Let's eat together.

566
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,480
I'm really envious of you. Your appetite is so good.

567
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,690
I'm using my heartbreak as motivation.

568
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,280
Yiran, you should know it better than I do.

569
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,350
You... really are heartbroken?

570
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,560
Is it because...

571
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,920
It's all because of that Wei–

572
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,810
However, I'm no match for her. What can I do?

573
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,350
You are such an innocent girl. How can you be her match?

574
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,990
The most detestable thing is that the boys actually help her

575
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,700
and prevent us from telling anyone the situation.

576
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,060
However, forget about us.  Our credibility is minimal,

577
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,680
but it's different for you.

578
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,160
If you said it, the credibility would be much higher.

579
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,210
Are you saying that I should bad-mouth her?

580
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,880
It's not that. This is not what we meant. We merely feel that,

581
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,960
it's extremely unfair for the evil people to be so full of themselves.

582
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,360
For this, it should be discussed at length.

583
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,780
Wait as I think while eating.

584
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,400
Erxi!

585
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:54,950


586
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,040
