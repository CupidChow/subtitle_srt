 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,510
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,620
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,920
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,690
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,530
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,470
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,610
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,190
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,640
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,820
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,860
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,440
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,930
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,310
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,200
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,270
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,360
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,430
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,030
   

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,020
   

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,210
Auntie and Uncle, I am sorry.

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,500
I was the one driving the car.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,070
And... when the accident happened, Third Brother even gave me a  push.

29
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,960
Otherwise, I would have been the one laying here.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,270
Kid, don't worry about it so much.

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,800
Nobody could have anticipated something like this.

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,280
Since he is awake now,

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,780
one is bound to have good fortune after surviving a disaster.

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,410
That's right. Oh!

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,020
I am going to call our relatives. They are all waiting on updates.

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,660
Hurry up and go.

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,720
Just stay in bed. Don't move.

38
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,390
Third Brother, are you really okay now?

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,710
Do you feel any dizziness? Are you all right everywhere else?

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,870
Let's do this. Look at me. Look at me!

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,190
What is one plus one?

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,250
- 249.
- Huh?

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,830
Something's wrong! I'll find the doctor!

44
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,430
Enough, already. Calm down a bit.

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,770
The way Third Brother is acting means that he is fine now.

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,830
He knows that you're not even a "250."
 (Note: 250 is slang for a dummy) 

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,800
Not–

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,430
What time is it?

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,200
- 5:00 p.m.
- You guys go log on to "A Chinese Ghost Story"

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,460
and tell Weiwei about this.

51
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,300
Third Sister-in-Law?

52
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,190
At a time like this...

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,480
how can you still be thinking about the game?

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,080
Third Sister-in-Law?

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,230
Third Sister-in-Law couldn't have waited for you all night, right?

56
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,920
Third Sister-in-Law?

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,770
The doctor's here. The doctor's here.

58
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,140
Ah, Doctor.

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,780
Please check him quickly. Could there be any aftereffects?

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:27,620

61
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,430
Xiao Nai's roommate said something about a "Third Sister-in-Law."

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,940
Could it be that our son is in a relationship?

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,710
I think not necessarily.

64
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,760
Xiao Nai's personality is so eccentric.

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,140
Ever since he was little, I've never seen him play with any girl.

66
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,540
How could he possibly find a wife so soon?

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,440
He... will be at least 40 before he marries.

68
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,300
How can you talk about your son that way?

69
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,690
Even though I agree with what you said,

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,740
however, his roommates call him "Third Brother."

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,210
Could Third Sister-in-Law have some other meaning?

72
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,180
It should be a username from the game.

73
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,250
Nowadays, these youngsters online

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,170
create all sorts of bizarre names.

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,710
A couple of days ago, a literature professor told me

76
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,760
that some authors nowadays don't come up with regular names.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,700
There's an author who came up with

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,490
"Tang Jiasanshao."  What about that?
 (Note: The name means "Add three spoonfuls of sugar") 

79
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,600
"Third Sister-in-Law," "Three Spoons."  Don't they sound very similar?  
 (Note: these two terms sound alike.) 

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Therefore, the "Third Sister-in-Law" that they're talking about

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,090
could be related to something like "Three Spoonfuls."

82
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,540
Yes, that makes sense.

83
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,240
As for you, just stop worrying unnecessarily.

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,440
How could we get a daughter-in-law so quickly?

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,450
Once we get home, we'll first order him half a month's worth of

86
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,500
the fish head soup with Szechuan lovage and gastrodia elata.  
 (soup with Chinese medicinal herbs) 

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,990
Okay.

88
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,780
Your restaurant is close to the hospital. So, do you know what people with concussions should eat?

89
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,240
Eat something similar to what you want to heal. Getting the fish head soup should be pretty good.

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Okay, then we'll get an order of fish head soup.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,610
Also, we'll order something with plain flavor...

92
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,910
Shitake mushrooms and vegetables. Also, give us a bowl of rice.

93
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,700
Eh, wait a moment. We'll also get him an order of stir-fried pork liver.

94
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,850
- Yes, pork liver is good.
- Okay.

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,400
Just... one bowl of rice?

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,950
We'll take these to go. As for eat-in,

97
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,240
we'll order tomato scrambled eggs and a cucumber salad.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,820
Thank you.

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,720
Nothing else?

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,420
We're only getting vegetarian, Brother?

101
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,600
I really don't have money.

102
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,820
Even though Third Brother's family doesn't blame me,

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,520
I will have to pay for his medical expenses.

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,950
But... you can get reimbursed by the social health insurance, right?

105
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,140
That's right! You can get reimbursed.

106
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,110
- They'll reimburse it?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,720
- We'll also get sweet and sour pork ribs.
- Okay.

108
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,380
Thank you.

109
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,160
Brother Hou, Brother Mei, I can only say these words to you guys.

110
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,520
From now on,

111
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,940
I, Yu Banshan,

112
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,140
will serve our Third Brother whether dead or alive.

113
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,750
I'll follow him for the rest of my life.

114
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,270
Why are you all of a sudden saying this?

115
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,430
You haven't experienced the feeling when your life or death is decided in a split second.

116
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,070
In the split second when our car crashed into the truck,

117
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,190
do you know what Third Brother's instinct was?

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,660
His immediate instinct was to first push me out of the way, then take the steering wheel.

119
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,240
How could my Yu Banshan's life be

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,540
worth more than Third Brother's?

121
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,650
How can I be worth it for him

122
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,150
to sacrifice himself to save me?

123
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,290
I don't know if you guys have thought about it,

124
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,300
but I have.

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,430
Third Brother

126
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,140
really is amazing, really is a master, really is number one.

127
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,630
I can't compare.

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,900
To be honest, I also don't like it in my heart.

129
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,730
Why? Why couldn't I beat him?

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,720
However, when confronted with reality, I cannot ignore it.

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,120
I, Yu Banshan, am just not as good as him.

132
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,840
I think everyone thinks this way.

133
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,870
Except for Third Brother.

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,030
He doesn't think that.

135
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,330
His actions told me

136
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,530
that in his heart,

137
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,380
my life,

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,930
Yu Banshan's life, is equally as valuable as his.

139
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,930
I have been thinking during these days when Third Brother was unconscious.

140
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,900
If I wasn't so lucky,

141
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,200
and instead of the tree, we hit the truck. What would we do then?

142
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,540
What would have happened to Third Brother?

143
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,990
Stop thinking so much.

144
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,990
Then this young life

145
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,010
would have been extinguished because of me.

146
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,470
Third Brother only suffered some scratches with nothing serious. In a few days, he'll be discharged from the hospital.

147
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,570
I can't stop myself from thinking this.

148
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,800
When Third Brother saved me, he also didn't think either. He didn't know

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,870
that he wouldn't get hurt.

150
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,330
Even if he didn't get injured,

151
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,630
today, I've made my statement here.

152
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,300
In the future, whatever Xiao Nai wants me to do, I'll do it.

153
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,450
Come hell or high water, I won't even blink.

154
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,020
- Um...
- Don't mumble. If you have something to say, just spit it out.

155
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,640
I can really understand how you feel right now,

156
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,050
but I have to tell you. First, when following Third Brother,

157
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,720
there won't be any hell or high water.

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,190
- We'll only be living the high life.
- That's right.

159
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,460
And next... you'd better think it through.

160
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,190
If you're going to follow Third Brother,

161
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,210
you can only become the mistress. He already has a wife.

162
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,310
I'm being serious.

163
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,010
Enough. I know you're serious. Let's go in, okay?

164
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,310
Although Third Brother didn't die from the car crash, he'll soon starve to death.

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,370
That's right. Let's hurry. You've been crying for ages.

166
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,250
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,870
Hey, wait.

168
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,690
My eyes... are they red?

169
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,540
I can't let him see me like this. Otherwise, this shameless jerk will mock me again.

170
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,880
- Okay, calm, calm, calm. No problems.
- No more crying, okay?

171
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,070
Let's go quickly.

172
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,780
What monster is this? It's so perverted.

173
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,070
Just wait until I take you out!

174
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,890
Ultimate weapon! Ultimate weapon!

175
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,290
Ultimate weapon! Ah, I can't cast my ultimate weapon.

176
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,010
Forget it. Have to save my own life first.

177
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,240
Oh no! I can't outrun you.

178
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,180
Let me ask a heroine to deal with you.

179
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,340
Heroine Weiwei! SOS.

180
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,760
Weiwei!

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,230
You're concentrating so much on your professional book.

182
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,460
Hurry over here and help me destroy this monster.

183
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,970
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

184
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,500
Oh, Madame Heroine, I'm begging you.

185
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,410
Hands off.

186
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,890
That guy is still wet behind the ears.

187
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,660
Let me give you a lesson and see how you treat me next time.

188
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,290
I will make you take a detour from where I am.

189
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,510
Weiwei, kill him off with one stroke.

190
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,520
- Stand aside. Don't block my way.
-Aye-aye!

191
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,130
What?

192
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,240
Weiwei, what's wrong with you?  Are you sick?

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,020
- Erxi... 
- What?

194
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,880
Do you have a good friend inside the game?

195
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,600
Yes...

196
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,380
Yes, I do.

197
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,480
Then, have you thought of meeting up with him?

198
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,640
No. What good would it do?

199
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,010
But what if someday he just disappeared?

200
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,290
Or if he never went online again?

201
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,570
He and you play the game,

202
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,070
also spend a lot of time together every day.

203
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,900
However, he suddenly disappeared,

204
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,030
yet you don't know who he is, or where he is.

205
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,860
Even if you run into him in a crowd,

206
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,860
he would just be a stranger.

207
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,040
Aren't all games like that?  There are new players every day,

208
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,480
and some of them leave each day.

209
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,220
Even though I've only been playing for a short while,

210
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,120
this seems pretty normal.

211
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,690
Hmm, true.

212
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,200
It's pretty common in the game.

213
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,560
I thought I'd gotten used to it.

214
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,850
 But why do I feel anxious this time? 

215
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,240
Weiwei, what is it?

216
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm going back to my studies.

217
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,870
 In the online game, there's far too much farewell without notice. 

218
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,390
 Could it be that Naihe would disappear that way, too? 

219
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,190
 Will this video 

220
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,090
 be the only proof of the encounter between Naihe and me? 

221
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,250
 However, it could be that something came up so he couldn't make it. 

222
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,420
 Why am I only thinking of the worst case scenario? 

223
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,960
 And did Naihe really just disappear? 

224
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,190
 I just need to log on to the game and take a look. 

225
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,880
 Why am I so scared to get online? 

226
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,740
 Oh, no. I have actually become sentimental. 

227
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,440
 Oh, no. 

228
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,950
 I seem to have fallen for someone. 

229
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,750
 That night, Weiwei stood by herself by the NPC at Jinling City's gate until 8:03 p.m. 

230
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,700
 and you still didn't show up. 

231
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,140
 Afterwards, Weiwei logged off. 

232
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,220
 After that, she hasn't logged on since. 

233
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,030
 That is all I know. 

234
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,440
 Got it. Thank you. 

235
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,740
 Yixiao Naihe, why didn't you come that day? 

236
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,810
 When it was almost 8:00, Weiwei even told me that she believed that you would definitely come. 

237
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,170
 Sorry, I want to tell Weiwei first. 

238
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,160
Third Brother, I heard that Third Sister-in-Law took quite a bit of real tongue-lashing in the world chat.

239
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,850
It was all my fault. I will apologize to her later.

240
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,780
Why are you so slow?

241
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,730
Get up. Get up.

242
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,820
At your pace, Third Brother will have to wait until next year to eat this.

243
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,860
Actually, I think that

244
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,860
the key issue is that Third Sister-in-Law has not gone online.

245
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,940
Do you think that Third Sister-in-Law could be so hurt by this incident that she will never get online again?

246
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,140
If that happens, Third Brother will return to being single again.

247
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,410
No need to worry about that.  As long as she has anything to do with the internet, Third Brother will definitely be able to find her.

248
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,710
Unless she spends the rest of her life without going online.

249
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,160
This is true.

250
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
Then, if it's like this...

251
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
Third brother will have to meet her in real life, right?

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Third brother, would you be willing to do that?

253
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,350
What are you doing?

254
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,450
You're watching the video "Lady Bandit's Abduction of Her Lover?"

255
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,710
It's Weiwei who's watching it.

256
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,490
You haven't hacked into Third Sister-in-Law's computer, have you?

257
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,500
Did you find her in real life?

258
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,820
When can I be discharged from the hospital?

259
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,730
You still have to stay a few more days. You have to wait until your health has fully recovered.

260
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,360
- Hao Mei.
- Huh?
- Make a small thing for me and put it into the game.

261
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,060
As soon as Weiwei logs in, it will send an automatic message to my cell phone.

262
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,780
That's easy enough. Let me handle it.

290
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,210
During our last class, we analyzed and appreciated

291
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,200
"The Titanic." In this class,

292
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,720
we will continue by appreciating

293
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,330
a Hollywood classic film, "The Bridges of Madison County."

294
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,140
   

295
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,180
Can you really be so kind-hearted?

296
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,390
We're classmates. We should help each other.

297
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,000
Thanks.

298
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,810
Are you okay?

299
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,240
Don't move me. It hurts! It hurts!

300
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,550
Why is it you two again? Let me remind you. This is a classroom.

301
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,900
If you want to date, do that outside.

302
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,760
Professor, this chair broke again.

303
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,280
This student was injured.  Can I take her to the school infirmary?

304
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,650
Go.

305
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,670
Did you do that on purpose?

306
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,100
I swear. I really didn't know the seat was broken.

307
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,820
Why is it whenever I run into you, I always have such bad luck?

308
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,960
Before I came out, I already checked my horoscope.

309
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,320
It said I would have five-star luck today.

310
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,410
You messed everything up.

311
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,150
Let's just say it was my fault this time.

312
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,030
Last time, it was my fault, too.  I apologize to you.

313
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,740
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,740
But I really did it out of kindness.

315
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,160
Kindness?

316
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,750
Why did you suddenly grow a conscience?

317
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,620
You saved me a seat and gave me Yakult.

318
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,820
Could you be this nice?

319
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,970
Be straight with me. What are you up to?

320
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,300
Fine. Then I'll be frank.

321
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,030
You're really close to Bei Weiwei, aren't you?

322
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,390
Weiwei?  She's my roommate.  So what?

323
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,140
Oh, I get it!

324
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,570
You want to bribe me to tell you Weiwei's schedule,

325
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,270
then take pictures of her and post them online with baseless gossips.

326
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,130
How did you know about that as well?

327
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,220
That was just a big misunderstanding.  I've already apologized to her for it.

328
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,170
Right now, I think she's...

329
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,580
So, now you like Weiwei?

330
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,880
Is it that obvious?

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,260
Dream on!

332
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,330
It hurts!  It hurts!

333
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm telling you. Don't think that trying to be nice to me will make me help you pursue Weiwei.

334
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,940
It's what you should do, okay?

335
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,150
My trouble now is all your fault.

336
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,010
Okay, okay.  First, I'll take you to the doctor.

337
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,350
Open it!

338
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,990
Fortunately, my butt is fine.  Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off.

339
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,160
My intentions were good.

340
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,850
What happened was purely an accident.

341
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,620
However, I'm the kind of guy who accepts responsibility for his actions.

342
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,590
Tell me.  How can I make it up to you?

343
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,330
Other than helping you apply the medicine.

344
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,700
In your dreams!

345
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,340
Even if you wanted to, I wouldn't give you the chance.

346
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,050
You can treat me to something good to eat.

347
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,350
Okay.  What do you want to eat?  We can go right now.

348
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,200
Dream on.  It's three meals a day.

349
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,720
How can I go to the dining hall in my current condition?

350
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,780
How can I get to my food in that huge crowd?

351
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,710
Okay. Then I'll take care of your three meals a day.

352
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,370
Every day, I'll deliver it punctually downstairs until you recover.

353
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,900
Okay.

354
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,480
Wow!  I didn't realize you were really a person of your words.

355
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,960
Of course. A gentleman's word...

356
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,190
I bought two servings. One is for you, one is...

357
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,430
How did you know I want two servings for breakfast?

358
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,800
You even know I like to drink Yakult for breakfast!

359
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,720
Actually, one of these servings

360
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
is what you want me to give to Weiwei, right?

361
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,110
Don't try to deny it.  Do you think I'm stupid?

362
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,670
Well... has Weiwei run into something that made her unhappy?

363
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,950
How did you know?

364
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,340
I saw her and it seemed her mood was rather low.

365
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,920
You're her roommate. You know why, right?

366
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,510
Of course, I know.

367
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,170
However, why would I tell you?

368
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,270
This is Weiwei's private business.

369
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,130
Let me tell you this.  Don't think about bribing me to say nice things about you.

370
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,880
Even if I, Zhao Erxi, am gluttonous and–

371
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,560
gluttonous... selling out my friends is something I would never do.

372
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Smart. I really was trying to bribe you.

373
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,700
You even admitted it!

374
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,100
Why wouldn't I admit it? I like her and have never hidden it.

375
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,430
If you don't want to help me, that's fine.

376
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,480
In any case, I won't give up.

377
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,170
 Master, are you not in a good mood today? 

378
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,700
 Is there anything you're unhappy about? Can you tell me about it? 

379
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,250
 It's nothing, really. I just suddenly want to start dating. 

380
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,680
However, a girl like me,

381
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,080
would anyone like me?

382
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,070
   

383
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,960
   

384
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,590
That's because none of them understand you. They have a lot of misunderstanding about you.

385
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,860
I was also one of them.

386
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,340
 Master, let's go. I'll take you somewhere. 

387
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,210
 What place? 

388
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,610
 Once you get there, you'll know. 

389
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,430
Where are you taking me?

390
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,250
We'll arrive soon.

391
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,530
Wow! It's so beautiful!

392
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,470
Do you like it?

393
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,940
I like it.

394
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,280
There's something even more beautiful.

395
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:07,960
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

396
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,780
 What are you doing? Why are you suddenly making it so romantic? 

397
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,810
 It couldn't be that you want to practice on me 

398
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,390
 and then chase other girls, right? 

399
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,270
 Master, you are a girl. 

400
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,530
 Master, my level is almost higher than yours now. 

401
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,280
 I think... I don't want to be your apprentice anymore. 

402
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,680
 What? Are you going to rebel and turn your back on your teacher? 

403
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,710
 That's unacceptable. This is called an ingrate. 

404
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,380
 That's not it. I just wanted to say, Wei... 

405
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,400
 Huantian Xidi, 

406
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,360
 would you like to... become my partner? 

407
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,190
A confession?

408
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,700
Someone's confessing to me?

409
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,270
 I... would like to! 

410
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,010
Yes! Yes!

411
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,310
 I already figured out my own thinking. 

412
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,300
 Next, I should storm into the game, 

413
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,990
 and do everything conceivable to get my Master. 

414
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,480
 In any case, I'm not married and Master doesn't have a wife. 

415
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,440
 But why don't I dare go online? 

416
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,740
 I'm doomed.  An alien must have taken over my body. 

417
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,910
 Or can you say this is the so-called 

418
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,250
 shyness? 

419
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,680
 Forget it. I'll take the exam first. 

420
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,830
 After I take the exam, I'll play the game. He definitely won't disappear. 

421
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,760
 Right! 

422
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,600
- Hello?
 - Hello, may I ask if this is Miss Bei Weiwei? 

423
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,340
Yes, it's me. May I ask, you are...?

424
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,060
Miss Bei, hello. This is the Operations Division for "A Chinese Ghost Story" in Feng Teng Group.

425
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,810
Operations Division for "A Chinese Ghost Story?"

426
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,020
May I ask... why you contacted me?

427
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,390
 First of all, let me congratulate you about your video. 

428
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,960
 It won first place in our contest for the game story video. 

429
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,460
 I also watched the video. 

430
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,450
 Its production is superb and we all like it very much. 

431
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,640
Thank you.

432
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,920
 It's like this. The senior executives of the company, after seeing your video by coincidence, 

433
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,420
 were inspired by the abduction scenario in the video 

434
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,920
 and would like to add new plot options for gameplay. 

435
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,440
 At the same time, they want to use your video as a marketing video for promotion. 

436
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,760
 Therefore, the company wants to purchase the copyright for your video. 

437
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,560
 We don't know whether you would be willing or not. 

438
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,810
 This... Can I give you the answer later? 

439
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,780
Because this video wasn't made by just me alone.

440
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,960
- I need to ask my friend's opinion.
 - Um, 

441
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,690
 okay. May I ask when you will come to a decision? 

442
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,040
In two or three days.

443
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,800
 Then, can I contact you on Monday? 

444
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,470
Yes.

445
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,280
 - Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

446
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,000
Weiwei,

447
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,650
look at you. Depressed in one moment, yet bright and sunny the next.

448
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,590
Can you give a hint when you change the channel on us?

449
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,720
Didn't you guys hear it just now?

450
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,020
Just now you said something about "A Chinese Ghost Story."

451
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,760
What is it? Quickly, satisfy my curiosity.

452
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,190
Recently, I made a game video, remember?

453
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,970
Feng Teng Group wants to buy the copyright for my video.

454
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,380
And they said they were inspired by the video,

455
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,180
so they'll add new features to the game.

456
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,460
Is that trustworthy?

457
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,140
It should be trustworthy.

458
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,810
Feng Teng's pretty good at maintaining the player's privacy.

459
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,790
Except for its internal staff, there shouldn't be anyone else who would know I'm Luwei Weiwei.

460
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,580
Also, there's no benefit to using this to trick people, right?

461
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,960
Yup. Then that's good.

462
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,280
Go back to your exams.

463
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,120
I am leaving.  Time to play the game!

464
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,840
She's really recovered.

465
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,890
Brrr...

466
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,280
 Weiwei, come to where I am. 

467
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,710
 Why am I suddenly feeling a little nervous? 

468
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,210
 Third Sister-in-Law, where are you? I'm the eternal sinner. 

469
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,120
 I must humbly beg for your forgiveness. 

470
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,310
Yugong actually used an idiom properly.

471
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,980
 Third Sister-in-Law, I'm extremely sorry. Just beat me to death. 

472
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,920
 What happened? 

473
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,710
 That day, coming back from the business dinner, I was driving. 

474
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,820
 In the end, we had a car accident. 

475
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,550
 You guys are okay, right? 

476
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,740
 Right now, you guys are even in the mood to come online, 

477
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,110
 so there shouldn't be anything wrong. Right? 

478
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,700
 We're fine. The truck suddenly made a left turn without signaling. 

479
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,840
 We barely managed to avoid the big truck. 

480
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,050
 However, we hit a tree. 

481
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,720
 I'm fine. Third Brother pushed me out of the way. 

482
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,450
 Third Brother had a slight concussion, 

483
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,920
 but he woke up after being unconscious for a day. 

484
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,710
 What do you mean, he woke after being unconscious for a day? 

485
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,440
 That's really serious, okay? I'm going to find Master. 

486
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,950
Why are you still playing the game? Why aren't you taking needed rest?

487
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,830
I'm already fine.

488
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,460
Even so, you can't be playing the game.

489
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,530
Playing the game is very consuming.

490
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,140
I'm not playing. I just happen to have it on.

491
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,450
Happen to have it on?

492
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,050
Then why is it that as soon as I got online, you sent me a message?

493
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,350
Your head... does it still hurt?

494
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,470
Sorry. That day, I didn't make it.

495
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,270
Compared to your injury, that's a minor issue.

496
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,250
 I haven't been online for several days. 

497
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,850
 Master couldn't have been waiting for several days, right? 

498
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,620
 Could he have misunderstood and thought I was mad? 

499
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,870
 I didn't get mad. In the beginning, I was just afraid that if I went online, no one would be there. 

500
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,810
 Afterwards... 

501
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,410
I'm taking my exams,

502
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,780
so... in these past few days, I haven't come online.

503
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,670
I know.

504
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,920
 You know? You don't know. 

505
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,320
That's right. Feng Teng Group called me today.

506
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,150
They said they want to buy the copyright for our video.

507
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,230
How do you want to respond?

508
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,840
This issue is a little complicated.

509
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,530
- Is it?
- Yes.

510
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,410
Therefore,

511
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,450
let's talk about it face-to-face.

512
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,850
 This is my cell phone number. 

513
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,450
 This is Naihe's cell phone number? 

514
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,920
 My cell phone was stolen. I haven't bought another yet. 

515
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,620
 It doesn't matter. Write down my cell phone number. 

516
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,160
 Okay. Then, where should we meet? 

517
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,510
 I'm at Tsinghua University. You're also in the capital city, right? 

518
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,170
  Yup, I am. I'll go to Tsinghua University to pick you up. 

519
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,200
 When are you free? 

520
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,010
 Tomorrow after my exam, I have time after 11:30 a.m. 

521
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,900
 At 12:00 p.m., I'll wait for you at the east entrance of Tsinghua University. 

522
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,410
 Let's make it 11:35 a.m., so we don't have to wait an extra half hour. 

523
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,420
 Why did I speak my thoughts? 

524
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,190
 Not even wanting to wait half an hour... am I acting way too eager? 

525
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,220
 Well... tomorrow I'll call your cell phone. 

526
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,840
 I have something to do, so I'm logging off. Bye-bye.  

527
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,270
Hey, Weiwei, what are you looking for?  Running back and forth like that.

528
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,250
Why don't you come with me to shop for new clothes?

529
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,640
I really didn't think there would be a day

530
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,260
when our classmate, Weiwei, would proactively propose shopping for new clothes.

531
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,020
That's why they say life is always full of surprises.

532
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,070
What do you think of this one?

533
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,020
What do you guys think of this dress?

534
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:35,020
