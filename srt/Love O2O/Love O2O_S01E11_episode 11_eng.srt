 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,550
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,660
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,700
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,480
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,360
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,520
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,170
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,730
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,790
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,720
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,860
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,760
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,970
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,200
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,930
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,290
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,180
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,330
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,310
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,470
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,350
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,160
   

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,000
    

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,740
There's an empty spot over there.  Do you all mind scooting over?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,030
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,530
- Banshan! 
- Isn't that the beauty queen of the department?

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,240
   

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,540
Look over there. Isn't that Bei Weiwei?

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,620
- Is she the runner up to School Beauty Queen we talked about? 
- Yes.

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,300
Why is Xiao Nai sitting next to Bei Weiwei? Is this a coincidence?

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,110
Stop dreaming. I'm telling you that both of them must be together.

34
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,870
I just saw Xiao Nai give her a ride here on his bike.

35
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,490
Has our Master Xiao Nai been grabbed by Bei Weiwei just like that?

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,380
Meng Yiran is also here today.

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,550
Do you think she's also here to see Xiao Nai?

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,690
Most likely. However, I feel that for Bei Weiwei to get Xiao Nai,

39
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,180
it's even better than winning the school beauty queen!

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,300
Well, of course!

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,110
It's all your fault for dragging me over to see this basketball game.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,830
I didn't know, either. Why don't we leave first?

43
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,240
No. If we leave now,

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,430
what will everyone say about me?

45
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,220
   

46
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,300
The scores are tied now.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,800
Don't worry. When they stop paying attention to the spectator stand,

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,120
their score will go back up.

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,490
Why is our department only ahead by 2 points?

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,740
I forgot to do the introduction.  They are my roommates.

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,870
Erxi, Xiao Ling and Si Si.

52
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,610
Hi.  Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,710
 So you can only tell about people after comparing them.  In contrast, 

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,500
 the way I maintain my composure in front of Master is still pretty good. 

55
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,110
Dunk one from the baseline.  Dunk one from the baseline.  Watch the ball.

56
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,570
Yugong and Houzi are down there.  Do you want to go down to say hello?

57
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,100
Is it number 10 and 11?

58
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,790
What about Mo Zhata?

59
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,890
He didn't come.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,660
Do they know that I am Luwei Weiwei?

61
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,200
No.

62
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,610
Okay, I'll come.

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
   

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,490
Wait for me a bit. Let's go back together.

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,500
Xiao Nai bought those snacks we just ate.

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,570
Who cares about the snacks? This world is so unreal.

67
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,320
Erxi, Si Si!

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,660
Our Weiwei really is a perfect match for Xiao Nai.  Who says they don't go well together?

69
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,330
- Those people on the school forum are really shortsighted.
- That's right.

70
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,260
Well done!

71
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,560
 Third Brother!   Finally! 

72
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,070
The eternal bachelor is finally getting it together?

73
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,920
Hello, Senior Brothers. I'm Weiwei.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,370
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

75
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,270
What I mean is I am Luwei Weiwei.

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,280
No way.  Third Brother, what is this?

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,630
You tell me.

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,530
- Dang, it's fate.
- Xiao Nai, you're all right.

79
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,980
You managed to land the beauty queen of our department.

80
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,210
- So, who did the chasing?
- Do you have to ask? Just look at our Master Xiao Nai.

81
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,010
The game wasn't even over and he ran over to the stands.

82
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,640
The Master's legendary poise completely disappeared.

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,870
The way I see it, Xiao Nai was the one who pursued Weiwei.

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,410
Guessing is such a waste of time.  Junior Sister, hurry and tell us who did the chasing?

85
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,340
I want to hear it first hand.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,700
I know about this.  These two must have pulled a "stealthy crossing through the warehouse" a while ago.
 (He misused the idiom "Stealthy crossing through Chencang," meaning to achieve with distraction.) 

87
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,470
"Stealthy crossing through the warehouse?"

88
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,730
It's "Stealthy crossing through Chencang."

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,220
Also, don't use this idiom so casually.

90
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,140
- Is it important?
- Not important.
- Not important.

91
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,320
Right now, the important thing is that you are lucky in love, and we won the basketball game.  Shouldn't you treat us to a meal?

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,300
So, Banshan, you are the man after all.

93
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,350
Treat us to food.  We just finished playing basketball and are starving.

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,180
Then let's start tonight with the late night snack.

95
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,540
Third Brother's treat and Third Sister-in-Law should also go.

96
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,860
Don't frighten her. I'll go with you but she won't go.

97
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,920
That won't do.  You only count as half of the VIP.

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,650
- The key is our department beauty queen.
- Yes, that's right.

99
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,290
- Can she not eat with us?
- I have no objection then.  Ask her.

100
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,640
- Let's eat together. Let's go.
- Go.

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,510
Senior Brothers, I have to go. My roommates are waiting for me.

102
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,630
Goodbye, Senior Brothers.

103
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,790
What time do you normally study?

104
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,290
7:30 a.m.

105
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,580
Got it.  I'll wait for you downstairs tomorrow.

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,440
Weiwei, remember to save me a seat.

107
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,290
Okay.

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,160
Let's go.

109
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,170
- Let's go and get changed.
 - Okay.
- Let's go.

110
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,830
You guys get changed first.  Bye.

111
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,480
- Where is he?  Where is he?
- Who?

112
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,700
Third Brother's girlfriend.

113
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,840
You're late.  She's already gone.

114
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,700
I came over as soon as I heard the news.

115
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Third Brother, call her over here.  I want to see her in person.

116
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,610
There'll be plenty of opportunities later.

117
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,300
Let's go.  Today, Yugong is treating us.

118
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,670
Why me? I don't have any money and I don't have a girlfriend.

119
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,070
I just took Weiwei out to eat and spent all my money.

120
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,650
Oh no, it's all over.  Third Brother has been infected by the lovesickness.

121
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,340
How are we going to live with him now?

122
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,650
If there's something you want to ask, just ask.

123
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,090
- How long have you been dating Xiao Nai? You didn't even tell us?
- That's not the case!

124
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,450
I just found out about it myself.

125
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,770
Do you take us for fools?  With the way you two acted today,

126
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,920
nobody would believe you two have dated for less than half a year.

127
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,740
Half a year?  Half an hour is more like it.

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,060
I demand ten minutes to make my case without interruptions.

129
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,440
Hurry and give us the facts.  How far have you gone?  Have you kissed yet?

130
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,290
When did you kiss for the first time?

131
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,440
It's like this...

132
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,690
One day several months ago, the weather was perfect.

133
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,400
Not a cloud was in the sky.  The moon was so bright you couldn't see the stars.

134
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I started the game and went to the bathroom.

135
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,210
- Get to the point!
- Get to the point!
- Get to the point!

136
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,570
The point is after I went to the bathroom...

137
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,280
You're all so impatient!  After I went to the bathroom,

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,220
I discovered I'd been surrounded by a crowd of players.

139
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,570
They asked me to kidnap the groom...

140
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,460
Then we agreed to meet in person.

141
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,780
Then I found out Yixiao Naihe was Xiao Nai.

142
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,990
So you just met two hours ago?

143
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,900
I really am innocent.  I didn't intentionally hide it from you.

144
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,830
So you're saying you just met Xiao Nai and it's already settled?

145
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,410
It seems so.

146
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,750
If there were a next time, I'd have definitely done my best to hold out until tomorrow.

147
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,000
Forget it. There won't be the next time.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,380
I told you she was in love.

149
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,430
But her boyfriend is Master Xiao Nai.  How incredible!

150
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,080
Weiwei, does Master know you're completely smitten with him?

151
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,330
You can relax.  In the game, I'm smitten with him.

152
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,170
He shouldn't be uncomfortable with this in real life.

153
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
You really are more and more...

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,710
I don't know how to describe it.

155
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh, right. Weiwei, you haven't let us see the game video you were talking about last time.

156
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,730
When we get back, I'll show it to you.

157
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,290
The reason for our meeting this time was about the gaming video.

158
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,960
I completely forgot about this matter!

159
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,560
 The impact of both Masters was indeed too powerful! 

160
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,510
So it's true that when a person falls in love,

161
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,240
her IQ plummets down in a straight line.

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,900
Master Xiao is way too amazing.

163
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,420
even his speed of courting someone is that of a blitzkrieg.

164
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,550
Ah... sneak attack.

165
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,960
 How about it?  Wasn't I good today? 

166
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,110
 Stop talking about it.  What the heck is this? 

167
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,100
What's wrong, Mr. Beauty?

168
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,210
- What's wrong? 
- My heart feels

169
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,960
a little bit off.

170
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,060
You see that Third Brother has a lady now and you don't,

171
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,430
so you feel especially awful.  Is that it?

172
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,250
- Jealous, jealous, jealous!
- Go away!

173
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,820
Why should I be jealous of Third Brother?  He would have had a girlfriend sooner or later.

174
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,190
As for me, I am thinking about Third Sister-in-Law in the game.

175
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Think about it guys. In real life, Third Brother has a girlfriend.

176
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,780
As brothers, we should congratulate him.

177
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,950
But if you guys think about it a little more, what should Third Sister-in-Law in the game do?

178
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,940
She was just stood up in the game.

179
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,050
And then just now, Third Brother finds himself a new girlfriend.

180
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,190
My... My heart even hurts when I think about it.

181
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,620
- Let me tell you. By you're worrying about this is−
- There was a mosquito.

182
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,180
- You go ahead. 
- It's right that you are worried about this.

183
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,270
- Right!
- Isn't it?

184
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,830
Yes, that's right.

185
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,140
Third Brother is just a scumbag! He has a girl in the game and outside the game.

186
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,040
Think about it. How much pain must Third Sister-in-Law in the game feel? So painful!

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,130
That's right!

188
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,270
This can't do. Today,

189
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,410
I will have to make things right for Third Sister-in-Law in the game.

190
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,560
Then out of us three, you'll go?

191
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,880
Fighting, brother! I believe in you.

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,010
I also believe in you.

193
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,780
Third Brother! I have something to discuss with you.

194
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,090
In real life, you found a girlfriend, and she's even the department beauty queen.

195
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,560
As your brother, I have to congratulate you.

196
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,360
But have you thought about Third Sister-in-Law in the game?

197
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,900
What do we do about Third Sister-in-Law in the game?!

198
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,430
Yes, that's right. Third Brother, what do we do about Third Sister-in-Law in the game?

199
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,310
- Give us an explanation. 
- Give him an answer.

200
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,190
Then I can only have both.

201
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,810
Third Brother, are you serious?

202
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,910
I cannot be  more serious.

203
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,380
Third Brother, you're just a scumbag! You!

204
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,810
You guys, what are you doing? Let's walk, quickly!

205
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,930
- All right, all right. You guys go ahead first. 
- We'll get there soon.

206
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,510
What are you guys laughing about? Did I say anything wrong?

207
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,310
You didn't. Nothing you said was wrong. Third Brother...

208
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,290
is 100%, a complete

209
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,420
- scumbag. 
- ...without any additive.

210
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,990
What's going on here?

211
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,730
Ask Weiwei.

212
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,510
Weiwei?

213
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,040
Isn't our department beauty queen called Bei Weiwei?

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,130
Third Sister-in-Law in the game is called Luwei Weiwei...

215
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,850
These two people wouldn't be the same person, right?

216
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,260
- They are the same person. 
- That's right.

217
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,270
Same person.

218
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,490
Yugong, Houzi...

219
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,020
You two!

220
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,410
I will get you guys. Don't run!

221
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,630
The beer is here!

222
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,330
I always knew that Third Brother worked efficiently,

223
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,580
but I never thought that he would be this efficient!

224
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,310
Before we even knew that he was making a move, he got the department beauty queen.

225
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,750
Hey, Xiao Nai. How did you get our department beauty queen?

226
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,690
Teach us! We're so close to graduation

227
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,060
and still remain as young, single and lonely men.

228
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,780
Isn't your heart broken just looking at us?

229
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,920
This... let's just say it depends on your talent.

230
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,230
- I know one thing though.
- What thing?

231
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,490
Before, Third Bro and I went out.

232
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,790
We even bumped into our department beauty queen. I said to him,

233
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,330
"Isn't there a connection between her and me?"  You know what Third Brother said?

234
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,490
What did he say?

235
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,430
He said, "Even if there is something, it wouldn't be between you and her."

236
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,900
So much jealousy! Bottoms up!

237
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,260
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

238
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,570
But I have to say that Xiao Nai handled this matter beautifully.

239
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,520
Look at our Computer Science Department.

240
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,540
We finally manage to produce a runner up in the School Beauty Queen contest.

241
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,980
Fortunately, she didn't get snatched up by someone from another department.

242
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,020
If she were exported to a different department,

243
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,780
where would we show our faces later? Am I right?

244
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,970
Hey, hey, hey! What runner up to the School Beauty Queen? Do you even know how to speak?

245
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,390
Third Sister-in-Law is talented in both studying and sports.

246
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,480
She is number one for sure! Those rankings are a joke!

247
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,640
Number one, number one! I'll drink as a punishment.

248
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,350
I remember that there was some controversy with the number one place last year.

249
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,460
One was Meng Yiran and the other one was Third Brother's girl.

250
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,730
Why did Third Brother's girl lose?

251
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,200
Oh, I know about this! My girlfriend

252
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,220
is Third Sister-in-Law's roommate. According to her,

253
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,610
Third Sister-in-Law's picture was taken in secret by somebody and the picture was especially blurry,

254
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,730
seriously affecting the way her face was shown.

255
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,120
There was another important reason. It's said that Third Sister-in-Law did not appear as pure as Meng Yiran,

256
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,140
that's why she lost.

257
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,440
- What rankings? 
- You didn't know, Third Brother?

258
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,170
You don't even know about the department ranking of beautiful girls? Wait, here is one that you should know.

259
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,900
Ranking of high-risk girl.

260
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,990
Third Sister-in-Law... Number one.

261
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,620
- Let me borrow your laptop. 
- What for? Right now?

262
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,630
Here, let's drink some.

263
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,840
Let's drink.

264
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,410
Let's see what Xiao Nai is doing.

265
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,000
You wouldn't be voting for some girl, right?

266
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,760
Let me see!

267
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,060
   

268
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,930
Third Brother, what did you do again?

269
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,030
Why would we keep rankings that are especially fake?

270
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,730
You're amazing.

271
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,930
Here.  For Third Brother and Third Sister-in-Law.

272
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,360
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

273
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
- Escape a single's life soon!
- Escape the single's life.
- Escape the single's life.

274
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
Because of Third Brother and Bei Weiwei, the school forums are blowing up!

275
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,630
They are blowing up!

276
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,010
Wow! Hey, Third Brother!

277
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,040
- It really is blowing up! 
- It really is!

278
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,990
- Wow, it's the Master. 
- Why is he with her?

279
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,020
- I don't believe it. 
- How did they get together?

280
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,130
Hello, Sir. This is among our brands'

281
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,770
hottest products.

282
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,390
Do you plan to give this as a present to your girlfriend?

283
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,490
Yes. Can you take it out for me to take a closer look?

284
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,140
Yes, please wait for a moment.

285
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,760
To receive such an expensive gift, your girlfriend will be so pleasantly surprised.

286
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,990
- Cao Guang!
- Da Li? Are you going out this late?

287
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,050
- Where did you go? I called you but you didn't pick up. 
- My phone died.

288
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,660
Did you go to buy a gift? For whom?

289
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,930
Why do you ask the question when you know the answer? It was your idea originally.

290
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,770
However, catering to her interest was indeed a great idea.

291
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,960
The gaming world is truly different.

292
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,700
Cao Guang, did you not see the school forums?

293
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,220
- Oh right, your phone died!
- Why would I need to see the school forums?

294
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,300
- Look for yourself then. 
- What is it?

295
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,710
   

296
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,930
- What up with this?
- What else can it be?

297
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,400
Bei Weiwei and Xiao Nai are together now.

298
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,120
They were seen by everyone in public. The news is all over the school forum.

299
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,950
This is impossible!

300
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,100
The pictures are evidence. There's no way that all those pictures are fake.

301
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,310
Cao Guang! Where are you going?

302
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,170
- The basketball court.
- You−

303
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,650
Are you stupid? What time is it? The basketball game finished ages ago.

304
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:34,110
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

305
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,120
Yiran, don't be mad right now.

306
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,340
Those two might not even be together for real.

307
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,030
Even if they are together, it is because Xiao Nai is temporarily misguided.

308
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,270
For a girl like Bei Weiwei, I have ways to deal with her.

309
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,890
This is all your fault! Why did you make me go to the basketball game?

310
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,080
I didn't know that something like this would happen.

311
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,680
I also did it for your sake.

312
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,060
For my sake? You always do this and that for me!

313
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,060
The result? Nothing useful has ever come out of it.

314
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,990
Now look what happened, the whole school knows that Xiao Nai−

315
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,760
Xiao Nai and Bei Weiwei are together!

316
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,830
Why would I go to the basketball game? How would everyone else see me?

317
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,750
Yiran, people might not know

318
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,100
that you like Xiao Nai.

319
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,460
Look at it yourself.

320
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,170
 Does this count as Bei Weiwei's counterattack against Meng Yiran?  

321
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,300
 I voted for Bei Weiwei before.  Why do I have this explainable satisfaction? 

322
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,330
 The rumor had it that the Beauty Queen was going after Master Xiao Nai. 

323
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,080
 However, he was taken away by Bei Weiwei instead.  Is our School Beauty Queen Meng crying like a little baby? 

324
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,660
Tell me.  What should we do now?

325
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,360
Yiran, calm down a bit first.

326
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,420
Why don't you go back to get some rest?

327
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,470
Didn't you want me to buy something for you this afternoon? I haven't gone yet.

328
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,100
I will go to buy it for you now.

329
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,520
Then I will also get your favorite orange juice from that brand that you like.

330
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,370
Don't be so unhappy, okay?

331
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,510
Why are you getting mad at me?

332
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,250
Is it my fault that Xiao Nai doesn't want you?

333
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,720
You can't get the guy but take your anger out on me.

334
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,200
Do you really think you are a princess? Spoiled little princess.

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,070
She treats me to a couple of meals and then treats me like a slave.

336
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,940
If not for−

337
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,930
I wouldn't want to deal with you.

338
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,930
Slow down. It's only us two.  No one is fighting you for this.

339
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,070
You are drinking this beer like it was the potion to heal your heartbreak.

340
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,930
Is Bei Weiwei even worth it?

341
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,820
Who hasn't been rejected before? You will get used to it after a few times.

342
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,810
Listen to me. Don't drink anymore.

343
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,630
For that kind of a woman, she isn't worth it.

344
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,570
Who said I was rejected?

345
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,800
I just think I was taken in by her.  I feel humiliated.

346
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,220
I thought I was smart,

347
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,280
but I didn't see Bei Weiwei as so fickle.

348
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,630
Waiter, two more.

349
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,980
Brother, I really sympathize with you.

350
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,780
Actually, I always felt

351
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,410
good-looking girls like Bei Weiwei

352
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,320
mostly think too highly of themselves.

353
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,350
They will always be picky and looking for the best offer.

354
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,600
You were pursuing her so earnestly, I couldn't say anything.

355
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,850
However, things are the way they are.

356
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,800
I'll just tell you straight out.

357
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,610
Stay away from her.  You might be better off.

358
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,400
Do you really think so?

359
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,000
We are already a couple in the game,

360
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
but in real life, she is with Xiao Nai now.

361
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,860
Doesn't our relationship count in the game? So can she play other's feelings?

362
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,520
I must have been blinded.

363
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,260
At first, I thought that regardless of her appearance on the outside, she still had a good heart.

364
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,830
I didn't realize she was the same inside and out.

365
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,570
Let bygones be bygones.

366
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,190
With your qualifications, there are so many pretty and sincere girls out there

367
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,400
for you to choose from.

368
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,020
Who cares about the kind of nerdy girl in Computer Science with a high IQ but low EQ. Right?

369
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,530
I really underestimated her.

370
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,110
She acted so well. How could she have a low EQ?

371
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,150
Yeah. Well, in the game,

372
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,950
she was so attached to you.  Outside the game,

373
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,540
she's grabbed on to Xiao Nai so tightly.

374
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,040
Why isn't the Oscar for Best Actress given to her?

375
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,720
All right, all right.  What's Bei Weiwei anyway?

376
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,190
Get a good night's sleep tonight.  Tomorrow, we'll make a clean break with her.

377
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,290
Break it off?

378
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,210
Why break it off?

379
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,920
If she can act, well so can I!

380
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,320
Starting tomorrow, I'll act too.

381
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,620
Bei Weiwei, you just wait.

382
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,440
- Let's go.
- We're going back.

383
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,250
- We're leaving.
- Bye-bye.

384
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,050
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

385
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,010
See you tomorrow.

386
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,620
Third Brother,

387
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,140
thank you for risking your life to save me.  Bottoms up from me.

388
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,660
Saving you was true.

389
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,680
I didn't risk my life.

390
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,490
If you hadn't blocked me, I could have avoided the accident.

391
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,150
Third Brother,  are you really certain?

392
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,270
Yes, in that split second. And the car's safety rating is sufficiently high.

393
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,110
Weren't you afraid just in case?

394
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,320
Even if there was an exception, this was the best option for the least damage.

395
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,740
Third Brother,  I salute you.

396
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,530
Put it down.

397
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,820
You went all out today on the basketball court. We were all really touched.

398
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,210
You've just recovered from a serious accident.  You shouldn't drink.

399
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,740
We've been drinking all night and now you say this.

400
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,410
This beer only has 3.8% alcohol. It's not very much.

401
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,130
I'm going to the restroom.

402
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,360
That guy was afraid of being embarrassed and wouldn't let us tell you, but he said it himself.

403
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,570
That guy was afraid of being embarrassed and wouldn't let us tell you, but he said it himself.

404
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,040
His drinking loosened him up a bit.

405
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,220
Tomorrow, he'll probably regret it.

406
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,070
Okay, you guys keep drinking.  I'm going to the restroom, too.

407
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,460
Here, their combat skills aren't that great. Cheers.

408
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,310
It really is you.

409
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,160
Aren't you the cook in our school cafeteria?

410
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,590
No, what I meant was... that you are the employee in our school cafeteria.

411
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,340
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,140
It's all right.

413
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,490
Then, don't you work in our dining hall anymore?

414
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,750
I work part-time at night.

415
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,710
But the food you cook is really good.

416
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,960
I thought the taste of the dishes I just ate were really familiar.

417
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,420
Since that time I tried the food at the cafeteria, I go there all the time.

418
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,040
I know.

419
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,160
You knew?

420
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,140
Does that mean that you know me?

421
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,450
Okay, then you should go back to work.

422
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,030
Oh, right!  The stir-fried vegetables in the school cafeteria are too bland.

423
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,260
Could you add a pinch of salt?

424
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,090
I'm not in charge of cooking all the dishes in school.

425
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,610
No wonder. Some of the dishes are wonderful

426
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,380
and the others horrible.

427
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,740
What is this?  A menu?

428
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,460
These are the dishes I cook. You can order these.

429
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,330
Why don't we exchange cell phone numbers?

430
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,770
I'm just a cook.  I bring food.

431
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,060
I'm just a programmer.  I write the code.

432
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:34,920
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

433
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,810
 I still can't sleep. 

434
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,780
 Misunderstand? 

435
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,690
 Misunderstand that we are... in this kind of relationship. 

436
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,960
 Since when were we not in this kind of relationship? 

437
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,840
- You're still not asleep? 
- I'm going to the bathroom.

438
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,310
 I want to sleep. 

439
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,910
 Otherwise, I'll have bags under my eyes when I go to study. I'll be done for. 

440
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,030
Weiwei...

441
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,080
- What is it?
- I had diarrhea three times tonight.  I can't handle this anymore.

442
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,750
What's wrong with you?

443
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,820
Erxi has a serious case of diarrhea.

444
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,360
Let's hurry and take her to the infirmary.

445
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,330
But the school infirmary has a really bad reputation.

446
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:05,070
Then we'll go to the hospital.  Use your phone to call a cab. Tell them to wait by the front gate.

447
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll heat up some warm water for you to drink.

448
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,690
Check to see what we need to bring along.  Lie down for a bit.

449
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,320
What was it I ate that I shouldn't have?

450
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,480
How did I suddenly become like this?

451
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,930
It's okay. When you have acute gastroenteritis, it's easy to become dehydrated.

452
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,250
I'll get you some hot water later.  You should drink some.

453
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,320
- Here.
- Slowly. Careful.

454
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,580
Here, be careful.

455
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,260
You guys should go back.

456
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,930
The doctor said it's not a big thing.

457
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,620
I'll be fine after I get some sleep.

458
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,080
Don't worry about it.  We hope

459
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,990
you'll take care of us if we ever get acute gastroenteritis.

460
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,170
Don't think we're doing this for free.  You'll have to pay us back later.

461
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,680
You guys are so kind.

462
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,740
Our dorm is really great.

463
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,950
Of course.  Lie down.

464
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,100
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.

465
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,220
Are you awake? Are you feeling better?

466
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,980
Weiwei, the snacks from yesterday were bought by your Master. Right?

467
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,360
Yeah.

468
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,700
It's true that you shouldn't just eat anything from the Master.

469
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,700
It's not something a peasant like myself can digest.

470
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,730
Please.  We all ate the same thing but we're fine.

471
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,450
Don't blame everything on him. Tell me the truth.

472
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,310
Did you drink too much of Si Si's diet tea?

473
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,290
Weiwei, you are really good-looking.

474
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,740
No wonder you could get the Master.

475
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,280
What?  I relied on my internal attributes.

476
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,540
Internal attributes?

477
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,030
  It's 7:00 a.m. I should tell Master not to wait for me.  

478
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,070
Let me borrow your phone.

479
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,750
  The narcissistic side of me was discovered on the first day of dating.  

480
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,140
  I was just kidding.  

481
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,150
 What do I do?  I need to fix it quickly. 

482
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,530
Why is the Master here?

483
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,920
I called Da Zhong this morning when going to the bathroom.

484
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,230
He ran into Master on the stairs.

485
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,790
He ran his mouth and told him. Then he came to pick us up.

486
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,260
Why didn't you give us a heads up?

487
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,060
I was seen without brushing my teeth.

488
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,550
It was only 6:00 a.m. You were still sleeping.

489
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,850
Besides, who cares whether you brushed your teeth or not.

490
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,080
  I haven't brushed mine, either.  

491
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,120
I just feel that

492
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,360
it's not very appropriate for Master to give us a ride.

493
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,230
What's not good about it? Master is one of us.

494
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
  What do you mean by "one of us?"  

495
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,910
 Si Si, aren't you too quick to ingratiate yourself? 

496
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,850
But Master's car...

497
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,460
for us earthlings to...

498
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,210
Si Si is right.  He is one of us.

499
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,230
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

500
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,420
Let's go get something to eat first.

501
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,260
  Master is so considerate.  

502
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,620
  He actually came to my aid.  

503
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,980
It's fine. We've already troubled you enough.

504
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,010
No need to stand on ceremony.  We are all together.

505
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,980
 Of course, being considerate is so normal for him. 

506
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,810
Slowly, slowly.

507
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,020
Thank you, Senior, for treating us to breakfast.

508
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,340
Weiwei, we're going to take Erxi up.

509
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,140
Thank Senior for us well.

510
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,260
You need to show our gratitude for three minutes.

511
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,300
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

512
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,400
Do you need to get ready?

513
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,940
Get ready for what?

514
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,530
Didn't they say three minutes? Let's start now.

515
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,190
They're just kidding. Are you taking it seriously?

516
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,220
Oh. I accidentally took it seriously.

517
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,040
I'm going up as well. Bye-bye.

518
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,150
It smells so good.

519
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,890
Are you awake?  So it's food that has the right magic.

520
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,920
Waking people up so naturally.  Come to eat.

521
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,320
Hey, wait a minute.

522
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,290
Are you not sick?  Even with enough energy for shopping.

523
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,730
There are a lot of online sales of name brands with 70% discount online.  They start promptly at 10:00 a.m.

524
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,710
I don't have time to worry about whether I feel sick or not.  If I don't get the sale, I will feel even worse.

525
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,280
Even the healing rate of the roaches are not as fast as you, right?

526
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,900
So what if that's the case?  What do you know?

527
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,740
These special sales are the real medicine for my fast recovery.

528
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,710
Eh, that's right, Weiwei.  Come take a look.

529
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,910
Today, there are lots of posts of you and Xiao Nai on the school forum.

530
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,260
And also, pictures of you two holding hands at the basketball court yesterday!

531
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,950
Let me see.  Let me see.

532
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
See.

533
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,170
A lot of people didn't believe it.  But after the pictures were posted, they were all blown away.

534
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,500
Everyone is gossiping about when you two started dating.

535
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,780
I thought the post about the evaluation of the school beauty queen would surge to the top.

536
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,930
Why is it not here?

537
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,390
The people in our school are so gossipy, including you!

538
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,700
Hey, it's time for exams.  People become more gossipy during exam time.

539
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,740
This is what they call relief.

540
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,790
It's 10:00 a.m.  I have to hit the sales!

541
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,160
You guys, come take a look of this dress.  How is it?

542
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,250
Hurry.  Hurry.  I will miss the window.

543
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,510
Hey, not bad.  It's pretty cheap.

544
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,300
How about this one?

545
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,700
Hello.

546
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,470
Are you up?

547
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,350
 Yes. 

548
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,490
Still studying in a bit?

549
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,630
Want to go?

550
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,150
However, would there not be any seats left if we go now?

551
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,810
There is a place that is very quiet.  I will take you there.
