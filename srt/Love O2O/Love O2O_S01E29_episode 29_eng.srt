 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,550
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,570
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,600
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,750
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,550
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,510
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,420
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,040
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,700
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,790
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,870
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,170
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,900
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,010
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,960
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,330
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,150
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,220
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,340
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,310
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,230
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,080
   

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,970
   

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,510
 Coming, coming. 

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,100
Who is it?

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,540
K.O.? Why are you here?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,650
Came to get a favor.

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,350
Huh?

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,450
So messy?

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,610
I only moved in for one day,

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,930
and haven't had time to clean up.

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,900
How did you know I was living here?

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,700
Do you not have anything at all?

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,660
What are you doing?

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,180
Get dressed. We are going to the supermarket

38
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,390
to buy those items on the list.

39
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,650
Wok, frying pan, electric rice cooker,

40
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,070
spatula, electric... baking bell?

41
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,450
Griddle.

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,680
Soy sauce, corn oil, chicken essence.

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,130
Are you going to cook at my house?

44
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,690
Yeah.

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,060
If I go to the supermarket, what will you be doing?

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,210
Washing the vegetables.

47
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,100
What is an electric griddle?

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,790
Should I buy a wooden, aluminum or stainless steel spatula?

49
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,730
I will go with you.

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,440
New utensils need to be washed first. It may take some time.

51
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,660
Kill some time on your own.  Come out in two hours to eat.

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,540
This is too strange.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,700
Will he be gone after I wake up?

54
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,110
It smells great.

55
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,760
Steamed chicken wings with egg yolk,  sautéed hairy crabs,

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,570
poached fish filet.

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,680
stir-fried rice cake, spicy eggplant Szechuan style.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,970
They are my favorites.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,820
Wash your hands.

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,830
Does it taste good?

61
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,910
It's delicious.

62
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,350
K.O., you're too kind and amiable.
 (Note:  Usually said of a woman or wife) 

63
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,250
Who knew that the best hacker

64
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,650
used to be a chef?  This is legendary!

65
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,820
Compared to this, I suddenly feel I'm...

66
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,980
I suddenly feel rather inferior.

67
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,110
K.O.,

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,840
which college did you graduate from?

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,120
Nine years of mandatory education.
 (Note:  elementary school and middle school) 

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
Huh?

71
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,650
I lost my family when I was fourteen.

72
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,950
I had no money and was unable to continue my education.

73
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,550
Aren't you doing well now?

74
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,210
You are now even better than college students like us.

75
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,950
Although you lost to Third Brother,

76
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,130
but it wasn't due to skills. It's because you were noble.

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,420
I know.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,640
I was just being polite.

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,510
It feels so good. I'm so blessed.

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,560
I plan to stay here.

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,350
Huh?

82
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,370
I will cook, do the dishes, and mop the floor.

83
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,410
I will do the laundry, too.

84
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,610
I will do everything. Do you want me to live here?

85
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes.

86
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,440
The sun is pretty nice.

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,660
 - I will drive this.
- I will get on this one. 

88
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,540
 Okay. 

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,120
Brother Mei, we agreed that it would be a fair competition.

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,190
Aren't you great?   You opened the back door for K.O. directly.

91
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,880
He can cook, do the dishes, mop the floor, and wash the laundry. Can you?

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,670
I...

93
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,610
I have such precious hands. Of course, I can't do such rough chores.

94
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,680
Shut up if you can't. Get in the car. Let's set off now.

95
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,860
You can leave first. I'm going to pick up Weiwei.

96
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,360
Let's go together.

97
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,790
Junior Sister, get in the car.

98
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,770
Isn't this entourage too flamboyant?

99
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,780
They insisted on coming.

100
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,260
Had I known, I would have met you at the office instead.

101
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,140
This is attracting too much attention.

102
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,900
It can't be worse than being driven to school by your in-laws.

103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,010
You are right, but whose fault is that?

104
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,140
Put on your safety belt.

105
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,900
 ♫ You made me want to write a love song for you every day ♫ 

106
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,850
 ♫ Singing the most romantic chorus ♫ 
 ♫ And you will softly chime in ♫ 

107
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,970
 ♫ Your gaze is strengthening our choice ♫ 

108
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,630
 ♫ You turned our world into rosy pink ♫ 

109
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,260
 ♫ It's you who made me want to spend my life with you from now on ♫ 

110
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,090
 ♫ Love has to be chiseled with great care/I am Michelangelo ♫ 

111
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,950
 ♫ With my heart to carve out the happiest style ♫ 

112
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,480
 ♫ Use time to reminisce ♫ 

113
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,070
 ♫ The touch of sweetness in love ♫ 

114
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,610
 ♫ This wish won't change ♫ 

115
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,720
 ♫ Love is rather sweet ♫ 

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Slow down.

117
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,630
 ♫  To me, your little spur of tantrum ♫ 

118
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,940
 ♫ I don't know why my wound hasn't healed yet ♫ 

119
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,840
- Overtake him? 
- Yes.

120
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,320
 ♫ It was you who made me see a flower bloom in the 
arid desert ♫ 

121
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,090
 ♫ You made me want to write a love song for you every day ♫ 

122
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,970
 ♫ Singing the most romantic chorus ♫ 
 ♫ And you will softly chime in ♫ 

123
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,070
 ♫ Your gaze is strengthening our choice ♫ 

124
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,670
 ♫ You turned my world into rosy pink ♫ 

125
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,520
 ♫ It's you who made me want to spend my life with you from now on ♫ 

126
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,220
 ♫ Love has to be chiseled with great care/I am Michelangelo ♫ 

127
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,160
What's wrong? Did we run out of gas?

128
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,000
I suddenly realized that they only know the mountain we are going to,

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,660
but not exactly the location of the mountain.

130
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,430
Let them wait.

131
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,480
We might not have a lot of time alone for these two days.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,450
It's fine. It's fun to be with everyone.

133
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,820
What I meant is...

134
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,310
 ♫ You turned my world into rosy pink ♫ 

135
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,030
 ♫ It's you who made me want to spend my life with you from now on ♫ 

136
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,860
 ♫ Love has to be chiseled with great care/I am Michelangelo ♫ 

137
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,980
 ♫ With my heart to carve out the happiest style ♫ 

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Are they here yet? What's going on?

139
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,100
My calls are not getting through.

140
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Not getting through? Call again.

141
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,120
Come on.

142
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,140
 They are here. 

143
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,490
 Boss, you are finally here. 

144
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,020
What's wrong with you? You didn't answer my calls and you drove too slowly.

145
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,050
Junior Sister Weiwei, what's wrong with you? Why is your face so red?

146
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,610
There was no signal just now.

147
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,100
Let's go.

148
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,950
- Let's go.
-  Go. 

149
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,950
 Let's go. 

150
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,480
Wow, the air is so fresh here.

151
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,400
There's a big swimming pool here.

152
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,740
Third Brother, when did you find such a nice place?

153
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,160
I discovered this by accident.

154
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,670
Weiwei gets to choose her room first.

155
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,560
You can pick from the rest yourselves.

156
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,770
Okay.

157
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,630
I'm telling you first. I'm getting the room facing the pool.

158
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,860
Don't fight with me.

159
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,480
Hey, how can you do this?

160
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,090
Senior Brother K.O. and the rest are swimming. Aren't you going to take a look?

161
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,590
Who told you that those who grew up by the sea know how to swim?

162
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,910
I only know how to eat fish.

163
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,490
- Okay. 
 - It's done. That's it.

164
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,980
Let's go to watch them swim.

165
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,090
Are you forcing me to go?

166
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay, let's go. I'm forcing you to go.

167
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,980
Let's go to the pool.

168
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,840
Let's go.

169
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,730
What's the point of just swimming back and forth?

170
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,760
Have a race.

171
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,370
Let the two of them race. What do you think?

172
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,650
 Okay. 

173
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,660
Don't blame me for not reminding you of this.

174
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,040
Third Brother was an inter-collegiate champion.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,160
Do you know that there is always someone better, and another mountain higher?

176
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,640
Look at his build. One look and you can tell that he was a born champion.

177
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,200
Build?

178
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Brother Mei, you have sharp eyes indeed.

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,790
Of course.

180
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,560
Brother Mr. Beauty,

181
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,920
why are you so happy when someone praises K.O.?

182
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's race.

183
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,240
- Fine. 
- One, two...

184
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,950
Come on.  Come on.  Place your bet.

185
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,000
- I will bet on Master. 
- I will bet on K.O.

186
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,410
I will be the referee.

187
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,820
Okay, let's do it.

188
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,640
Are you ready?

189
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Ready...

190
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,410
Start!

191
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,670
 One, two, three. Give me some.  

192
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,070
Xiao Nai, do your best!

193
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,600
Do your best! Master, do your best!

194
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Master, do your best!

195
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
-  Do your best!
- Speed up! 

196
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,190
 K.O., speed up! 

197
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,420
 Do your best! Master, do your best! 

198
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,740
 Quick! 

199
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,650
 Hurry up! 

200
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,460
 Do your best! 

201
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,780
 Do your best! 

202
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,400
 Do your best! 

203
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,560
Yeah!

204
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,630
I announce that Third Brother is the winner of this round.

205
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,990
Brother Mr. Beauty, I won!

206
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,970
This doesn't count. One more round.

207
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,300
One more round and we will definitely win.

208
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,260
Again?

209
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,670
One more round.

210
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,500
If I don't win, I won't be in the mood to barbecue.

211
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,790
Okay.

212
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,740
Ready...

213
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,880
Start!

214
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,910
- Quick. 
- Hey, Junior Sister.

215
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,970
You had the first choice. It's my turn now.

216
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,960
I choose Third Brother.

217
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,170
I can only choose K.O. then.

218
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,130
You chose K.O.?

219
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,460
Quick!

220
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,760
Do your best!

221
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,010
Quick!

222
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,300
I announce that K.O. is the winner.

223
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,370
 It was a close win. 

224
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,600
Hey, I won again.

225
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,930
Did you not bet on me?

226
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,250
I wanted to but Brother Mr. Beauty chose you first.

227
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,950
I could only bet on K.O. then.

228
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,340
Third Brother, did you let him win?

229
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,030
K.O. said he would only be in the mood to barbecue if he wins.

230
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,230
Is he mad?

231
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,930
Yes, you didn't have faith in him.

232
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,900
Go and console him. What if he doesn't want to barbecue for us?

233
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,050
Go now.

234
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,180
Leave this to me.

235
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,060
K.O.!

236
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,350
You are not bad at barbecuing.

237
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,190
Here.

238
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,300
The fish is done. It's here.

239
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,230
- Fish! Fish! 
- Hungry pack of wolves.

240
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,380
I think it's a waste for K.O. to be a programmer.

241
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,670
He should start his own barbecue restaurant.

242
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,360
- His prospects will be much better. 
- That's right.

243
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,040
That's right. Senior Brother K.O., you should go back to your original profession.

244
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,740
He can't.

245
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,230
Boss, aren't you letting him go?

246
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,820
It's too much of a hassle to dine out. We can install a kitchen in our company.

247
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,660
Third Brother, you are really heartless.

248
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,400
This is known as getting the cake and eating it, too.

249
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,220
Brother Mei, the others eat what's in their own bowl while checking what's in the wok.
 (Note: Note:  Idiom to suggest greed of always wanting more) 

250
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,960
Are you going to eat the chef instead?

251
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,640
It's the drumstick. I'm watching my drumstick.

252
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,540
K.O., you are too slow in barbecuing.

253
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,600
It's here.

254
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,130
It's mine.

255
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,310
- Mine. 
- Mine.

256
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,040
My drumstick, my drumstick!  I had my eye on it for a long time.

257
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,230
Give it back to me.  It's my drumstick.

258
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,120
Protect this. This drumstick has the family name Xiao.

259
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Xiao Bei Drumstick.

260
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Not bad. What a nice drumstick!

261
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,040
You are all bad guys!

262
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,970
I'm so brawny yet can't even get a drumstick.

263
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,690
When you guys see food, does your strength just go off the charts?

264
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,170
K.O., you're cooking too slowly and you guys are so disorderly.

265
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,080
I suggest that we implement a rule to distribute the food.

266
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,820
Why don't we rely on our skill

267
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,740
of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors? Whoever wins gets to eat first.

268
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,530
Is this called a skill? That's called luck.

269
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,330
Furthermore, the game is so fast. Even if we play a hundred times,

270
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,800
not even a single drumstick will be ready.

271
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,440
That's right. I have a suggestion.

272
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,400
I think we can PK in "A Chinese Ghost Story."

273
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,590
Everyone has a username, right? Whoever wins, gets to eat first.

274
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,490
This is real skill now, right?

275
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,640
Gaming nerd. Why don't you fight me in person?

276
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,470
How can we have this? Third Sister-in-Law is here.

277
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,740
Look at her gluttonous face.

278
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,200
Will she be happy if we don't include her?

279
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,180
I support your suggestion. I want to be on the same team as Master.

280
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,320
You just reminded me. Third Brother can't be in the game

281
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,880
or all the drumsticks will go to him.

282
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,060
That's right. I agree, too.

283
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,090
What will I eat then?

284
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,160
You can let her win it for you.

285
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,220
It's agreed then. Let's get your laptops.

286
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,030
We are on different servers. How can we play?

287
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,070
Let's do this. Use my server to play.

288
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,540
And use my username.

289
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,330
I will keep score. We will take turns to PK.

290
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,720
I want to use Master's username.

291
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,960
Okay, Third Sister-in-Law. Do you really want to use an account you are unfamiliar with?

292
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,510
Hell didn't send the invitation but you want to barge in.  You are just seeking your own doom.

293
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,200
We haven't played yet. How do you know I will lose?

294
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,980
Bring it on.

295
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
One drumstick.

296
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,990
One more time. I will be your strategist.

297
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,360
You will be her strategist? I'm not playing then.

298
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,420
As soon as Master moves his mouth, you are too scared to play?

299
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,620
Yugong, you are exposed with one look.

300
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,880
So embarrassing, Yugong. Are you a man?

301
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,210
Shut up. Bring it on.

302
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,810
Come.

303
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,060
- Still Storm Wave, Sow Confusion Robe, Fluid Cloud Move.
-  Let me see. 

304
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,970
Jump onto the dueling stand.  Replenish Health Melody.

305
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,180
Quiet Fox Mutation.

306
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,000
Whoa!

307
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,520
Weiwei, you can actually keep up with Brother Xiao's speed!

308
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,170
Someone's going to be done soon.

309
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,190
Slow. Yellow Crane Spiral Jade Tree.

310
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,160
Yu Banshan,

311
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,600
deduct a drumstick.

312
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,390
- Did you deduct a drumstick?
- Of course,

313
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,200
you lost to two people.

314
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,260
Bastard, I'm going to beat you to death! Deduct a drumstick?

315
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,880
Third Sister-in-Law, let me borrow your account. I haven't played your character.

316
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,100
Okay, give me a minute. Let me log out.

317
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,710
Okay.

318
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,950
Are you done, Third Sister-in-Law?

319
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,370
Wait a moment. Let me read this message.

320
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,830
Okay.

321
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,070
 Luwei Weiwei, you must find it strange to receive this message. 

322
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,260
 Frankly, I didn't expect that 

323
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:50,380
 before I leave "The Chinese Ghost Story," my farewell message would be for you. 

324
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,910
 You don't need to be bothered by this.  I'm merely biding farewell. 

325
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,710
 There's no other intention. 

326
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,990
 There are certain things that have been weighing on my mind. I didn't know who to tell you. 

327
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,670
 Just pretend I'm talking to a hollow tree. 

328
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,540
 I, Zhen Shaoxiang, have always been drifting alone without a purpose. 

329
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,190
 I never did anything with seriousness. 

330
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,570
  This time, I was provoked 

331
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,950
 before I decided to get into game development. 

332
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,640
 I didn't expect that it would turn into a real interest. 

333
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,610
 Although I have few qualifications and am inexperienced, 

334
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,030
  I did my best. Frankly. I was prepared to lose. 

335
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,230
 I just didn't realize that I would lose so disgracefully. 

336
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,300
 If I were to say that I wasn't aware of those unethical tactics, 

337
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,230
 I wonder whether you would believe me. 

338
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,220
 Even so, I still feel very ashamed. 

339
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,880
 Xiao Nai must look down on me very much now. 

340
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,550
 No matter what, if I was truly that capable, 

341
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,200
 my father wouldn't have used such unethical tactics. 

342
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,610
 I have been playing this game for many years. 

343
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,030
 I feel that I can't stay here anymore. 

344
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,670
 Every time when I log in to play, it seems to remind me of this disgraceful experience. 

345
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,480
 Hence, I plan to study diligently to really learn something. 

346
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,340
 Perhaps, I need to thank you and Xiao Nai for this. 

347
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,560
 Lastly, please relay to Xiao Nai that 

348
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,170
 one day, I will develop a game that's better than his. 

349
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,790
 Best of luck. 

350
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,030
 I look forward to it. Xiao Nai. 

351
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,260
 Are you finished yet, Third Sister-in-Law?  I've waited so long that flowers are wilting. 

352
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm done. You can use it.

353
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
Okay.

354
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,980
- Who's going to fight me for K.O.'s chicken legs?
 - I will. 

355
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,280
You?

356
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,750
 Bring it on. 

357
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,410
Okay, I'm going to announce the results of the competition.

358
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,010
Junior Sister Weiwei, three drumsticks and ten lamb skewers.

359
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,200
Applause!

360
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,700
- Come. Let's eat together. 
- Hao Mei,

361
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,290
a pair of chicken wings.

362
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,770
Yu Banshan, not a single one!

363
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,300
He owes one drumstick.

364
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,180
So unfair. I didn't get to eat anything at all.

365
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,990
Can you give me one?

366
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,080
We are going for a walk.

367
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,060
Third Brother, I haven't even eaten and you are going on a date?

368
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,830
If we stay here, you will starve for the whole night.

369
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,110
Here.

370
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,050
This is like the Dusk Glow Peak in the game.

371
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,470
That's why I brought you here to have a look.

372
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,530
I suddenly remember this.

373
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,850
When we release "A New Chinese Ghost Story,"

374
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,670
will there be fewer players in "A Chinese Ghost Story"

375
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,650
and eventually, the game will cease to operate?

376
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,020
It won't happen. It should continue to remain active.

377
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,990
But "A New Chinese Ghost Story" will take away many players.

378
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,880
If there are less and less players in "A Chinese Ghost Story," Feng Teng will shut down their server.

379
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,980
No matter how great a new game is, it will never replace the original game completely.

380
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,440
Not everyone will leave.

381
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,310
Also, I remember,

382
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,810
Feng Teng promised that it will stay operating forever.

383
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,830
That's what they said.

384
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,670
In the past, there were cases where they claimed to operate forever,

385
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,020
but ultimately, they shut down the game.

386
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,210
I can't guarantee it for a very long period,

387
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,800
but it will probably last until our children will be playing it.

388
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,730
That shouldn't be a problem.

389
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,440
Children?

390
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,870
That's right.

391
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,210
At least, I'll take them to Vermilion Sparrow Bridge

392
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,160
and tell them

393
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,530
what our first words were.

394
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,350
 Brother Yixiao Naihe, did you call out to me? 

395
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,350
 Couple up with me. 

396
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,730
 Okay, let's join up.  We'll go to the Stone of Three Lives together. 

397
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,360
 Logically, you should have been the one to deal with this matter, 

398
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,290
 but there were too many people paying attention to this. 

399
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,620
 I thought it would be best to settle it quickly. 

400
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,350
 Yup! Then we'll journey this world together 

401
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,050
 as a rogue couple. 

402
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,360
 Rogue couple? I remember we had an official wedding ceremony. 

403
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,430
 Senior Xiao, what a coincidence! 

404
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,300
 It isn't a coincidence. I have been waiting for you. 

405
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,290
I suddenly feel that the problem that has been troubling me

406
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,240
is no longer important.

407
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,940
Even if they shut down the game one day,

408
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,870
the scenery that we saw together, the things we did together,

409
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,000
those memories wouldn't disappear when the data is gone.

410
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,160
I will always keep them in my heart.

411
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,960
What about you?

412
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,740
My ability to remember things will definitely be better than yours.

413
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,200
   

414
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,780
Greetings to our audience in front of the TV! We have a special guest with us today.

415
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,280
He may not be familiar to our regular viewers.

416
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,490
Recently, he is the man under the spotlight in the gaming industry.

417
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,940
He is the chief project director of "A New Chinese Ghost Story,"

418
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,750
Xiao Nai. Let's welcome him.

419
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,870
Hello, everyone.

420
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,710
Let's congratulate you first for winning the international grand prizes for mobile and computer games.

421
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,280
For these two games, other than the positive buzz from word of mouth,

422
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,270
commercial success has also been noteworthy.

423
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,560
I just saw the latest figures

424
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,370
showing that your mobile game has a monthly revenue of twenty million.

425
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,780
This sales figure is very rare for mobile games.

426
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,030
Furthermore, the number of players on the computer game has also broken the record.

427
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,140
When you were developing these two games, did you think that they would be such an amazing success?

428
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,810
When our team was developing these two games,

429
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,390
we were still students in college.

430
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,050
At that time, the mobile game and computer game weren't as popular as today.

431
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,490
Thus, we never thought about

432
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,050
how to achieve commercial success.

433
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,880
We merely wanted to express our own ideas for the game.

434
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
This is really great.

435
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,600
A mobile and a computer game

436
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,980
vaulted your company to become the most valuable investment in the gaming industry.

437
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,630
We heard that Feng Teng is thinking of acquiring Zhi Yi Technology.  Is this true?

438
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,650
We have some collaborations with Feng Teng on some products.

439
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,420
There is no restriction on the aspect of capital investment.

440
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,310
 Let's talk about something off topic. 

441
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,950
 It's said that there is a tradition to roast the game designer, 

442
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,290
 but because you are particularly good looking, 

443
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,320
  the players only throw compliments at you instead of scolding. 

444
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,090
 Did you hear about this? 

445
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,450
  Of course, I feel that our game is interesting, 

446
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,730
 so everyone has gone easy on me. 

447
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,290
 But I would like to remind everyone that "A New Chinese Ghost Story" 

448
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,610
is a product resulted from the collaboration between us and Feng Teng Group.

449
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,710
 The President's name of Feng Teng is Feng Teng, very easy to remember. 

450
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,130
 So is this a ploy of redirecting?  I must say well done. 

451
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,470
 Other than "A New Chinese Ghost Story," 

452
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,820
 will you be developing any new games? 

453
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,500
 For now, we don't have any plan to develop new games. 

454
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,020
 The future direction for Zhi Yi Technology is network security next. 

455
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,880
Master is so handsome that it can last a thousand years.

456
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,460
I feel that he's the most handsome man in the world now.

457
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,350
Suddenly, I don't feel like sharing him with others.  What should I do?

458
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,760
If it's not an issue for Weiwei, why would it be for you?

459
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,850
Who said I want to share?

460
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,470
Let me watch. Don't be so petty.

461
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,580
You only know to block us.

462
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,550
If you don't want others to stare at your Master, stop him from accepting interviews.

463
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,500
Before, during the press conference for the mobile game "Wandering Journey in Jianghu,"

464
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,600
he had already been exposed.  It's no use stopping him.

465
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,460
Don't tell me you even thought about it? You are so petty.

466
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,660
 It's also said that this game is very popular with women. 

467
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,390
However, all the staff in your company are male.

468
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,210
How did you manage to develop a game that women love?

469
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,160
The information is not accurate.

470
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,750
My fiancée is also on our team.

471
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,180
Fiancée? Hurry up and tell us! What have you been hiding from us?

472
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,720
When did you suddenly become his fiancée?

473
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,790
- I don't know either. 
- Stop lying.

474
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,130
Did Master propose to you?

475
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,980
He didn't.

476
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,130
Wait. Could it be...

477
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,380
 When I graduate, will I be working in your company? 

478
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,310
 If not, what else? 

479
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,520
 I interned at your company for already two summers. 

480
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,450
 I haven't received any salary at all. 

481
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,870
 Oh? 

482
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,470
 What do you mean by "oh"? 

483
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,030
 It means there is no money for you, 

484
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,350
 but if you want someone, there is one. 

485
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,240
Does this... this even count?

486
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,270
Your Master is really something.  You were his girlfriend before you even met.

487
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,250
He hasn't proposed and you are already his fiance.

488
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,980
He is always so

489
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,740
devious.

490
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,660
Weiwei, it's not that I worry about you.

491
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,160
In a battle of wits, there is no way you can beat your Master.

492
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,610
In a physical fight, you definitely can't win over him.

493
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,030
What will you do about your future position in the family?

494
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,140
Master and I don't fight.

495
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,710
So stupid.

496
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,330
Am I talking about that kind of fighting?

497
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,240
Erxi, are you done putting on your gown? I'm not going to wait for you anymore.

498
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,810
 Wait. I will be done after powdering my nose. 

499
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,390
- Hurry up, Erxi.
- Hurry.

500
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,770
Tada! How about it?

501
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,530
Do I look sexy?

502
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,330
Weiwei, I don't want to take my graduation photos with her.

503
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,890
Everything's fine. The photographer won't let her off like this.

504
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,900
Don't you have any taste? Isn't this really pretty?

505
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,830
Come, everyone. Gather here.

506
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,850
The teachers can sit down first.

507
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,930
 My cap is crooked. 

508
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,970
That tallest guy in the middle... You!

509
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,020
Yes, it's you. Move to the end.

510
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,410
Okay.

511
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,310
That girl in the colored dress. Cover your outfit.

512
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,900
Okay.

513
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,950
Can't I have a different kind of youth?

514
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,110
Come on. Get ready.

515
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:54,020
3... 2...1!

516
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,200
Where are you looking? Look over here.

517
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,590
Why are you looking over there?

518
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,570
Hey, good looking guy. Go behind the tree.

519
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,580
Look here.

520
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,230
3... 2...1!

521
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,620
 Okay, let's have a second shot. Make it a funny shot. 

522
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,130
Get ready. 3... 2...1!

523
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,800
Excellent. For the third shot, throw your caps in the air.

524
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,390
Get ready. 3... 2...1!

525
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,340
Weiwei, tell Master to come here. I want a photo with him.

526
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,430
It's fiancé.

527
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,530
Remember to call Da Zhong over.

528
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,680
Get my cap for me.

529
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,120
 Get my cap for me. 

530
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,690
- How is it? 
- You are here.

531
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,670
Happy Graduation.

532
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,170
It's so nauseating.

533
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,410
Here is the shiny Mr. Xiao.

534
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,310
My roommates want to take a photo with you.

535
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,630
I wonder if you are okay with this.

536
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,550
A photo? I need to check with my girlfriend.

537
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,220
Isn't it fiancée?

538
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:23,040
Apologies. My mistake. I need to ask my fiancée to see whether she agrees.

539
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,500
Okay, let's take the photo.

540
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,620
 Let's take pictures for the two of you. 

541
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,050
Master is here. I want a photo with you.

542
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,860
Weiwei, hurry up. We want one, too.

543
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,330
Come. 1... 2... 3!

544
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,530
It's done. Who's next?

545
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,520
Da Zhong, take for us.

546
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,800
The four of us. Hurry.

547
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,680
Get ready.

548
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,840
1... 2... 3!

549
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,310
Help me to take one.

550
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,310
All of them are so heartless.

551
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,770
I only took 200 photos and they lost patience already.

552
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,430
I will take a selfie.

553
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,560
 C'est le charme de...
(Note: speaking French: "It's the charm of...") 

554
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,450
 ...ici, en Chine.
(Note: speaking French: "...here, in China.") 

555
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,130
J'ai été diplômé ici.
 (Note: speaking French: "I graduated here.") 

556
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,230
I should find someone to take it for me.

557
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,380
Please, this way.

558
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,630
Hey, schoolmate. Help me with the photo. Okay?

559
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,470
Voici une fille mignonne là-bas.
 (Note: speaking in French: "There is a cute girl there.") 

560
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,490
This is my friend. Please give me a minute.

561
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,220
This schoolmate whom I don't know, could you come down, please?

562
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,920
Don't ruin the image of our school.

563
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,690
What do you mean by ruining the image of the school?

564
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,020
What's wrong with my taking some graduation photos?

565
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,330
So you dressed up like somebody today.

566
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,430
How could you talk in this manner?

567
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,140
Our distinguished scholar of the Foreign Language Department

568
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,650
is acting as a tour guide for the foreigners?

569
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,630
Tour guide?

570
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,960
I'm accompanying a foreign business delegation visiting China.

571
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,520
So, you are not even a tour guide. You are just an attendant!

572
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,170
Hello. Nice to meet you.

573
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,420
I'm Zhao "Two" Xi. ("Er" of Erxi, is two in Chinese)

574
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,330
Hello, nice to meet you, too.

575
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,460
You are such a lovely girl.

576
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,750
Thank you. Thank you.

577
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,250
Did you hear that? She's complimenting me as a lovely girl.

578
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,450
I don't need you to help me with the photos anymore.

579
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,720
You, with your narrow little mind,

580
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,870
can't really capture one-tenth of my beauty.

581
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,570
Two Xi Zhao, be careful.

582
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,140
Who are you telling to be careful? You should be careful instead.

583
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,440
So romantic!

584
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,920
♫  Delivering it to your hands to quench your thirst  ♫

585
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,340
 Where did that stupid Erxi go? 

586
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,420
What's going on? That guy who's holding Erxi looks so familiar.

587
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,500
Are you stupid? It's Cao Guang, the top student from the Foreign Language  Department.

588
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,900
I heard he's working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now.

589
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,730
♫  We'd already agreed to spend next weekend together  ♫

590
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,320
 ♫  To me, your little spur of tantrum ♫ 

591
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,650
He's great. He could even hold Erxi like this.

592
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,540
He has a chance.

593
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,060
Weiwei, come and take a look now.

594
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,180
Quick.

595
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,900
Should we rescue her?

596
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,450
Are you stupid?

597
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,270
Can't you feel the lovey-dovey atmosphere between Erxi and Cao Guang?

598
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,130
It's the classic scene for budding love in a romantic drama.

599

 ♫ With my heart to carve out the happiest style ♫

00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,980
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

633
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,350
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

634
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,120
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

635
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,680
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

636
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,310
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

637
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,680
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

638
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,290
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

639
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,820
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

640
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:55,560
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫
