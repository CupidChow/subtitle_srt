 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,530
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,620
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,570
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,670
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,420
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,390
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,530
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,060
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,760
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,770
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,600
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,830
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,650
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,910
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,150
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,960
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,330
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,110
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,270
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,350
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,460
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,360
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,190
   

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,130
     

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,650
- Erxi!
-  Weiwei! 

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,070
Let me take it.

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,070
How are you? It's pretty heavy!

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,380
I missed you so much!

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,940
You're knocking me over.

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,180
You are calling me fat as soon as you see me!

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,060
Let God be my witness. When did I mention the word "fat?"

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,690
You said I'm heavy enough to knock you over. Isn't that calling me fat?

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,740
Ma'am, your comprehension ability has exceeded that of a normal human being.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,220
See! You just called me "ma'am".

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,490
And I even brought special snacks all the way here just for you!

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,750
Well, then, I'll have to eat yours, too.

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,730
Erxi? Erxi! Erxi, where are you? Erxi?

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,170
What's wrong?

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,540
Why are you so skinny that I can't even see you?

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,600
Your acting is so over-the-top!

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,250
Hurry and take me to Xiao Liang's place. It's too hot. I want iced orange juice.

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,310
- Hand over the special food for the exchange.
- Fine... You're too much!

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,970
- That's more like it! Let's go! 
- Come on!

45
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,480
You lost weight!

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,740
You said that I almost knocked you over.

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,390
Be careful! It's heavy.

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,560
Come on in.

49
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,700
Wow! Xiao Ling really is a rich girl.

50
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,560
This is basically a mansion!

51
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,050
This room is really nice.

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,090
The view outside is nice, too!

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,570
And it has its own bathroom.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,930
Weiwei, what should I do? I feel like running into a sugar mama for myself.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,960
Is Master calling?

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,270
It's your sugar mama calling.

57
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,720
Hi, Xiao Ling. I picked up Erxi.

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,350
Xiao Ling, Xiao Ling... I love you even more now! I want to marry you!

59
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,800
 - Get lost! I'm a normal girl, okay? 

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,880
For you, I can turn into a boy.

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,450
 Ew! Just give the phone to Weiwei.  

62
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,800
 I don't want to talk to you. 

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,970
What is it, Xiao Liang? Okay. Don't you worry.

64
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,420
Weiwei, which room am I staying in?

65
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,300
This room is mine. The other one is yours.

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,170
You came in here first and left me the bigger room?

67
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,890
If you don't want it, we can switch.

68
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,570
I took a look. The window looks out into a garden.

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,930
And there's a swimming pool with a cute guy swimming.

70
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,380
Don't tell anyone that you know me.

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,030
Can't I enjoy some eye candy?

72
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,870
Weiwei, before I got here, did Master come over?

73
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,830
He must have! A lonely guy and a lonesome girl stayed in the same room together all by yourselves.

74
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,420
Bei Weiwei, you went over the line!

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,600
It's late. I'm going back to work. Put your stuff back by yourself.

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,970
You run off as soon as I ask a critical question.

77
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,190
Bye-bye!

78
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,120
Oh, Master cleaned the kitchen and wiped down the kitchenware.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,350
You might have the runs if you use it.

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,930
I knew Master was here!

81
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,090
Xiao Ling's apartment has so many cute guys!

82
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,620
 Hello, Cao Guang. 

83
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,690
Do you have money, Zhao Erxi?

84
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,190
You're the scholar of the Foreign Languages Department,

85
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,880
yet you keep mentioning money. How vulgar are you?

86
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,020
You're a young girl who doesn't repay her debts at all.

87
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,490
You're not vulgar at all.

88
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,260
  Who says I won't repay? I'm calling you, am I not? 

89
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,340
I'll pay you two grand for now.

90
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,470
The rest will be paid by the installment date.

91
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,140
Are you going to take three years to repay the five grand?

92
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,570
Inflation is crazy now. How should I calculate the interest?

93
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,700
Do you still have a heart? We're schoolmates after all.

94
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,840
Are you going to get rich by being a loan shark?

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,430
Two grand is half my living expenses for the next semester.

96
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,090
Then, why don't you work off the debt?

97
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,890
Work off the debt?

98
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,460
Take down my address. Come over in an hour, or suffer the consequences.

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,400
Pick up a few things for me on the way.

100
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,060
Wait a second! Let me... write it down.

101
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,160
Fifteen minutes late. I'll dock your pay. Come in.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,000
Why? You asked me to pick up things, and your list was super long.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,760
I got here so soon because I'm a fast runner. Not even Flash is as fast as me!

104
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,330
You're still late if you stay outside.

105
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,560
Put the bag over there.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,490
You live in such a big place by yourself? You must be rich.

107
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,500
Erxi, will you please be more demure? Have some class.

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
If it were...

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,110
I'm naturally free-spirited, wild and boar-like. What's wrong about that?

110
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,910
Wait. You were saying... If it were who? Was it Weiwei?

111
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,270
Don't jump into conclusions. To me, Bei Weiwei is worse than you.

112
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,390
Cao Guang, I'm warning you. You can insult me,

113
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,490
but I'll fight you if you insult my friend Weiwei.

114
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,490
Can't you show some maturity like a grown man?

115
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,070
So what if she rejected you?

116
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,620
Must you hold a grudge till this day?

117
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,650
I didn't know she was so two-faced.

118
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,390
If she betrayed you one day, don't say I didn't warn you.

119
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,190
I told you already, yet you still go on–

120
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,180
Coffee,  you are awake?

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,170
Coffee? Where did you find su-such ...a cute thing?

122
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,650
It doesn't bite, does it?

123
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,710
It depends on his mood.

124
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,270
Don't tell me... you're afraid of a little cat?

125
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,540
I'm warning you!

126
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,260
If you come any closer, I'll jump off the building!

127
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,660
If that's the case, I wouldn't feel comfortable to leave Coffee in your care.

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,370
Just pay me back my three grand.

129
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,230
What do you mean? Do you want me to take care of it instead of paying off the debt?

130
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,030
That's right. I might go out of town for a while.

131
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,480
I want you to take care of Coffee.

132
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,380
A hundred bucks a day. But now it seems...

133
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,970
Wait!

134
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,790
What is it?

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,490
Upon some closer inspection,

136
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,770
this cat seems a bit different from other mean cats out there.

137
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,200
There is a hint of goofiness in its sparkling eyes, very much like me.

138
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,530
Fate has brought us together.

139
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,580
Kitty, you do like me. Don't you?

140
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,160
Since you are so sincere,

141
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,490
I'll test you to find out if you can take good care of my Coffee.

142
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,780
Do I need to be tested?

143
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,080
Of course! Do you think it's easy to take care of a cat?

144
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,370
Clean the litter box in the morning and night everyday.  Replenish water when needed for its three meals each day.

145
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,070
A bath every three days

146
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,940
and you must completely blow-dry its hair.

147
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,480
If he rubs against you, you have to play with it for a while.

148
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,900
Its toys are all in that box.

149
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,140
You have a better life than me. I don't have toys.

150
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,820
I'll be here for a few more days. I'll show you how it's done.

151
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's start with the basics.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes, sir. What's number one?

153
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,090
Scoop up the cat poop.

154
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,840
It stinks!

155
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,830
Don't you smell it?

156
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,620
I've gotten used to it.

157
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,050
How?

158
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,660
It's easy. Ty to breathe through your mouth.

159
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,150
Don't you know that when doing it this way

160
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,700
there seems to be a hint of sweetness in the aroma?

161
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,230
Okay... General Clearing Poop, you shall start!

162
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,960
Take aim before you start.

163
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,150
- Shake it a bit. Shake it.  Shake the clean stuff off.
- How do I shake it?

164
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,710
Like this.

165
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,200
Why do I feel that it's getting more and more smelly?

166
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,580
Stop laughing! Where's the toilet?

167
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,550
Straight ahead!  Over there!

168
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,700
When you're done, don't forget to come back and put in fresh litter.

169
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,350
 ♫ Do you want to be my love? ♫ 

170
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm leaving.

171
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,450
You're making a quick escape?

172
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,180
Heck with your escape!

173
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,220
I'm reporting to the company for my internship today and I'm running out of time.

174
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,040
Besides, you're not leaving tomorrow.  You can teach me next time.

175
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
Bye-bye.

176
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,210
Senior Ah Shuang,

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,630
- were you asking for me?
- Yeah, yeah.

178
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,360
The boss of the final stage on the m-mobile game

179
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,980
h-hasn't been tested on the drop test yet.

180
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,170
- You-You can use the computer simulation.
- Okay.

181
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,180
The rate for drop test is one in ten thousand.

182
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,540
So you should know that you'll have to do it tens of thousands of times

183
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,910
in order to get accurate figures.

184
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,530
Tell me after you-you calculate the probability. Go ahead.

185
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,140
All right.

186
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,500
Senior Ah Shuang!

187
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,870
I would like to ask if there is an issue with the report I wrote previously.

188
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,360
No issue.

189
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,380
Then can I understand it to mean that I have not caused more chaos for you?

190
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,620
- What do you think?
- No problem. Go ahead with it.

191
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,050
Poor you.

192
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,900
He didn't try to bully you again, right?

193
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,450
It's fine.

194
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,050
Tens of thousands of times? Then when will I be able to finish it?

195
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,790
 I've beaten this kind of boss in "A Chinese Ghost Story" many times. 

196
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,760
 Its advantage is high health points. 

197
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,230
 If you don't defeat it in a certain amount of time, 

198
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,950
 it'll go into berserk mode. 

199
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,490
I can design a background applet

200
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,920
to make the computer do it in my place.

201
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,320
Didn't I ask you to do the drop test?

202
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,890
What are you looking at? Don't think that because the report doesn't have an issue,

203
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,560
that you can do things with disregard.

204
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,270
Senior Ah Shuang,  I want to make a background applet to let the computer do it.

205
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,070
Things can then be done more quickly.  Look.

206
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,950
Wh-Wh-Who said you could use a program?

207
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,150
You girls just know how to be lazy.

208
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,430
Hello, may I ask where the interns should go for reporting?

209
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,600
- What is your name? 
- Zhao Erxi.

210
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,830
It's the HR Department. You will have to be fast.

211
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,730
Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,160
   

213
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,800
Good morning, Manager Zhen.

214
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,250
Your makeup is nicely done today.

215
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,690
 Luwei Weiwei, you clearly didn't figure that Zhenshui Wuxiang 

216
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,290
 would actually be your supervisor. 

217
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,220
Sister Beibei, big news!  Big news!

218
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm in the Development Department.

219
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,510
- I am too.
- You both are?  I am too!

220
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,640
We will be colleagues in the future then.

221
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,380
- We'll watch out for each other.
- What are you talking about?  Hurry and report to your unit.

222
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,110
- Oh.
- Oh.

223
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,100
 There are already a lot of assistants to the programmers. 

224
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,720
 Don't tell me that I have been assigned to some ridiculous place? 

225
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,430
Here, this is yours.

226
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Sister, what does the General Affairs Department do?

227
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,010
Wait a minute. I'll bring you there.

228
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,810
From now on, the seat near the window is yours.

229
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,350
The light and air conditioning are very good. It's easy to get in and out, too.

230
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,560
Sister, what will I be doing in the future?

231
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,150
About your job?  Your manager will tell you.

232
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,230
- Is that true? Thank you. Thank you. 
- You are welcome.

233
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,700
Sister!

234
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,630
May I ask what my salary is?

235
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,970
Your pay is ¥150.

236
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,460
¥150?

237
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,470
¥150 per day?

238
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,080
That's the highest salary we give to our best interns.

239
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,370
- I... 
- If you need anything, come and see me.

240
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,330
This company is really nice.

241
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,100
Even a little intern like me is treated so well.

242
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,170
The pay is ¥150 a day.

243
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,440
Plus ¥100 Cao Guang is giving me every day...

244
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,100
that's ¥250!

245
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,550
A day.

246
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,620
Hello,  do you need me to help you with anything?

247
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,310
No, no.  You can just sit.

248
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,460
This ¥150 a day is really great.

249
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,260
Sister Beibei.

250
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,380
What's going on with that new intern?

251
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,720
The General Affairs Department is so busy everyday

252
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,140
and all she does is sit and play with her phone.  What's that all about?

253
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,700
Are you talking about her?  She must have a special connection with the Young Master.

254
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,770
No way! With her stupid looks?

255
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,870
But she was the one whose resume the Young Master picked out.

256
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,640
When she came here today, she even made eyes at the Young Master.

257
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,260
Really?

258
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,470
Otherwise, do you think I'd be willing to do all this for her?

259
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,590
Young Master certainly has a unique taste.

260
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,060
What's her name?

261
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,600
Zhao Erxi.  So boorish!

262
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,440
I am done eating. I am going back now.

263
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,320
How did you get so wet?

264
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,090
When I left for lunch, it wasn't raining, so I didn't take my umbrella.

265
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,520
Didn't you know there was a thunderstorm today?  Everybody at the company ate lunch here.

266
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,710
What were you doing out there?

267
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,060
Nothing,  I just suddenly wanted to eat at that restaurant.

268
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,560
♪ And suddenly, I'm... ♪

269
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,140
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

270
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,500
Have some tissues.

271
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,400
Thank you, thank you.

272
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,590
Ah Shuang, do you want to drink some hot water?

273
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,390
No, no.

274
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,420
Ah Shuang, I can see your cold is pretty serious.  You go home and rest, I'll submit the request for you for time off.

275
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,820
I still haven't finished my work.

276
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,030
I'll see how I feel later.

277
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,240
I think I have some cold medicine at my desk. I'll get it for you.

278
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,260
Okay, thank you.

279
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm out.

280
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,750
Forget it. I'll buy some for him.

281
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
Hello, CEO Zhao.

282
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,050
Okay, I'll send it right away.

283
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,930
- Can you help me buy some cold medicine?
- Who has a cold?

284
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,260
Ah Shuang caught a cold. I wanted to buy him some cold medicine,

285
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,580
but I just got a call and they want me to send an important document to a customer.

286
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,250
Help me run this errand, okay?

287
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,920
All right.

288
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,400
Hey!

289
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,440
What is it?

290
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,610
If Senior Ah Shuang knew I was the one who bought it,

291
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,890
would he rather die than take it?

292
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,150
Then we will tell him after he takes the medicine.

293
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,090
He won't be able to spit it out.

294
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,410
   

295
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,720
- What happened?
 - Junior Weiwei, 

296
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,540
I asked you to buy medicine. How did you end up like this?

297
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,620
It's not Senior Yugong's fault.

298
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,680
All right, all right.  Didn't Ah Shuang catch a cold?

299
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,470
Originally I was going to buy medicine for him,

300
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,110
but I suddenly got a call from a customer who wanted me to send over an important document.

301
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,590
I just had Junior Weiwei help me buy it.

302
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,910
Jacket.

303
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,330
Where are you going?  Not going to work overtime?

304
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,980
Going home.

305
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,760
My clothes are all wet.

306
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,910
What if I get your car dirty?

307
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,000
   

308
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,140
This isn't the way to Xiao LIng's house.

309
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,610
We're going to my house.

310
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,850
- Your house?
- It's closer.

311
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,550
Also...

312
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,670
don't worry about messing up my house.

313
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,220
 Come in. 

314
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,290
I rarely have guests here. Use my slippers.

315
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,980
Then what will you do?

316
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,970
Wait for me in the living room.

317
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,720
 He only has one pair of slippers. 

318
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,020
 It seems that I'm the first one to come here. 

319
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,240
It's a rainy day.  Why did you just run out without an umbrella?

320
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,850
You're mistaken.  When I left, the rain had already  stopped.

321
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,780
Who knew on the way back

322
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,930
it would start up again?

323
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,640
Ah Shuang gave you a hard time.

324
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,240
Why didn't you tell me?

325
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,710
Then you would look bad.

326
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,270
Do you feel bad?

327
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,900
Not at all. I think it's kind of interesting.

328
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,610
I think maybe I changed how Ah Shuang feels about me, too.

329
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,120
♫  Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me  ♫

340
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,630
Weiwei.

341
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,960
Change out of your wet clothes. I haven't worn these yet.

342
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,040
 Master's shirt and pants! 

343
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,650
No thanks.

344
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,100
Unless you want the ones I've worn already?

345
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,490
- Haven't seen you wear this shirt before. Very indie style.
- I just picked it casually.

346
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,120
Where's Third Sister-in-Law? Shouldn't you come to work together?

347
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,000
Today is Saturday.

348
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,220
Besides, she caught a cold.

349
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,070
What a coincidence. Ah Shuang has a cold, too.

350
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,660
It's raining outside. If you go into an air-conditioned room after getting wet, you'll catch a cold for sure.

351
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,510
You should be careful, too, Third Brother.

352
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,070
Yeah.

353
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,700
Boss.

354
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,980
Your girlfriend's... sick?

355
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,140
Yes. She has a cold.

356
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,790
Yugong told me.

357
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,680
He said that she got rained on when she went to buy medicine for me.

358
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,580
Sounds about right.

359
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,750
I didn't give her a hard time on purpose. It's just that some time–

360
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,360
You don't need to explain.

361
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,770
I assigned her to Yugong, and Yugong assigned her to you.

362
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,350
You have every right to decide on her work responsibility.

363
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,320
However, at first, I thought you rejected women purely for biological reasons.

364
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,680
But now I see that you feel antagonistic towards the women who are doing IT work.

365
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,720
About that,

366
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,960
I hope Weiwei can change your mind.

367
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,030
I've been wronged before.

368
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,490
Everyone's different. Don't lump them all together.

369
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,850
But it's no rush. Take your time.

370
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,260
Boss!

371
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,650
Your girlfriend...

372
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:00,470
I mean Bei Weiwei really is very different.

373
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,730
Weiwei! Why are you not up yet?

374
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,980
- Today is Saturday. I'm sleeping in! 
 - Oh.

375
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,360
Then I'm leaving first.

376
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,720
There's overtime at work today. Even the interns get paid double time!

377
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,150
¥300, here I come!

378
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,710
Why are you back?

379
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,290
 Weiwei, can I ask you for a favor? 

380
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,450
What's that?

381
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,120
I've been leveling up my metal forging skills lately,

382
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,290
  but I'm running out of time.  

383
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,250
Since you're at home today, can you help me work on that?

384
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,280
Metal forging skills?

385
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,580
I wanted to gift a top-level sword for a friend,

386
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,840
but I don't have enough time because of work.

387
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,590
If you do it for me during the day,  then I'll continue it at night, then it'll work. 

388
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,580
Sure, sure. Go to work already!

389
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,170
I love you!

390
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,840
I'll bring juice for you when I return!

391
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,110
  Erxi can never see this!  

392
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,600
  Let's cover it up quickly!  

393
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,520
  Oh my goodness.  

394
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,090
  Disappear already!  

395
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,750
  Will this work?  

396
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,360
 Maybe a little more. 

397
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,110
Hello?

398
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,750
Took you a long time to answer.

399
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,800
Did I wake you?

400
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
It's because I didn't want to take your call.

401
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,150
Then who's the one talking with me right now?

402
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,070
My spirit?

403
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,920
How are you feeling? Feeling better?

404
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,950
Not too bad.

405
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,430
If I catch a cold, it'll be all your fault.

406
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,350
If you took me home right away yesterday, I wouldn't be sick.

407
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,110
You live with a roommate. It's not convenient.

408
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,110
President Xiao, it's time for your work.

409
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,720
Please focus on cultivating your codes. Bye!

  - Weiwei, how's my metal forging skills coming along?  

427
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,170
 I'm off work already, but I have to go to a friend's house to feed his cat. 

428
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,570
 I can't come back now. Please work on that skill for me! 

429
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,780
Don't worry. I get it. I'm really quick at it.

430
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,510
 Thank you!  

431
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,070
Driver, please stop! I rode past my stop!

432
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,010
You can't stop here. Do it quickly, okay?

433
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,220
Thank you, Driver.

434
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,830
Who's it?

435
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,940
- You really are broke. 
 -What?

436
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,750
You've worn this shirt quite a few times.

437
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,950
I have a few of the same shirt.

438
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,380
Go and give Coffee a bath.

439
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,060
So can I go home after I bathe it?

440
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,600
We'll see.

441
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,280
  Am I being a masochist? 

442
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,970
 Why am I asking your roommate to feed the cat when I know what kind of person you are.  

443
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,770
  She's online?  

444
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,760
 What's she doing running around? 

445
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,010
 She didn't even notice when I got online. 

446
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,210
   

447
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,600
Weiguang?

448
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,520
He's Erxi's disciple, right?

449
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,340
It's him.

450
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,510
 I am not... 

451
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,680
Erxi doesn't have many friends in the game.

452
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,980
Could he be the one whom she wants to send the gift to?

453
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,510
Then I can't tell him that I'm not Erxi.

454
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:51,710
It'd be bad if he thought Erxi found a substitute to make the gift.

455
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,950
 Yes. But... 

456
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,730
 I need to be offline now. Talk to you later. 

457
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,010
 Already? 

458
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,020
 Yes. 

459
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,540
 Have work to do. Bye-bye.

476
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,050
♫  I don’t need to look for anyone else  ♫

477
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,530

482
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,710
♫  As I pass by you, the tips of your hair  ♫

483
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,350
♫  Are like grass blown by the spring wind  ♫

484
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,720
♫  Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to  ♫

485
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,520
