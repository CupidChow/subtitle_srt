1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,220


2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,440
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,610
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,960
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,770
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,490
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,570
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,440
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,130
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,670
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,770
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,870
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,680
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,070
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,140
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,880
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,290
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,320
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,260
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,340
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,410
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,280
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,100
   

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,040
   

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,080
Are you interested in a game?

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,230
It would be discourteous to decline. How?

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,360
 Good Shot!  Beautiful! 

30
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,930
 Nice! 

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,880
Who is that?  He's got a murderous look on his face.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,700
Who cares about who he is?

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,260
Anyway, he won't win. Our Third Brother is only putting out half the effort.

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,720
Why does he look so familiar?

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,100
I remember now.

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,790
He's the guy from the Foreign Language Department called Cao... Cao Guang.

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,750
He's also quite a talent.

38
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,120
Two top talents fighting for the top honor.

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,830
A fight for the top honor in basketball.

40
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,150
He's in the Foreign Language Department. Why didn't he choose an English speech contest?

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,820
His brain short-circuited.

42
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,190
Big Brother, Third Brother's sick English is very good, too. Okay?

43
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,060
If these two really match up to each other, I don't know who would win.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,580
But I know that when it comes to basketball,

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,770
Cao Guang will lose for sure.

46
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,050
Yeah!

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,520
Let's go.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,820
Hey, Third Brother, why did he go one-on-one with you?

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,330
This Cao Guang seems to be pursuing the Beauty Queen of our department.

50
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,390
- Bei Weiwei?
- Yes.  I heard Xiao Ling mention it.

51
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,920
Hey, Third Brother, what are you doing?

52
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,680
To play another game.  I held back earlier.

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,030
I feel a murderous aura.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,850
I feel the sky has changed.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,850
Get up.

56
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,560
 What? Wait a second. Big news! 

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,180
Senior Xiao Nai has moved back into the dorms.

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,850
We can walk by the basketball court once in a while now.

59
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,980
Weiwei and I knew a long time ago.

60
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,830
What? You guys didn't tell us such an important thing!

61
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,190
Tomorrow, you guys can get the water.

62
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,150
- That's right!
- I'll call you again later.

63
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,180
Erxi and I coincidentally saw him reject a girl.

64
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,060
Just thinking about it makes my whole body tremble.

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,640
Master is so callous, so heartless, so unpredictable!

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,290
Why are you sighing? It's not as if he rejected you.

67
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,020
As one among the downtrodden, I could feel it as if it happened to me.

68
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,780
No, I need to take a sip of the milk tea to warm my fragile heart.

69
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,030
How did Master reject her? Who's the girl?

70
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,230
I don't know. She gave him a love letter, but he didn't even spare a glance, and just walked right past her.

71
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,920
Wow! So cool!

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,140
I wonder who the Master's ideal type is.

73
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,470
 I feel a little guilty thinking about what I said to Cao Guang. 

74
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,180
  Forget it. Besides, Master Xiao Nai won't find out.  

75
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,500
 By the hillside of Prasine Emerald Mountain.  Hurry over to kill a boss. 

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,340
  I'll be right there.  

77
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,500
  Which boss are we fighting?  

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,560
 Meng Dongxing. 

79
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,930
We really have an amazing character catch today!

80
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,650
We were just doing some meditation and getting some sun by the hillside.

81
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,660
We didn't expect that the monster, Boss Meng, who is extremely hard to find,

82
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,070
would actually be dropped in our laps today!

83
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,770
Come on!  Attack together!

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,390
Third Sister-in-Law, you can't just stand on the sidelines.

85
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,480
You guys go ahead. If I join in the attack, his power will simply increase.

86
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,530
Why?

87
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,300
When only a female player attacks him,

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,390
due to his protective instinct toward women, his attack power will be reduced to half.

89
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,760
If both male and female players attack him,

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,000
due to jealousy, his attack power will increase by half.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,060
There's something like that!

92
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,990
I wonder if attackers are all male, due to his irritation with them,

93
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,390
his attack power will, however, increase.

94
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,210
I heard that this guy likes to harass female players.

95
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,700
I have never seen it before so I would love to see it.

96
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,240
Attack him and let us see what he does.

97
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,740
Okay, then prepare yourselves.

98
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,740
Such a beauty should be servicing in a bedroom

99
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,150
but is instead out here playing with weapons in the wilderness.

100
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,220
Why don't you let me take care of you and I will guarantee you a life of comfort and luxury?

101
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,790
Wow, he really is harassing her without any reservation.

102
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,410
How dare you harass our sister-in-law? Let's knock him out.

103
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,400
What did we get out of this?  If it's equipment, just give it to Sister-in-Law.

104
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,330
If I gave this equipment to Sister-in-Law, I figure Third Brother would beat me to death.

105
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,660
No way.  Third Brother is in a particularly good mood today.

106
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,850
I noticed that, too!

107
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,060
 What did you get? 

108
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,170
Third Brother is asking.  I'll answer him.

109
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,870
A man's hair.

110
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,260
Hair of the Princess' Lover,

111
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,580
without a single attribute.

112
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,940
Today, we were really lucky that we could get this kind of equipment.

113
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,600
At least it's better than the Invincible East Dagger we got that time.

114
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,080
And it was a dagger for castration.

115
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,020
It's also better than that Emei Old Dame's Foot-Binding Cloth, right?

116
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,100
- And it hadn't been washed for years!
- Hey!

117
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,230
Say, could it be that we devastated Boss Meng too wretchedly,

118
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,740
- so it dropped such ridiculous equipment?
- That really is not it!

119
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,070
- It's because of this useless wimp.
- So mean!

120
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,670
- So mean.
- Hey,

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,270
why is there no response from Sister-in-Law?

122
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,800
Could she be depressed over this?

123
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,830
 No. After spending so many years in this world, 

124
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,720
 I stopped caring about fame and fortune long ago. 

125
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,770
 Why do I think that tone is so familiar? 

126
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,310
It's like Third Brother.

127
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,150
No, it isn't.  Third Brother isn't like that.

128
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,340
 Naihe never shows his narcissism in words. 

129
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,890
 He's always narcissistic in his heart! 

130
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,670
 One gets stained when staying too close to the ink.
(Idiom:  one who lies with dogs will ride with fleas)  

131
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,980
 In the future, I can't allow her to hang out with you guys too much. 

132
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,150
 That's right. I was influenced by you guys. It's nothing. 

133
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,540
 Just now, I was thinking about the video. 

134
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,990
 The video to compete in the video contest? 

135
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,500
 Yup. Fighting Boss Meng gave me inspiration. I also want to make a video. 

136
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,770
 Okay, we will be right there whenever you ask. 

137
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,520
 Did you figure out the plot yet? 

138
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,810
 I thought of something but it is really absurd. 

139
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,020
 Let's hear it. 

140
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,970
 A zither musician met a female bandit in the nearby woods. 

141
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,760
 That female bandit captured and brought him back to her stronghold. 

142
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,260
 Basically, the thief fell in love with the zither player 

143
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,800
  and treated him with great care. 

144
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,720
 - However, the musician was not happy.  
- It's time for dinner.

145
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,810
Let's go over there for the meal.

146
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,210
My grandfather was a bandit and my father was also a bandit,

147
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,160
so I was born as a bandit.

148
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,390
Other than being a bandit, I don't know how to be anything else.

149
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know what else I should do.

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,070
Also, everyone in this stronghold is a bandit.

151
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,180
You dislike me so much,

152
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,430
but I have never killed anyone before.

153
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,110
I am not the worst person in the world.

154
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,010
Of course, I am still a bad person.

155
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,200
I also would like to be like other girls.

156
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,740
Raise  chicks and ducklings.

157
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,670
Rise at dawn and return home at dusk everyday,

158
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,130
living a peaceful and quiet life.

159
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,650
However, this is only a dream.

160
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,860
It will never come true.

161
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,550
You are free to leave.

162
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,780
I am letting you go.

163
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,200
 The female bandit then released him, 

164
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,330
 but she couldn't bear to see him leave. 

165
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,390
 So she secretly followed him. 

166
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,610
 ♫ You seem to be before my eyes but I don't know ♫ 

167
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,380
 A monster suddenly appeared in the forest to attack the musician. 
 ♫ How to sketch out the face I anxiously awaited in my dream ♫ 

168
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,010
 ♫ Who would insist on wandering in this mortal world ♫ 

169
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,690
 ♫ As a stranger in an alien place ♫ 

170
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,200
 ♫ I don't notice the colored pavilion in background of 
this painting ♫ 

171
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,710
 ♫ But instead the water and ink streaking to reveal your expressive eyes ♫ 

172
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,500
 ♫ The brush strokes capture your essence of spirit ♫ 

173
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,210
 ♫ As if that moment stood still on paper ♫ 

174
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,840
 ♫ How does the time elapse so abruptly ♫ 

175
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,030
 ♫ As the crisis emerges in life ♫ 

176
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:18,090
 ♫ We meet each other when alone in our melancholy ♫ 

177
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,570
 ♫ Facing the dilemma of the future when we jointly walk into the hopeless abyss ♫ 

178
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,740
 In order to save the musician, the female bandit became injured. 
 ♫ The fate finally arrives at its end ♫ 

179
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,430
 Afterwards, the musician accepted the female bandit, 

180
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,180
 and the two of them returned together to the stronghold to be married. 
 ♫ This journey reaches distant mountains and crosses wide seas / Why else could I wish for ♫ 

181
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,060
 ♫ Marching to the end of each road in this tireless search / The paths of our destiny intercept  ♫ 

182
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,140
 ♫ In this silence at that instant of settling the choice / Moment of decision ♫ 

183
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,880
 ♫ The roaming cloud at the edge of the sky has 
already dispersed ♫ 

184
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,360
   
   

185
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,020
 ♫ As the crisis emerges in life ♫ 

186
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,150
 ♫ We meet each other when alone in our melancholy ♫ 

187
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:42,020
 ♫ Facing the dilemma of the future when we jointly walk into the hopeless abyss ♫ 

188
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,110
 ♫ The fate finally arrives at its end ♫ 

189
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,980


190
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,000
Your Excellence, these past days, you've endured hardship.

191
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,160
This time, we've obliterated the bandit hideout in one fell swoop.

192
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,300
From now on, the people here will live in peace.

193
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,330
The merit of Your Excellence's effort cannot be overlooked.

194
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,100
Your Excellence,

195
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,160
you didn't have to kill her originally.

196
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,720
Rather than making her live with the hatred for me,

197
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,170
death is better.

198
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,230
 For the ending, shall we have the musician 

199
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,600
 come to a sudden realization that he also fell in love with the female bandit? 

200
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,480
 Later, he jumps off a cliff to die with her. 

201
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,430
 What do you think? 

202
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,660
 It's not bad. Let's do it like this then. 

203
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,320
 - You... really think it's good?
- Yes. 

204
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,960
 I don't have many lines. 

205
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,180
 Let's start recording after finishing the script. 

206
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,930
You get up so early every morning.

207
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,570
 Oh, shoot! A mountain bandit! 

208
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,430
 Female bandit, what are you trying to do? 

209
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,320
 Say something! 

210
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,270
 I cleared this path. I planted this tree... 
(Note: A common line in martial arts movies)

211
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,530
 If you wish to pass, leave the man behind! 

212
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,100
Oh, Senior Brother, does it hurt?

213
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,720
- What are you doing, Senior Brother?
- Wow,

214
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,660
are you two even human? I've fallen and no one thinks to give me a hand.

215
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,250
For my brother here, once I'm done laughing, I'll help you up.

216
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,930
 We're laughing our butts off. He fell off his chair. 

217
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,770
 Do you guys live together? 

218
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,920
 We are roommates in the dorm. 

219
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,360
 So, Master is really a student like me. 

220
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,690
 Why do I keep feeling it's a little inconceivable? 

221
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,740
 However, Third Sister-in-Law, in the past, Naihe often stayed out overnight. 

222
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,390
 You'll have to keep him in line. 

223
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,090
 He doesn't come back during the day, either. 

224
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,300
 He never shows up at school. 

225
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,070
 Hide all your socks well. 

226
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,780
 I plan on staying there until the end of the semester. 

227
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,370
 Don't come back. 

228
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,200
 - Don't come back!
- Don't come back. 

229
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,500
 Don't tell me boys really don't wash their socks for weeks at a time. 

230
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,170
 This... is normal, isn't it? 

231
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,920
 Among the boys in Science and Engineering, 

232
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,440
 someone like Third Brother without stinky socks is the anomaly. 

233
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,790
 Yugong, I heard you talk about hacking people's computers before. 

234
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,220
 Could it be that you guys are in Computer Science? 

235
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,360
 Bingo. 

236
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,440
 What a coincidence! Me, too. 

237
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,270
Really?

238
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,270
 Could you be a female underclassman? 

239
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,590
It could also be a guy.

240
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,710
 Forget it. The ratio in the Computer Science Department between male and female is 9 to 1. 

241
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,870
 Female underclassman, you are so tough and brawny. 

242
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,140
 Or could you actually be a male underclassman? 

243
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,390
 Am I really so tough and brawny? 

244
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,780
 I am talking about the prologue of the abduction scene. 

245
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,080
 No, no. It was good. 

246
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,530
 Its effect is so loud, even the deaf can hear it. 

247
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,150
 So loud even the deaf can hear it? 

248
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,300
 If Yugong's former literature teacher heard him using this idiom like this, 

249
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
  I wonder whether he would cry.  

250
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,300
 It is good, but that, "Leave the man behind," should best be revised. 

251
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,270
 There are four men here. Who knows which one you try to abduct? 

252
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,160
  The audience may misunderstand.  

253
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
Right?

254
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,190
  They won't misunderstand. No need to revise it.  

255
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,210
No need to revise?

256
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,080
  Why not?  

257
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,620
 You guys aren't valuable enough for abduction. 

258
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,930
Brothers, get him!

259
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,330
 I haven't even started robbing you yet, 

260
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,300
 and you guys are fighting among yourselves in this robbery. 

261
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,330
 Don't forget to bring me back something tasty to eat. 

262
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,050
- I got it.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,790
Weiwei, do you want anything to eat?

264
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,860
- No, thanks.
- Bye-bye.

265
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,800
Bye-bye!

266
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,170
 Huantian Xidi?  Such a good name, a good name. 

267
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,020
 Welcome to Clan Pu Village.  I am Mayor Pu of the village. 

268
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,330
 I'll teach you some skills to help you get around in this world. 

269
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,120
 You have a decent physique and intelligence. 

270
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,130
 As long as you focus on your training, you will certainly become very capable. 

271
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,310
What is this nonsense?  What am I supposed to do?

272
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,810
That...

273
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,970
 I will definitely make a name for myself in this realm, 

274
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,640
 as I get rid of the bully and aid the vulnerable 

275
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,480
 I will definitely live the fascinating life of my dreams here. 

276
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,210
 I'll eat abundant meat in chunks and drink in gulps. 

277
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,990
 Follow me to the village entrance and I'll bring some dead monsters back here. 

278
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,640
That's amazing!

279
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,150
As long as your mind doesn't harbor distracting thoughts,

280
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,580
you can do it, too.

281
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,340
Mayor, didn't you say that I could?

282
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,220
The weather is pretty good today.

283
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,520
I'm going to take a walk around.

284
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,460
Take a walk around!

285
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,030
Help!

286
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,760
Weiwei! I died again!  Come and save me!

287
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
Weren't you going to storm the realm alone?

288
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
Please forget I said that.

289
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,880
I've already died several times fighting the first boss.

290
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,410
The first one?

291
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,400
Don't tell me that you're fighting the minion boss outside Clan Pu Village?

292
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,200
What minion boss? It has so many monsters around it. How can you still consider it a minion boss?

293
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,410
So many attacked me by myself.  This should really be considered a bug.

294
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,230
Don't laugh at me.

295
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,410
Help me fight it. I'll stand behind you, to watch you and learn.

296
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,270
I'll give you a massage.

297
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,220
Watch carefully.

298
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,870
Weiwei, you're so amazing!

299
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,030
Kill some more so I can see! Last time, I didn't even see clearly.

300
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,060
Use some more strength.

301
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,410
The door isn't locked! Come in!

302
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,080
Classmates, hello. Would you like to look at the face masks of Queen Bee brand?

303
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,920
They are all pure organic extract from mung beans.

304
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,930
Do you want to take a look?

305
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Classmates, right now I'm working hard to support my study judiciously.

306
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,320
These masks are priced for our friends in this special promotion.

307
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,710
It's a good deal.

308
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,840
I've used this mung bean one before. It's not bad.

309
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,400
Then I'll take two. How much is it?

310
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,480
Exactly ¥180.

311
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,170
Wait a moment.

312
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,450
Here's the money.

313
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,730
Exactly.

314
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,480
Are you guys playing a game?

315
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,320
What game is this? It looks pretty fun.

316
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,200
It's "A Chinese Ghost Story." It's pretty fun.

317
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,790
Then I'll try it out when I go back.

318
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,860
Then, I'll be leaving now.

319
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,040
If you like it, find me again.

320
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,370
I'm in Room 304.

321
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,400
Bye-bye.

322
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:06,230


323
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,960
 Class leader, Bei Weiwei's game ID is Huantian Xidi.
(Note: Her name means "Boundless joy") 

324
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,830
 She is playing a game titled  "A Chinese Ghost Story." 

325
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,350
  Don't forget our deal.  

326
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,140
  I won't forget. Thank you.  

327
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,010
 I lost on the basketball court but I won't lose  Bei Weiwei to you. 

328
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,220
This is the annotated file of the personnel transfer plan after CEO Zhen's review.

329
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,080
Based on this, he wants you to get a clean copy for him before tomorrow.

330
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Thank you for your trouble, Assistant Meng.

331
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,400
No problem. It's what I should do.

332
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,970
- Assistant Meng, do you have any other plans?
- Uh,

333
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,160
I've remembered that CEO Zhen also asked me

334
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,400
to spend some time to understand the recruiting of the interns when I am free.

335
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,500
We just screened out a number of them but are going to discuss this with the interviewers.

336
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,350
We will select the most suitable candidates from the remaining applicants.

337
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,040
Nice work! Let me have a look, okay?

338
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,580
This...

339
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,720
   

340
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,350
 Yiran, today in the dining hall, I bumped into Bei Weiwei and Cao Guang. 

341
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,930
 Bei Weiwei and Cao Guang? Why would they be together? 

342
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,180
 This isn't the key point. 

343
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,840
 The key point is that Bei Weiwei said the person she likes is Xiao Nai. 

344
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,800
 Yiran, you have to be careful. 

345
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,930
 Girls like Bei Weiwei really know how to seduce people. 

346
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,440
 Moreover, she's in the Computer Science Department. 

347
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,870
 You'd better pay attention. 

348
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,800
Forget about this person. I don't think she fits in.

349
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,150
There are also... these.

350
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,090
Get rid of them together.

351
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,260
They're all from the Computer Science Department of Tsinghua University.

352
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,540
Okay.

353
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,400
Are you busy?

354
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,070
It's all right. What's the matter?

355
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,370
If you have time, shall we play a round?

356
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,220
I say, can you not sit next to me?

357
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,720
I don't like people watching when I play chess.

358
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,250
You have so many issues.

359
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,080
Are you afraid of being embarrassed in front of me losing to your son?

360
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,350
Look at you. You don't even understand.

361
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,050
Besides, when have I lost before?

362
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,690
You obviously won't lose.

363
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,210
- Every time you are about to lose, you'd quit playing.
- Hey!

364
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,010
Look at how your mom talks.

365
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,440
Dad, your demeanor when playing chess is indeed rather worrisome.

366
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,720
I am here to talk to you about something important.

367
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,830
Xiao Nai, you always have your own ideas since your were little.

368
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,720
In this, I feel reassured.

369
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,870
However, nowadays, looking at you,

370
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,490
you spend all your talent on making games.

371
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,040
Isn't this too much a waste?

372
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,970
Dad, you author books, express your views,

373
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,640
educate and nurture the young.  What is the purpose?

374
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,750
Provide wisdom, teach career skills, and clarify confusion.

375
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,960
Publish our own research results,

376
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,340
and convey our ideas and beliefs.

377
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,440
To me, making games is the same.

378
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,860
I also convey my own ideas and viewpoints.

379
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,260
Only the way of expressing it is different.

380
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,740
I think using games is much more vivid.

381
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,690
Also, in a form that's easier for people to accept,

382
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,550
to describe a world that I've imagined.

383
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course, mainly because I'm interested.

384
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,340
It's your turn.

385
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,910
What you said does have merit.

386
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,600
I've been too narrow-minded.  I'll support you.

387
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,100
Thank you, Dad.

388
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,860
Making games is only my plan before I'm 25 years old.

389
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,710
It's not a lifetime goal.

390
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,920
Okay. Let's play.

391
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,120
I'll take your elective course next week.

392
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,330
What are you coming for?

393
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,860
I've heard the attendance rate of your elective course isn't very high.

394
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,310
I'll help you raise the rate.

395
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,350
 I heard that Professor Xiao is Xiao Nai's father.  Why are there so few people attending his class? 

396
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,350
 But it's not much use.  Xiao Nai won't come to class anyway. 

397
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,260
 Also, Professor Xiao's class is especially boring. 

398
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,690
 Is someone sitting here? 

399
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,390
No.

400
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,690
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

401
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,760
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

402
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,880

 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫  

404
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,620
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

405
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,630
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

406
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,850
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫  

407
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,880
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

408
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,000
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫

 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

414

416
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,490
  
  
Master?  Master is attending a history class.

417
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,390
   
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫

 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

421
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,780
I'm really not used to seeing

422
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,110
so many students attending my class.

423
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,590
I want to ask everyone. Did you really come to listen to my lecture?

424
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,790
Yes!

425
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,720
All right. For the sake of mutual trust between people,

426
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,450
I believe everyone,

427
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,020
but I still have to test you.

428
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,410
At the end of our last class, I left you with a topic.

429
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,670
I'd like to know if you all still remember,

430
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,320
so I'd like a student to give me an answer.

431
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,660
Who will answer?

432
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,400
This female student.

433
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,010
The girl with the red shirt

434
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,960
sitting next to the male student in the white shirt.

435
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,940
Me?

436
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,750
Yes, you.

437
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,300
In the last class, the professor was talking about the Mawangdui Tombs of the Western Han Dynasty.

438
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,750
After class, I looked up some materials.

439
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,370
Among the artifacts unearthed at the Mawangdui Tombs, the ones I'm most interested in

440
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:50,560
are neither the silk garments, nor the T-shaped painting on silks.

441
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,180
Instead, they are silk texts and medical texts.

442
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,460
I believe... these ten volumes of medical books are our most prized historical relics.

443
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,900
For example, among them, "Prescriptions For 52 Diseases."

444
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,590
Compared to the academically acclaimed "The Yellow Emporer's Internal Canon,"
 (Note: A medical text from 300 B.C.) 

445
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,820
it was compiled even earlier.

446
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,290
I have checked.

447
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,570
Some of the treatments within have been validated by the medical school. Based on that, it shows that

448
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,100
some of the treatments in the "Prescriptions For 52 Diseases" are correct,

449
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,180
and can still be used nowadays. Applying historical lessons in modern time.

450
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,170
I believe this is the essence of archaeology.

451
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,960
However, it's a pity that the silk texts became damaged.

452
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,570
Many prescriptions have already been lost.

453
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,650
It seems that I'm not very lucky today.

454
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,980
I actually picked someone who really attended class.

455
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,420
Fine, then today, we will continue talking about this.

456
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,350
But I still hope that students can concentrate more of your attention on me.

457
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,110
Your professor was really handsome when he was young, too.

458
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,790
Professor, we believe you.

459
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,800
Our lesson shall end here today.

460
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,060
I hope next time there are still this many students coming to class.

461
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,450
Thank you.

462
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,990
 Professor, we'll definitely come! 

463
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,150
Do you need to get out?

464
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,150
Si Si,

465
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,390
the fragrant smell of your milk tea is distracting me from playing games.

466
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,740
Quickly, make me a cup.

467
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,350
If you want to drink it, why don't you tell me directly. Using excuses again...

468
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,580
- Here.
- You have improved.

469
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,420
Weiwei, what's wrong?

470
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,380
What's the matter?

471
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Today, in Professor Xiao's elective class, his son came.

472
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,710
Xiao Nai!

473
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,760
- Is it true?
- Is it true?

474
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,960
Also... he was sitting next to me.

475
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,790
How do you have such great luck, stinking Weiwei?

476
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,980
Weiwei, you're so annoying. Why didn't you notify me earlier?

477
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,490
It's so hard to come across Xiao Nai everyday, and I missed him like this. Hey,

478
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,000
do you have pictures?

479
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Did you forget? I lost my phone.

480
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,260
Then why didn't you buy one earlier?

481
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,910
Go to the forum. Go to the forum! There are definitely pictures on the forum!

482
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,720
I'm going to... lick the screen.

483
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,230
Why didn't you come with me to the elective class?

484
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,850
I didn't get in.

485
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,210
It's so easy to get the credit from Professor Xiao's elective class.  Who wouldn't want to go?

486
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,380
I ended up getting into a lousy Film Analysis class and ran into a jerk.

487
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,580
Also, my butt hurt for several days.

488
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,960
Weiwei... Weiwei, then did you speak to Master Xiao Nai?

489
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,940
For such a good opportunity, did you conveniently ask for his cell phone number or anything?

490
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,420
Perhaps, you'll become Master Xiao Nai's cup of milk tea?

491
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,750
I don't have the talent.

492
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,890
No way. For such a good opportunity, didn't you even say a word to him?

493
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,050
Don't slander me.

494
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,830
I said two phrases.

495
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,550
"No," and "Thank you."

496
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,120
You really make people give up all hope.

497
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,700
It is such a waste for you to have been born with such a beautiful face.

498
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,860
Next time! Next time, after I've learned the skill.

499
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm going to get water.

500
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,990
Weiwei, tell me about what happened again.

501
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,330
Get up.

502
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,320
Weiwei, you've profited!

503
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,630
Be quiet.

504
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,780
Master actually took the initiative to talk to you.

505
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,600
Isn't your luck too great?

506
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,020
- Keep your voice down.
- Why bother to stay low-key?

507
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,650
Master, how can I get you to meet with me

508
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,260
at the moment when I'm most beautiful?

509
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,120
Master...

510
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,480
Master? Hey!

511
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,730
Weiwei, the next time you see him, you must

512
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,110
speak more! Take more photos! Speak more! Take more photos!

513
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,960
-  That girl from the film class with the horizontal bar knows Bei Weiwei? 
- Hey.

514
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,430
- Isn't that your goddess?
- Hey.

515
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,630
- Hurry up and approach her there.
- Help her carry the water jug.

516
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,160
No need. I have another method.

517
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,790
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

518
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,980


519
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,440
 Yang Yang "Just One Smile Is Very Alluring"
