 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,530
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,620
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,590
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,610
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,500
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,490
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,540
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,130
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,760
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,710
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,860
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,120
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,010
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,130
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,960
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,350
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,250
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,320
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,390
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,470
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,330
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,150
   

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,240
    

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,080
He's in the vicinity of the school.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,580
   

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,860
I  had just asked if he knew me, but he left.

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,040
Could it have been done by someone who knows us?

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,100
I couldn't see what he looked like.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,660
This expert works part-time.

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,000
This is so weird.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,870
Nope, I have to pig out tonight

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,580
to console my wounded heart.

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,620
Third Brother, I'll be going then.

36
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:27,000
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,100
There are so many dishes. Come and join me.

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,330
You have a drink, too.

39
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,370
Oh, right.  Thank you.

40
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,010
Thanks for what?

41
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,150
I used to come here a lot.

42
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,040
You probably didn't work here then.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,980
For this dish of meat,  your portion is at least three times bigger than what I used to get.

44
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,530
You're too skinny.

45
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,310
I'm skinny from exhaustion!

46
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,210
Are you in a bad mood?

47
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,620
Not really. I'm just tired.

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,100
Lately, I've been stuck on a problem.

49
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,000
Say, the famous poet Li Bai used to drink for inspiration.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,140
I'll try it, too.

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,160
I hope this bottle of green superpower drink will turn me into the Hulk!

52
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,990
Cheers!

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,420
Eat up!

54
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,430
Where do you live?

55
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,410
I live... in the men's dorm.

56
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,420
Which building of the men's dorm?

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,910
Who told you I live in the boys' dorm?

58
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,420
I graduated. I live in my house now.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,260
Where is your house?

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,470
My house...

61
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,720
Are you talking about my new house? My new house is just...

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,330
My new house... is my new house!

63
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,800
   

64
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,360
Where am I?

65
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,350
The eatery.

66
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,220
Why did I sleep here?

67
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,490
Is this where you live?

68
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,190
I sleep here when I'm not working.

69
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,080
Sorry for taking your bed.

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,650
It's fine.

71
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,640
Is this not my blanket?

72
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,220
Last time you came here, you said you were going to throw this blanket away.

73
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,440
I felt that it was still in decent shape, so I kept it.

74
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,990
Actually, it's still pretty good.

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,080
Did you put something in my food?

76
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,550
I've been exhausted lately,

77
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,130
but now I feel full of energy,

78
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,580
as if my health points are replenished on the return trip.

79
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,990
Say, did you put something in my food?

80
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,120
Never mind. I was just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

81
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,450
Are you tired from work?

82
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,440
Are you tired from cooking all day?

83
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,800
Let me put it this way.

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Coding in front of a computer all day

85
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,380
is definitely more than twice as tiring as you cooking all day.

86
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,780
My brain is so fried and almost feels numb.

87
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,060
These shoulders are sore all day long.

88
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,970
And as for my spine, I am close to getting a problem.

89
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,560
You can quit then.

90
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,570
No way! It's a company my buddies and I started together.

91
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,270
If I just quit, it would be too inconsiderate of me.

92
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,220
Do they make you do everything?

93
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,070
Not exactly.

94
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,070
The work our Third Brother takes on is twice of mine.

95
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,480
If I think in those terms, I feel a little better.

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Your Third Brother?

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,380
That's right.

98
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,320
He was here last time, too. He's quite good looking.

99
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,770
The one who sat to my right.  He's the one with his girlfriend.

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,150
I didn't notice.

101
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,510
Of course not. He was probably overshadowed by my dazzling looks.

102
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,960
Yep.

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Did you just say..."Yep?"

104
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,770
Yep.

105
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,790
It's hard to find someone who understands.

106
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you, K.O. Now that the Hulk is fully revitalized,

107
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,730
it's time to return to slaving over coding.  Thank you for letting me borrow the place overnight.

108
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,290
Bye-bye.

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
  Hi, Xiao Nai. 

110
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,370
Who are you?

111
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,400
K.O. We had an exchange the other day.

112
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,050
Your reputation precedes you. So, it was you.

113
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,370
 Don't you don't find it odd that I have your number? 

114
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,230
It's not so surprising.

115
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,060
Just like how you may be using blocking software,

116
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,180
but I can still find your cell phone number.

117
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,640
Is that so? Then, why don't you try?

118
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,630
I will give you half an hour.

119
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,970
  You lost. I waited an hour for you. 

120
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,030
192-6786-6786, five minutes.

121
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,250
Five minutes?  Did you hack China Mobile?

122
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,650
No, I told China Mobile that I was being harassed by an unknown caller.

123
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,290
Its customer service is good.

124
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,160
  Then why didn't you call me? 

125
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,240
Because I felt that you would be the one being tormented when I didn't call.

126
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
 K.O. is a well-known lone wolf. 

127
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,160
You've come to us several times already.

128
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,540
I am curious about your motive.

129
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,000
Midnight tonight, WCTF Geek Competition. Are you interested?

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
What do you mean?

131
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,170
We sign up together. If I lose, I'll work for you for a year, for free.

132
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,320
I think you really need help.

133
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,810
You know a lot about our company.

134
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,770
However, a good hacker isn't necessarily a good programmer.

135
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,850
I'll decide if that is the case.

136
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,970
What? Are you afraid?

137
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,010
Reverse psychology is my favorite.

138
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,410
Whoever solves the most challenges wins.

139
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,950
Okay.

140
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,630
Good. I'll challenge their record, while I'm at it.

141
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,510
   

142
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,730
So tough!

143
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,040
I heard that at the WCTF World Geek Competition last night,

144
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,290
there were two IPs from China that beat the previous record.

145
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,180
One of them scored 69, the other scored 68.

146
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,340
Really? That's really something to be proud of.

147
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,350
Third Brother, did you not go home last night?

148
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,760
It got too late yesterday, so I slept in the office.

149
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,170
Right, we have a new co-worker reporting today.

150
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,310
A new person?  You'll have to let me take a look first.

151
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,760
Tell me. When will he come in?

152
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,430
Midnight.

153
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,010
He's coming to work at midnight?

154
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,580
Right!  Did you recruit a person or a ghost?

155
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,450
You know that person, too.

156
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,930
I know him?  Who is it?

157
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,610
No way...

158
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,990
If there was someone in our department you liked, you would have brought him over already.

159
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,500
- The temple.
- What?

160
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,970
The person who hacked Hao Mei's computer really dares to come here?

161
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,190
Isn't he afraid of being beaten to death?

162
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,980
Normally, these kind of experts

163
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,750
like to be free and unconstrained.

164
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,900
How could he like working at our company?

165
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,760
What exactly did you do to him?

166
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,590
It's not that I did anything, it's what he wants to do.

167
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,490
Bro, can you speak our language? I don't understand.

168
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,380
This person is pretty weird; coming to work at night.

169
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,200
It won't be dangerous to us, right?

170
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,120
Big Brother, are you afraid?

171
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,070
- Don't you think the four of us couldn't overcome one guy?  What is there to be afraid of?
- Right.

172
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,920
Where's Brother Mei?

173
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,620
Big Brother, what's that for?

174
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,440
Do you know what this is?  This is the mop we use in the bathroom.

175
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,930
When he arrives, I'm going to kill him with it.

176
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,800
If I can't beat him to death with it,  this will stink him to death.

177
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,770
Why is it you?

178
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,000
Did you get takeout?

179
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,410
So it is you.

180
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,770
It's me.

181
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,060
According to our agreement, I lost.

182
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,400
So I will work for free at your company for one year.

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,870
No need to skip the salary.

184
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,140
Welcome to Zhi Yi.  I still haven't asked for your name.

185
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,380
You know it. It's K.O.

186
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,310
K.O.? Why does it sound so familiar?

187
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,270
I remember now!

188
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,770
You can't be that super awesome, super famous hacker, can you?

189
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,520
- The one who in 2011...
- Right.

190
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,230
Third Brother,  he can't be...

191
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,160
Y-Y-You...

192
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,950
It's me.

193
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,500
Also, we agreed on no salary, so no salary.

194
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,130
I won't go back on my word.

195
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Then I'll put you under Hao Mei.

196
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,550
Hao Mei, you found K.O. You will take responsibility.

197
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,690
Me?

198
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,500
This will be your desk from now on.

199
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,820
Third Brother had someone especially clean it for you.

200
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,980
I say that you really have it good.

201
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,470
Our CEO Xiao permits you to work from home as an exception.

202
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,520
Not like us, toiling all day here to be whipped around by him.

203
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,230
Are you not mad anymore?

204
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,760
I was still angry just now.

205
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,230
You dared to lie to me and even hacked my computer,

206
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,980
but later I felt some excitement.

207
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,910
Think about it.  I went to a food stand for a late night snack,

208
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,240
got to know a cook, and he turned out to be

209
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,450
the renown hacker, K.O.

210
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,730
It feels like seeing that... floor-sweeping monk.

211
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,440
What's a floor-sweeping monk?

212
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,110
Don't you know what the floor-sweeping monk is?

213
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,510
I'll explain it to you next time.

214
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,940
But I only have one question.

215
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,640
What is it?

216
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Why did you switch my goddess on my desktop

217
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,960
to a temple?

218
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,990
She's not good looking.

219
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm telling you. You can insult me,

220
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,040
but if you insult my goddess, I will have an issue with you.

221
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,260
No, I've thought of a question even more serious.

222
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,630
You'll be my co-worker from now on.

223
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,970
Then the issue with my meals...

224
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,950
How am I going to resolve this?

225
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,740
Meeting dismissed.

226
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,170
We're about to get paid soon. When are you treating us to dinner?

227
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,310
- Your treat?
- You're so cheap!

228
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,390
That K.O. is really good.  Since he got here

229
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,770
Hao Mei no longer makes a fuss here. His face has returned to its bright and soft state.

230
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,760
That's all due to their friendship.

231
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,070
Oh, right.  Are you and Weiwei still living in separate places?

232
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,260
How else? Without the proper relationship, it's unbecoming.

233
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,120
It's only been so long.  What do you want me to do?

234
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,530
Listen. These words,

235
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,690
this tone,

236
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,580
your time has finally come.

237
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,580
Third Brother,  actually I really feel for you.

238
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,900
Since we are both in the disheartened group, why don't we tonight...

239
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,260
Are you leaving so early today?  Where are you going?

240
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,310
Getting married and having children.

241
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,140
   

242
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,860
The marriage is fated to take place in spite of distance. Even Majestic Beasts have fated lovers.

243
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,220
I am the matchmaker in the world of Majestic Beasts. Today, you two have asked me to be here.

244
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,920
Which pair of divine pets are waiting for me to bestow my blessing?

245
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,830
Wonderful, wonderful. These are a pair of cultivated Majestic Beasts rarely seen in this world.

246
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,020
You can see that the owners have trained them very thoughtfully.

247
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,640
They're well-matched, well-matched!

248
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,530
   

249
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,810
Blessings to you all. The ceremony has been completed.

250
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,430
 You can build a bridal chamber for the Majestic Beasts in your own house. 

251
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,590
 They can move in after 8:00 p.m. 

252
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,280
 I heard players on the forum say that when the Majestic Beasts move in, 

253
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,850
 there will be pink-colored hearts falling from the roof. 

254
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,710
  I don't know if it's true.  

255
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,690
 Let's try it and see. 

256
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,540
 Sorry, your Majestic Beasts' online times 

257
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,100
 have not yet reached 150 hours. 

258
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,420
 They are considered minors, 

259
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,790
 and cannot move in together. 

260
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,430
 They're already at the level of binding their hair.
(Note: in ancient times, people bound their hair once they reached adulthood) 

261
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,740
 Yet they can't move in together. 

262
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,110
 If you make "A New Chinese Ghost Story," 

263
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,750
 you won't be this perverse. Right? 

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,660
 I won't. 

265
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,680
 Just something this minor? 

266
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,040
 Go to work on your stuff. 

267
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,850
 I'll take them to accumulate some online time. 

268
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,130
 Okay. Auto-following. 

269
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,930
 ♫ Do you want to be my love? ♫ 

270
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,120
 In any case, Master is currently auto-following. 

271
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,160
  He won't know what I'm doing.  

272
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,110
  Then... 

273
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:09,010
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

274
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,820
Hello, miss. Are you looking for a phone? Do you need any recommendations?

275
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,570
I want this one.

276
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,050
What color do you want?

277
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,180
Color...  Master's is gold.  

278
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,610
I want the gold one.

279
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,820
You have great taste. This phone has a great battery capacity and charges quickly.

280
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,150
You can talk for two hours after just charging for five minutes.

281
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,650
All right, I'll take this one.

282
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,930
Okay, please wait a moment. I'll get it for you.

283
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,040
- Here. 
 -Thank you.

284
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,720
Take care.

285
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,750
 I finally have a cell phone. Now, I fulfilled Master's request. 

286
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,400
  But will he laugh at me if he sees that my phone is the same as his?  

287
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,710
  I was too impulsive just now. Should I change it?  

288
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,110
  Forget it. If he asks,  

289
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,230
  I'll say it's a coincidence.  

290
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,180
  What text should I send to Master?  

291
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,650
 This will be the first message on the new cell phone. 

292
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,250
  It should have a special meaning.  

293
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,820
  I know!  

294
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,620
 Hong Kong's Guishi Group's 20th Year Anniversary 

295
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,420
 is giving back to society with its sincere gratitude 

296
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,330
 and will be organizing a raffle event. 

297
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,050
 Your cell phone number has been selected for the third prize. 

298
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,400
 The prize is one laptop computer. 

299
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,940
 After submitting ¥1,000 for taxes and service fees, 
 (Note: Approx. $150 USD) 

300
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,840
 we will send the prize to you via express courier.  

301
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,260
  Thanks to Erxi, who reads these text messages out loud each time,  

302
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,730
 I practically know them by heart. 

303
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,390
 I'll also add a bank card, so it'll be even more realistic. 

304
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,710
  Master will definitely  

305
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,510
  delete this text.  

306
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,740
  Then, I'll tell him at night I was the one who sent it.  

307
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,060
  His reaction will definitely be very entertaining.  

308
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,930
  I wonder if Master has seen the text.  

309
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,340
 He's definitely deleted it. In a bit, how should I criticize him? 

310
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,820
 I sent you a text, but you ignored it. 

311
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,020
 Text? 

312
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,300
 It's from this phone. 

313
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,510
 Did you delete the message?  

314
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,060
 Weiwei, sorry.  

315
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,380
 I thought it was a scam. 

316
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,000
   

317
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,920
  What is this?  

318
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,110
 Hello, Bei Weiwei. Through the Bank of China's online banking service, Xiao Nai 

319
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,540
 has transferred ¥1,000 to your card, ending in the numbers 2540. 

320
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm going to make a phone call. You guys eat.

321
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,450
You actually transferred me the money? It was a prank!

322
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,500
I know it was a prank from you.

323
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,240
How did you know it was me?

324
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,040
I checked the location of the phone. It happened to be in the same city as you.

325
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,100
What?

326
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,180
Could it be that every time you get spam,

327
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
you look up the address?

328
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,120
That's not it. It's just that the bank account you gave looked familiar, so I checked it.

329
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,740
Weiwei, your trickery isn't professional enough.

330
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,270
For the transfer, you didn't even include the recipient's name.

331
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,770
My bank card... in your presence, I think it only appeared once,

332
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,350
yet you remembered it?

333
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,130
That's too amazing!

334
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,250
Miss Bei, you think too much of me.

335
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,940
You don't even include the recipient's name for a wire transfer.  Your skill of trickery isn't up to par.

336
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,820
Then, you knew it was me, but still made the transfer?

337
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,390
Buy a plane ticket.

338
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,120
Weiwei, flowers are blooming on the street.

339
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,150
Enjoy the spectacle on your return.

340
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,120
You have to leave after returning for just a few days.

341
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,150
Why didn't you tell us you applied for a summer internship?

342
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,020
It's so sudden.

343
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,380
I just got the notification.

344
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,610
What company? Is it reliable?

345
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,030
The people in it... should be quite reliable.

346
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,490
Then where are you going to stay? At the school?

347
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,090
Weiwei, there's a package for you.

348
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,660
Almost done with the clothes?

349
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,270
Room and board has been settled. Xiao Ling has a house near the school, and can lend it to me. This is the key.

350
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,140
What? Are you staying in someone else's home?

351
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,610
It's not too convenient, right?

352
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,030
That's right. It's not good to stay at someone else's house, right?

353
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,300
It's fine. Xiao Ling is my good friend.

354
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,010
Okay, then.

355
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,270
But you are really... why didn't you say something sooner about this kind of plan?

356
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,650
We could have helped you prepare some necessities to bring over.

357
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,020
It's fine, Dad. I don't lack anything.

358
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,450
Also, it's very convenient around the school. I can just buy it if I need anything.

359
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,350
"Yuyang's Thoughts on Poetry." Wow.

360
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,320
When did you start reading this?

361
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,300
I... casually read it. Improving my literary knowledge.

362
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,830
Weiwei, it's so hot. Don't work too hard.

363
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,550
You have to take care of yourself.

364
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,310
If there's anything wrong, just call us.

365
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,540
Your mom is right. We're not by your side,

366
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,590
so you need to rely on yourself for everything.

367
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,220
I know. I take good care of myself. Don't worry. Why are you getting so emotional?

368
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,890
Let's go. Time to cook.

369
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,200
Hey, but your company is pretty good. It even provides plane tickets to interns.

370
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,990
 I didn't tell Master when I would be back. 

371
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,440
 If I show up in front of him, 

372
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,080
 I wonder if he will be surprised or shocked? 

373
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,830
  Forget it. I'm happy as long as I get to see him.  

374
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,000
It's fine if people have a break on the weekends.

375
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,740
But do elevators need a break, too?

376
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,200
The elevator is fixed?

377
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,850
- Hello, Director Fang. 
- Hello.

378
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm Xiao Yu. I'm sorry for asking you to make a trip on such a hot day.

379
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,930
No problem.

380
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,980
CEO Xiao and the others were originally going to greet you personally,

381
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,480
but they had to take a phone call.

382
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,260
No problem. I came at an inconvenient time.

383
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,570
The key is that the music of the scenario has been released,

384
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,670
and I wanted you guys to listen to it right away.

385
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,810
Also, your President Xiao is an expert in this field.

386
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,140
I want to ask him to give his opinion.

387
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,080
  What's going on? Didn't Master say that today  

388
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,580
  he was the only person in the office?  

389
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,530
  That's why I dared to come straight to his office.  

390
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,460
  What's going on?  

391
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,350
  Not only is Yugong here,  

392
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,940
  but these people seem to be here for him, too.  

393
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,450
  Why don't I just sneak out now? I'll contact him tonight.  

394
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,430
Is this an employee of your company as well?

395
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,500
Uh, this person is a family member of one of our employees.

396
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,280
 Why do I have the feeling of being caught eloping? 

397
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,100
 Director Fang, please come in. 

398
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,690
Okay.

399
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,270
Director Fang, this way, please.

400
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,570
Weiwei Junior, are you eloping right now?

401
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,730
Eloping? I'm clearly performing an act.

402
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,350
This performance of yours really hits people on the head.

403
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,280
- President Xiao.
- Director Fang, sorry to keep you waiting.

404
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,440
It was us who came without notice.

405
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,890
Director Fang, our audio room has the best equipment.

406
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,870
Let's watch it over there.

407
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,830
Okay, let's go.

408
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,630
Come with me.

409
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,120
  Master is so calm. 

410
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,710
  It didn't surprise him at all.  

411
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,690
  And he's walking so fast.  

412
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,050
  Is he in a hurry to settle me down so that he can attend to his guest?  

413
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,300
  Even though it's the right thing to do, 

414
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,970
  he should have welcomed me with a little enthusiasm.  

415
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,250
 It's all right even if just verbally. 

416
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,320
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

417
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,870
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

418
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,420
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

419
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,030
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

420
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,620
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

421
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,230
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

422
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,620
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, ♫ 

423
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,380
 ♫ I'm willing to chase away all the troubles  ♫ 

424
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,830
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

425
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,620
President Xiao, it's improper to make others wait too long in the meeting room.
 ♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫ 

426
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,910
Okay?
 ♫ I want to give you a hug ♫ 

427
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,790
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

428
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,290
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

429
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,680
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

430
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,500
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

431
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,390
The food on the plane was too awful to swallow.
 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

432
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,630
Wait for me here.
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

433
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,020
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

434
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,640
 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

435
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,160
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

436
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,620
 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

437
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,570
  How could I wait for him here?  

438
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,030
  Wouldn't I be too obedient?  

439
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,630
No, I should run away.

440
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,660
  It's not good for me to run away like this, right? 

441
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,030
  This kind of thing... Isn't this kind of thing very normal?  

442
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,670
  If I run away like this, he'll laugh at me.  

443
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,000
Hello, are you Miss Wei?

444
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,590
This is your take-out order. I've delivered it to you.

445
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,070
Thank you for your patronage. It's exactly ¥20. 
 (Note: Approx. $3 USD) 

446
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,530
  Take-out? Did Master order this?  

447
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,550
Okay.

448
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,630
This... Miss, do you have any change?

449
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,490
It's like this.  I happen not to have any change.

450
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,030
Could I get some change from your colleagues?

451
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,870
Why don't we do this? I'll go back to the store with you to get change.

452
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,660
Isn't that too troubling for you?

453
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,140
It's fine. It's fine. I don't want to stay here anyway.

454
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,770
What?

455
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,650
Nothing, nothing. Wait for me here. I'm going to leave a message.

456
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,790
In fact, she could have put it on her tab. This young lady was so worried.

457
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,150
President Xiao's knowledge in the area of music

458
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,270
is even more profound than I imagined.

459
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,600
I never thought that even with something I'm personally very satisfied with,

460
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,220
you could find faults in it.

461
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,220
We all hope the product will be as perfect as possible.

462
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,250
Of course.

463
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,730
But I am confident you will be satisfied next time.

464
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,750
I'm looking forward to it.

465
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,500
Nice working with you.

466
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,790
Promise you'll be satisfied...

467
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,600
Satisfied?

468
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,960
I find that people, when confronting the unknown,

469
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,190
are filled with curiosity.

470
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,150
Hey, will you die if you don't annoy me for a day?

471
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,770
  Thank you for your beef rice.  

472
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,890
 However, I don't have spare change, and he couldn't put it on the tab, 

473
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,950
  so I went to pay at the store.  

474
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
So you ran away.

475
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,880
And you gave such a lame excuse, too.

476
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,000
Hello?

477
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,870
Where are you?

478
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,380
I'm cleaning at Xiao Ling's house.

479
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,560
I can't live at school, so I'm borrowing her place to stay for a while.

480
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,350
Address?

481
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,390
Are you coming over? Let's talk later.

482
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,590
I'm cleaning right now and it's dirty.

483
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,110
I'll come over to find you.

484
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,250
No need. You're too high-profile. I can't afford you.

485
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,660
Weiwei, are you embarrassed?

486
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,680
Bao Gui Garden, building A, 1601.

487
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,330
Bring two bottles of juice when you come.

488
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,530
Go to clean the kitchen.

489
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,350
Don't come out until it's cleaned.

490
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,140
Here.

491
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,050
Thanks for the juice.

492
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,630
Thanks for your hard work!

493
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,850
