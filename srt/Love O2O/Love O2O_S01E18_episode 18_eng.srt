 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,550
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,510
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,640
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,770
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,570
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,410
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,430
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,220
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,600
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,770
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,810
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,450
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,980
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,030
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,340
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,230
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,250
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,460
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,430
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,250
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,160
   

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,130
     

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,870


27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,810
Go and clean the kitchen.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,530
Don't come out until it's cleaned.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,260
Thanks for the juice.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,940
Thanks for your hard work!

31
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,410
Get cleaned up. I'll treat you for a meal.

32
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,300
Hurry up.

33
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm concerned that you'll catch a cold.

34
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,540
Concerned that I'll catch a cold?

35
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,480
By the way, isn't your staff taking two weeks off?

36
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,410
You forced them to take leave but why didn't Yugong take time off?

37
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,180
He has to meet with the director of the music studio to discuss the soundtrack.

38
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,370
For the demo of "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

39
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,910
The rain stopped. We can go now.

40
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,100
Why are you grinning?

41
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,610
Nothing.

42
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,030
I just  think that as soon as you got here,

43
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,310
the weather has improved, too.

44
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,260
We're on the street. What if people see us?

45
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,220
♫  Rain drips on my jacket  ♫

46
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,870
♫  Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes  ♫

47
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,420
♫  The signal you gave me, a smile  ♫

48
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,980
♫  Came at just the right time  ♫

49
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,420
♫  As I pass by you, the tips of your hair  ♫

50
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,140
♫  Are like grass blown by the spring wind  ♫

51
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,520
♫  Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to  ♫

52
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,330
♫  Chase away all the troubles  ♫

53
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,960
♫  I want to take you to the ends of the earth  ♫

54
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,690
♫  I want to listen to your heartbeat  ♫

55
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,750
Why didn't you ask me about my reason for coming here all of a sudden?

56
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,720
 Do I need to? 

57
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,590
  Don't be so narcissistic, okay? Just ask. 

58
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,170
Okay.

59
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,810
Weiwei, why did you come and see me out of the blue?

60
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,750
I'm here for my internship.

61
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,600
I couldn't find any suitable job back at home.

62
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,030
Is your company taking interns?

63
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,850
The standard for hiring at our company is very high.

64
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,280
I only want to be an intern. I won't ask for pay.

65
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,230
For free labor, we have to be even more careful.

66
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,180
Then just what do you want?

67
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,380
Bribe me.

68
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,920
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

69
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,310
Sorry, but other than your beauty,

70
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,890
I don't accept any other form of bribe.

71
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,770
♫  You are so important to me  ♫

72
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:45,180
♫  You are so important to me  ♫

73
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,750
 President Xiao... 

74
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,800
 Director, why is she seducing him for a position as an intern? 

75
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,340
 Isn't that a bit illogical? 

76
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,230
 Weiwei, who cares if it is illogical? 

77
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,250
 It's written that way in the original work. 

78
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,330
 Our production will be a hit! Get to the key scene in ten minutes. 

79
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,810
 Just follow the script. 

80
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,550
 Let's take it from the top. Lighting! Episode one, scene three, 

81
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,760
 "Seducing the despotic company president." 

82
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
 Weiwei, when you come in later, 

83
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,060
 just lean on the door and strike a pose. Okay? 

84
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,040
  Good. Camera, over there. It's your turn. 

85
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,990
 Episode one, scene three, take two.  

86
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,720
 Action! 

87
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,840
 President Xiao, 

88
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,320
 I hear your company is hiring interns. 

89
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,490
 Don't you think I'm a good fit? 

90
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,510
 I'll have to have a try to find out. 

91
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,150
 Cut! 

92
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,550
 Nice Kiss. Again, from a different angle. 

93
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,430
How could I have such a shameful dream?

94
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,340
Forget it quickly! Forget it quickly!

95
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,350
What should I wear to work?

96
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,530
Fortunately, when I went home, Mom and I picked out some new clothes.

97
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,310
 Weiwei, are you already in the capital city? 

98
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,780
Yes, I got here last night.

99
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,300
 You came back to the capital city so suddenly to be an intern. 

100
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
 Is it because you couldn't bear the loneliness in staying away from your boyfriend? 

101
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,790
That's right. So don't come over and be the third wheel.

102
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,610
 How can you be like that?  You favor your boyfriend over your friend? 

103
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm just kidding.

104
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,020
  I'm just kidding, too, Weiwei.  

105
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,070
 You're such a kind and understanding person. You must have already thoroughly cleaned Xiao Ling's place, right? 

106
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,460
 Can I just take my luggage and move in? 

107
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,350
Yeah, but what should we do? I forgot to clean your room.

108
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,270
  No way! Weiwei, how can you be so indecent?  

109
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,690
I'm just kidding.

110
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,180
It's all clean. Come quickly.

111
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,950
  Not bad, not bad. Then I'll come back a little sooner.  

112
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,090
 We'll live our own little married life and I'll work at my internship. 

113
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,110
Tell me when you get here. I'll pick you up at the station.

114
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,020
I'm going to hang up now and head to work.

115
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,950
  Why does it look like a couple's outfit?  

116
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,800
What a coincidence! Should I get changed?

117
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,790
Others will think we did it on purpose.

118
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,980
It's fine. Let's let them think so.

119
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,420
Let's go.

120
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,590
What will I do once I get there?

121
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,730
What do you like to do?

122
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,180
I don't know either.

123
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,240
It's fine as long as I have something to do.

124
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,070
Lately, we've been running tests on our mobile app.

125
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,670
You can work on that for a few days.  After you become familiar with the company, I'll arrange other things for you to do.

126
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,520
Yugong happens to have work in both departments

127
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,310
You can follow him.

128
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,240
Yes, Boss!

129
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,340
You go in first.

130
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,900
I'll find Yugong by myself in a bit.

131
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,810
Why?

132
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,050
No reason. I'm shy.

133
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,220
I understand now.

134
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,090
Understand what?

135
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,220
What "shooting yourself in the foot" means.

136
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,400
Boss, this can't be our new employee, right?

137
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,290
She's an intern.

138
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
  Boss?  

139
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,660
  Is this what they call him at the company?  

140
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,840
Boss, are you guys...

141
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,820
Is this how you communicate in your company?

142
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,490
He's in the Programming Department.

143
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,910
Try to keep your distance from him.

144
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,200
Ah Shuang was afraid of women before,

145
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,920
but in front of you, he seemed to be immune.

146
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,920
With such exaggerated acting,

147
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,480
he must be in the Acting Department.

148
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,700
Boss brought the future boss lady to work.

149
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,490
Really?

150
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,310
Has Boss been taken for life?

151
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,860
I was going to marry my sister off to him.

152
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,940
You can introduce your sister to me. I'm single.

153
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,580
I can't marry my sister off to a good man,

154
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,350
but I can't push her into the flaming pit. Right?

155
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,640
Have you ever seen a flaming pit this handsome?

156
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,290
Boss is already at the entrance.

157
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,670
Weiwei, are you reporting for work right after returning from home?

158
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,620
You're truly our role model.

159
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,700
You take Weiwei on a tour of the company. I have a teleconference.

160
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,330
- Go with him. Complete your newbie village quest.
- Okay.

161
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,620
Third Brother, then am I the mayor of the newbie village?

162
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,950
Mayor, she's all yours.

163
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,370
Junior Weiwei, follow your mayor.

164
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,430
I'll help you get acclimated with the environment of our office.

165
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,720
Our company mainly focuses on development, so the structure is fairly simple.

166
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,030
It's divided into five departments.

167
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,010
Programming, planning, testing, art, and administration.

168
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,320
This is our Art Department.

169
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,140
They have the most people and are also the most cunning.

170
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,120
They're developing the prototype for NPCs.

171
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,600
They would even consider my looks.

172
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
Are you saying that they're using you for an NPC prototype?

173
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,610
Oh, it sounds like fun!

174
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,730
Well... this NPC prototype is the owner for Hospitable Spring Pavilion.  
 (Note:  Common name for a  brothel) 

175
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,910
And her name is Ru Hua.
 (Note:  Ru Hua means flower-like) 

176
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,350
Lately, they have been making the NPC prototypes for the Hospitable Spring Pavilion.

177
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,190
That is to say...

178
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll definitely stay away from them.

179
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,920
This is the Planning Department.  Your husband is in charge.

180
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,530
It also includes the functions of plot planning and data planning.

181
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,790
The rest of the staff are his brothers.

182
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,430


183
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,310
What is it?

184
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,210
Nothing.

185
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,430
It can't be, you... I just said "husband."

186
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,460
- Isn't it just "husband"?
- Eh, Senior, I was just thinking,

187
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,060
in the future, should we tell your future wife

188
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,320
that you want to marry a rich lady?

189
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,710
You are not behaving like a cute girl anymore.

190
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,650
Why did I hear someone address Master as "Boss" just a moment ago?

191
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,950
That's right. There are also those who call him "Brother Xiao."

192
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,810
Like a crime syndicate?

193
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,980
Actually, for us working in internet communications, it is pretty similar to a crime syndicate.

194
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,240
Every day it's from dawn to dusk.

195
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,340
Furthermore, have a look.

196
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,720
All of us are young people, right?

197
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,690
If we called Third Brother something like General Manager,

198
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,090
or CEO Xiao, how lame would that be?

199
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,230
That's right. Here is the Programming Department. I need to introduce it to you in detail,

200
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,930
because this is our company's most awesome department.

201
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,280
Team A is nicknamed the "Hands of Three Masters."

202
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,180
Master?

203
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,930
Your husband doesn't count.

204
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,090
Other than him, Team A has 3 other people.

205
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,510
Do you see that guy? The guy with the crew cut.

206
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,650
That guy... isn't he Senior Hao Mei's friend, the chef who cooks really tasty food?

207
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,310
Yes. But he has another identity.

208
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,710
The famous hacker, K.O. Do you know of him?

209
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,200
Of course, I know of him. He's one of the best hackers in China.

210
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,420
Could it be?

211
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,310
It's him.

212
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,330
You're lying, right?

213
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,860
If I'm lying, I'm this.
 (Note: His hand shape means "wangbadan" which is a jerk) 

214
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,670
This guy was recruited by Third Brother.

215
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,870
I heard that they PK'ed a few times.

216
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,400
Anyhow, now he's a part of our company.

217
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,870
However, not many people know he's K.O.

218
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,550
I only told you because you're family. You have to keep it a secret.

219
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,610
- Actually, you probably told many people, right?
- Impossible.

220
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,020
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

221
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,450
However, even to this day, I still don't know what his name is.

222
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,480
Even his wage is given to him privately by Third Brother.

223
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm very certain that the reason he doesn't say his real name

224
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,330
is because his name is too lame.

225
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,060
Let me introduce you to another expert.

226
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,180
Him. In the future, when you see him, you must go around him.

227
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,730
No matter what you do, don't linger around him.

228
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,460
Why?

229
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,040
Junior Weiwei,

230
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,970
look around. Our entire company is like a monastery.

231
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,220
It's all because of him.

232
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,820
This... This fellow,

233
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,850
if he sees women, he can't write any code.

234
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,690
That serious?

235
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,440
However, don't think he's a good guy.

236
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,600
If you ask me, he must be too lecherous.

237
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,430
Then, with poor self-control, as soon as he sees women, he's unable to keep going.

238
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,910
Therefore, it's better if he doesn't see women at all.

239
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,600
 Why do I feel as though I'm in the realm of Jianghu? 

240
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,050
 These people are experts in Jianghu with weird quirks. 

241
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,230
Didn't you say there were Hands of Three Masters? Where's the other one?

242
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,990
The other one... is that pretty face.

243
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,210
Mr. Beauty Senior?

244
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,610
It feels as if the picture's not quite right.

245
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,110
Right? Aren't you suddenly disillusioned?

246
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,340
Still, it's not bad.

247
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,420
Actually, Mr. Beauty Senior's personality is pretty good.

248
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,250
That's true. Sometimes, having no personality at all is still a type of personality.

249
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,570
That's right, Weiwei. In the company, in the future, you can call me Senior Yugong;

250
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,580
however, don't call him Mo Zhata.

251
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,890
Then what should I call him?

252
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,470
Per the protocol in Jianghu, we call him Brother Mei.

253
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,740
What's wrong?

254
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,080
It's nothing...

255
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,180
I just suddenly want to perform crushing rocks on my chest.
 (Note: "Xiong kou sui da shi" is where you lie with a slab of rock on your chest and someone breaks it with a hammer) 

256
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,180
Hey, Junior. Have a drink to calm your nerves.

257
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,740
Finally, there is our Administrative Department.

258
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,850
There's actually not much to say about the Administrative Department.

259
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,330
You need to remember one point: you must be nice to them

260
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,950
because they are the ones who decide

261
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,080
whether your meal include three dishes with meat and one vegetarian plus drinks, or three vegetarian and one with meat, but no drinks.

262
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,170
The orientation is done.

263
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,330
Now I have to think about what first task I should assign to you.

264
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,250
I've got it. Recently, in testing the mobile game, Ah Shuang is responsible for following up on it.

265
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,220
You can work with Ah Shuang.

266
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,590
Ah Shuang. Ah Shuang!

267
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,290
A new person. I'm giving her to you. Please get along well.

268
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,530
Weiwei, I believe in you!

269
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,860
Hey, wait. Wait! Wait! Don't leave!

270
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,060
Wait. Don't leave!

271
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,400
Hello, I'm Bei Weiwei.

272
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,550
Can I call you Senior Ah Shuang?

273
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,770
I-I-I know. D-Don't come closer.

274
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,170
D-Don't call me that... Anyway, I'm not in charge of you.

275
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,250
Okay, okay.

276
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,030
However, Yugong told me to work with you.

277
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,220
Then go to tell Boss. I-I-I'm not training you.

278
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,020
He's busy right now. Don't be nervous.

279
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,210
Why don't I head over there?

280
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,160
If you need anything, just call me.

281
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,980
They sent a woman over.

282
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,440
What are they doing? A woman in IT just makes things worse.

283
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,860
You've never seen me work.

284
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,290
How could you know if I will cause a mess?

285
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,910
That's right. You haven't given her any task.

286
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,000
How would you know if she'll cause a mess?

287
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,470
Don't you think that I'm afraid of beating you up because K.O. is protecting you?

288
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,260
Come on. Come on.

289
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,120
What's wrong with K.O. helping me? Right, K.O.?

290
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,030
- Hmm.
- Hmm!

291
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,450
Then...

292
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,740
Then you try to solve this problem.

293
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,010
Cell phone testing report?

294
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,340
Th-The 20th page.

295
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,040
Cell phone testing on the issue of compatibility.

296
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
T-There are a few models of cell phones that are incompatible.

297
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,320
G-Go and find all of them.

298
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,110
A-Analyze further and m-make a report.

299
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,910
Is there a budget for finding these phones?

300
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,310
At most ¥600.

301
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,640
No reimbursement for anything above that.

302
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,470
Also, you'd best finish it before tomorrow afternoon.

303
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,350
Find on your own an empty spot around here as your work desk.

304
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,510
All right.

305
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,010
Also!

306
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,380
Don't look for me if you can't finish.

307
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,510
It would be best not to come to the company.

308
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,950
I will try my best.

309
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,710
Good luck!

310
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,750
Good luck! I believe in you.

311
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,440
Why have I never heard of these phones?

312
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,020
GESO.

313
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
Nothing.

314
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,120
Such unpopular phones.

315
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,150
Is there really a need to test them?

316
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,980
Let's try this.

317
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,210
X-f-l-e-x.

318
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,510
What a tongue twister!

319
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,300
¥1,200?

320
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,150
  It's impractical to buy this. 

321
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,820
  If I borrow it... School hasn't started and no classmates are here.  

322
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,050
  This is quite challenging. How should I solve it?  

323
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,960
  Forget it. I'll look over the report first.  

324
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,710
 I should understand the cell phone test first. 

325
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,860
Third Brother,

326
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,600
is the teleconference done?

327
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,770
First off, I'm not here to badmouth someone.

328
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,830
Banshan... I don't know whether his brain is cramping today, or he took the wrong medicine.

329
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,560
He put Weiwei under Ah Shuang.

330
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Who doesn't know what Ah Shuang is like?

331
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,630
Now that Third Sister-in-Law has fallen under Ah Shuang's control...

332
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,410
Did you finish the optimization task I told you about?

333
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,190
Let's put work aside for a moment! I'm fired up!

334
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,890
I'm worrying for Third Sister-in-Law's well-being and reporting to you. Look at you...

335
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,020
Right, you probably don't know the latest news.

336
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,580
Do you remember that a couple of phone models are incompatible with our mobile game?

337
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,700
Ah Shuang wants Weiwei

338
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,350
to find all the incompatible phones and do more in-depth testing.

339
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,570
Is that necessary?

340
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,090
In my opinion, it's a waste of people and resources.

341
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,830
From what I can see, Ah Shuang is purposely making it hard for her.

342
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,400
Oh.

343
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,510
Is that it?

344
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,010
Go back to work if there's nothing else.

345
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,190
Even a tiger won't eat its own cubs.

346
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,680
Are you're really okay allowing others to bully her?

347
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,060
We'll regard it as a quest in the newbie village.

348
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,730
If she works under me, it will be even more difficult.

349
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,770
You win. You win. It's really a case of "A great man needs to be ruthless," right?

350
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:59,970


351
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,180
I have an appointment at noon. Go to have lunch with Yugong and the others.

352
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,680
Okay. I'll eat with... the mayor of the newbie village.

353
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,950
- Your drinks. 
 - Thanks.

354
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,800
I don't understand.

355
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,760
You assigned Weiwei to Ah Shuang.

356
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,350
When Third Sister-in-Law showed up at the office, Ah Shuang was already very displeased.  
 (Note: Ah Shuang means very pleased.  This is a pun.) 

357
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,830
And yet you let him train her?

358
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,660
Is it appropriate?

359
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm fighting fire with fire.

360
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
Look at our company. We're all lonely young men, one after another.

361
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,450
The only woman, comrade Weiwei, is already taken.

362
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,990
If I don't take action, what are we bachelors going to do in the future?

363
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,080
Seeing how tough our Third Sister-in-Law is,

364
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,540
she can definitely cure Ah Shuang.

365
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,840
At that time, we can...

366
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,610
find girls.

367
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,740
You make it sound as if someone would want you just because there are girls there.

368
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,270
It increases the odds.

369
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,490
Third Sister-in-Law, what task did Ah Shuang assign to you this morning?

370
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,430
Finding phones.

371
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,450
- What kind of phones? 
 - How dare you to ask?

372
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,750
Before tomorrow afternoon, Ah Shuang wants Third Sister-in-Law to

373
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,800
finish the phone incompatibility report.

374
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,750
Is there a need for such urgency?

375
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,920
Besides, those incompatible phones are probably already gone from the market.

376
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,950
That's right. It's apparent that he is giving her a hard time on purpose.

377
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,630
Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry. I'll help you beat him up.

378
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,810
No, no. I'll let Xiao Nai deal with him.

379
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,830
No need. Don't trouble Xiao Nai with something minor like this.

380
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,760
Also, I feel that

381
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,510
Ah Shuang looks down on women in IT.

382
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,800
If I go to Xiao Nai, doesn't that prove his point?

383
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,170
Is there something like that, too?

384
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,580
Yes, yes. I heard it, too. He said,

385
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,710
"Women in IT will just cause trouble."

386
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,080
But I've already thought of a solution

387
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,670
to make Ah Shuang change his views about women in IT.

388
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,570
What solution?

389
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,950
It's a secret.

390
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,010
 Today, you ate the most. Let me tell you. 

391
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,490
 - It's you who eats the most, you glutton.
- Hey. 

392
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,780
Hey, Third Brother, why are you just leaving now?

393
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,880
I made an appointment for 1 o'clock.

394
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,510
I saw your bicycle over there. Let me borrow your key for a bit.

395
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,450
It's the office key.

396
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,780
The key to the bicycle is in a drawer in my office. Get it yourself.

397
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,720
The office key?

398
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm leaving now. Be careful.

399
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,910
Bye-bye.

400
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,810
I definitely need to talk to him.

401
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,310
How could he give the keys to the office so casually to someone?

402
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,800
In case Third Sister-in-Law is a mole, what should we do if she steals the code?

403
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,720
Such thoughtless behavior!

404
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,460
Hey, Brother, do you believe you can steal the code simply by having keys?

405
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,260
How shrewd is Third Brother? Each code has a 128-bit encryption.

406
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,170
It's an encryption code with an asymmetric combination.

407
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,760
That is to say that, not only would you fail to crack it, it would also destroy the computer.

408
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,540
So, Third Sister-in-Law plus keys

409
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,950
- is still of no use.
- It's an issue of principles.

410
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,880
What are you coughing–

411
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
If I were a mole,

412
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,300
I would sell you two off first.

413
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,480
Everyone's off work so early today.

414
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,200
Everyone left?

415
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,890
They went to have dinner.

416
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,450
Then, are you waiting for me?

417
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,550
I also got back late and didn't make it in time.

418
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,110
What are we eating tonight?

419
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,080
I ordered take-out. My lady will have to make do with eating together with me.

420
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,180
What task did Ah Shuang give you?

421
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,610
There are a few phones that are incompatible with the app version of the mobile game.

422
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,830
Ah Shuang wants me to give an analysis report by noon tomorrow.

423
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,310
Noon tomorrow? Did you solve it?

424
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,550
I have a preliminary solution.

425
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,870
I've found all the phones. I just need to test them,

426
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,850
and then can I finish the report.

427
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,300
I saved the company a lot of money.

428
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,230
I bought all the cell phones and still have about ¥500 left. 
 (Note: Approx. $75 USD) 

429
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,100
My lady, are you showing your achievements right now?

430
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,610
Yes, I'm asking for praise.

431
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,610
Nothing to praise. Of the leftover money,

432
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,760
a portion of it is yours.

433
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,420
What?

434
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,710
According to my stock calculations, about 250 belongs to you.
 (Note: Calling someone 250 means they're dimwitted) 

435
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,160
It's you who's 250.

436
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,680
You like eating this.

437
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,660
It's discourteous not to reciprocate.

438
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,070
Right, I have to thank you.

439
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,700
Thank me for what?

440
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,600
Thank you for assigning me to Ah Shuang.

441
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,560
Actually, I was afraid you would be in charge of me from the start.

442
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,700
That'd be so awkward.

443
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,100
Anyway, it's great like this.

444
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm really looking forward to what Ah Shuang will have me do next.

445
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,140
My lady, you put too much thought into the decision.

446
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,180
Letting Yugong take care of you was just to save myself the trouble.

447
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,980
You're lying to me again! Don't eat the ribs anymore.

448
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,010
I'm taking them all.

449
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:59,490
GESO, the second generation.

450
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,470
During the game,

451
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,870
there's a problem with the screen flickering.

452
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,090
The problem probably lies within the video card.

453
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,710
 With the X-Flex, a frequent recurring issue 

454
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,950
 was its crashing upon startup. 

455
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,700
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

456
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,480

 ♫ And make the whole world know ♫ 

470
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,690
 ♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫ 

471
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,160
 ♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫ 

472
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,850
 ♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫ 

473
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,420
 ♫ Because I’ve already found (you) ♫ 

474
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,160
 ♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫ 

475
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,440
 ♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫ 

476

 ♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫ 

477

 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

478

 ♫ You are so important to me ♫ 

483
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,100
Senior Ah Shuang, this is the detailed report.

484
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,880
I have included in it all the phone models, their respective issues, and the associated assessment.

485
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,030
I've also added some early suggestions, just for your reference.

486
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,350
W-W-What is this?

487
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,050
These are all the incompatible phones.

488
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:02,010
But I didn't go over budget. I only spent ¥150.

489
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,660
I found some used phone shops and websites that repair old phones.

490
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,390
I rented each phone at the price of ¥15 a day. 
 (Note: Approx. $2 USD) 

491
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,090
I only need to return them today.

492
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,470
Senior Ah Shuang, I've completed the report based on your time and budget requirements.

493
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,830
If you are satisfied with my work so far,

494
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,160
you can assign me other tasks.

495
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,660
I...

496
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,930
You go first. I'll look at the report.

497
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
All right.

498
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,000
     

499
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,760
  It's 12. Remember to eat. Also, 

500
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,820
  I won't be eating with you today. I'm going to pick up Erxi.  

501
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,910
  Come back soon.  

502
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,230
  Don't be late this afternoon.  

503
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,340
  No wonder she's Master's family.  

504
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,070
Hello? What do you need me for?

505
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,830
Okay. I'll see you later.

506
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,020
Erxi!

507
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,070
- Weiwei! 
 - Let me take it.

508
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,160
How are you?

509
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,150
It's pretty heavy!

510
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,640
I missed you so much!

511
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:09,980


512
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,560
 ♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫ 

513
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,340
 ♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫ 

514
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,860
 ♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫ 

515
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,520
 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫ 

516
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,870
 ♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫ 

517
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,640
 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

518
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,090
 ♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫ 

519
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,820
 ♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫ 

520
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,410
 ♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫ 

521
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,770
