00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,540
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,610
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,700
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,720
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,490
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,520
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,170
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,780
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,770
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,720
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,820
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,720
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,980
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,190
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,000
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,240
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,210
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,400
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,460
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,450
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,220
   

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,340
     

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you doing later?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,870
I'm going to Zhen Yi Technology to get my internship pay. Who's coming with me?

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,260
- I've got plans with my Da Zhong.
- Uh,

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,780
I'm at that time of the month.

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,120
There's no love for your classmate!

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,100
Even if I had any, I wouldn't give any to you.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,070
I'll be going first.

33
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,400
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

34
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,410
Weiwei.

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,320
Okay. In any case, I don't have anything to do.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,550
Yeah!

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,330
- Let's go!
- Wait for me for a second. I need to answer a call of nature.

38
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,910
Very fast.

39
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,690
Quickly.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,970
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,890
Classmate Erxi!

42
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,660
Didn't I tell you to pretend that we were strangers? Don't you understand Chinese?

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,320
Wait a second!

44
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,300
Then, this classmate whom I don't know,

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,800
you should look up, because...

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Ah!

47
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,960
Bei Weiwei.

48
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,150
I'm going to study abroad soon.

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm here to do the paperwork today.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,130
Congratulations.

51
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,560
I...

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm very sorry...

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,830
for the troubles I caused you and Xiao Nai

54
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,460
with my immature behavior.

55
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,040
It's fine.  Actually, it's all right.

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,490
Wei–

57
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,100
Weiwei, I envy you.

58
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,630
Not just for your relationship with Xiao Nai,

59
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,920
but even more

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,710
for having true friends who treat you with sincerity.

61
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,070
Between friends, sincerity is the most precious.

62
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,390
If you really are sincere to others, the other party will definitely feel it

63
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,590
and treat you the same way.

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,400
I believe

65
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,500
you will also find your own true friends.

66
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,830
It's too late for me to recognize that,

67
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,730
but I think I still have opportunities.

68
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,130
Bei Weiwei, thank you.

69
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,320
I hope everything goes well for you.

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,240
Wish you all the best, too.

71
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,830
Bye-bye.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,810
Weiwei! What did the campus beauty queen say to you?

73
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,960
Why do I feel that she is a little prettier than usual?

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,620
Nothing. She just told me she's going to study abroad in the next term.

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,200
Also, she is really envious of me for having a bad friend like you.

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,920
Who's a bad friend? I'm clearly the national best girlfriend.

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,460
Enough, already!

78
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,830
Weiwei, since she's gone, aren't you now promoted as the school beauty queen?

79
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,030
About that,

80
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,440
write an anonymous post to the forum,

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,340
saying that a married woman...
- What?

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,830
No, girls with boyfriends can't compete as the campus beauty queen. How's that?

83
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,160
Just forget it. Miss Married,

84
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,630
you are guaranteed to be the beauty queen.

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,360
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Come in with me. Wait in the lobby. No one will notice.

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,980
I'll wait here.

88
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,990
Let's go. It's fine.

89
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,940
Sit here, I'll go up to get my salary.

90
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,590
If they dock my pay, you must fight your way up there once I call you, understand?

91
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,240
Got it.

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,860
   

93
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,690
 This person seems familiar. 

94
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,990
So he's from Zhen Yi Technology?

95
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,480
I got it! I got it! Let me pay you back.

96
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,060
Let's spend the rest on a feast!

97
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,350
This person... do you know who this is?

98
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,040
This is Director Li, the head of game development.

99
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,630
What's wrong?

100
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,370
I'll tell you later.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,230
To ensure fairness, we must use the external server

102
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,900
provided by Feng Teng, under the conditions of the real network environment.

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,000
The rest is the same as our test in the office.  So don't be nervous.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,780
But I'm still nervous, Third Brother.

105
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,930
Are you sure I should go up with you first?

106
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,980
You can't let me be the first to suffer a casualty because I am handsome.

107
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,040
Heck!  In terms of handsomeness, I am certainly number one.

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,120
Third Brother only brings you to serve as the contrast and to best show off how great he looks.

109
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,660
Very good. You still have the energy to joke around.

110
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,360
This means you're not too nervous.

111
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,010
We're still a little nervous,

112
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,230
but not as much as Ah Shuang who can't come due to diarrhea caused by anxiety.

113
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,570
Ah Shuang flaked out at this critical moment.

114
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,810
  The number you dialed cannot be reached at the moment. 

115
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,150
  Why is his phone off? 

116
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,180
- May I ask if you are the team from Zhi Yi?
- Yes.

117
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,230
Okay. Please follow me.

118
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,510
So President Xiao is here.

119
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,910
- Director Wang.
- Welcome, welcome.

120
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,570
Director He, sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,440
No, not at all. We just got here, too.

122
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,430
Is this the team from  Zhi Yi?

123
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,960
Fresh college graduates, very young indeed.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,510
That's right.

125
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,720
- Director Li.
- Welcome.

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,330
Director Wang,  Director He.

127
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,380
This is...?

128
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,280
We at Zhen Yi are led by the son of President Zhen.  This is Director Zhen.

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,260
- Director Wang.
 - Welcome.
- Director He.

130
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
Welcome.

131
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,610
My goodness, it's true that every generation has its heroes.

132
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,890
Seeing such young teams is making me feel my age (old).

133
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,300
Since everyone is here, let's move inside.

134
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,100
Why are all their phones turned off?

135
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,080
Just what's going on?

136
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,690
Do you remember when we had a meal with Meng Yiran?

137
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,480
I bumped into someone familiar. He's of one Xiao Nai's staff.

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,410
I saw him with Director Li of Zhen Yi.

139
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,770
Isn't it strange for both of them to get together?

140
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,720
Erxi, do you think this will be harmful to Xiao Nai?

141
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,570
It shouldn't. Perhaps, it was merely a case of a casual meal because they know each other.

142
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,490
I don't think it's that simple. I still have to call to find out.

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,030
 The number you are calling has been switched off. 

144
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,720
Why is it still turned off?

145
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Weiwei, don't panic yet. He must have turned off his phone as a requirement before the demo. That's why you can't get through.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,920
Let's go home first.

147
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,640
Director Wang.

148
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,570
Since this is not a public presentation. I ask everyone to feel at ease.

149
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,930
Just relax. Once President Feng is here, we will start.

150
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,830
- All right.
- All right.

151
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,250
President Feng is here.

152
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,200
President Feng.

153
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,520
Please sit.

154
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,850
President Feng, this is the team from Zhi Yi Technology and the other team is from Zhen Yi Technology.

155
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,790
They will be presenting separately their demos later.

156
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,380
President Feng's flight is at 1:00 p.m.; hence, time is rather tight.

157
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,450
Every team only has thirty minutes.

158
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,710
Okay, let's get started.

159
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,850
Director He and I have discussed in advance. We will go in alphabetical order. Hence, Zhen Yi goes first.

160
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,490
Okay. Thank you, Director Wang.

161
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,410
It's my honor to represent Zhen Yi Technology today

162
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,970
to present the product of our research.

163
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,470
Besides being the project manager for Zhen Yi,

164
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,900
I'm also a veteran player of "A Chinese Ghost Story."

165
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,380
At Zhen Yi, all of our design effort for "A New Chinese Ghost Story"

166
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,250
insists on placing the players' need as our top priority.

167
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,270
For a player to be attracted to a game,

168
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,520
it's not just because of repetitive battles and limitless level advancement.

169
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,710
More importantly is the interaction with other players

170
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,310
and their relationships. So, on top of the original game structure,

171
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,620
we've added even more interactive systems.

172
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,390
We will introduce to everyone a more complex and  interesting romantic relationship system,

173
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,340
family system, alliance system, and large missions that can scale up to hundreds of players, etc.

174
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,580
President Feng, let's look at our demo.

175
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,220
My presentation ends here. Thank you, everyone.

176
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,750
Not bad.

177
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,370
The online gaming technology has reached its peak at this stage.

178
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,340
Some minor breakthroughs cannot provide the players with new excitement.

179
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,470
To introduce innovation in the area of playing approach, I think Zhen Yi has done very well.

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,080
Zhen Yi's product is definitely very interesting.

181
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,350
Then next, it's Zhi Yi's team.

182
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,880
Hello, everyone. I'm Xiao Nai.

183
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,220
Next, my team and I will present

184
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,720
our design concept for "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

185
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,260
Your demo is so small. Did you have to rush it out?

186
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,960
I heard you don't have a lot of programmers.

187
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,610
We have eight.

188
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,720
Although they are all top students,

189
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,260
but with such a development resource, it's really...

190
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,110
Even though Zhi Yi doesn't have a lot of staff members,

191
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,250
but each and every one of them has the ability to lead in his specialty.

192
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,400
Also, the members know each other well and have a strong teamwork.

193
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,650
Moreover, a small client app

194
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,810
is not equal to the poor quality of the game.

195
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,490
On the contrary, it makes it easier for the player to download.

196
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,250
I hope I can demonstrate this point to Director He.

197
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,810
You can start.

198
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,380
 Director Li, everything is going smoothly. 

199
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,320
Feng Teng provided us with a server of the same configuration.

200
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,580
Zhen Yi had no problems with the connection. Why is there a problem with Zhi Yi?

201
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,060
Could it be that there's a flaw of the game itself?

202
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,150
This is not right. I can't even connect through the physical link.

203
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,930
Physical link?

204
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,550
Where did it go wrong?

205
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,470
Could there be a problem with our server?

206
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,550
What's going on?

207
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,160
- Check with IT now. 
- Yes, Director Wang.

208
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,000
President Feng, Director Wang,  IT has checked.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,780
They said that the server we allocated to Zhi Yi is experiencing issues.

210
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,350
They are not sure what caused the server to have this abnormal shutdown.

211
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,450
It might take them half an hour to restart it.

212
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,850
Half an hour? But President Feng needs to rush to the airport in forty-five minutes.

213
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,920
We can't delay President Feng's flight. We either decide now or change to a different time.

214
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,850
It's not practical to change the time. We need to check Director He's schedule.

215
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,260
Director He will be in the States for three months. This can't wait.

216
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,420
Why don't we decide now?

217
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,830
I think that Zhen Yi's product has done a fairly good job.

218
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,720
Zhen Yi's ideas are really creative.  Zhi Yi's may not be as good as Zhen Yi's.

219
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,160
- Moreover, it's important for the collaboration to run smoothly. It didn't go smoothly from the start. 
- That's right.

220
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,020
Connect it to the mirror server.

221
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,330
- You have a backup server? 
- You are using your own server,

222
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,020
but the configuration of your server is different from what's provided by Feng Teng.

223
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,780
This is not fair to Zhen Yi.

224
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,360
Prior to the presentation, we prepared a backup on a server

225
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,410
of the same configuration.

226
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,620
The reason is to mitigate the potential risk.

227
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,470
President Feng, this is the login credentials for the remote server.

228
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,460
The IT staff at Feng Teng can log in anytime

229
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,420
and check all the configurations of the server.

230
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,160
Online games are a commercial product.

231
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,560
Every second of its operation will affect the reputation and revenues of the company.

232
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,310
That's why stability is crucial.

233
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,750
Recently, we had many mishaps on the internet.

234
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,290
In order to prevent the negative impact of this risk,

235
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,020
Zhi Yi, when designing our server architecture,

236
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,060
took into account the real-time failover at the alternate site.

237
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,410
Under this infrastructure, in case of a catastrophic event,

238
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,020
another mirrored server will be activated immediately to allow the players to continue.

239
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,550
This will allow the game to continue its normal operation to the largest degree

240
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,920
and to the extent possible, to minimize the occurrence of accidents.

241
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,460
This is always a goal we at Zhi Yi pursue.

242
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,380
It's also our promise for our joint operation in the future

243
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,450
to Feng Teng.

244
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:18,490
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

245
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,860
They are a such young team yet so detailed and reliable with their work.

246
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,490
Really beyond my expectations.

247
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,650
They came prepared.

248
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,330
Director Wang, I don't believe in coincidence.

249
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,330
I understand.  I've already asked someone to investigate this.

250
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,950
Next, I would like to ask our team member

251
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,500
to share the special features of "A New Chinese Ghost Story" with everyone.

252
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,710
We've redesigned our game engine

253
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,770
from using a single threaded logic to multi-threaded.

254
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,830
The biggest limiting factors are the calculation capabilities of the CPU and graphics processor.

255
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,550
President Feng,  changing a single threaded to multi-threaded means–

256
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,050
I know. No need to explain it to me.

257
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,990
Between the individual computer game and the online game,

258
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,100
the biggest difference is in

259
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,950
the interaction between NPCs and the players.

260
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,890
If the NPCs roles are very rigid, then the players will naturally lose interest.

261
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,360
As a result, for our NPCs, we have specifically

262
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,630
created complex behavior trees.

263
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,080
We've done all we can to make them more intelligent.

264
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,510
Both parties can have livelier interactions.

265
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
Interesting, right?

266
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,680
The weather in our game will simulate the actual weather to the maximum extent possible.

267
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,940
There will be four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter; as well as days and nights.

268
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,390
There's warm and sunny weather. And, of course, there's also an extended rainy season.

269
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,590
Our main objective is to allow the players to feel the joy of the changes of weather

270
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,420
without even stepping out of the house. Thank you.

271
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,330
With such complex graphics changes,

272
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,470
it must place a high demand on computer hardware.

273
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,850
However, if playing games require upgrading their computers,

274
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,940
could it become, to our players,

275
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,110
inconvenient and difficult to play?

276
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,150
Director He's question is the key point of what we want to present next.

277
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,360
Without lowering the quality of the game, yet reducing the requirements of the computer,

278
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,180
it has always been the objective of our effort in optimization.

279
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,600
Next, we will use the large-scale, "He Bo Flood Quest"
 (Note: He Bo is the river god of the Yellow River) 

280
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,430
as an example.

281
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,250
In the game, since there is extensive rain,

282
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,810
they will naturally cause floods to occur.

283
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,400
The "He Bo Flood," a full-server disaster relief quest that we've set up.

284
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,410
Within the time limit, players, not only have to

285
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,250
escort NPCs to safe areas,

286
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,150
they, also, have to address post-disaster reconstruction and drought relief as part of the content.

287
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,630
This features a dynamic mission chain to ensure that the players

288
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,160
will not develop the dislike or boredom toward the quest.

289
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,140
Next, we will simulate the scenario when thousands of player start the mission

290
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,260
to really test how the server performs under pressure.

291
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,190
   

292
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,910
Wow, that's amazing.

293
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,420
President Feng, I feel that this...

294
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,150
Okay, I know you understand. I won't explain then.

295
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,920
10,000 people were playing simultaneously online yet it runs so smoothly.

296
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,950
This is so difficult.  Not just for "A New Chinese Ghost Story,"

297
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,420
if we integrate this technology into other games as well,

298
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,240
then our revenue will really be...

299
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,350
Above are some of the new concepts and designs for "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

300
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,020
Before I conclude our presentation,

301
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,720
we would like to share with everyone the ideals of Zhi Yi Technology:

302
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,350
Insistence on original innovation and proliferation of our culture.

303
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,550
From the day we chose to start up our own business and established this gaming company,

304
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,610
the majority of the people had doubts about us

305
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,750
because we were young and inexperienced.

306
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,500
Also, many people view gaming as something people do without a constructive purpose.

307
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,820
But in my eyes, a game is the same as a book, a movie

308
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,150
or a museum.

309
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,100
It's not only just entertainment,

310
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,340
it's also a carrier that is a medium to spread our culture.

311
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,770
They are all an avenue to expose people to our culture,

312
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,950
fostering their understanding naturally.

313
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,290
While playing the game, players can come into contact

314
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,510
and experience all the nuances of Chinese culture.

315
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,760
Hence, the goal of Zhi Yi is not only just to produce popular games,

316
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,480
but we also hope that through the world we construct

317
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,580
is to help make more people understand Chinese culture.

318
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,610
So that is the reason why we always insist on creating our own engine.

319
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,750
Only by having our own engine can we create

320
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,200
completely different from other cultures,  and a world that belongs solely to the Chinese culture.

321
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,350
We want to build a world

322
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,640
that originally only existed in literature and imagination.

323
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Of course, we wouldn't impose our ideas and opinions on the players,

324
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,080
but instead, present and enrich them through all the details of the game.

325
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,220
This is what constitutes the entire structure of our game

326
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,940
and our worldview.

327
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,700
Feng Teng is also devoted to spreading traditional culture.

328
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,220
Zhi Yi's thoughts on this

329
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,900
happen to match ours.

330
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,070
Thank you, President Feng. This concludes our presentation.

331
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,760
Thank you, everyone.

332
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,670
Of course, Zhi Yi Technology's ideas are pretty good,

333
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,130
but I personally believe marketability is still the first priority.

334
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,020
When compared to the interactive system's playability and continuity that Zhi Yi emphasizes,

335
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,750
it's a little better.

336
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,020
My view is different from Director He.

337
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,910
"A New Chinese Ghost Story" isn't just a simple continuation of "A Chinese Ghost Story."

338
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,690
If there aren't any marked differences, there's no need to launch a new product.

339
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,270
The superiority of the engine that Zhi Yi Technology developed is obvious.

340
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,270
We can apply it to our future games.

341
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,890
President Feng, it's almost time.

342
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,130
My gratitude to both young teams

343
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,800
for showing us the result of your own development effort.

344
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,530
Everyone, please wait in the waiting area outside the conference room.

345
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,230
We will announce our decision in a short while after our internal discussions.

346
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,940
Uncle Li, your pacing is very annoying.

347
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,520
The situation is not beneficial to us now.  My heart is...

348
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,160
It's already done. We have tried our best.

349
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,290
If we lose, it means we were not good enough.

350
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,150
Did you discuss this in advance? Why didn't I know about the backup server?

351
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,650
Of course, you wouldn't know.

352
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,420
Before we came, Third Brother told me to take precautions.

353
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,550
I really didn't expect a problem would really crop up.

354
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,240
At that time, I panicked and almost forgot about our backup.

355
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,470
But talking about this, it's strange, too. Why is there a sudden problem with their server?

356
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,200
I'm flying to New York now.

357
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,400
Let's talk about our contract when I'm back.

358
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,230
I will be available at your convenience, President Feng.

359
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,380
Thank you for your support of Feng Teng.

360
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,550
I could feel your sincerity.

361
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,410
I hope we will have the opportunity to collaborate in the future.

362
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,330
Thank you, President Feng.

363
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,410
Director He, escort me downstairs.

364
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,620
Sorry about our embarrassing incident.

365
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,090
Although I don't want to admit it, you won this time.

366
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,060
I admit my defeat without complaint.

367
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,820
Let's go.

368
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,250
- Yeah! 
- Yeah!

369
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,950
Don't act so depressed.

370
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,040
Although we lost, we must lose with grace.

371
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,570
Zhi Yi was better than us with their design and technology.

372
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,770
I fully accept their win.

373
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,260
However, you should not be discouraged, either.

374
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,050
Although we lost this,  if we learn from our experience this time,

375
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,710
we can come fully prepared next time.

376
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,940
We will definitely create an even better game and defeat Zhi Yi.

377
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,420
You have been working overtime. It has been tough. Go home and get some rest.

378
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,540
Sorry, manager.

379
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,190
It wasn't your responsibility. Don't blame yourself.

380
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,930
I am the one in charge of the project. Hence, it's my responsibility.

381
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,620
If Feng Teng didn't bring forward the presentation date,

382
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,510
I believe we could have done even better.

383
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,660
Take three days of leave with pay and then come back to work.

384
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,910
Where is Director Li?

385
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,190
Wasn't he behind us just now?

386
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,020
Fine. I'm going to find him for some other matters. Go back to the hotel first.

387
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,810
Yes, Manager.

388
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,120
President Zhen, sorry.

389
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,720
We didn't get the project.

390
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,110
I didn't expect this either.  I though we would definitely win.

391
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,030
didn't expect Xiao Nai to be so formidable. He even prepared a mirror server.

392
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,850
I think Director He was exposed as well.

393
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes, I understand.

394
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,640
I will console Young Master.

395
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,900
All right. I will hang up now, President Zhen.

396
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,820
I wonder how they are doing.

397
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,840
You are back.

398
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm here to buy you a midnight snack.

399
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,330
We won.

400
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,260
That's so great!

401
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,660
Here!

402
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,760
Comrades, we got the project.

403
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,620
Isn't that great?  Isn't it?

404
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,910
Good job! It was so easy, without any doubt.

405
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,700
So easy!

406
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,730
Thank you for your effort during this period. You worked hard.

407
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,040
Here's a toast to everyone.

408
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,960
Come! Let's drink.

409
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,370
I thought you would celebrate in Shanghai.

410
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,870
Why did you come back?

411
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,160
Isn't it because we missed you?

412
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,600
Anyway, we can have a feast in Shanghai when we are there to discuss the contract.

413
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,610
Okay?

414
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,710
Eat more tonight. Anyway, someone's picking up the tab.

415
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,170
- No one is allowed to leave until you get drunk. 
- Yes!

416
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,490
Let me tell you.

417
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:54,030
I didn't eat anything on the plane just to save my stomach for this feast. I'm so starved.

418
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,520
Order more. We must not make it easy for Third Brother today.

419
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,840
- There are still lots of food here. 
- Are you stupid?

420
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,240
It's so rare that we get to extort a meal out of Third Brother today.

421
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,590
Furthermore, I'm the core force of this team.

422
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,340
I must eat more to replenish my brain cells I lost during this period.

423
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,390
Order and eat more.

424
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,020
Okay, gorgeous. We are adding orders.

425
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,350
Expensive restaurants usually have lukewarm services.

426
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,100
Eat more. Someone is treating.

427
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,050
Everyone, do you have any suggestions? If not, I'll take care of it.

428
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,150
Sure.

429
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,240
Two dozen raw oysters, two dozen scallops,

430
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,200
two dozen clams,

431
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,750
and... two servings of river snails.

432
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,100
Hey, does anyone want some beer?

433
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,040
Make it red wine. Beer doesn't mix with seafood.

434
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,560
Fine, red wine then. Make it quick.

435
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,890
Third Brother, let me give you a toast

436
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,930
for treating everyone to the feast today.

437
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,310
Isn't Hao Mei the one paying today?

438
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,040
Huh...

439
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,480
Why is it me?

440
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,820
I remember that before the meeting that day, we were all discussing

441
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,130
about where Hao Mei would take us for seafood.

442
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,360
The reason is... two houses.

443
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,640
Right, right, right. I almost forgot.

444
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,380
Brother Mei, don't be a person who goes back on his promises.

445
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,380
- This meal is on you.
- That's right. A man must keep his words.

446
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,680
Right? Right!

447
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,750
Help. Can I cancel my order?

448
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,630
Brother Mei, be more generous.

449
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,590
That's right. Don't be so petty.

450
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,420
Then you guys would let Third Brother get away this easily?

451
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,690
Next weekend, I will take everyone on a trip.

452
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,710
Woah!

453
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,570
So Brother Xiao is the generous one.

454
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,750
I love you!

455
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,170
Brother Mei, what else do you have to say?

456
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,520
I'll check my bank account...

457
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,510
Third Brother, you are too evil.

458
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,350
You are too kind.  I am at most a dust storm

459
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,900
Here, here, eat some crab.

460
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,570
No one will dare offend you again.

461
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,420
Too late. You just offended me.

462
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,670
I didn't think I would be paying for this.

463
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,880
This is all my money;

464
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,140
the money I've earned with my blood and sweat!

465
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,370
Are your blood and sweat worth this much?

466
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,700
Your blood and sweat.

467
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,430
Brother Mei, shouldn't you be telling us about your houses now?

468
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,410
- Huh?
- That's right.

469
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,790
Didn't my parents come last month?

470
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,520
I didn't want to return to my old village to work.

471
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,870
My parents bought it for my future wife.

472
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,970
Then, why did they buy two?

473
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,860
Could it be...

474
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,720
- Do you want to marry and have two wives?
- Third Brother, you–

475
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,520
Dust storms don't happen only once.

476
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,410
Have this.

477
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,610
We don't even have a girlfriend,

478
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,020
and he's going to marry two?

479
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,340
That's right!

480
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,450
W-W-Wait a minute. I almost forgot.

481
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,790
M-My house still has some room.

482
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,930
You can stay there if you want. I won't collect rent.

483
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,250
Me!

484
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,310
But... uh, the room's very small.

485
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,980
Only one person can live there. You all...

486
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,880
Brother, we've lived together for four years.

487
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,760
- It's enough.
- You wouldn't abandon me, w-would you?

488
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,380
I even have showered with Brother Mei before.

489
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,480
Can you match that?

490
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,830
Yugong, you better think carefully.

491
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,760
If you bring your girlfriend there in the future,

492
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,890
- wouldn't Brother Mei steal her? 
- That's right.

493
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,360
I will take my girlfriend and go to take refuge with Brother Mei.

494
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,590
Your feet stink. Brother Mei won't be able to take it.

495
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,420
- I will go. 
- His feet stink more than mine. He doesn't even wash his socks.

496
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,040
W-W-Wait a minute. We're all brothers here.

497
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,360
No matter who stays, my conscience won't rest easy.

498
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,580
How about this? You guys discuss a bit and tell me the results.

499
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,200
Just like that, okay?

500
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,720
 Come. Let's drink. 

501
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,780
 Here. Have another one. 

502
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,500
Why is Senior Ah Shuang not here?

503
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,410
He resigned.

504
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,270
So did he really betray everyone?

505
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,270
How did you know?

506
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,880
When I was meeting Erxi, I saw Ah Shuang with another stranger.

507
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,310
When I went with Erxi to pick up her pay today,

508
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,940
I found out that the person was in charge of the game development at Zhen Yi,

509
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,810
so I called you because I thought there was something suspicious,

510
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,360
but your phone was turned off.

511
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,830
It's not convenient during a demo meeting.

512
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,980
But why did Ah Shuang do that?

513
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
  Come. Let me give you a toast. 

514
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,810
 Come. Another one. 

515
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,070
 Third Brother, I'm here to see you regarding some matters. 

516
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,410
 I want to know the reason. 

517
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,410
 So you know it all already. 

518
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,140
 I have a childhood friend, 

519
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,910
 who developed a small game, 

520
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,810
 but his girlfriend 

521
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,140
 betrayed him and sold it to Zhen Yi. 

522
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,670
 In a burst of anger, my childhood friend 

523
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,450
 still released the game. 

524
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,140
 He was subsequently sued by Zhen Yi for stealing trade secrets. 

525
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,680
 Zhen Yi found me because of this. 

526
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,280
 This friend is really important to me, so I had to betray Zhi Yi, 

527
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,920
 but I only told them about our progress on the game, nothing else, so can you– 

528
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,580
 Boss, I'm sorry. 

529
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,670
So that's what happened.

530
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,730
Then, do Yugong and the others know about this?

531
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,350
They don't need to know.

532
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,120
You've worked hard.

533
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,700
Raw oysters?

534
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,130
What's wrong?

535
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,970
Nothing,

536
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,330
Grow up soon, my wife.

537
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,100
Since everyone's done eating, let's go singing next.

538
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,090
Let's go!

539
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,420
- Let's go!
- Let's go to sing!

540
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,110
 Coming! 

541
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,940
 I'm going first! 

542
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,310
 - Who's going first? 
 - I'm going first! 

543
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,060
Let's go. I'll take you home.

544
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,260
-Then they– 
 There's no problem, I already called taxis for them.

545
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,650
Come on. Let's pay the check.

546
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,910
I thought Brother Mei was picking up the tab.

547
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,700
I just pulled a prank. Let him have some fun.

548
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,310
Let's go.

549
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,240
You guys have fun, we're going to leave first.

550
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,170
- Are you leaving?
- Are you leaving?
- Are you leaving?

551
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,210
- Yeah!
- We're leaving.

552
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,950
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

553
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,030
Okay, let's party.

554
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,560
Come on, let's party!

555
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,180
It's already 3:30 p.m.?

556
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,950
So late.

557
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,670
Who is it?

558
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,050
Coming!

559
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,310
Coming, coming.

560
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,820
Who is it?

561
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,010
K.O.? Why are you here?

562
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,630
Come to get a favor.

563
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:58,010
