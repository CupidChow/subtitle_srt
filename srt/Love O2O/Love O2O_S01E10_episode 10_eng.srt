 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,600
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,500
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,470
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,580
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,700
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,700
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,800
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,300
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,990
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,100
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,900
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,200
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners   with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,300
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,600
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,000
   

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,000

 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,100
So how about it? I picked this one for Weiwei.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,300
I have good taste, right?

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,390
Nice. Let me take a picture.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
Hurry up.  Come on.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,100
 1...2...3. Yay! 

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Xiao Ling, couldn't you help me pick one

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
more suitable for a good woman from a nice family?

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,100
Attendant, do you have anything else which is more suitable for a good woman from a nice family?

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
How is our dress not suitable for a good woman?

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,600
It's just that... this lady has a nice figure. When she wears this, it's...

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,990
Let me see!

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,970
- Stop fooling around. 
- Let me see!

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,800
Why do you suddenly want to buy new clothes?

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Because the clothes that I bought last year are showing pills.
 (Pills: (of knitted fabric) form small balls of fluff on its surface) 

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,030
But didn't I tell you about this problem quite a while ago?

42
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,230
You were pretty content in wearing them.

43
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,620
Moreover, you didn't need to come out now to buy new clothes.

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,670
You have an exam tomorrow.

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,970
I have an important interview tomorrow.

46
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,350
Which psycho company conducts interviews on Saturdays?

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,570
Furthermore, it will be after 11:00 a.m. when we finish our exam tomorrow.

48
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,800
Here. This is the type for a good woman.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,350
- Thank you. 
- Go and try it.

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,770
 This is not considered as lying. The interview tomorrow 

51
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,670
 can change my life. 

52
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,830
How about it?

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,200
Applause!

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,620
You finally succeeded in your disguise as a good woman from a nice family.

55
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,000
Weiwei, do you need to be so formal?

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,900
It's just an interview.

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,620
Moreover, have you not always emphasized about inner qualities?

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,270
This is my first interview.

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,920
Inner qualities are just like the fleeting cloud.

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,830
Such a top weapon

61
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,830
would be better saved to be my trump card.

62
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,380
Awesome.

63
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,750
Shoes.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,200
What's wrong with your shoes?

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
Your shoes look nice.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,620
Just change the color and it will complement well.

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,310
This is my size.

68
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,490
No. This doesn't go with your dress. You should wear high heels.

69
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,030
They are too high. I'm already 169 cm (5.5 ft).

70
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,960
If I wear this, I will be at least 175 cm tall (5.7 ft).

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,330
Flat shoes are still better. Let me try this.

72
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,030
I really can't stand you.

73
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,980
It's just an interview. What are you worried about?

74
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,560
Are you afraid that you would be taller than the interviewer?

75
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,610
Your guess is right.

76
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,220
 If Naihe is not that tall, what should I do? 

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,020
Her dress is too conservative.

78
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,960
Her dress is refreshing and neat.

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,910
It suits her well.

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,900
For an interview, it also makes sense to dress like a student.

81
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,130
Come with me to change my dress.

82
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,070
 Am I the only one who thinks it's more seductive to be totally buttoned up? 

83
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,430
 What is the taboo beauty? This is it! 

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,330
Weiwei, you are great at bargaining. You bought the entire set at such a great price.

85
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,870
My bargaining skill is so good that I'm lonely.

86
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,660
Weiwei, why do I feel that you picked up some bad influence? You are becoming more and more narcissistic.

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,980
Yes, I seem to have gotten some bad influence indeed.

88
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,480
This is called "Getting stained when you are close to the black ink."

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,580
Nope, it should be "Hued scarlet when you come near the vermilion paint." 
 (Note:  Positive instead of bad influence) 

90
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,810
- She's talking about you! 
- Am I the pig?
 (Note: Vermilion and pig are pronounced the same.) 

91
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,520
Yiran, isn't that Bei Weiwei?

92
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,000
The boutique where she shopped seems pretty nice.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,650
Let's go in and take a look.

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,370
No. When you look closely at the dresses in that little shop, you will find out that they aren't that good.

95
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,700
Furthermore, the cost of the dress shows how much you are worth.

96
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Buying her dress there really reveals her class.

97
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,580
Yiran!

98
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,630
What's wrong with you all? Why do we need to wear a dress when you take an exam?

99
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,100
- I'm going directly there after the exam. 
- Huh?

100
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,630
The interview.

101
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,760
It's rare for Weiwei to wear a dress. Let's coordinate a little for her.

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,740
We are not even in the same exam room. Why must we try to coordinate?

103
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,020
This is really a distraction to my focus on the exam.

104
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm afraid that when I take the test, I will start to admire myself.

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,660
Oh my...

106
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,600
I can't stand you.

107
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,720
Did Weiwei infect you with her narcissism?

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,300
- Who are you talking about? 
- You!

109
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,310
She's talking about you!

110
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,070
We are going to be late. Let's hurry.

111
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,130
Let's go now.

112
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,030
    

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,710
Isn't that Bei Weiwei?

114
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,700
She seems to be really pretty.

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,400
But why does she need to dress up like this for the exam?

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,030
How did she dress up?

117
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,860
- She didn't even put make-up on.  
- When you are pretty, you look good no matter what.

118
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,170
 It's not even 11:10 a.m. 

119
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,670
   

120
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,640
 It's going to be 11:30 a.m. soon. 

121
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,260
 Master should be on his way to Tsinghua University. 

122
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,070
 Will he be as nervous as me? 

123
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,700
 ♫ Do you want to be my love? ♫ 

124
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,660
 Xiao Nai? 

125
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,930
 Is that person standing under the willow tree Xiao Nai? 

126
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,700
 It's really Xiao Nai. 

127
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,330
 What is he doing here? 

128
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,800
 It seems that he's waiting for someone, too. 

129
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,490
 Who's good enough 

130
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,160
 to make Master Xiao wait like this?  

131
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,280
 Why do I get the feeling that this looks somewhat familiar? 

132
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,860
 I must be mistaken. 

133
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,680
 Why does he keep staring at me? 

134
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,210
 Could it be Master Xiao knows I'm in the Computer Science Department? 

135
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,970
 That's why he looked at me a few more times. 

136
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,220
 This sounds more logical. 

137
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,110
 Then, should I say hello to him? 

138
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,770
 After all, he's my senior in the same department. 

139
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,990
 But by doing this, would he think that I'm trying to hit on him? 

140
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,230
Senior Xiao, what a coincidence!

141
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,650
 Why didn't I restrain myself? I should have just walked past him. Why did I greet him? 

142
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,840
 He is now ignoring me, right? 

143
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,900
It isn't a coincidence. I have been waiting for you.

144
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,040
Me?

145
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,160
You are Naihe?

146
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,780
It's me.

147
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,780
 Fortunately, I didn't buy the pair of high heels. 

148
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,060
 Or I would have ruined them from the shock. 

149
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,070
 Naihe, Xiao Nai? Xiao Nai, Naihe? 

150
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,890
 If Naihe is really Xiao Nai, 

151
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,360
 how can Naihe be Xiao Nai then? 

152
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,330
You handed in your exam paper early.

153
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,600
If I came later, I would have made you wait.

154
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,690
Are you talking about the final?

155
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,440
It's okay.

156
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,400
 Is he really Naihe? 

157
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Let's go. I will treat you to a meal.

158
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,370
 Will another Naihe show up later? 

159
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,000
 If Xiao Nai is Naihe, 

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,170
 the whole thing is too unreal. 

161
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,100
Weiwei.

162
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,430
Do you eat fish?

163
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,690
Weiwei?

164
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,200
Thank you, Senior.

165
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,140
    

166
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,370
Aunt Jiang can't talk but the food she cooks is really delicious.

167
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,300
My parents aren't good at cooking. When I was young,

168
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,990
if I didn't eat at the cafeteria, I would be eating here.

169
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,110
When you were young?

170
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,180
Is there anything else you want to eat?

171
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,300
No need. It's such a big bowl of soup.

172
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,870
It won't be easy to just finish it.

173
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,730
Are there any Chinese medicinal herbs in this soup?

174
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,150
After the car accident,

175
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,370
my father ordered half a month's worth of fish head soup with Szechuan lovage and gastrodia elata here, to help my head heal.

176
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,480
Professor Xiao? I took his class.

177
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,260
Do you fall asleep?

178
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,800
Although his course is a bit too academic, it's still pretty good.

179
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,100
Actually, he talks about some of his archaeology experiences

180
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,300
which are pretty interesting.

181
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,090
I've taken his class, too.

182
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,470
You don't need to say nice things about him.

183
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,330
That's right. I sat next to you once.

184
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,100
I know.

185
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,950
 You know? What does that mean? 

186
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,870
 In Master's eyes, we common earthlings really don't exist. 

187
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,700
 Could it be that Master has had too much to eat 

188
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,180
 and has invited me to help him eat? 

189
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,270
 That's not right. Why would Master do something sinister like that? 

190
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,670
 He definitely wouldn't. 

191
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,810
 It's so quiet. Should I say something? 

192
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,830
 Xiao Nai seems so different when he's Naihe online. 

193
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,110
 He's totally different. He seems more distant. 

194
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,910
 Forget it. 

195
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,210
 I heard that Xiao Nai's parents are both from a scholarly family. 

196
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,590
 Maybe, they have a rule to stay quiet during meals. 

197
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:09,500
 The more you say, the more you get wrong. I should save my strength for the future. 

198
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,400
 That's right. Safety first. 

199
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,630
 I should just eat the fish. 

200
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,070
Drink more.

201
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,280
   

202
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:22,070
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by the Love O2O Team @Viki.com 

203
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,500
 Master's ringtone is "Female Bandit and the Musician?" 

204
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,060
 Does he miss the days when he was kidnapped? 

205
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,300
Third Brother, where are you?

206
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,220
It's the final game today. Aren't you coming?

207
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,360
Isn't it at 7:00 p.m.? It's still early.

208
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,530
Come here early. Everyone's waiting for you for warm-up.

209
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,810
What are you doing today?

210
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,030
 Come immediately. 

211
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,350
- I am busy. 
- Busy?

212
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,740
What is it? Didn't you already complete your work?

213
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,930
 What are you doing now? 

214
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,470
On a date.

215
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,100
Date?

216
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,940
Third Brother, are you on a date?

217
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,500
 Bring her along. 

218
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,620
I will ask her if she's willing.

219
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,120
Do you want to come to watch the farewell basketball game for us seniors?

220
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,100
I will bring her later.

221
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,620
Are they coming?

222
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,660
Have some more. Don't rush.

223
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,600
I will return to get my bike later. We can go there together.

224
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,210
 Does Master live near here? 

225
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,540
   

226
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,440
 Wow! Not only does Great Deity look good on a white horse, 

227
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,140
 he looks good on a bike, too. 

228
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,030
Get on the bike.

229
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,050
Wait. Well...

230
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,710
Well... are you giving me a ride?

231
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,770
Yes. It's some distance away. How can we walk there?

232
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,140
You are taking me to a basketball gym. Is this appropriate?

233
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,510
When people see us, they will misunderstand.

234
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,080
Misunderstand?

235
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,420
Misunderstand that... we are in this kind of relationship.

236
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,890
Since when were we not in this kind of relationship?

237
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,350
I...

238
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,740
 Since when... were we in this kind of relationship? 

239
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,260
 Although I want to be in this kind of relationship, 

240
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,510
 I don't want to start like this. 

241
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,460
 But come to think of it... 

242
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,550
 I came with the intention of sealing the deal with Master. 

243
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,700
 Now that this upgraded Master said something like this, 

244
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,940
 if I don't accept, wouldn't I lose my opportunity? 

245
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,630
 I will lose whether I accept or not. 

246
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,240
 What's going on? Stop, stop, stop! 

247
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,760
 Stop thinking. Don't be swayed by his words. There won't be a way out. 

248
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,890
 Just pretend that I didn't hear that. I will treat him as a virus and keep my distance from him. 

249
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,280
 That's right. Just get on the bike. 

250
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,850
 If we walk, we might run into more people. 

251
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,710
 The bike is faster. 

252
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,260
 Maybe before anyone could find out it's me, 

253
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,460
 I would have just blown by them. 

254
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
Frankly, my biking skill is not bad.

255
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,450
Hence, your facial expression doesn't need to look as if

256
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,450
you are putting your life on the line.

257
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,170
 Was my expression that somber? 

258
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,230
 ♫ How much would I like to see ♫ 

259
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,250
 ♫ The smile breaking from the corners of your lips ♫ 

260
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,180
 ♫ It’d be best if it were in the next second  ♫  

261
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,450
 ♫ How much would I like to hear ♫ 

262
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,540
 ♫ The soft melody from your singing ♫ 

263
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,450
 ♫ It’d be best if it were in the next second ♫ 

264
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,830
 ♫ The white baseball cap ♫ 

265
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,810
 ♫ The dark green corners of your clothes ♫ 

266
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,130
 ♫ The beauty when the time stands still ♫ 

267
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,810
 ♫ The connection between hearts happens at every 
next second ♫ 

268
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,310
I'm going to buy something.

269
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,820
 Look.  He is so handsome. 

270
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,360
 - I really like him.
- He is so tall. 

271
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,250
 Appearing with Master in the same frame of the painting 

272
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,640
 indeed attracts a lot of attention. 

273
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,860
Hold this for me.

274
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,950
 ♫ Pick an apple and wait for you to pass by my door ♫ 

275
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,670
 ♫ Deliver it into your palm to help quench your thirst ♫ 

276
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:55,210
 ♫ Like cola in summer, like cocoa in winter. ♫ 

277
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,480
 ♫ You are in the right role at the right time ♫ 

278
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,240
 ♫ We've promised to spend the next weekend together ♫ 

279
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,940
Hold on tight. 
 ♫ You tell me this while feeling a bit moody ♫ 

280
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,330
 ♫ But I don't know why my wound hasn't healed yet ♫ 

281
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,360
 ♫ You just burst into my heart like this. ♫ 

282
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,610
 Perhaps, I should be more courageous. 

283
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,930
 So what if he's Xiao Nai? 

284
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,080
 In the future, he will be Xiao Nai. 

285
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,570
 At this time, he's more like Naihe to me. 

286
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,060
 He's just Naihe. That's why I like him. 

287
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,730
Wait for me.

288
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,160
 There's a time and place to be courageous. 

289
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,720
 The courage now doesn't include 

290
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,370
 walking into the basketball gym with Xiao Nai under so many watchful eyes. 

291
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,860
Well...  I'm going to watch the game with my roommates. Catch up with you later on the internet.

292
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,880
Weiwei!

293
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,330
Hurry and go warm up.  Give your seat to Weiwei.

294
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,740
- Okay, I'm leaving. 
 - Okay. 
 - Bye-bye.

295
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,110
- Bye-bye. 
- Bye.

296
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,170
Come here, Weiwei.

297
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,650
Weiwei, it's going to be fun today.

298
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,980
- How so?  
- A lot of beautiful girls came today,

299
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,220
like Jiang Ruru from the Foreign Language Department, Li Hanyu from the Chemistry Department.

300
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,980
The school beauty queen is here, too. She's sitting over there.

301
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,760
Is this the first time that the top two beauty queens of our school appeared at the same venue together?

302
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,340
It seems so.

303
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,050
If we knew that Meng Yiran would be here, Weiwei should have worn that red dress.

304
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,790
- You would roll over her and clean her clock.
 - That's right.

305
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,660
Meng Yiran's figure really can't compare to our Weiwei's.

306
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,560
Frankly, our Weiwei's look is much prettier than hers.

307
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,610
 Just who sneakily took that photo of Weiwei in the contest last year? 

308
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,720
 It was such an awful picture. 

309
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,330
 Compared to Meng Yiran's glamour shot, she was really at a disadvantage. 

310
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,140
That's right. Yet Weiwei didn't allow us to send in better-looking photos.

311
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,960
- She should have taken a few more. 
- That's right.

312
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,770
Eat something. Eat something.

313
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,420
Wow! Weiwei, did you strike it rich? You bought so many tasty snacks. How much did these cost?

314
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,040
I want to eat this.

315
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,050
Wow, my favorite dried mangoes.

316
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,580
There're also roasted cashews.

317
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,650
Weiwei, why didn't you buy my favorite pecans?

318
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,960
- I brought snacks and yet you are still so picky? 
- I will eat. I was wrong.

319
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
 Master bought all these in three minutes 

320
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,010
 and you still expect him to be picky? 

321
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,120
Weiwei, didn't you go for the interview?

322
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,850
Is that why you bought these to celebrate?

323
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,500
You can consider it so.

324
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,440
You went for the interview. How was it?

325
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,780
Well... the process was a failure but the result was unexpected.

326
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,160
Who cares about that? Anyway, it's good that you passed.

327
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,760
That's right. What's most important is that...

328
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,630
Master Xiao Nai will be here today!

329
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,260
 Of course, I know he will be here. 

330
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,510
 He bought the snacks that you are eating now. 

331
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,340
I say, today's match is between the Computer Science Department and the Architecture Department.

332
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,150
Meng Yiran is not from our department. What is she doing here?

333
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,200
Si Si, you are wrong if you think this way.

334
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Good looking guys are resources to be shared by the entire universe.

335
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,360
You must not have any partisan view.

336
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,300
Look.

337
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,220
What did I say? Bei Weiwei will definitely be here today.

338
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,880
How could a girl like her give up such an opportunity?

339
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,650
These cashews taste great.

340
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,880
Give me some. Don't finish everything by yourself.

341
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,950
- You ate them so fast. 
- How annoying!

342
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,030
   

343
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,790
Students, go back to your seats!

344
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,170
Move it. Go!

345
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,410
Third Brother, what are you doing here?

346
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,080
Where is she?

347
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,550
Where's the person you were on a date with?

348
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,870
That's right. I texted Hao Mei to rush here.

349
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,730
- She fled. 
- Huh? Fled?

350
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,810
She was scared off by you guys.

351
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm so adorable. Would I scare anyone?

352
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,630
 These guys should be the two on the phone. 

353
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,960
 Could they be Yugong and Houzi Jiu? 

354
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,480
Okay, I'm going to change.

355
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,180
Yiran, Xiao Nai was looking at you just now.

356
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,160
It can't be. There are so many people here.

357
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,570
For goodness sake. Everyone here is just a wallpaper for you.

358
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,460
Moreover, didn't you meet Xiao Nai at your uncle's company?

359
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,770
He definitely remembers you.

360
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,010
Didn't Bei Weiwei sit in the same class as him

361
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,390
and not talk to him at all? Isn't that so?

362
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,610
- Who do you think Xiao Nai was looking at just now? 
- Meng Yiran?

363
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,860
Not necessarily so. There are many beautiful girls here today.

364
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,140
But he was looking in our direction just now.

365
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,190
There's only Meng Yiran there.

366
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,910
I remember now.

367
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,570
Xiao Nai and Meng Yiran probably know each other.

368
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,550
The only time Xiao Nai joined the school party, Meng Yiran was on stage.

369
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,910
Although they didn't perform in the same program,

370
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,550
they both were playing traditional instruments.

371
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,270
Perhaps, they might have had some exchange.

372
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,930
Xiao Nai might not be looking at girls, okay?

373
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,530
Why are you making him seem so vulgar?

374
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,860
Please, stop being so naive.

375
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,680
When did Xiao Nai ever look at the spectator stand? He always acts like he's alone.

376
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,170
His target is definitely...

377
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,060
There's only one.

378
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,550
He was looking at...

379
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,940
me.

380
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,370
- Let's go.
- Coming.

381
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,920
 - Do your best. - Do your best. 

382
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,300
Brother Hou, I just saw Third Brother take a look at the spectator stand.

383
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,900
There's definitely a problem.

384
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,740
This is the first time I saw nothing wrong in your logic.

385
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,330
I say, Third Brother. Never mind that she has a pretty face,

386
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,210
her figure is also not bad.

387
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,620
Stop changing the topic.

388
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,730
Third Brother, tell us who you were looking at.

389
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,290
Which beautiful girl were you looking at?

390
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,020
I discovered that our school beauty queen was in that direction.

391
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,060
Also, the beauty queen of our department with a special connection to me.

392
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,790
I already told you that it's none of your business.

393
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,990
You'd better give us some clarification.

394
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,720
By the way, your head was just healed. Will you be okay playing today?

395
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Don't worry. I'm fine.

396
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,350
Hurry up.  Let's get changed.

397
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,160
Weiwei, don't you know that you and Xiao Nai are known schoolwide

398
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,960
as the most unlikely couple?

399
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
What's this "the most unlikely?"

400
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,910
It's in a popular gossip forum about the school campus.

401
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,630
They paired up the most popular single students.

402
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,660
You and Xiao Nai are the least compatible.

403
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Why are there discussions like that? People in school really have nothing to do.

404
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,930
Xiao Ling, I suddenly remember that I still have a homework assignment to finish. Have you done it? Let me borrow it.

405
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,290
- Okay. 
- How are we not compatible?

406
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,210
Weiwei, why are you taking something meaningless so seriously?

407
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,720
Those people in the forum are merely talking about...

408
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,870
appearance, professions...

409
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,610
What else did they say? Let me think. I remember now.

410
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:17,890
They say one is graceful and elegant like the Chinese ink drawing.

411
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,510
The other one is striking and colorful like an oil painting.

412
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,890
One is a saintly immortal in Heaven; and the other, a  beauty with fortune and stature on earth.

413
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,590
What's with that expression of yours?

414
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,290
I'm getting goosebumps from hearing this.

415
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,620
Also, I'm not oily at all. Okay?

416
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,290
What a lame joke!

417
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,830
How can our professions not be compatible? We are both in the Computer Science Department.

418
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,800
A couple of IT heroes.

419
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,460
What are you laughing at?

420
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,130
Can you come up with an even worse nickname?

421
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,950
There wouldn't be any motivation to idolize when you are in the same profession, okay?

422
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,020
Moreover, Computer Science is but one of many of Xiao Nai's areas of expertise.

423
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,860
Then let me ask you this. Who do they say is compatible with Xiao Nai?

424
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,480
I don't think there is anyone. Everybody has some people opposing the idea.

425
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,720
That's right then.

426
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,730
 Hurray! 

427
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,540
Xiao Nai is really everyone's idol.

428
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,870
They say Xiao Nai is even better at swimming than basketball.

429
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,350
I wonder how he is in a swimming competition.

430
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,150
Weiwei, why are you so hot?

431
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,160
- You are such a pervert. 
- What? Me?

432
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,780
- You are such a pervert! 
- You are such a pervert!

433
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,940
- I think I'm innocent. 
- You too.

434
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,020
- You are a pervert, too. 
- Who says so?

435
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:35,640
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

436
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,530

440
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,620

447
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,910
Everyone did well.

448
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,410
- Later...
- What?

449
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,820
I think we can up our speed.

450
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,650
- Da Zhong, your rebounding...
- Okay, leave it to me.

451
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,480
Houzi, In terms of covering the open spots, especially on defense, I think you can do better.

452
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,070
Xiao Nai was so cool when he changed direction in the air.

453
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,330
When I go back, I'm going to tell Da Zhong to practice that.

454
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,560
This seems quite demanding of the body.

455
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,470
I don't know.

456
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,960
Xiao Nai is really talented at everything.

457
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,840
  This person is too extraordinary.  

458
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,980
  If we are really together in the future,  

459
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,750
  I have to try harder.  

460
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,910
   

461
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,320
 Substitute. 

462
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,830
 Quick. 

463
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,810
Replace me later.

464
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,410
Okay.

465
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,220
Da Zhong is indeed right.

466
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,010
Senior Xiao Nai is only playing half of the game today.

467
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,860
Why?

468
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,440
It's a farewell game. Moreover, the reserve players who are seniors will also take the court.

469
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,350
I also heard that

470
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,090
Xiao Nai got into a car accident recently.

471
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,220
A car accident?

472
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,270
It's not very good for his body to exercise for too long, right?

473
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,170
Why did I forget about that?

474
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,430
Why is he still playing?

475
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,720
What did you forget?

476
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,310
Nothing.

477
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,620
We are going out later. I may not go online tonight.

478
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,750
What do you plan to do tomorrow?

479
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,680
- Studying. 
- Okay, I will go with you.

480
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,640
Okay, I'll save you a seat.

481
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,520
There's an empty spot over there. Do you all mind scooting over?

482
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,650
 What's going on? 

483
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,710
 What's going on? Are they together? 

484
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:29,580
