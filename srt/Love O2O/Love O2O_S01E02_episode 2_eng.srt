00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,410
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,580
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,520
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,550
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,680
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,580
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,480
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,540
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,100
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,860
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,720
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,870
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,430
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,910
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,100
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,010
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,710
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,230
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,170
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,310
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,430
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,960
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,190
   

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,470
   

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,380
 Luwei Weiwei. 

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:45,040


28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,490
Yixiao Naihe.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,160
The top-ranked player on this server, Yixiao Naihe?

30
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,980
 A master! An idol! And rich! 

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Brother Yixiao Naihe, did you call out to me?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,960
What did you think of this event?

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,940
 Did the legend come here to gossip as well? 

34
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,050
It was very grand.

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,520
Would you like to have an even grander wedding ceremony?

36
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,340
Couple up with me.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,310
Have you been hacked?

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,830
Have you seen the latest news on the official website?

39
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,030
The one about couple's PK duel? (PK: player killing)

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,580
So, you just looked me up because of the PK duel contest.

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,680
Yes.

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,590
Why did you choose me?

43
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,010
You are the only female player to make the Top 10 rankings.

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,020
 This Master Naihe is really strong. 

45
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,010
 He's number one in the PvP (Player vs. Player) ranking.  If I joined forces with him... 

46
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,360
 we'd be halfway to making first place on this server. 

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,720
 My first time to couple up was to complete a quest. 

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,410
 Should the second time be for the duel? 

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,750
 Nevertheless, 

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,570
 if it weren't for the quest or the duel, 

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,410
 why would I get tied up with a stranger? 

52
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,980
 Besides, the prize is so generous. 

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,470
Okay, let's join up.  We'll go to the Stone of Three Lives together.

54
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,030
 Wait. 

55
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,480
I still have to make some preparation.  At 8 o'clock in three days.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,770
Prepare for what?

57
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,900
The wedding banquet.

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,400
We just need to get it registered.

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,990
It's not worth it to make it so grand for a PK duel contest.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,110
How could Yixiao Naihe's wedding banquet be so casual?

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,020
♪  Every day is just the same. Only today is different!  ♪

62
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,310
Brothers, good news. Good news!

63
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,180
We have a shot to stop being single!

64
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,800
♫  Yeah!  ♫

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,780
Hey! Can you give me some reaction?

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,400
What's this about "strip naked?"  Is it something special?
 (Note: "Strip naked" here can also mean stop being single) 

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,590
Don't I strip completely naked every day when taking a shower?

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,610
Come on! It serves you right to be single!

69
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,820
I'm serious.

70
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,790
Recently, I met a girl.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,560
In the same dorm as the school beauty queen.

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,670
Do you know about the school beauty queen?

73
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,690
I might... she's called Meng Haoran, right? 
 (Note: Meng Haoran is a famous poet in the Tang dynasty) 

74
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,340
Meng Haoran? As if!

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,270
Meng Haoran was the one who authored "The Song of Everlasting Regret." 
 (Note: Bai Juyi was the actual author) 

76
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,320
Her name is Meng Yiran.

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,990
Sorry, sorry.

78
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,800
And so? Does that girl have any interest in you?

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Of course!

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,820
I'm so handsome.

81
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,630
If she isn't interested in me, it wouldn't be logical.

82
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,400
Right now, I am just waiting for that girl to approach me.

83
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,960
As a matter of fact, she contacted me today.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,890
She said that the school beauty queen's laptop was broken

85
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,790
and is asking us to help her fix it.

86
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,140
Oh! How was it broken?

87
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,270
It seems that the RAM isn't working.

88
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,700
So boring. It's not even the least bit challenging.

89
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,730
You both deserve to be single for your entire lives.

90
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,230
Here. Let me tell you a trick.

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,000
We can storm their dorm,

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
fix the computer,

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,360
eat a meal, and then...

94
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,230
Although we are interested,

95
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,320
could it be that for her, "the drinker's interest in not in the cup?" 
 (Note:  idiom that suggests she has ulterior motive) 

96
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,650
Brother Hou, as a person, one should know oneself.

97
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,280
Our target obviously isn't the school beauty queen herself.

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,460
It's the girls around the beauty queen.

99
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,790
As for the pure beauty queen, we'll leave her to...

100
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,830
I am getting married in the game.

101
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,080
I'll introduce her to you soon.

102
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,370
You're getting married in the game?

103
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,460
So, I've already have a partner.

104
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,880
It's not appropriate for me to fix another woman's computer.

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,140
If you're interested, go by yourselves.

106
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,250
Brother Xiao Nai!

107
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,850
Please introduce your in-game wife!

108
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,700
That's right, Third Brother. I really want to know what kind of devilish creature finally stirred up your mortal desires.

109
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,780
 So, you're the woman who has swindled our Third Brother? 

110
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,670
Do you even know how to communicate?

111
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,180
Get out of the way.

112
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,160
 So, you're the woman whom our Third Brother has swindled? 

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,900
 Uh... and you guys are...? 

114
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,630
 They're members of my regular team. 

115
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,570
 Mo Zhata, Houzi Jiu, and Yugong. 

116
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,210
 Hi, everyone ^_^, I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time. 

117
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,660
Wow! We really have a Third Sister-in-Law!

118
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,500
Even the eternal bachelor has a woman!

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,660
We won't have to be looked down upon when playing in the dungeon again!

120
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,160
- Being called as the "Bachelor Team" was so embarrassing.
- Hey!

121
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,530
Third Sister-in-Law's username looks somewhat familiar.

122
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,620
Now, that you've mentioned it, I feel that way, too.

123
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,990
It seems as though Third Sister-in-Law made it onto the ranking list before?

124
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,320
I remember! Luwei Weiwei,

125
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,030
Isn't she the former wife of Zhenshui Wuxiang?

126
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,290
 Third Sister-in-Law, were you previously married to Zhenshui Wuxiang? 

127
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,370
 Naihe and I are... 

128
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,540
 That's right. Your Third Sister-in-Law previously was attached to the wrong person. 

129
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,760
 Everyone, don't discriminate against her for that. 

130
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
Okay, okay. Understood. Understood.

131
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,210
There's a saying that expresses it right.

132
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,590
Who in this life hasn't encountered a few scumbags, right?

133
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,790
 Third Sister-in-Law, just forget about him. 

134
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,040
 Our Third Brother is definitely better than him! 

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,890
Come on. Let's do a quest for some bonding.

136
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,640
Third Sister-in-law's skill is pretty good!

137
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,410
Rarely can we find folks who work so well with us.

138
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,020
You are too kind.

139
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,250
We didn't give you a compliment.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,580
When's the day for you both to tie the knot? Don't forget to bring us along!

141
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,640
The day after tomorrow.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,710
The day after tomorrow? Don't you have to...

143
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,730
It's fine. There's enough time.

144
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,040
Do you have something to do that day?

145
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,430
We can always reschedule.

146
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,480
No need. That day after tomorrow is better.

147
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,340
 It's an auspicious day for the occasion. 

148
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,800
Big Brother, I have to get down on my knee for you.

149
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,670
You're only getting married in a game and you have to pick an auspicious day for it?

150
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,210
What is that weird thing you're looking at?

151
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,020
Also, you have this weird smile on your face.

152
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,570
When am I acting weird? I'm quite serious.

153
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,490
I'll see for myself.

154
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,500
The basketball game is today. When are you going to grab our seats?

155
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,860
You're right! The basketball game is today, too!

156
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,090
Maybe, I won't go. I'm busy tonight.

157
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,650
What? How can you not go to a game with Xiao Nai in it?

158
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,330
Are you sure you're still in the group for the Master? You're fired.

159
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,750
Come on, let's go. There are only a few girls in the Computer Science department to begin with.

160
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,130
We should at least support and cheer for our seniors.

161
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,930
Just come, please.

162
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,670
Okay, I'll come.  I just have to go back earlier later.

163
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,250
- Let's get our bags. 
 - Let's go. 

164
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,250
I'm on my way out now. See you at the conference.

165
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,330
Xiao Ling, your Da Zhong's here!

166
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,790
You all are finally here.  If you had come any later, those seats would've been taken.

167
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,480
It's only 3:00 p.m. right now. Doesn't it start at 6:00 p.m.?

168
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,330
Well, isn't Brother Xiao here later?  So, everyone is coming early to get a seat.

169
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,940
I heard Meng Yiran also came. Do you all know that?

170
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,500
The school beauty queen? Why do you care so much whether she comes or not?

171
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,790
No, no. I also only heard it from someone else.

172
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,180
I didn't even take a glance at her.

173
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,110
- Go ahead and show us the seats.
- Okay, come here.

174
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,710
It's right here.

175
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,720
Da Zhong, when is Senior Xiao coming?  It can't be until 
6:00 p.m., right?

176
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,960
Shouldn't he do some warm-up before the game?

177
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,710
Yeah, we came early because we didn't want to miss his warm-up session.

178
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,060
Xiao Ling, are you here to see me or Brother Xiao?

179
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,380
Of course, I'm here to see Senior Xiao. Why would I come to see you?

180
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,850
- So, you're here to see Brother Xiao?
- Yes.

181
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,900
Then you should go back. Brother Xiao might not be able to make it today.

182
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,470
What? Then, what's with the poster?

183
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,010
Yes, we're the ones who made the poster. But if we didn't do that,  how else could we get this many people here?

184
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,120
So for this whole time, you guys were using false advertising?

185
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,090
What is this? You guys lied to all the girls who were coming to see the game.

186
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,820
We never said that it was Brother Xiao on the poster.

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,250
You guys who imagined it in your heads. It has nothing to do with me.

188
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,570
If we knew that, why would we come this early?

189
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,560
Let's go! Let's return to the dorm then eat at the cafeteria before we come back.

190
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,880
Wait, Xiao Ling.

191
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,530
Are you still my girlfriend?

192
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,990
When you come back, these seats will be taken.

193
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,460
You can be rest assured.

194
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,750
If Senior Xiao doesn't show up, you won't have to worry about open seats.

195
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,100
- Let's go. Get out of my way.
- Xiao Ling! Xiao– Xiao Ling!

196
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,230
   

197
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,520
   

198
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,450
A lot of teams are already here.

199
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,190
I just looked at the list of VIP guests.  Everyone who's coming today is a real big shot.

200
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,040
The familiar ones are Feng Teng Technology;

201
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,660
the senior management of gaming investment for NetEase Gaming, and Haomiao Capital.

202
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Third Brother,

203
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,180
don't be nervous.

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,090
Are you kidding?

205
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,090
Nice!  You deserve to be our Third Brother.

206
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,370
Let's go.

207
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,620
 

208
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,310
See. How about my amazing foresight!  There're only half as many people here now.

209
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,000
Weiwei!

210
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,880
Look, Meng Yiran and her sidekick are here.  Right over there.

211
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,390
Could she be interested in Senior Xiao?

212
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,900
Do you even need to ask that?  Anyone who can think knows that she's definitely interested in him.

213
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,910
Fortunately, Senior Xiao is aloof and doesn't pay attention to anyone.

214
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,690
If she captures his heart, I'd cry for three days!

215
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,640
The game is starting.  Watch the game.

216
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,550
Here he comes again.

217
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,450
Senior Weiwei, in case we win,  can I treat you to some late-night snacks?

218
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,970
Then will you lose?

219
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,330
- Of course not. 
 - Good luck!

220
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,320
Senior Sister, I will definitely win.

221
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,430
This little junior is so easy to trick.

222
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,250
I hate this kind of brat the most.  They use winning or losing the game to coerce you.

223
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,390
If Weiwei doesn't agree or rejects him,

224
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,360
then he'll blame our Weiwei if they lose.

225
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,250
Our Senior Sister Weiwei's methods of rejection

226
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,180
are getting more and more brilliant.

227
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,100
Not at all.  It happens so often and I've just become proficient at it.

228
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,260
All right, thank you very much.

229
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,250
After seeing the presentations for more than one hour from multiple teams,

230
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,880
everybody may be feeling frazzled.

231
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,500
The last speaker is from the Zhi Yi Technology team.

232
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,000
What kind of surprises will they bring us? Please give them a round of applause.

233
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,630
Good afternoon, everyone. I am Xiao Nai

234
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,670
from Zhi Yi Technology.

235
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,540
I'm very happy to share with everyone

236
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,950
the mobile game our team developed.

237
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,330
The best feature of L10

238
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,320
is its ability to accommodate multiple playing styles on one platform.

239
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,050
L10 is a multi-player online game with real-time action.

240
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,340
Its greatest feature resides with its cool battles,

241
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,040
rich playing approaches, and three-dimensional social ecosystem.

242
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,700
While allowing multiple players to enjoy an in-depth immersion experience,

243
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,990
it also delivers the ease of playing required for mobile gaming.

244
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,050
Within the universe of L10 in your palm,

245
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,550
players can relish in exciting battles

246
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,840
and also experience the rich and expansive life in the ancient world.

247
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,550
They may engage in social activities as well as participate in vigorous battles against each other.

248
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,410
Why don't we stand up and cheer for the Computer Science department together?

249
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,750
Okay!

250
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:43,770
Computer Science Department. Go, go, go!

251
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,080
So exciting! Hurry and take pictures!

252
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,140
- Let me see.
- Here.

253
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,830
So handsome!

254
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,010
Let me take some more.

255
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,750
Come on! Computer Science Department. Go!

256
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,580
President Xiao,

257
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,630
are you still in college?

258
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,040
Yes. I am a senior at Tsinghua University.

259
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,890
Since ancient times, the heroes have come from the young.

260
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,280
We're very interested in your technology and business plan.

261
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Whenever you're free, come to our company to have a chat.

262
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,640
I have the will, but don't dare to ask.

263
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,330
Your game is very lively and harnesses the popular trend.

264
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,280
However, President Xiao yourself doesn't seem to want popularity.

265
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,040
Luckily, I'm in a business to develop the game, not myself.

266
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,290
 President Xiao, this is my business card. Let's find a time next we meet. 

267
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,670
President Xiao!

268
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,830
I am from Zhen Yi Technologies. This is my business card.

269
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,000
I heard your presentation just now. You are indeed quite accomplished at your young age.

270
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,140
I don't know if President Xiao is available this Thursday to discuss more details at my office.

271
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,870
Thursday... I'll definitely come to your company to visit.

272
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,660
Great. I'll see you, then.

273
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,440
I shall take my leave.

274
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,390
A lot of people are interested in us. It seems we can get some pretty good terms.

275
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,560
We will only know after talking to them.

276
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,670
It's about time now. I have an appointment to attend to.

277
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,430
I'm here, my four noble warriors.

278
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,210
Third Sister-in-Law is online.

279
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,800
Come on.

280
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,640
 Sorry, I'm late. 

281
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,560
 No problem. I just got here, too. 

282
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,340
Why are there so many people here?

283
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,530
Luren Jia and Jishi Yu are both the leaders of major guilds.  Why are they here as well?

284
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,470
You ask them.

285
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,700
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

286
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,990
Brother Naihe once did me a great favor.

287
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,860
I never thought he would get married to someone. How could I not enjoy the fun?

288
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,730
Today, I asked everyone free today in my guild all to come here.

289
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,570
 Later on, they will ride their horses, and follow behind the carriage. 

290
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,150
I'm sure this will be quite an exciting ceremony.

291
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,740
That's right. People from my guild have also come.

292
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,460
In a while, let's all have some fun together.

293
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,430
Everyone is still waiting for Brother Naihe's red envelopes.

294
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,860
So many people!  A red envelope for each person?

295
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,460
Master wouldn't go bankrupt, would he?

296
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,100
This is...

297
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
A betrothal gift.

298
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,810
I don't want it.

299
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,960
You'll need it in the future for PK duel battles.

300
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,880
   

301
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
A dowry.

302
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,200
It's a bit inadequate. I'll make up for it in the future.

303
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,100
Truthfully, it's enough for you to join me.

304
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,800
It is time.

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
 Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe 

306
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 take the eternal vow to enter into marriage, for better or for worse, 

307
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,400
 becoming 158999th couple on this server. 

308
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,800
 I wish you both mutual love and happiness for a lifetime. 

309
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,000
Spread the flower petals!  Spread the flower petals!  Spread the flower petals!

310
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
The Third Brother actually has a wife now.

311
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,300
- I originally thought he would be single for his entire life with his annoying personality. 
- Me, too.

312
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,600
Since he has succeeded this time, then we have a chance, too!

313
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,500
♪  Let's sway back and forth together!  ♪

314
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Congratulations to you two. I'm going to join the wedding procession.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm going back to the game. It's time to follow the wedding procession.

316
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,620
   

317
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,600
Didn't Luwei Weiwei just get dumped?

318
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Yixiao Naihe, as the top player on this server,

319
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
actually picked up a pair of old and used shoes.

320
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
What is he thinking?

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,900
You wouldn't understand the world of a master.

322
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,000
In my opinion, Yixiao Naihe should be paired with Xiaoyu Yaoyao.

323
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The number one master and the top beauty would be an even better couple.

324
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Finally, someone shows some good judgment. Yixiao  Naihe is truly blind.

325
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
 He actually chose to marry this ugly Luwei Weiwei. 

326
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Don't talk nonsense. I've already got Zhenshui.

327
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,000
I know. I just pity Yixiao Naihe.

328
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,700
Yaoyao, if Yixiao Naihe also liked you,

329
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,300
who would you choose?

330
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
Yixiao Naihe seems to be rich, too.

331
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,400
This wedding festival seems even better than Zhenshui's.

332
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Who cares about money? Of course, I'd choose Zhenshui.

333
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,400
 Yixiao Naihe versus Zhenshui Wuxiang: Yixiao Naihe wins. 

334
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,960
 Luwei Weiwei versus Xiaoyu Yaoyao:  

335
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,000
 Xiaoyu Yaoyao wins. 

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,360
Who said that Xiaoyu Yaoyao won?

337
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,300
Our Third Sister-in-Law is far stronger than her. If you don't believe it, let's have a PK duel.

338
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,100
That's right! Whoever doesn't agree, come out to have a PK duel.

339
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 In the past, I saw Yixiao Naihe and Xiaoyu Yaoyao in a team together. 

340
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,500
 Really? 

341
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,000
 I saw it, too. I saw them fight against some monsters together. 

342
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,200
 I don't think it was that long ago. Maybe, just last week! 

343
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,600
 In that case, then Luwei Weiwei gets dumped by Zhenshui Wuxiang. 

344
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 And Yixiao Naihe was dumped by Xiaoyu Yaoyao. 

345
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
 Later on, the grieving parties who lost out got together to form a new couple. 

346
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,040
 Wouldn't this mean that Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei 

347
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,000
 are simply a couple of spiteful spouses? 

348
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Yixiao Naihe and Xiaoyu Yaoyao fought jointly against the monsters before? 

349
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,100
 They even know each other. 

350
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,190
 Do you know Xiaoyu Yaoyao? 

351
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
 No, I don't. 

352
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,100
 Someone said they saw you two battling monsters together. 

353
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
 I suppose I know her. Yugong added her to our team once. 

354
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
 Her skills were too shabby. I kicked her out. 

355
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,000
 Time for the bridal chamber! Gather around for the watch. 

356
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,500
When did the game have the bridal chamber?

357
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,900
It came online recently. However, it's pretty boring.

358
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,000
You can only do two things. First, stand and chat.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,100
Second, sit and chat.

360
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,200
It's also called simply chatting without a blanket.

361
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,500
Wow, Brother Hou, other than  chatting, what else do you expect to do?

362
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,000
They really won't let us see.

363
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,400
 I need to take a call. 

364
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,300
 Okay. 

365
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,000
What are we doing right now?

366
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
We're enjoying the scenery.

367
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,200
The moon is really full tonight.

368
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
We're not on our honeymoon, right?

369
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 No way... Are we really on our honeymoon? 

370
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,700
 Master, you're so dedicated to this game. 

371
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,000
Taking song requests! Taking song requests!

372
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,000
Taking song requests! Taking song requests!

373
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Don't miss this opportunity, everyone.

374
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,100
Taking song requests! Taking song requests!

375
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
 Ding dong. 

376
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,000
 Your quest as a couple has been completed. 

377
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
If we don't leave now, they'll run out of sweet and sour pork ribs.

378
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
- I forgot the important stuff!
- Let's go.

379
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,700
Hurry. Hurry.

380
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,000
Let's eat braised pork today.

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,300
What are you looking at?  So focused.

382
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,000
There's been a lot of gossips lately.

383
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Some people are harshly criticizing the lies about the last basketball game.

384
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,100
"As I saw the campus beauty got out of the luxury car,

385
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,200
at that instant, my worldview came crashing down."

386
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Who came up with such a title?  So melodramatic!

387
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,230
However, I still like it.

388
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,300
Oh, there are pictures! Don't be impatient.

389
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,600
Could the signal be better here?

390
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
Erxi, let's get in line first.

391
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,100
It is coming out. Don't rush me.

392
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,100
What are you doing?

393
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
The bag in the photo looks a lot like yours.

394
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,200
Look.

395
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,600
What do you mean by "it looks like yours?" It's indeed me.

396
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I remember on that day, Xiao Yang's mom gave me a ride back since it was on her way.

397
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,300
The person who posted this is nuts!

398
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,600
They don't even know what really happened, yet spread baseless rumors online.

399
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,000
At least, he blurred out your face.

400
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It shows he at least has some decency. What do we do now?

401
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,700
Let's eat first. Then we'll find his ID.

402
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,200
Let's go.

403
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Take a look of this.

404
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,200
"...the campus beauty got out of the luxury car,

405
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,400
at that instant, my worldview came crashing down."

406
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,800
As soon as you read it, you know it's click-bait. So deflating.

407
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Hey, this really is the front gate of our school.

408
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,100
This girl's figure is really not bad.

409
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,200
She is such a beauty from Tsinghua University.  Why didn't she open her eyes?

410
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Truly a case of feeding an outsider's field with our own fertile water.

411
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Please. Just because it took place at the front gate,  does it have to mean that she is from our school?

412
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,700
Can you stop using such simplistic logic, please?

413
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Also, the car could be from her own family.

414
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
People these days only know how to jump to conclusions from a photo,

415
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
always ready to think of the worst of others.

416
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Just who is this with nothing better to do?

417
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,800
This is his username from the first posting. Let's trace his IP address.

418
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,440
This person has an ID called "Guangmang Sishe."
  (meaning Shooting Rays) .

419
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,800
Do you guys know who that is?

420
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,440
"Guangmang Sishe?"

421
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,360
This ID is very famous!

422
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,530
That's the most talented scholar in the Foreign Language Department of our school.

423
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,110
He's handsome, born into a family of prominent diplomats, and proficient in multiple languages.

424
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,080
Ah, proficiently speaking other languages is so...!

425
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,660
Anyway, he is only a little bit inferior to Xiao Nai.

426
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,450
No, a lot more inferior.

427
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,810
What's his name?

428
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,200
- Cao Guang.
- Yes, that's it.

429
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,980
Cao Guang? I don't know him.

430
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,220
Why would he publish this kind of post?

431
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,180
Based on his previous posts, I can infer

432
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,560
that he is probably a young man full with resentment.

433
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,440
Especially, if he thought you were...

434
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,630
That's over the line! I will look him up.

435
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,210
- Hey! Where are you going to look for him?
-  The School of Foreign Languages. 

436
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,240
What's going on?

437
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,890
Look! A beauty.

438
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,880
Isn't this the beauty queen of the Computer Science Department?

439
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,600
Schoolmates, sorry to bother you for a moment.

440
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,490
Are you in the School of Foreign Languages?

441
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,750
Yes, is there anything we can help you with?

442
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,480
I want to find Cao Guang.

443
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,890
- Cao Guang...
- Cao Guang...

444
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,350
He's right there. That's him.

445
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

446
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,160
Bei Weiwei, what's up?

447
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,840
Schoolmate, I'm here to save your worldview.

448
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,910
What is this?

449
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,320
I am that little boy's home tutor.

450
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,210
Next to him, it's his single mother.

451
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,000
That day his mom was going the same way, so she dropped me off at school.

452
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,010
Schoolmate Cao Guang,

453
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,790
making malicious inferences when you saw someone get out of a car

454
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,760
is your personal issue,

455
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,160
but you posted it online without any proof.

456
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,430
That's not just your personal matter.

457
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,620
Then, what do you want?

458
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,210
Delete the post. And also, apologize to me right now.

459
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,620
Who knows if this photo is real or fake?

460
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,690
For you folks in the Computer Science Department, it should be pretty simple to compose a photo, right?

461
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,000
After all, you even managed to find me.

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,820
Do you not believe me?

463
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,510
I wouldn't suspect every woman who got out of a luxury car.

464
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,530
But you...

465
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,820
So, you like to crudely rush to judgement on people based on appearance.

466
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,850
What is that?

467
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,140
Isn't it true that you don't believe me?

468
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,030
You can confirm with your own eyes.

469
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,760
Let's do this. My student needs an English tutor.

470
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,610
You can try out for it.

471
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,830
   

472
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,130
Weiwei, how was it?

473
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,180
He didn't believe it. He said the photograph was photoshopped.

474
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,580
Geez! Why didn't he say his picture was photoshopped instead?

475
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,300
I am going to beat him up!

476
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,640
Good luck! I believe in you!

477
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,820
Weiwei, how can you have no pity on such a fragile maiden like me?

478
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,770
You are just letting me go to sacrifice myself.

479
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,230
Don't worry. Someone like him wouldn't be able to kill you.

480
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,120
Also, I'll be supporting and cheering for you on the side.

481
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,270
You have absolutely no affection for your fellow classmate.

482
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,490
Then, what to do now since he doesn't believe you? Why aren't you worried?

483
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,350
What's there to worry about?

484
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,410
Since it's false, it can't become the truth.

485
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,620
I have my way to take care of it.

486
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,200
You really are formidable.

487
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,620
Let's go!

488
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,750
Let's go!

489
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,510
 Weiwei, come to the Heavenly Palace. 

490
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,300
The Heavenly Palace? Why such a high-level place?

491
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,110
Was he hit by the "Swing Set Chain" immobilization technique?

492
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,110
Yes. I've tied him down.

493
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,630
Equip your weakest weapon, and teach him a lesson.

494
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,990
Yixiao Naihe, didn't I only make the statement that you picked up other people's broken shoes?

495
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,850
If you have the guts, just kill me in one swift swoop.

496
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,870
What's this to call on a woman to humiliate me?

497
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,760
So, it's you! I remember now.

498
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,850
Yes, it's me.

499
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,410
If you have the guts, just kill me in one swift swoop.

500
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,680
Don't worry.

501
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,140
Fortunately, I didn't throw away my beginner's equipment set.

502
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,590
Darn! Your beginner's equipment?

503
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,090
Come on! I have tens of thousands of health points.

504
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,140
If you stab me one cut at a time, you'll be doing this until next year.

505
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,710
Don't worry.  Just several tens of thousand times.

506
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,210
Also, I've enabled auto mode so my hand won't get tired.

507
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,720
Fine.  I admit that I have a foul mouth.

508
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,590
I also accept that you are going to kill me,

509
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,110
but can't you do it briskly? Don't drag it out.

510
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,070
Don't worry. You won't die.

511
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,450
When you're about to run out of health points, I'll help heal your wounds.

512
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,170
Darn it! You really know how to play this.

513
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,250
This Modao Shixue is clearly not afraid to die.

514
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,400
Why doesn't he just go offline directly but let us go on stabbing him here?

515
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,670
He's doing a chain quest.

516
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,120
A chain quest?

517
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,440
Is it the one where if you log off or die, you have to start anew?

518
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,040
You are really too savage.

519
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,610
Thank you. Let me take a phone call.

520
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,440
Then I'll go to work on my exam paper.

521
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,610
Weiwei, why aren't you sleeping yet?

522
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,170
I'm working on an exam paper. I'll be done soon.

523
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,470
Did I disturb you?

524
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,690
Aren't those people from Xiaoyu's family? Why are they here?

525
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,610
Yixiao Naihe?

526
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,950
That girl is there as well.

527
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,700
Modao Shixue?

528
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,990
Do you know him?

529
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,640
These past few days, he's helped me complete a quest.

530
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,340
Should we do something?

531
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,810
We can't win.

532
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,910
Then we'll reason with them. Moreover, how can they torture him like this?

533
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,150
Killing him one hit point at a time.

534
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,600
Hey! Yixiao Naihe, you are a master.

535
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,800
You are such a high-level master.  How can you bully a low-level player like this?  How does this make a hero?

536
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,400
Exactly. And also, you even double up on him alone.

537
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,030
Why are you ignoring us?

538
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,410
We're settling a personal dispute.

539
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,230
You passerby should continue to pass by.

540
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,190
What kind of personal dispute would require this kind of torture?  This is just a game.

541
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,480
Those who don't want to die

542
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,470
should disappear immediately!

543
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:44,990


544
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,010
